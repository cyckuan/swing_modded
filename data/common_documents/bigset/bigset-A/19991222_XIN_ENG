<HEADLINE> UNICEF Aids Venezuela Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carel De Rooy, UNICEF Area Representative for Colombia and
Venezuela, arrived in the affected areas Monday to map immediate
and mid-term priorities of UNICEF relief to the victims, including
an estimated 1,000 children who have been separated from their
parents, UNICEF said in a news release issued here in its New York-
based headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Three states -- Vargas, Mirand and Zulia -- and the federal
capital of Caracas are the most affected by the floods. The flood
and its lethal aftermath is Venezuela's worst natural disaster in
the outgoing century.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is focusing its relief response in essential medical
supplies, first aid and the prevention of outbreak of disease,
basic sanitation and hygiene education through the mass media,
getting children back to school quickly and provision of school
supplies, psycho-social rehabilitation for thousands of children
traumatized by the event, and assistance in relocating 2,000
indigenous Amerindian families in the stricken Zulia state. UNICEF
staff had been working with this population to improve nutrition
levels prior to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 children are estimated to be out of school.
Thousands of children will likely be in need of psychosocial
support to recover from the trauma of witnessing so much
devastation and loss of life.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. Disaster Management Team has been activated and a local
U.N. Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team has been mobilized
to assist the Venezuela U.N. Resident Coordinator, the UNICEF new
release said.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Condemns Georgia's Anti-Russian Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia Tuesday strongly accused
Georgia of helping the separatists in Russia's breakaway republic
of Chechnya, condemning recent "anti-Russian statements" by the
Georgian leadership.
</P>
<P>
"The unfriendly attacks are being made at a time when the
Russian government is taking resolute steps to restore
constitutional order in the North Caucasus, waging an
uncompromising fight against international terrorists that
threaten the national security of both Russia and Georgia," the
Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to comprehend the logic of the official
Tbilisi, which is declaring a desire to strengthen and develop
relations of strategic partnership with Russia and simultaneously
conducting a direct dialogue with Chechen separatist leaders under
the slogan of neutrality," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
"By turning down proposals that the Chechen section of the
Georgian-Russian border be guarded jointly, Tbilisi in effect has
opened a window through which Chechen fighters are being supplied
with weapons, ammunition and finances," it noted.
</P>
<P>
" OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe)
representatives who visited the Georgian border village of Shatili
several days ago were able to see how free Chechen fighters felt
on Georgian territory. How much are all the Georgian assurances
about a 'securely-closed border' worth after all this? Georgian
authorities give Chechen terrorist emissaries a soapbox to make
anti-Russian statements. Hospitals in Georgia are providing
treatment to dozens of cutthroat fighters, who were wounded in
hostilities against Russian forces and do not conceal their
intentions to take up arms again after they recover," says the
ministry's statement.
</P>
<P>
"Before the eyes of Georgian authorities, Chechen separatists
regularly hold negotiations with their foreign patrons and
supporters, including terrorist Osama Bin Laden, who is being
sought by all civilized countries. Preparations are underway to
set up a 'Chechen government in exile' in Georgia," the statement
goes on.
</P>
<P>
"Tbilisi is trying to cloak its anti-Russian actions with
propaganda rhetoric and numerous appeals to international
organizations," the ministry claimed.
</P>
<P>
Russia hopes the Georgia will stop the "dangerous risk of
encouraging terrorists." "This would be in the true interests of
the people of Georgia and help to strengthen the peace and
stability in the Caucasus," it stressed.

<HEADLINE> Gadhafi Says U.S. Hated around the World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Libya's leader Moammar
Gadhafi said on Tuesday that the United States is threatened with
terrorism because it is hated around the world.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government is hated ...all the people in the world
are against it, therefore there is a threat," Gadhafi said in an
interview with CBS program "the Early Show".
</P>
<P>
"No one likes America, no one loves America ...because of its
policy in the world," he went on. But he said that terrorist
attack against the United States would not happen "in this new
year."
</P>
<P>
"But I hope it will not happen," Gadhafi said. He added that he
has no knowledge about a particular threat.
</P>
<P>
Gadhafi said he has the same common feelings as others against
terrorism and he said he was very sorry about the explosion of Pam
Am flight 103, 11 years ago today over Lockerbie, Scotland, which
killed 270 people. Two Libyan suspects are going on trial in the
Netherlands for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States should apologize and offer
restitution if the Libyans charged in the case are acquitted,
Gadhafi responded: "This must be, it must be."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says 500 Mln Dlr Delaying Loan to Russia Not Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
said Tuesday that the U.S. Export-Import bank is still reviewing a
decision on whether to postpone a loan guarantee of 500 million U.
S. dollars to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports say U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
sent a letter telling the Export-Import Bank "not (to) approve for
the time being" the loan guarantee for Tyumen Oil Corporation
because it would not be in the U.S. national interest.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley denied the reports. "
Some of those press reports are erroneous, to the effect that the
secretary has invoked the Chafee amendment that we discussed here
yesterday," Foley told reporters at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The department and the Ex-Im Bank have been in contact, and
there have been consultations and meetings in the last few days,
concerning the Ex-Im's potential decision on those two loan
guarantees to Russia's Tyumen Oil Company, known as TNK, Foley
added.
</P>
<P>
"It's true that that remains under review, that we are studying
the possible applicability of the Chafee amendment to these loans,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"What I can confirm to you, however, is that the secretary did
meet this morning with Ex-Im (Bank) Board Chairman James Harmon,
and they exchanged views on the pending 500 million dollar loan
guarantee," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
The Export-Import Bank Board is meeting to consider this matter
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Export-Import Bank makes decisions independently based on
commercial and business considerations. But according to the
Chafee amendment, the Clinton administration can cite national
interests to intervene and block the decision.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has been urged to block the loan
guarantees because of Moscow's military operation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, Foley said, "I don't know of any connection between
what's going on in Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters at a regular
briefing that the raising of the concerns about the bank
guarantees is not related to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"What we have said publicly is exactly what we said privately,
that we have concerns about the transparency in the management of
bankruptcy proceedings," Lockhart said.

<P>
CAIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin arrived in Cairo Tuesday evening for a private visit, but he
will hold talks with Egyptian officials on bilateral ties, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Jospin is expected to hold talks with President Hosni Mubarak
and Prime Minister Atef Obeid on ways of promoting economic, trade
and investment cooperation between Egypt and France, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
This was Jospin's second trip to Egypt this year after an
official visit last May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an economic study, prepared by the Egyptian Trade
Representation Department on the occasion of Jospin's visit, has
anticipated an increase of French investments in Egypt, especially
in the untrodden areas.
</P>
<P>
Despite noted progress in the French investment activities in
Egypt, investment opportunities in some economic fields remain
untapped, the new urban and industrial araes in particular, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
France's direct investments in Egypt rose to 150.7 million U.S.
dollars by the end of 1998, up by 47.75 percent from the year
previous, making it the fourth largest European investor in Egypt
after Britain, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

ROME, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Carlo Azeglio

Citing the six months of foreign journeys and meetings with

now the euphoria over the end of the Cold War was over, the
international community still reacts "inadequately" to the heavy
inheritance from the past.
</P>
<P>
"We now have the tools" to solve the major problems if they
were" used to their full potential," he said, but this means that
international institutions must work better and a "new

<HEADLINE> Egypt's National Carrier Prepared for Y2K: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's national carrier,
EgyptAir, has taken all necessary precautions against any possible
Y2K problems of its computer systems at the advent of the year
2000, an EgyptAir official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Samir Embabi, official in charge of EgyptAir's technical
department, told the country's Middle East News Agency that the
airline has secured its computer systems against Y2K bug by either
replacing the old equipment or changing software programs within
the framework a national project for the public sector.
</P>
<P>
Most older computers, computerized equipment and software
programs were programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a
year. These computers may misread the year 2000 as 1900, causing
technical malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has announced that its government ministries and agencies
and the public sector have been made Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company has changed the departure and arrival
time of five flights around the midnight of December 31 in case
there are any problems of the computers, Embabi said.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule, the last EgyptAir flight would touch
down at Cairo International Airport before 22:00 local time (2000
GMT) on the last day of 1999, the official added.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir has rescheduled the flights from Berlin, Paris,
Frankfurt, London and Istanbul, which were initially scheduled to
arrive at the airport between 23:30 local time (2130 GMT) on
December 31 and 1:00 local time January 1, or 2300 GMT on December
31, he said, without elaborating.

<HEADLINE> Year 1999 Most Difficult for Zimbabwe: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Tuesday described the year 1999 as the most difficult year
in the last decade with the major economic sectors registering
lower growth rates.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the 12th State of the Nation Address to the
Parliament, Mugabe said inflation had moved up and the balance of
payments position was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
The adverse conditions in the world economy has also
constrained the potential growth of the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, depressed international prices for most of our
export commodities during the greater part of the year had an
adverse impact on balance of payment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's export performance failed to improve
despite the depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar against major
currencies.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the country's average rate of
inflation during the first 10 months of this year was 58 percent,
a figure double that for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean dollar had been under immense pressure despite
that the financial sector had pooled at least 200 million U.S.
dollars into the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said that despite the hardships,
agriculture still retained its position as the major contributor
to economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
"Maize production increased and there was also a general
increase in the production of small grains and groundnuts.
Production of wheat and cotton also went up while marginal
decreases were recorded in tobacco and soya beans," he said.
</P>
<P>
The value of mineral production had risen to 488 million U.S.
dollars from 111 million U.S. dollars in 1998, he said, adding
that the gold, coal and nickel production had also increased.
</P>
<P>
According to Mugabe, the most disturbing element in the mining
sector was the closure of Hartley Platinum Mine in Mashonaland
West, which put a dent on the national economic performance.

<HEADLINE> Libya Continues Efforts for Sudan Reconciliation: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CAIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Libya will continue exerting
efforts aimed at helping realize national reconciliation in Sudan,
the Libyan permanent representative to the Arab League said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-
Meguid, Gomaa Fazani told reporters that the peace initiative
proposed jointly by Libya and Egypt regarding Sudan is still in
place.
</P>
<P>
Libya will continue bolstering the initiative in a bid to help
Sudan achieve peace and protect its unity and territorial
integrity, Fazani was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Libya and Egypt put forward the initiative early this year,
calling for permanent cease-fire between the Sudanese government
and the southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), and a
peace conference for national reconciliation to be attended by all
parties to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the northern Muslim opposition
parties have accepted the proposal. But SPLA, which has been
fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for the mostly Christian
and animist south, has rejected it.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan diplomat accused the United States of attempting to
stymie the Libyan-Egyptian peace plan and vowed to continue to face
up to such challenges.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which supports SPLA, has opposed Libya for its role
in helping seek solutions to the Sudanese issue. Washington prefers
the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, or IGAD, a
regional organization of Eastern African countries, to play a
decisive role in mediating between the Sudanese government and
SPLA.
</P>
<P>
Libya keeps coordinating and consulting with the Arab League on
the political situation in Sudan, Fazani said. He expressed
appreciation for the keenness of the pan-Arab organization on
preserving Sudan's territorial unity and integrity.

Announcing this decision made Tuesday by the Israeli police
authorities, Police Commisioner Yehuda Wilk said there is no
concrete evidence that any terror group is planning attacks on the
multi-faced holiday, but the security has to be ensured for all
because thousands of Muslims will pray at the Aqsa Mosque in East
Jerusalem while thousands of Christians and Jews will celebrate the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 police and security personnel will be deployed in the
Old City of Jerusalem on that day, Walik said.
</P>
<P>
"At this moment we do not have any evidence about any particular
group or individual that will have an intention to carry something
else," he said, "but at the same time we have to remember that we
are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who will be
entering and leaving Israel in the year 2000, and we have to be
aware."
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, about 40,000 Muslims coming from East Jerusalem and
Palestinian territories prayed at the Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that thousands of foreign visitors will arrive at
Israel next week for the new millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Michel Sabbah,
urged on Tuesday the Jews, Christians and Muslims to settle
disputes in the new millennium and work together for peace.
</P>
<P>
In his last Christian message of the second Christian
millennium, Sabbah told Israel that its continued annexation of
Arab East Jerusalem would not bring peace to the holy city.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that Israel and Palestinians share sovereignty over
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pleges Continued Support for Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. on Tuesday reiterated
its support to the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on unifying the
divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Cyprus News Agency, U.S. Embassy spokesman
Walter Douglas said the U.S. will monitor the second round of the
talks by sending a team led by Presidential Emissary Alfred Moses.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. continues to strongly support the U.N.-sponsored
Cyprus proximity talks process under the Secretary-General's
auspices," Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the
wake of a short-lived coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to bring the two sides into
a bi-zonal bi-communal federation.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to solve the Cyprus issue, Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash held the first
round proximity talks at the U.N. headquarters in New York on
December 3 to 14.
</P>
<P>
The second round is slated for January 27, 2000 in Geneva.

HARARE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe on Tuesday pledged to withdraw his troops from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) once the timetable for the
pullout of foreign troops is set.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the 12th State of the Nation Address to Parliament,
Mugabe said that "I want to assure the nation that our forces who
are deployed in the DRC will start returning home as soon as a
timetable for withdrawal of all foreign forces from the DRC has
been agreed upon by the Joint Military Commission as provided for
in the ceasefire agreement."
</P>

He said the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
allied forces remained committed to the Lusaka Peace Agreement and
hoped that the rebel groups would also respect the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Irish MPs Get Right to Stand in Westminster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government will
introduce a law next year to allow members of the Irish parliament
stand for election to the House of Commons and the Northern
Ireland Assembly, officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The law would allow members of Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican
Army's political wing, to sit in the Irish Dail(parliament) as
well as the House of Commons and Belfast's Northern Ireland
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The extension of the right on both side of the Irish border is
the latest "confidence-building" measure under the 1998 Good
Friday Agreement to secure a political settlement in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The move is a concession to Sinn Fein, which is seeking to have
members in Westminster and Dublin as well as the new Northern
Ireland Assembly in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and senior politician Martin
McGuinness, appointed as a minister in the new Northern Ireland
executive, are both elected members of the House of Commons but
have never taken their seats because they refuse to swear
allegiance to Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
Adams welcomed the government's decision to change the law to
allow politicians to become members of both the British and Irish
parliaments. But he insisted the move is not linked to the arms
decommissioning issue.
</P>
<P>
A bill to change the law is to be published later on Tuesday
and introduced in the New Year.

<HEADLINE> More Iraqi Oil Export Not to Affect Prices: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- World oil prices will not be
affected by the United Nations' recent decision to lift the ceiling
on Iraqi oil sales, sad a senior of the United Arab Emirates
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Obeid Bin Saif Al
Nasir said here that the U.N. move "could result in price
fluctuation but prices will maintain their gains."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution last Friday which
removed the 5.26 billion-U.S.-dollar limit on the amount of oil
Iraq can sell over six months through the U.N. oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
Nasir also said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) need not intervene in the oil market unless the
prices reach 30 U.S.dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
"The increase of prices to 30 dollars a barrel will be a strong
reason for producing countries to intervene," he said, adding,
however, that he did not expect the prices to reach that rate at
present.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices currently rotate around 25 dollars per barrel
following the OPEC's abidance by production quotas decided in
March.
</P>
<P>
Nasir ruled out any intention by OPEC to increase the output at
present, saying that any change in policy will be discussed in the
organization's next meeting in March 2000.

<HEADLINE> Third Round Cyprus Talks Most Decisive: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Government Spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou said Tuesday that the third round of the U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus will be the most decisive one
in solving the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"The most decisive stage will be during the third round which
will be held after the so-called elections in the Turkish-occupied
part of the island," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash held the first round of the proximity talks at the U.
N. headquarters in New York on December 3 to 14.
</P>
<P>
Annan would not extend new invitations to the two sides, as
their leaders have already agreed to attend the second round of
talks on January 27 next year in Geneva, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be conducted by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's Special Advisor for Cyprus Alvaro de Soto.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had conducted two rounds of talks two years ago
but failed when the Turkish Cypriot side refused to negotiate
unless its breakaway state in northern Cyprus was recognized.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a republic in
northern Cyprus in 1983, which is recognized only by Turkey.

ABU DHABI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak ended a brief visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and
left here for home on Tuesday evening, the official WAM news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
During his half-day stay, Mubarak held separate talks with UAE

Israel as well as the situation in the Gulf, it said.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Sudan was also discussed, with both sides
expressing support for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who has
declared a state of emergency and dissolved the parliament as a
result of his power struggle with parliament speaker Hassan al
Turabi.

<HEADLINE> Balance of Power Enables Israel to Take Risks in Talks: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The overall balance of power
in Israel's favor in the Middle East has provided a "window of
opportunity" for resolving Israel's conflict with its Arab
neighbors, a group of strategic experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with its Arab neighbors, Israel enjoys a military
superiority in almost all fields - in the air, at sea and on the
ground, researchers with the prestigious Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies (JCSS) at Tel Aviv University said in their
annual study.
</P>
<P>
This gap has widened in the last decade since Israel has been
well adopted to the ongoing worldwide "military revolution" while
the Arab world lags behind, the researchers said, referring to the
increasing use of hi-tech means in armies and wars since the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The study, a book titled "The Middle East Military Balance 1999-
2000," detailed all the numerical and qualitative superiority
Israel has over its main Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Syria, Israel has 340 high-quality combat
aircraft while Syria has only 22. While Israel's ground forces are
equipped with the most advanced arms, Syria has not been modernized
its land forces for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"These weakness (in the Syrian side) has resulted in a decline
of Syria's capability to initiate an overland attack on Israel and
has in all probability contributed to the Syrian decision to resume
political negotiations," the authors of the book said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa held two days of talks in Washington last week,
reopening the Israeli-Syrian talks after nearly four years of
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
The main issue of contention is the fate of the Golan Heights, a
Syrian plateau seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Syria
has demanded that Israel withdraw fully from the Golan in exchange
for security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"The balance of power between Israel and Syria enables Israel to
take calculated risks in the conduct of the peace negotiations with
Syria," Professor Shai Feldman, head of the JCSS, said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the so-called "calculated risk" meant the notion
that Israel will no longer be able to have a presence in the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Barak has repeatedly said that he is ready to make "painful
territorial concessions" on the Golan, but stressed that Syria has
to provide satisfactory security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Feldman said as a security arrangement, Israel should seek every
means to diminish the risk of a surprise attack by Syria, including
the deployment of an early-warning station on the Mount Hermon in
the Golan and the defining of demilitarized zone on the heights.
</P>
<P>
Professor Shlomo Brom, one of the co-authors and a former army
strategic planning chief, said Israel would need 10 billion U.S.
dollars to make security arrangement if it agreed to withdraw from
the Golan as part of a peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
He said Barak told Washington about this price tag in 1995 when
he was negotiating with Syria as chief of the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and Syria are reportedly seeking U.S. assistance for
the implementation of a peace agreement even if the talks have yet
to enter substantial stages. Washington has pledged help in order
to move forward the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Only Difference With Turkey is Continental Shelf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The only difference between
Greece and Turkey was the delimitation of the continental shelf in
the Aegean Sea, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There were no other problems between the two neighboring
countries, if Turkey believed there were other problems, it could
seek recourse to the International Court of Justice at the Hague,
Reppas said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said that recourse to the Hague over the continental shelf
delimitation required the drafting of an agreement to refer the
dispute to arbitrators and mutual consent.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit reportedly has mentioned
that there are more than one problem in the eastern Aegean and he
expressed optimism that the disputes between the two long-time
rivals can be settled before the year 2004 without the help of the
court at the Hague.
</P>
<P>
During the past 25 years, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members,
have nearly gone to war three times over their disputes in the
territorial waters, air space limits and the delimitation of the
continental shelf in the Aegean and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have since late this year tried hard to
improve their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Greece's recent conditional consent to Turkey's candidacy for
European Union (EU) membership seems to have created new dynamics
for the further improvement of their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In January, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou is
expected to visit Turkey to sign bilateral agreement on a range of
issues.

<HEADLINE> Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Urges Unity and Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Michel Sabbah, the Latin
Patriarch of Jerusalem, on Tuesday urged Jews, Christians and
Muslims to settle their disputes in the new millennium and work
together for peace.
</P>
<P>
In his last Christian message of the second Christian
millennium, Patriarch Sabbah said that Israel's continued
annexation of Arab East Jerusalem would not bring peace to the holy
city.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that Israel and the Palestinians share sovereignty
over Jerusalem. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war and later annexed it.
</P>
<P>
The Patriarch also appealed to Muslims and Christians in
Israel's northern city of Nazareth, where Jesus is believed to had
spent his boyhood, to work together to resolve a dispute over the
construction of a mosque in the city.
</P>
<P>
"As we celebrate the great Jubilee, we see with pain that the
centers of the Jubilee in our land, Jerusalem, Bethlehem and
Nazareth, are deprived of peace," Sabbah said, reading his message
from an old Latin patriarchate in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem remains the center of the conflict, Bethlehem still
suffers from instability and diverse limitations of freedom, and
Nazareth became in these days the heart of a problem which tore the
secular fraternity between its inhabitants, Christians and Muslims
alike," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Jesus's birthplace Bethlehem would find stability when
the Palestinians set up an independent state on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and enjoy sovereignty and full freedom.
</P>
<P>
Sabbah's message this year was less critical of Israel and its
policies towards the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that a just peace in the whole region would
essentially come through making peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Peace will be the fruit of justice. In our context, it should
restore to the refugees their dignity and their rights, to the
political prisoners their liberty, and to Jerusalem it should
guarantee its sacred character," Sabbah added.

PARIS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The workers of Disneyland Paris
will stage a strike on Thursday for a dispute over extra-pay for
the Disneyland employees working on December 31, several unions of

</P>
<P>
The season from the present Christmas to the New Year's Day is

Europe.
</P>
<P>
The unions asked for an extra 2,000 francs (350 U.S. dollars)
bonus for each of those who work on December 31 or the New Year's
Day, while the manager only agrees to a 700 francs (145 U.S.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Expects Moderate Economic Growth Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 21 (Xinhua) - Thai Deputy Prime Minister and
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said here Tuesday that the
country's economic growth next year could be moderate compared to
the 7.7 percent growth in the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark concerning the report on Thailand's economic
performance in the third quarter of this year released by the
National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Thailand's gross domestic product (GDP)
grew by 7.7 percent in the third quarter from a year ago due to
strong performance in the manufacturing sector, especially the
auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Automobile sales in Thailand are expected to reach 200,000
units, a 40 percent increase from last year. Vehicle exports are
expected to reach 120,000 units by the end of the year, Up 100
percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The NESDB also forecast a three to four percent growth for the
whole year of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the real turning point for a sustainable economic
recovery is the level of production utilization.
</P>
<P>
At present, Thailand's utilization level is at about 58-60
percent, well below the 70-80 percent level, which is considered
high enough for fresh investment.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the country could come under inflationary
pressure as a result of a pickup in the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the financial sector will be crucial for the
economic recovery next year, Supachai said, adding that the
financial mechanism must return to normal to help sustain the
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's financial sector was crippled by huge non-performing
loans, which account for more than 40 percent of the total
outstanding loans of the entire banking system.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economy grew by 0.9 percent and 3.5 percent in the
first and second quarters of this year respectively after a 10
percent contraction last year.

<P>
KAMPALA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The three major rebel factions
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have agreed to forge
a common front but not to merge militarily and politically, a
rebel official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The common front will comprise of a joint commission, a mixed
military commission and the leaders' forum, an official with
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) based in Kisangani told Xinhua
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Each rebel group is entitled to send three delegates to the
joint commission and two delegates to the mixed military
commission respectively. The leaders' forum is to supervise the
running of the common front and to provide a chance for the rebel
leaders to exchange views," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the three groups would not be unified militarily and
 politically. They maintain their individual identities and
autonomy," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the three rebel groups issued a joint communique
at the end of a three-day meeting in the west Ugandan town of
Kabale Tuesday calling for closer cooperation among themselves.
Delegates from their allies Uganda and Rwanda also attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's Presidential Adviser on Congo issues Kahinda Otafiire,
who led the Ugandan delegation at the meeting, hailed the rebel's
agreement to harmonize positions as a good development for the
Congolese people.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have enjoyed support from Uganda and Rwanda since
they took up arms against the DRC government in August of 1998.

<HEADLINE> JLG Celebrates Completion of Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) held a reception here Tuesday to celebrate the
completion of its mission, which aimed to implement the terms of
the Sino-British Joint Declaration to maintain long-term stability
and prosperity in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The JLG has made, through friendly cooperation, hundreds of
arrangements for the smooth transition and handover of power in
Hong Kong ever since it was established on May 24, 1985, when the
Sino-British Joint Declaration went into force," said Wu Hongbo,
Chinese senior representative.
</P>
<P>
"We have now reached the final destination together, with a
sense of mission accomplished," said Alan Paul, British senior
representative, who jointly hosted the reception with Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the great concept of "one country, two systems"
has already become reality both in Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (
SAR), headed by its chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, has been
leading the Hong Kong people forward in the unprecedented practice
of "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and remarkable
successes have already been made toward this end.
</P>
<P>
The central government will, as always, support vigorously the
efforts of the Hong Kong SAR government in its administration
according to law. The mainland will remain firmly supportive for
the long-term stability and prosperity of the Hong Kong SAR, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
Both Wu and Paul spoke highly of Chinese President Jiang Zemin'
s visit to the United Kingdom in October this year.
</P>
<P>
"The visit promoted our bilateral relations to a new stage of
development and the new century will witness further growth of the
bilateral relations between China and the United Kingdom," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Paul said, "the visit of President Jiang Zemin to Britain was a
great success. We are determined to build on that achievement to
our mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed confidence in Hong Kong's future under the
guidance of the "one country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
Paul attributed significance to the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, saying that the declaration, a most reliable compass
to guide the JLG, gave the JLG members a clear sense of direction
and common goals for continued prosperity and stability in Hong
Kong and its smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
"Today, 'one country, two systems' is working well in Hong Kong.
And the joint declaration continues to be the guarantee and guide
for Hong Kong's future," said Paul.
</P>
<P>
Paul pointed out that the work of the JLG proved that the
sensitive issues between countries can be solved by consultation
and cooperation, which constitutes an encouraging message to the
whole world community.
</P>
<P>
Anson Chan, administrative secretary of the Hong Kong SAR, who
was present at the reception, thanked the JLG "for their
dedication and years of hard work in turning the unique concept of
'one country, two systems' into reality."
</P>
<P>
"It is now up to the SAR government and the people, with the
support of the central government, to ensure its continued success,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
The JLG concluded the 47th meeting, its last meeting, in Hong
Kong, on December 8. It will be dismissed on January 1, 2000 in
accordance with the Joint Declaration between China and the United
Kingdom.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa Tuesday gave
credits to the historic achievement scored by the Sino-British
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) over the past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
"The work of the JLG represented a most remarkable achievement,
" said Tung at a dinner held at the Government House for the
British and Chinese sides of the JLG.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that "the unprecedented and unique concept of 'one
Country, two Systems' has been turned into a reality. Under the
Basic Law, Hong Kong enjoys the full range of autonomies, the way
of life and the preservation of the systems as envisaged in the
Joint Declaration."
</P>
<P>
"The course we have charted for Hong Kong will be remembered in
history as a brave adventure and one which has made a most
important contribution to the reunification of China," said Tung.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong today is a vibrant and lively city and we see the
successful implementation of the concept of 'one Country, two
Systems' not only in Hong Kong, but also in Macao which celebrated
its return with the motherland only yesterday," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past 30 months since Hong Kong's return, we have faced
some important challenges such as the Asian financial turmoil.
However, we were able to tackle each hurdle put in front of us
with the full knowledge that the continued prosperity and
stability of Hong Kong is built on a strong foundation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The JLG held a reception here Tuesday to celebrate the
completion of its mission, which aimed to implement the terms of
the Sino-British Joint Declaration to maintain long-term stability
and prosperity in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The JLG, which was established in May 1985, concluded the 47th

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Claims to Have Seized "Indian-paid" Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan police Tuesday
claimed to have arrested an "Indian-paid terrorist" involved in a
series of bomb blasts in the Pakistan-administered part of the
disputed area of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector General from Azad Kashmir (free Kashmir) said
the unspecified terrorist was caught while attempting to cross
into the Indian-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The suspect confessed he had carried out last week's bomb blast
in Islamgarh town which claimed 10 lives and injured 20 others,
said the police.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorist admitted that Indian intelligence agency had
paid him 15,000 rupees (about 288 U.S. dollars) for the terrorist
activities in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir. He attempted four
terrorist acts but succeeded in two," the state-run Pakistan
Television quoted the police chief as saying.
</P>
<P>
In another bomb blasts which occurred in a passenger bus on
December 12, five people sustained injuries.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad last week blamed New Delhi "for the recent spate of
terrorist activities in Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir which
has further vitiated the atmosphere in tension-ridden South Asia."

<HEADLINE> NPC to Intensify Supervision of National Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature will
pass a new law on the examination and supervision of the national
budget in order to ensure the rational use of state funds.
</P>
<P>
The draft of a decision for enhancing these procedures is now
being discussed at the on-going 13th session of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Lai Jinlie said the draft, one article of which orders
the adjustment of the budgets for agriculture, education, science
and technology, and social security, should be approved by the NPC
Standing Committee as progress towards final legislation of a
national law on the examination and supervision of the budget.
</P>
<P>
The draft decision will stipulate that the State Council, which
is in charge of the annual national budget, must report to NPC
Standing Committee on how to use surplus revenue, said another
lawmaker, Wu Changqi.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the surplus revenue should be added to the
budget for the following year to prevent abuse and waste of the
country's money.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economist on Asian Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Asian economies have shown
signs of recovery, but further macro-economic adjustments are
needed for sustainable growth, Paul Krugman, a top international
economist, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Krugman, professor of Massachusetts Institute of Technology of
the United States, said at a lecture held by the Bangkok Bank that
the situation in Asian economies has vastly improved from a year
ago, but the governments concerned should make some new macro-
economic strategies to pull the economies further out of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the governments should not rely too much on
fiscal stimulus policy, which could not be a long-run policy.
</P>
<P>
He said a new way on monetary policy should be found to take
the burden of fiscal deficit, which may lead to new problems.
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the bad debt is another problem needed to be
addressed to achieve a long-term growth, Krugman said.
</P>
<P>
However, debt restructuring is not just a matter of taking
debts from banks, but a matter calling for mass restructuring of
the financial sector, he said, adding that bad banking is not the
only reason of the Asian financial crisis, but is certainly the
central concern now.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Deliberate Draft Amendment to Corporate Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers attending
the ongoing 13th session of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, China's top legislature, today examined and
deliberated the Draft Amendment to the Corporate Law.
</P>
<P>
Although approaching the draft from different angles, the
lawmakers reached the consensus that the examination and approval
of the draft amendment is of great importance to China's state-
owned enterprise (SOE) reform, the implementation of the strategy
of revitalizing China through science and education, and the
promotion of turning research achievements into productive forces.
</P>
<P>
Promulgated and implemented in December 1983, the Corporate Law
of the People's Republic of China has provided the legal basis for
the country's economic reform, especially the reform of SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The draft amended articles concerning the board of supervisors
in SOEs and the conditions for listing high-tech ventures.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haibin, a member of the NPC Standing Committee, said the
present Corporate Law has no strict regulations to restrain SOEs'
leaders from abusing their power, which usually leads to the
squandering of public funds.

adding that "the system of boards of supervisors should be
combined with the establishment of enterprises' internal
supervisory organs."
</P>
<P>
Legislator Zhu Yuli said he believes the bond market is as
important as the stock market, and suggested that the legislature
take it into consideration when making further amendments.
</P>
<P>
Another lawmaker, Feng Zhijun, said that approval of the draft
amendment is beneficial to China's high-tech ventures, and that
legislators should make a full examination of the Corporate Law to
achieve more in one stroke.

<HEADLINE> Former UNITA Leader Condemns Angolan Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Renovated
Commission of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) blamed here on Tuesday the Angolan civil war for
the underdevelopment of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Eugenio Manuvakola said the over-25-year conflicts have made
the national economy, culture, morality, social and political life
go backward.
</P>
<P>
The former rebel leader also pointed out that for the sake of
peace and national reconciliation, UNITA should fulfil its
engagement in the 1994 Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The Renovated Commission of UNITA was founded in September 1998
by some repentant rebels who renegaded from the UNITA led by Jonas
Savimbi and called for the peaceful solution to the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Manuvakola also encouraged the Angolan government troops to
continue the campaign against the UNITA rebels to win a durable
peace, which he said is an indispensable factor for the
development.

Member States.
</P>
<P>
Across the themes, conference participants will discuss the key
challenges of the new millennium. In particular, they will seek to

<HEADLINE> Tehran to Launch Project to Combat Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Tehran Mayor Morteza Alviri
announced on Tuesday that a long-term project will be launched next
year to combat serious air pollution in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Alviri told a group of Tehran residents that a 15-year project
has been drawn up and is ready for implementation, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The anti-pollution project was a combination of three plans
which were presented to Tehran since 1993 by the World Bank,
Japanese experts and Iranian environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that it will take long to ease the air pollution
which has been building up over the past half century parallel to
the development of the city.
</P>
<P>
About 1.5 million tons of pollutants are being produced in
Tehran, which will be controlled in the first year of the
implementation of the project, he said.
</P>
<P>
Alviri said that 72 percent of the pollution is caused by
traffic which can be reduced by introducing mechanisms such as
preventing travel of vehicles producing exhaust fumes, banning
traffic within certain zones, and carrying out compulsory technical
check-up for cars.
</P>
<P>
The city was so deeply drowned in heavy smog Tuesday morning
that people could barely see the rising sun. The Weather Bureau
attributed the phenomenon to stagnant pollutants in the air.
</P>
<P>
The intensity of the two main pollutants, carbon monoxide and
suspended particles, on Tuesday morning was much higher than the "
crisis" level, forcing most residents to wear masks.
</P>
<P>
Tehran City Council on Tuesday ratified a double-urgent bill,
calling for protection of citizens against air pollution.

<P>
King Fahd said at the cabinet meeting that the budget has taken
into consideration the need to achieve financial balance and the
rationalization of expenditures while seeking economic growth,
the Saudi Press Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By virtue of the rise in petroleum prices in world oil markets,
the budget deficit is expected to decline by 70.3 percent in the
balance of payments, to reach 14.6 billion rials (3.9 billion
dollars) in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In its budget statement, the Saudi Ministry of Finance expected

percent based on the State Statistics estimates.
</P>
<P>

liras (48.97 million dollars) during the first six months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Syria exported 11,590,433 tons of goods during the period, which
fetched the country 16.8 billion liras (366.8 million dollars), and
imported 3,385,000 tons of goods at a cost of 19.1 billion liras
(415.8 million dollars), according to local reports on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- The Algerian People's National Assembly has approved
the State Finance and Budget Law for the year 2000, local reports
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The budget envisions the country's revenues at 1,032 billion
Algerian dinars (15.8 billion dollars) and expenditures at 1,252
billion dinars (19.2 billion dollars), a deficit of 220 billion
dinars (3.4 billion dollars) on the grounds that one U.S. dollar
buys 65 Algerian dinars.
</P>
<P>
The budget based its figures on a petroleum price of 15 dollars
per barrel, an inflation rate of 4-5 percent, a growth rate of 5
percent and a GDP of 2,500 billion dinars (38.46 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria must pay about 51 million dollars in
instalments before the end of 1999 to settle its loans from Arab
development funds.
</P>
<P>
Syria has to repay 22 million dollars to the Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development, 8.9 million dollars to the Saudi
Development Fund, 7.6 million dollars to the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab
Economic Development, 3.9 million dollars to the Islamic
Development Fund, 400,000 dollars to the Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries, 700,000 dollars to the Development
Fund of Abu Dhabi, as well as 7 million dollars to the Japanese
Bank for International Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
An economic report worked out by European experts showed that
Syria's external public debts will reach 5.1 billion dollars this
year, accounting for 30.5 percent of the country's gross national
product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
It also predicted a deficit rise in the 1999 budget to 740
million dollars, or about 4 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- The Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development has
agreed to provide Syria a loan of 6 million Kuwaiti dinars (about
20 million dollars) to finance the construction of the Rekka-Deir
Al Zor-Haska road in northern Syria, the total cost of which will
be about 16.57 million Kuwaiti dinars (54.68 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deal was signed by Syrian Minister of State for Planning
Affairs Abdel Rahim al-Soubei and Director General of the Fund Badr
Mashari Al Hemdhi Monday.
</P>
<P>

grace at an annual interest rate of 3 percent plus 0.5 percent to
cover administrative expenses and the loan implementation services.
</P>
<P>
By extending the loan, the Kuwaiti Fund will provide Syria with
25 loans to finance various projects.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Abu Dhabi Seaport Authority said on Tuesday
that all its equipment was Y2K compliant and port operations will
be carried out normally during the New Year period without any
problems.
</P>
<P>
All computer equipment have undergone compliance tests and were
found to be Y2K ready, said Mubarak Al Buainain, director of the
authority.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K or the "millennium bug" problem is caused by the
prevalent practice in the computer industry of representing the
year with only two digits instead of four which is expected to
cause chaos in computer systems that will mistake 2000 for 1900.
</P>
<P>
Al Buainain said that contingency plans were put in place in
case of emergency, indicating that a number of operations would be
carried out manually alongside modern technology in order to face
any unforseen eventualities.

The U.N. assistant Secretary-General for peacekeeping
operations, Hedi Annabi, "brought to the Council's today a further
deterioration of the military and security situation" in Congo (K),
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, said.
</P>

"In particular, he flagged the reports from South Kivu area
available to the U.N. Mission (MONUC) strongly suggesting that the
slightest incident could trigger large-scale organized attacks
against the civilian population there, notably those of the region,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was equally feared that, given the level of threat to the
Congolese Tutsi community, that they themselves could trigger an
anti-Tutsi offensive through violent actions against their
neighbors," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Tougher Pollution Rules on Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday announced tougher pollution rules on the popular sport
utility vehicles and minivans to fight against air pollution and
cut smog-causing emissions by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Working closely with industry, we will ensure both the freedom
of American families to drive the vehicles of their choice, and
the right of American children to breathe clean, healthy air,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The new rules, to be phased in over five years beginning with
2004 models, for the first time require the popular sport utility
vehicles (SUVs) and minivans to meet the same, tougher emission
standards as cars.
</P>
<P>
The regulations call for cutting nitrogen oxide tailpipe
emissions from today's 0.4 grams per mile for cars, and somewhat
higher for SUVs, to 0.07 grams per mile for cars and most SUVs by
2007.
</P>
<P>
The changes could add 200 dollars to the price of SUVs and
light trucks, which together now account for nearly half of the
vehicles sold, and under 100 dollars to the price of cars, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated.
</P>
<P>
Also for the first time the federal government has linked
cleaner gasoline with emission controls of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the EPA will direct refiners to reduce the amount
of sulfur in gasoline by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the announcement at Maury Elementary School in
Washington to underscore the benefits of clean air to children.
</P>
<P>
The American Lung Association estimates that smog and
microscopic soot annually accounts for 400,000 asthma attacks and
1 million various respiratory problems, many in children, as well
as 15,000 premature deaths among the elderly.

in search of refuge," said Ricardo Castillo, Alternate Legal
Assistance (ALA) coordinator.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian fugitives come from the Jurado community, where
violent armed confrontations occurred recently between members of
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Colombian
army troops, leaving more than 100 dead and injured, said Castillo.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian peasants left their lands in Jurado because they
fear the guerrilla, soldiers, and paramilitary crossfire, who
dispute the support of the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Office for the Attention to Refugees of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (ACNUR) went today
to the Cocalito and Guayabito zones, located in the border
province of Darien, to give assistance to the displaced campesinos.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government reinforced the police units in the
border zone to guarantee the peace and security of the Panamanian
communities bordering with Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan President Appoints New Army Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman ratified Tuesday the appointment of the National Army chief
for General Javier Carrion.
</P>
<P>
Carrion will replace General Joaquin Cuadra, who goes into
retirement.
</P>
<P>
Carrion will assume the post in February 2000, as commander of
the institution now under General Cuadra.
</P>
<P>
The change of the Nicaraguan Army command occurs in the middle
of a tense climate with Honduras, because the Honduran Congress
ratified a treaty of maritime limits signed with Colombia in 1986
that, according to Managua, ignores Nicaraguan rights over 130,000
square kilometers of continental platform in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
General Carrion was one of the founders of the Sandinista
Popular Army created in 1979 by the Sandinista government, and
belongs to the first generation of guerrilla-turned professional
military.
</P>
<P>
Carrion was the executive officer who directed the operations
from the battlefront itself during the war the Sandinistas waged
during 10 years against the Nicaraguan Resistance (Contras), in
the decade of the eighties.

<HEADLINE> Putin Expects Efficient Cooperation Between Cabinet and New Duma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 21 (Xinhua) -- After the Russian Central
Electoral Commission announced the preliminary results of the
parliamentary polls Tuesday morning, Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin expressed hope that his cabinet and the new State
Duma "will work jointly and efficiently."
</P>
<P>
He expressed this idea at a meeting here with the leaders of
the six blocs and movements, which were elected to the State Duma,
lower house of the parliament during Sunday's elections: Gennady
Zyuganov (Communist Party), Sergey Shoigu (Unity movement),Yevgeny
Primakov (Fatherland-All Russia), Sergey Kiriyenko (the Union of
Right-Wing Forces), Grigory Yavlinsky (Yabloko bloc) and Vladimir
Zhirinovsky (Zhirinovsky's Bloc).
</P>
<P>
"The government and the former State Duma did much jointly over
the past few months, and there are ample grounds to believe that
this work will be continued with the new Duma," Putin told the
deputies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that powers of former deputies are to expire when the
new Duma starts its work. In this connection, he said, with a
smile, "Well, there is still a chance to ratify the START-II(
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty-II)."
</P>
<P>
Putin congratulated the parties' leaders on their gain in the
election campaign. He thanked voters, saying "Russian citizens,who
made their choice together with us, elected those whom they trust.
"
</P>
<P>
The prime minister regards as "a strong asset" the fact that
the State Duma will have 75 percent of new deputies. "I believe
that the entire country is now in expectation for the start of the
new State Duma's work," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Monday, Putin and the leaders of the six election coalitions
that went through to the Duma exchanged views on a wide spectrum
of issues. But the distribution of portfolios in the new Duma was
not touched upon, Putin's spokesman Mikhail Kozhukhov told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"No one planned to reach any agreements on the distribution of
portfolios in the Duma," Kozhukhov said, adding that the coalition
leaders spoke about their idea of cooperation between the new Duma
and the government, and of the first-priority legislative tasks.
</P>
<P>
The coalition leaders made concrete proposals on ways of
solving social and economic problems. The sides also discussed the
possibility of ratifying the START-II Treaty which, from the
government's point of view, is one of the current foreign-policy
priorities, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Metallurgical Sector Expecting Big Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical sector
is expected to have a profit of 2.5 billion yuan this year, an
increase of 25 percent from a year earlier, a senior official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Pu Haiqing, director of the State Administration of
Metallurgical Industry, said at the conference that the industry
began to earn profit in April this year, and its profit has been
increasing on a monthly basis since then.
</P>
<P>
Large iron and steel companies have played a significant role
in earning profits, he said at a national conference of the
metallurgical industry.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there are 19 iron and steel companies whose
profits this year are predicted at more than 50 million yuan each,
and 13 companies each with profit estimated at over 100 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The country's big four steel makers, namely the Baoshan Group,
the Handan Iron and Steel Company, the Shougang Group, and the
Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, account for more than 85 percent of
the industry's total profit.
</P>
<P>
Domestic iron and steel companies have readjusted their
strategy and managed to reduce costs in face of continued drop of
steel prices. Statistics show that the average cost of major
Chinese iron and steel enterprises was lowered by 6.2 percent this
year, the biggest margin in decades.
</P>
<P>
Pu said that progress has been made in improving the
performance of state-owned steel enterprises this year, with six
large and medium-sized enterprises turning losses into profits.
</P>
<P>
However, Pu said that the sector failed to accomplish the goal
of reducing steel output by 10 percent this year. Total steel and
rolled steel output this year would hit 122 million and 117
million tons, respectively, up six and nine percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the stockpile of rolled steel is steel increasing.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the failure to the fact that small iron and steel
plants continued to increase production in defiance of the
government policy to cut output.
</P>
<P>
Next year, the sector will continue to concentrate on
controlling production, readjusting product mix and promoting
technological upgrading, Pu stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that the State Economic and Trade Commission and his
administration have worked out a package of measures in a bid to
improve the sector's economic return by a bigger margin next year.

DHAKA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Nitol Group of Bangladesh
Wednesday formally introduced China made T J Honda Motor Cycle in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Price of the environmentally sound two-wheeler motor bike,
which is manufactured in China in joint venture with a Japanese
company, has been fixed at 1,666 U.S. dollars, Nitol Group
officials told this at the launching ceremony at a hotel here.

as the present government had created an investment-friendly
environment by playing the role of a catalyst.

He termed the relations between Bangladesh and China as "very
nice" and hoped that the local industrialists would be able to
manufacture motor cycles here in the near future.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Social Welfare Dr. Mozammel Hussain urged
the Chinese company to set up industries here, where the T J Honda
Motor Cycle could be directly manufactured, instead of assembling
it for the benefit of the common people of the country.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Worse Situation in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The meeting follows a Tuesday briefing by the U.N. assistant
Secretary-General for peacekeeping operations, Hedi Annabi, who
cited reports reaching the United Nations from South Kivu Province,
Congo (K), as saying that "the slightest incident" could trigger
large-scale organized attacks against civilians, especially ethnic
Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Annabi told the 15-member Security Council Tuesday that there
was also equal concern that, given the threat to the Congolese
Tutsi community, they themselves could trigger an anti-Tutsi
offensive through violent actions against their neighbors, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Annabi urged the council to call on all warring parties to
observe the cease-fire in the central African nation, formerly
Zaire, stop new offensive, "and to do everything possible to
prevent outbreak of violence, especially in South Kivu" province,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Council for the month of December, Jeremy
Greenstock who is the British permanent representative to the
United Nations, said Tuesday that the reports of fighting had "
raised council concern."
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Tutsis were first endangered when Hutu fighters,
fleeing Tutsi rule in neighboring Rwanda after an orgy of genocide
in 1994, fled to what was then eastern Zaire. After President
Laurent Kabila took office in 1997, with Rwandan help, his
government accused Rwanda of fighting with rebels who took up arms
against him in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, together with his allies, and Rwanda and Uganda signed
a peace accord in Lusaka, capital of Zambia, in July this year.
Each side has since accused the other of violating the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka agreement calls for deployment of U.N. peacekeepers,
the withdrawal of foreign troops from Congo, and a national
dialogue to set a timetable for democratic elections in Africa's
third largest country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been unable to deploy peacekeepers
because the Congo (K) Government and rebel forces have not
guaranteed full security and freedom of movement for U.N. liaison
officers surveying security conditions. Only 62 of 90 U.N. liaison
officers have been deployed so far.

million dollar loan for Russia because the state-affiliated oil
company for which the loan was intended is an example of
resistance to economic reform.

The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Nasdaq Composite Index skyrocketed to its biggest point
gain to date, and its 19th-biggest percentage rise, led by soaring
technology issues. The Fed's decision to leave interest rates
unchanged and remain officially neutral on the possibility of
raising rates next year sparked the climb. The Index closed above
3900 for the first time, adding 3.36 percent to 3911.15, its 27th
record in 37 trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
-- Sri Lanka began counting ballots from Tuesday's presidential

violence. President Kumaratunga had a slight lead in early
results, but the main opposition party is charging vote fraud.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong held a ceremony
Wednesday to celebrate the completion of the Hong Kong Central
Library, an intelligent building expected to commence its service
in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
The new library was planned by the Hong Kong Provisional Urban
Council (PUC) in 1990 to enhance the quality of Hong Kong's public
library services to meet the information, cultural and

</P>
<P>
Addressing the completion ceremony, PUC Chairman Ronald Leung

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's First Test-Tube Triplets Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's first test-tube
triplets who were born on November 6 have been doing well over the
past month and a half, and left the hospital for home this morning.
</P>
<P>
The infants, two girls and a boy, looked rosy and strong under
the good care of the nurses at a hospital affiliated with the
Shanghai Medical Sciences University.
</P>
<P>
The older girl now weighs 2,705 grams and the younger 2,700
grams, while the boy weighs 2,640 grams, compared with their
weights of 1,485 grams, 1,525 grams and 1,310 grams at birth,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The mother of the triplets was unable to conceive, but
successfully became pregnant after the using the test-tube method.
</P>
<P>
A heredity and sterility center in Shanghai jointly sponsored
by China and the United States one year ago has already helped 316
couples conceive via the test-tube method, with a success rate of
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far, 41 couples have had 52 children, including seven pairs
of twins and two sets of triplets.
</P>
<P>
To reduce multiple births and increase the survival rate of
test-tube babies, the center has begun to cut the number of
transplanted embryos in their method.

<HEADLINE> World Demand for Oil Rises in 1999: OAPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) has estimated an increase of
1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in world demand for oil this
year.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly newsletter for December, OAPEC expected the world
demand for oil in 1999 would rise from last year's 74.2 million bpd
to 75.3 million bpd by the year-end, while total international oil
supply would drop to 73.2 million bpd, compared with 75.5 million
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait-based organization said the fourth quarter of 1999
would witness a noticeable rise in demand to reach 77.2 million
bpd, a 1.9-million-bpd increase than the year before.
</P>
<P>
International demand for oil in the first quarter was 76.5
million bpd, compared with 74.9 million bpd during the
corresponding period last year, the OAPEC newsletter said.
</P>
<P>
But it said the global supply in the first quarter this year
reached 78 million, 1.4 million barrels more per day than the year
before.
</P>
<P>
World oil supply fell to 72.8 million bpd in the second quarter
of 1999, mainly because the output squeeze policy reached by major
world producers took effect on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) and non-OPEC producers agreed in March to impose a one-year
production cuts of 2.1 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
OAPEC said that although oil supply in the third quarter picked
up by 600,000 bpd from the second quarter, it was still 600,000
barrels less a day than that in the same period in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nairobi-based U.N.
agencies have launched a regional program to respond to the threat
of water shortage in African cities.
</P>
<P>
"Such regional programs are critical if we are to move beyond
the threat of water scarcity in Africa," said Klaus Toepfer,
Executive Director of the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) and
Acting Executive Director of U.N. Center for Human Settlements
(Habitat), in a press release issued by the two U.N. agencies
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that 12 more African countries will join the 13
that already suffer from water scarcity.
</P>
<P>
As part of the program "Managing Water for African Cities", the
U.N. agencies invited government and water management officials
from several African capitals to make a study visit to the cities
of Durban, Johannesburg and Windhoek from December 6 to 12.
</P>
<P>
The city managers learnt a wide variety of innovative
approaches to improve the efficiency of water use in these cities.
</P>
<P>
The program will disseminate these good practices among other
cities and will introduce some of these practices in the
demonstration cities, said Toepfer.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Insurance Industry Urged for Consolidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's insurers have
been urged to consolidate and position themselves to meet the
changing conditions.
</P>
<P>
In the next millennium, insurers should prioritize towards
consolidation and position themselves to be able to effectively
provide value for money to consumers and successfully mobilize
domestic savings to finance productive economic activities, Deputy
Finance Minister Chan Kong Choy said here Wednesday at the annual
dinner of the Life Insurance Association of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
With the intensification of competition through liberalization
and consolidation, the pressure for greater market access would
further gain momentum, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the external factors, the Malaysian life
insurance industry must consolidate, innovate and develop new
products as well as develop distribution channel to meet the
changing conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides mergers and acquisitions, the several on-going
initiatives by the government like fostering the high level of
competence and integrity were to prepare the industry to face
these challenges, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's strategy would be to ensure that insurers put
their house in order and be more guided by self regulation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for greater product transparency and urged
the insurance industry to play a bigger role in retirement
planning through pension and annuity products.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the insurance industry had achieved significant
progress over the last decade as total capitalization of locally
incorporated insurers had increased more than five fold from 600
million ringgit (about 157.894 million U.S. dollars) in 1988 to 3.
4 billion ringgit (about 894.736 million dollar) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, he said, insurance fund assets and the
aggregate premium income of the life and general sectors have also
increased in similar proportions from only 7 billion ringgit (
about 1.842 billion dollars) and 2.1 billion ringgit (about 552.
631 million dollars) to 38.7 billion ringgit (about 10.184 billion
dollars) and 10.9 billion ringgit (about 2.868 billion dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the assets of insurance funds and premium income
of the industry in proportion to the Gross National Product had
also increased from 8.6 percent and 2.4 percent in 1988 to 14.4
percent and 4.0 percent as at 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the deputy minister said the insurance industry had a
long way to go in providing protection to the population and
garnering more savings in the financial system as only about 28
percent of Malaysians have to date a life insurance policy while
life insurance funds assets only constituted 2.4 percent of the
assets of the country's financial system.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday said that
it would retain the right to conduct nuclear tests if India does
not sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar told the combined meeting of the
cabinet and the National Security Council that the signing of the
CTBT does not affect possession on enhancement of nuclear
capability or production of fissile material.
</P>
<P>
An official statement issued after the meeting said that the
cabinet was informed that the treaty only prohibits nuclear
explosion tests and it is non-discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the CTBT can not enter into
force until it was signed and ratified by all 44 states that have
nuclear weapons or nuclear reactors including India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Thus if India does not sign Pakistan would retain the right to
conduct test," said Sattar.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows at 5.7 Percent Rate in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic growth
rate stood at 5.7 percent in the third quarter, even faster than
the government previously estimated, the Commerce Department said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the gross domestic product in the July-
September quarter followed an anemic 1.9 percent rate of growth in
the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The growth was attributed to a number of factors, including
robust consumer spending, a strong buildup in inventories held by
businesses and an increase in exports.
</P>
<P>
The revised third-quarter estimate shows the economy is growing
at a more robust pace than the 5.5 percent rate the government
reported one month ago and the 4.8 percent rate originally
estimated.
</P>
<P>
It marked the biggest spurt in growth since a 5.9 percent rate
posted in the fourth quarter of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Li Lanqing Calls for Improved Tax System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing in a
written message today noted that the national taxation system
should be implemented in accordance with related laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China, urged the State General Taxation Administration (SGTA)
to overcome difficulties and reach all taxation targets this year
and in the first year of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released during today's national taxation conference
in Beijing show that national tax revenue through the end of
November stood at 917.2 billion yuan (110.5 billion US dollars),
up 15.4 percent over the same period last year. Value-added and
consumption tax revenues for the period grew by eight percent to
426.8 billion yuan (51.4 billion US dollars), and this year's
planned target of increasing tax revenue by 100 billion yuan is
expected to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Jin Renqing, director of the SGTA, said the country has carried
out a series of taxation policies to enlarge and stimulate
domestic demand by returning export taxes, collecting individual
income tax on saving interest, and reducing tax on investment
projects and high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jin urged the national taxation system to accelerate
taxation efforts by reducing tax arrears, strengthening tax audits,
and introducing strong penalties for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The SGTA has mapped out a plan for next year's tax revenue
calling for an eight percent, or 81.1 billion yuan (9.77 billion
US dollars), increase over this year, he added.

HAIKOU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Korean Air on Tuesday resumed
regular flights from its capital of Seoul to Sanya, the tropical
tourist resort on the island province of Hainan in southern China.

<P>
The Fed, after concluding its closed-door deliberations,
announced that "In light of market uncertainties associated with
the century date change," it was important to focus policy on "
ensuring a smooth transition into the Year 2000."
</P>
<P>
But the Fed said it was keeping its policy directive at neutral,
signaling that if financial markets survive the Y2K computer
changeover without major problems, rates could be headed up again
early next year.

Economists said the Fed was declaring only a temporary cease-

The stock market surged on the Fed's decision to bypass a
fourth rate increase this year. The Dow Jones industrial average

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Call for Improved Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Governments at all levels
should make efforts to improve air quality, said Chinese
legislators at the evaluation meeting for the "Draft of Amendment
Law on Preventing Air Pollution."
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the World Health Organization (
WHO), seven Chinese cities are on the list of the world's ten most
polluted cities.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, over 70 percent of 47 Chinese cities still needed to
improve their air quality, which was below state-set standards.
</P>
<P>
China amended the "Law on Preventing Air Pollution" three years
ago, but the continuously deteriorating air has forced legislators
to amend the law again. The draft submitted today adds stricter
regulations on preventing carbon monoxide pollution, controlling
urban dust, and managing sewage.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee, suggested that people should choose
clean fuel that doesn't pollute, rather than the coal now in
widespread use.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi, also vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said
it is most important to improve people's understanding of
environmental protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wu said it is also imperative to step up efforts to open the
interior regions in central and western China to the rest of the
world, and to further develop economic and trade exchanges
overseas, adding that accelerating the opening-up drive will be an
important for the development of these regions.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the state councilor said, it is essential to
implement all policies already mapped out, and more preferential
policies must be offered to open the regions in order to absorb
more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
She also said that foreign trade this year was better than
expected as exports began to increase again by a relatively wide
margin in recent months.
</P>
<P>
This year's task for using overseas investment has been
accomplished while overseas contracted projects and labor
cooperation have made progress.
</P>
<P>
She also reminded everyone that China and the United States
reached a bilateral agreement on China's entry into the World
Trade Organization this year.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Red Cross delegations from the two countries concluded their
talks on humanitarian issues and made public a joint press
statement on Tuesday, creating favorable conditions for the
preliminary talks on the normalization of diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have never had diplomatic relations, but they
held talks aimed at normalizing relations in the early 1990s.
These talks later broke off for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Japanese government accused the DPRK of "firing
missiles," but the DPRK claimed that it had launched a satellite.
In any case, Japan imposed sanctions on the DPRK and suspended
talks on normalization once again.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese political party delegation led by Tomiichi Murayama,
former Japanese prime minister and member of the House of
Representatives, visited the DPRK early this month and held talks
with the Workers' Party of Korea. The two sides agreed to urge
their respective governments to reopen bilateral government talks
and consolidate mutual cooperation and exchange on humanitarian
issues.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government announced the lifting of all sanctions
against the DPRK on December 14, paving the way for the
improvement of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Incumbent President Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's incumbent
President Chandrika Kumaratunga was sworn in here Wednesday for a
second term with pledges to bring peace to the Indian Ocean island
country.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, who sustained injuries in a failed assassination
attempt by a suspected Tamil rebel suicide bomber four days ago,
was sworn in before Chief Justice Sarath de Silva Wednesday
afternoon soon after her victory was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, who was reelected in Sri Lanka's fourth
presidential election with 51.12 percent of votes polled Tuesday,
defeated her major rival Ranil Wickremesinghe, leader of the main
opposition United National Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, 54, vowed to bring peace to the country which has
been plagued by seemingly unending ethnic conflicts since 1983
between the Sinhalese majority dominated government troops and the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
"The days of terror in this land are numbered, and the number
is small," said Kumaratunga after the ceremony conducted at her
tightly-guarded Temple Trees residence in downtown Colombo.
</P>
<P>
"There is no individual on this earth more determined that I am
to end this country's wretched and mindless bloodshed and
destruction," she said while her right eye still bandaged from
injuries sustained in Saturday's assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga called on Wickremesinghe and his UNP to join her in
building a consensus to solve the long-running ethnic conflicts in
the country.
</P>
<P>
She also made a special appeal to the minority Tamil community
to break all links with the LTTE which is fighting for a separate
Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
"I urge you to persuade, with every conceivable argument,
anyone who is a member of a supporter of the LTTE to renounce
violence and join us in establishing peace," she said.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Sees Steady Growth, Foreign Trade Minister ( Wrap-up) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade has
witnessed overall stable growth in the first 11 months of this
year, said Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (
MOFTEC) Shi Guangsheng at a national conference on foreign trade,
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
China's export value volume this year is expected to grow by
more then five percent over last year, Shi told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Not only will the growth rate be higher than last year, it will
also exceed the average growth rate worldwide, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
China's export volume, which slipped during the first half of
this year, started to rise in July and continued to accelerate
during the following months.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that China's total import and export
volume reached 323 billion U.S. dollars in the first 11 months, a
12.7 percent increase year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, export increased 6.6 percent to 174.7 billion U.S.
dollars and while import jumped 20.9 percent to 148.3 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
China also attracted a total of 608.16 billion U.S. dollars in
contractual overseas investment and had made actual use of 304.45
billion U.S. dollars by the end of November, according to Shi.
</P>
<P>
The projected figure of actual overseas investment for the
whole of 1999 will probably surpass 38 billion U.S. dollars, a
slight decrease from that of last year but "still considerable in
scale," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
This year also saw stable development in overseas labor service
contracts, with the total contractual value reaching 10.27 billion
U.S. dollars from January to November, up 2.1 percent from a year
earlier, and 8.79 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, an increase of
6.7 percent, Shi added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, MOFTEC this year gave approval to more than
100 enterprises for dealing in processing trade overseas,
involving 135 projects overseas with total Chinese investment of
about 140 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The focus of Chinese investment overseas has shifted from trade
enterprises to manufacturing companies, with the investment
spread over more than 160 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Shi pointed to the fact that China has reached bilateral
agreements on its accession to the World Trade Organization with
Indonesia, Japan, Australia, Chile, the United States, and Canada
this year, solving the key issues for China's WTO entry, and
drastically speeding up the process.
</P>
<P>
China's trade relations with neighboring countries and
developing countries have been proceeding at accelerated pace,
while bilateral trade links with major trade partners including
the U.S., Japan, and Europe have been gaining in strength, noted
Shi.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 saw China's interior areas tighten trade and
economic ties with Hong Kong and Macao, achieve new developments
in trade relations with Taiwan, and announce details on
implementing the Law on the Protection of Investment of Taiwan
Compatriots, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up New Panda Habitat in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Pandas roaming in the wild
will soon find themselves in a friendly habitat with plenty of
bamboo and a favorable living environment if they accidentally
wander into a special reserve in the mountainous region of
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Known as the home of the giant panda, China today initiated
construction of the "Chinese Panda Park" for the rare species in
its largest panda reserve, the Wolong Panda Reserve in
northwestern Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
The new reserve covers three square kilometers and is
established to enlarge the pandas' living space, enhance their
mating behavior, and help them survive in the wild.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese zoologists will conduct a series of
scientific researches and practical programs on pandas in the park.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 China launched a ten-year project to protect the panda
and its habitat, with plans to establish 14 nature reserves at the
junctions of Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces, a 5,000-square-
kilometer habitat with about 80 percent of the remaining 1,000
pandas living in the wild.
</P>
<P>
The Wolong Panda Reserve is home to more than 100 wild giant
pandas, one-tenth of the country's total. At the same time, the
reserve is breeding 46 pandas, 30 percent of all the pandas living
in captivity.

<HEADLINE> Five of Somali Faction Leaders Agree to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Five of the Mogadishu's main
faction leaders have reached an agreement to end their long
standing rivalry and struggle for power.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed at the end of a three-day meeting in
South Mogadishu on Tuesday by the faction leaders, Hussein Mohamed
Aidid, Hussein Hajji Bod, Mohamed Qanyareh Afrah, Mohamed Hussein
Addow and Osman Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, an all inclusive administration will be
set up for the regions of Southern Somalia as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders called for the restoration of law and order
in the capital. They agreed to reopen Mogadishu's air and sea
ports soon, which have remained out of use since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders also announced the unification of their
political opinions regarding what they called the restoration of
the Somali nationhood.
</P>
<P>
They called on the remaining other politicians to join them in
their efforts of what they called rescuing the nation from new
dangers facing the territorial integrity and the unity of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The governor of Hiran Region Hassan Mohamed Qalad characterized
the agreement as a positive step forward. And politicians in the
central region of Hiran have cautiously welcomed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, the well-known militia commanders including the former
head of operations for Hussein Aidid's faction Mohamud Mohamed
Siganeh and the commander of Ballidogleh airport Abdukarim
Farabadan said this agreement has taken place without their
consent and knowledge and therefore will not be materialized.
</P>
<P>
Other politicians have claimed that these five faction leaders
all belong to the same Hawiyeh tribe and therefore can not talk on
behalf of all the people in southern Somalia.

<HEADLINE> State Councilor Calls for Strengthened Trade with HK, Macao, Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua)-- State Councilor Wu Yi urged
trade officials to enhance trade ties with Hong Kong, Macao, and
Taiwan at the National Conference on Foreign Trade, which opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Macao's return to the motherland, Wu said, the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation should assume
an active role in creating the establishment of an official system
to handle trade cooperation with Macao, further tighten its
economic ties with the mainland, and boost the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the Mainland-Hong Kong Joint Committee on
Commerce and Trade was successfully convened in November, Wu said,
signifying a formal start of high-level exchanges and contacts
between trade authorities of the mainland and Hong Kong, and
proved conducive to the smooth development of mainland-Hong Kong
trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The trade and economic links between the mainland, Hong Kong,
and Macao, Wu added, are those between a state and its individual
tariff zones.
</P>
<P>
Thus, she pointed out, the state should provide the necessary
support for Hong Kong and Macao businesspeople who are in the
mainland for trade, investment and scientific cooperation, in
accordance with international trade practices and the principle of
"priority over peers, and appropriate preference."
</P>
<P>
Wu urged trade officials attending the conference to vigorously
broaden exports to the two Special Administrative Regions, transit
trade through them, and energize efforts to attract Hong Kong and
Macao investment in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Scientific cooperation should be viewed as a new growth point
in trade and economic cooperation between the mainland and Hong
Kong and Macao, while cooperation in information, biological, and
new-materials technologies should also be enlarged, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that trade relations between Hong Kong, Macao,
and Taiwan have become an important and special part of cross-
Straits relations, and that the mainland should make use of Hong
Kong and Macao's advantages to strengthen its trade links with
Taiwan, and create conditions for eventually realizing the
peaceful reunification of China.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The joint police marine
operations along the border coastal waters between Malaysia and
Thailand have proved beneficial to both sides, a police officer
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The routine joint patrols between the Royal Thai Marine and
their Malaysian counterparts have played their role in monitoring
sea activities and acting as a watchdog against sea robberies,
Langkawi Police Marine Coordinator Officer Zakaria Embi said after
the past 24-hour joint patrols under the Regional Border Committee
jurisdiction in Langkawi, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the results since the operations began twice every
month in the past year had proven that such joint-efforts can be
mutually beneficial to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the frequency of operations, the marine police
officer hoped that fishermen and transport vessels skippers
adhered to the advices rendered by the marine police to prevent
them from falling victims to sea robbers.
</P>
<P>
The officer also called on local fishermen to act as informers
for the marine police if they come across smuggling, piracy,
illegal landings and encroachment cases around the border coastal
areas.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Continues Freezing Work Permits to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of Cyprus has
decided to extend the moratorium on issuing work permits to
foreigners until the end of March next year, local newspapers
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial committee Tuesday also denied a demand by night
club owners for an increase in the number of foreign workers they
employ.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time the committee, which was jointly formed
by the Interior, Justice and Labour ministries, extended the August
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou, president of the
committee, said after a closed-door meeting that the decision was
made to cope with the island's deteriorating unemployment
situation. He said the committee will meet again after the
three-month period is over to decide on further actions.
</P>
<P>
In September, Labour Minister Andreas Moushiouttas admitted that
illegal foreign workers contributed to unemployment on the island.
He did not give the exact number of illegal foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said that the issue has remained unchecked over
the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
Reports said unemployment rate in Cyprus is now 3.6 percent of
the labour force.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Business Conditions Improve: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's business
conditions continued to improve with greater vigor in the second
quarter of 1999, according to a survey by the Federation of
Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) on the performance of the
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Significant achievements were recorded in domestic and export
sales and profits, where 50 percent of respondents reported higher
domestic sales, and more than 40 percent reported higher exports
and profits, the federation said in a statement Wednesday when
releasing the key findings of the survey conducted between early
September and mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Average selling prices and production costs remained stable,
while recruitment at overall and shopfloor levels and overtime
hours had increased, it said.
</P>
<P>
Like in the second quarter, some 50 percent of the
manufacturers estimated higher domestic sales and more than 40
percent expect higher exports and profits with stable selling
prices and production costs in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting this stronger operating environment, many
respondents had placed high priority on activities to maintain
market share, increase domestic and export sales, and expand into
new markets in the third quarter, the FMM said.
</P>
<P>
Of the poll, 151 manufacturers responded, comprising 31 percent
domestic and 66 percent export-oriented manufacturers, it said.
</P>
<P>
Capacity utilization improved tremendously at the higher levels
in the second quarter as half of the respondents had operated
above the 80 percent utilization level, compared with only one-
third of respondents in the first quarter, it said, adding this
improvement was prominent among the export-oriented industries.
</P>
<P>
For the third quarter, utilization continued to improve as more
respondents moved towards higher operating levels, it said, adding
that 51 percent continued to operate above the 80 percent
utilization level, of which one-fifth operated at the full 90-100
percent level. Again, this improvement was evident among the
export-oriented industries.
</P>
<P>
Outlook for the fourth quarter remained optimistic as a
majority of respondents expected the general industry and
companies' profitability to improve, the FMM said.
</P>
<P>
This was more evident among the domestic-oriented industries.
Higher domestic and foreign orders were also anticipated by a
sizable 40 percent of respondents.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing this optimism and a strong return of investment
confidence, almost all respondents (97 percent) indicated
intention to expand and upgrade their plants in the fourth quarter
with a total investment in the region of 535 million ringgit (140.
789 million U.S. dollars), it said.

<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi
today urged a relatively rapid increase of exports next year and
greater overseas investment to contribute to national economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national conference on foreign trade, Wu asked
for improved competitiveness of export commodities in terms of
scientific and technological advancement, saying that it is now
imperative to expand exports of high-tech and high value-added
mechanical and electronic products.
</P>
<P>
She said that it is also essential that the foreign trade
sector serve the national economy, underlining such main tasks as
accelerating the pace of integrating economic and trade policies
with the overall industrial policies, providing enterprises with
timely international market information, and improving the import
product mix and the industrial structure of overseas-funded
projects.
</P>
<P>
The major tasks also include helping state-owned industrial
enterprises expand their share of the international market,
introducing more Chinese enterprises and products overseas through
multilateral and bilateral economic and trade exchanges, and
further reforming the state-owned foreign trade sector.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's environment
was generally improved in 1998 particularly in terms of air and
river water quality, Science, Technology and Environment Minister
Law Hieng Ding said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 1998 Environment Quality Report, the damp weather
last year resulted in far better air quality compared to 1997, he
told reporters after releasing the report here.
</P>
<P>
The number of clean rivers in the country increased to 33 last
year from 24 in 1997 while the number of polluted rivers declined
from 25 to 16, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Generally I am satisfied with the environment quality last
year although I believe there is room for improvement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Law said the government would intensify enforcement to curb the
illegal dumping of toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
The government had identified about 80 percent of the producers
of toxic waste throughout the country and they would be monitored
from time to time, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the cases brought to court for
contravening the 1974 Environmental Protection Act reduced to 253
cases last year from 275 cases in 1997, but total fines collected
from offenders increased due to the higher fines imposed.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Africa to Usher in 21st Century With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- As the clock is ticking to the
dawn of the new century, Africa, the least developed continent on
the earth, vows to speed up its development in the long march to
catch up with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
While the outgoing 20th century is often described as "a
century of Africa's liberation and independence", the new
millennium can surely bring fresh hope and opportunity to the
backward continent which, like elsewhere, also has huge potentials
for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At present, the social development and economic recovery in
many parts of the continent are still hindered by some major
problems left over mainly from the colonial age.
</P>
<P>
One third of sub-Saharan countries are involved in civil
unrest, bilateral conflicts or regional wars. As a result, more
than half of Africans are still living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
However, African leaders have come to realize that the
continent can not afford to remain one of perpetual insecurity and
instability.
</P>
<P>
They share a unanimous view that peace and development are,
more than ever, two things that Africans have been yearning for,
as it was demonstrated in a declaration issued at the end of the
35th summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in
July.
</P>
<P>
This important meeting, attended by 46 African heads of state
and government, was undoubtedly aimed at making full preparations
for the African continent entering the new century.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo called on
leaders of African countries in his keynote speech to make "2000 a
year of peace and security in Africa," stressing that "Africa's
reputation as a continent at war against itself must be arrested."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo himself was elected as President of the Fourth
Republic of Nigeria and sworn in on May 29, an eye-catching event
of this year which has brought an end to the 16 years of
uninterrupted military rule in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
It is also encouraging to see in the year that African leaders,
"through concerted and collective efforts", succeeded in bringing
all players involved in the conflict of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) -- which had sucked in five other African
countries -- and the two warring sides of Sierra Leone to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Both the peace agreements, one for the DRC signed in Zambian
capital Lusaka on July 10 and the other for Sierra Leone signed in
Togolese capital Lome on July 7, show that "where there is
determination and persistence, there is a solution to the crisis,"
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said.
</P>
<P>
"They should encourage us to work even harder in order to
address the other hotbeds of tension which are still prevailing on
the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid and solve conflicts, the 53-member OAU and other
sub-regional bodies have adopted a series of measures and set up a
mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution,
which are meant to seek home-grown solutions.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the 16-member Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) approved the establishment of such a mechanism at
its 22nd summit which ended on December 10 in Lome.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism includes a Mediation and Security Council, a
multi- national stand-by force, and four Zonal Observation bureaux
to monitor and deal with potential conflicts in the sub-region.

to proper the STI.
</P>

African Community. And the 16-member ECOWAS decided at its 22nd
summit in December to make January 1 of 2004 as the launching time
of the west Africa single monetary zone.
</P>
<P>
So far, all the existing 10 regional or sub-regional
organizations in Africa have respectively mapped out their
blueprints of integration and cooperation for the next 10 years,
which include the establishment of economic community, monetary
union, free trade area and customs union to facilitate the free
movement of goods, services, labor and capital across the borders
of member states. All these will lead to the final formation of
the African Economic Community scheduled for the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
Given the challenges of globalization and international
competition, "Africa's strength, both internally and in its
relations with the rest of the world, lies in pursuing vigorously
the goal of economic cooperation and integration," OAU
Secretary-General Salim said.
</P>
<P>
It is observed that for Africa, if the political stability and
economic integration serve the long-term interest of development
in the new century, its economic prospects will also bode well in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), Africa's economic growth rate is predicted to reach five
percent in 2000, compared with 3.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the economic power-house of the continent, is
expected to see an economic growth rate of 3.7 percent in the
first year of the new century, representing a giant leap forward
after this year's expansion of 0. 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Morocco, another two important economies in Africa,
are expected to achieve growth rates of 3.3 percent and 5.1
percent respectively in 2000, up from 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent
of this year, according to IMF prediction.
</P>
<P>
Other African countries such as Tunisia, the Sudan, Cameroon,
Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Rwanda and Mozambique may secure a growth
rate between four and five percent this year, and they are
expected to enjoy faster economic expansion in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The IMF report attributes the continent's faster economic
growth in the new century to the readjustment of economic
structure carried out in some African countries, apart from a
positive role that the regional economic integration will play.
</P>
<P>
All in all, Africa will lurch and march along its road of
development in the new century despite many daunting challenges it
is facing or will face.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders can feel the weight of burdens on their
shoulders more than ever before, because they need not only to
address the social, economic and political problems in their
respective countries, but also to brave the torrential wave of
globalization.

<HEADLINE> Newsmaker: Kumaratunga Wins Reelection in S.Lanka's Presidential Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga was reelected on Wednesday with 51.12 percent of the
votes polled in the fourth presidential election on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, who escaped an assassination attempt Saturday
evening by a suspected Tamil suicide bomber, won the election with
a much smaller margin than her record 62.28 percent votes in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The suicidal bombing at her last election rally on Saturday in
central Colombo might win enough sympathy votes to ensure
Kumaratunga's victory, beating her main rival Ranil Wickremesinghe
of the opposition United National Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
The bomb explosion, which killed at least 24 people and wounded
84 others including the president herself, was believed to be the
extension of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamils Eelam's (
LTTE) bloody counter-offensive to retrieve lost ground in the
north.
</P>
<P>
Under the aegis of seeking a fresh mandate to resolve the 16-
year-old ethnic conflicts, President Kumaratunga called the
election about a year ahead of previously scheduled November next
year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said she had aimed to catch the UNP unprepared and
built on the government's military victories.
</P>
<P>
Yet it was the blood and flesh on the battlefield that marked
Kumaratunga's reelection campaign from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
A string of military defeats in the northern Wanni region early
last month stripped the government of a vast area which had taken
the army more than two years to capture, weakening Kumaratunga's
chance of winning the election.
</P>
<P>
Blood and violence are not unfamiliar with Mrs. Kumaratunga
whose father and husband were all assassinated by political rivals.
</P>
<P>
Chandrika Kumaratunga, 54-year-old, came from a prominent
political family and married the film star-turned-politician
Vijaya Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
Her father S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, founder of Sri Lanka Freedom
Party (SLFP), took office as the prime minister in 1956 but was
assassinated by a Buddhist monk on September 26, 1959.
</P>
<P>
Then her mother, Sirimavo Bandaranaike took over the post and
became the world's first woman prime minister in July 1960. Mrs.
Bandaranaike served as prime minister for the 1960-1965 and 1970-
1977 terms. She is now serving her third term in her daughter's
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga's husband was also shot dead by a leftist rebel on
February 16, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Kumaratunga then fled the country with her two children,
Yasodara and Vimukthi, to London, serving as a research fellow
with the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, she returned home and became the chief organizer of
the SLFP for the Attanagalla Electorate.
</P>
<P>
Following the formation of the People's Alliance coalition
centered around the SLFP, Kumaratunga flexed her political muscles
by being elected as the chief minister in the crucial Western
Provincial Council in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
Riding on the victory, she led the People's Alliance to victory
in the parliamentary election in August 1994 and later succeeded
in becoming Sri Lanka's first woman president in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
A few months after Kumaratunga's victory in the 1994
presidential election, peace talks between the government and the
LTTE collapsed and hostilities resumed.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Mrs. Kumaratunga followed a war-for-peace solution
to the ethnic problem. While government troops successfully pushed
the LTTE out of their traditional bastion of the northern Jaffna
peninsula by 1996, she initiated a devolution package to give more
power to regions including one dominated by ethnic Tamils.
</P>
<P>
However, both measures have failed to produce much success.
Besides the recent military defeats, her devolution plan has so
far failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament
due to the objection of UNP.

The formal launching of such a mechanism means the ECOWAS,

<HEADLINE> China's Machinery Industry Expects 10-Percent Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China's machinery industry is
expected to score a ten-percent growth in output value next year
with profits increasing by five percent, according to the State
Administration of Machinery Industry (SAMI).
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaohua, director of SAMI, said at a national work
conference today that the government is striving to get most of
its money-losing state-owned machinery manufacturers out of
difficulty by next year.
</P>
<P>
Reform of state-owned enterprises, implementation of debt-to-
equity conversion, and major technical upgrading will help fuel
the growth of the machinery industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Expanding into the rural market and China's western areas,
where industrialization is not as developed in coastal regions,
will also give the industry a big boost.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu noted, the international market also provides
strong competition.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the total added value of the
industry between January and November this year stood at 103.95
billion yuan (about 12.6 billion U.S. dollars) up 10.3 percent
year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The Industry reported a profit of 8.9 billion yuan (about 1.1
billion U.S. dollars) in the January-October period, surging 52
percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Wu attributed the increase in profits to state policies such as
interest cuts and an anti-smuggling drive.
</P>
<P>
There is still much room for improvement in the machinery
industry, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Africa to Usher in 21st Century With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- As the clock is ticking to the
dawn of the new century, Africa, the least developed continent on
the earth, vows to speed up its development in the long march to
catch up with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
While the outgoing 20th century is often described as "a
century of Africa's liberation and independence", the new
millennium can surely bring fresh hope and opportunity to the
backward continent which, like elsewhere, also has huge potentials
for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At present, the social development and economic recovery in
many parts of the continent are still hindered by some major
problems left over mainly from the colonial age.
</P>
<P>
One third of sub-Saharan countries are involved in civil
unrest, bilateral conflicts or regional wars. As a result, more
than half of Africans are still living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
However, African leaders have come to realize that the
continent can not afford to remain one of perpetual insecurity and
instability.
</P>
<P>
They share a unanimous view that peace and development are,
more than ever, two things that Africans have been yearning for,
as it was demonstrated in a declaration issued at the end of the
35th summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in
July.
</P>
<P>
This important meeting, attended by 46 African heads of state
and government, was undoubtedly aimed at making full preparations
for the African continent entering the new century.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo called on
leaders of African countries in his keynote speech to make "2000 a
year of peace and security in Africa," stressing that "Africa's
reputation as a continent at war against itself must be arrested."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo himself was elected as President of the Fourth
Republic of Nigeria and sworn in on May 29, an eye-catching event
of this year which has brought an end to the 16 years of
uninterrupted military rule in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
It is also encouraging to see in the year that African leaders,
"through concerted and collective efforts", succeeded in bringing
all players involved in the conflict of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) -- which had sucked in five other African
countries -- and the two warring sides of Sierra Leone to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Both the peace agreements, one for the DRC signed in Zambian
capital Lusaka on July 10 and the other for Sierra Leone signed in
Togolese capital Lome on July 7, show that "where there is
determination and persistence, there is a solution to the crisis,"
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said.
</P>
<P>
"They should encourage us to work even harder in order to
address the other hotbeds of tension which are still prevailing on
the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid and solve conflicts, the 53-member OAU and other
sub-regional bodies have adopted a series of measures and set up a
mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution,
which are meant to seek home-grown solutions.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the 16-member Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) approved the establishment of such a mechanism at
its 22nd summit which ended on December 10 in Lome.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism includes a Mediation and Security Council, a
multi- national stand-by force, and four Zonal Observation bureaux
to monitor and deal with potential conflicts in the sub-region.

</P>
<P>
The joint venture will register 200 million yuan of capital,

Prudential PLC was given approval to open branches in China in
May this year. The British company has established five
representative offices in the cities of Guangzhou, Beijing,
Shanghai, Tianjin and Shenyang, respectively.

Mark Tucker, chief executive of Prudential Corporation Asia,
said the new joint venture demonstrate his company's confidence in
Asia and determination in making long-term investments in China.
</P>
<P>
Chang Zhenming, deputy general manager of CITIC, pledged full
support for the joint venture. CITIC will be able to provide
domestic clients with a wider range of services including banking,
industrial investment and other financial services.
</P>
<P>
The two investment partners will provide China Insurance
Regulatory Committee with detailed business development and
marketing plans for the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Prudential PLC was established in London in 1848, and soon
became a major life insurance and mutual fund management company
in Britain. It manages well over 250 billion U.S. dollars worth of
funds and has business offices in ten countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Founded in October 1979, CITIC is a large state-owned
enterprise directly administered by the State Council. Its net
assets total some 244.5 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rocket Sends Human Remains Into Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A Taurus rocket soared
into space early Tuesday morning, carrying away with three dozen
capsules of cremated human remains into orbit, according to a
report from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
The lipstick-sized containers, each holding seven ounces of
cremated remains, are expected to remain in orbit for about 45
years before the containers re-enter earth's atmosphere and burn
up, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The cost of sending ashes into space is 4,800 U.S. dollars per
deceased -- cheaper than earth burial, spokeswoman Susan Schonfeld
said from Houston-based Celestis Inc., which arranges the launches.
</P>
<P>
The first payload by Celestis was on April 21, 1997, when the
remains of LSD-guru and 1960s pop icon Timothy Leary and "Star
Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry were flung into orbit with 22
others. Ashes from 30 people were launched into space on Oct. 3,
1998.
</P>
<P>
This time, there were cremated remains from China, Germany,
Japan and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Warns Investors Not to Violate Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has warned both local
and foreign investors not to violate business rules and
regulations or face the wrath, the Zambia Daily Mail reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government will ensure that all products in the
country conform to the required standards and law so the the
playing field can be leveled, Deputy Minister of Commerce, Trade
and Industry, Jazzman Chikwakwa said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The senior official issued the warning in a reaction to local
manufacturers' calls for checking on the influx of prohibited
cheap products into local markets.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the government will not hesitate to deal with
any erring business entity, whether local or foreign.
</P>
<P>
Some local soft drink manufacturers have been complaining that
chain stores, especially those with South African origin, are
bringing products made from materials which are not legal in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The illegal raw materials being used are said to be
disadvantaging local manufacturing industries which are using very
expensive local and imported raw materials to make their products.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers have complained about the use of sodium
cyclamate and sodium saccharin as ingredients in juice drinks
especially those coming from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chikwakwa said that anybody wanting to invest in his country or
doing business must follow the rules and regulations.

<HEADLINE> Brief Introduction of Parties in New Russian Duma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics of the
votes late Tuesday showed that six leading electoral blocs: the
Communist Party, the Unity movement, Fatherland-All Russia, the
Union of Right-Wing Forces, Zhirinovsky Bloc and Yabloko will
enter Russia's new State Duma. Following is a brief introduction
of these parties:
</P>
<P>
Communist Party of Russian Federation, or KPRF is well
established throughout Russia. Its supporters hanker after the old
Soviet Union. Avoiding extremist positions, the party calls for
stability of economic regulations, respect for "honest competition
" and even accepts private property. Program calls for restoration
of the Soviet Union, but the word "communism" is absent. It's led
by Gennady Zyuganov, defeated candidate in 1996 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Unity movement is a center-right coalition headed by
Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu. Set up three months ago with
Kremlin backing to act as a counter-force to the Primakov-Luzhkov
bloc in the Duma, it has not elaborated a program. Premier
Vladimir Putin, riding high in the polls, has backed the party.
</P>
<P>
Fatherland-All Russia or OVR is a center-left opposition party
led jointly by former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. Luzhkov is seen as pragmatic and dynamic,
credited with successful development of the Russian capital.
Primakov embodies experience and stability. Credited with
restoring a semblance of normality after August 1998 financial
crisis, and favored by former communists, the military-industrial
sector and by some intellectuals, the party would ally with
Communists in Duma. It has been systematically denigrated by the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The Union of Right-Wing Forces, or SPS is the "young liberals"
party, which includes former premier Sergei Kiriyenko, 37, and
former deputy premier Boris Nemtsov, 40. It was founded on August
23 this year. It urges to defense democracy and freedom and to
protect private property, while promoting an image of youth and
dynamism.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky Bloc, successor to the Liberal Democratic Party, is
led by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Its public support
slumped from 24 percent in previous years to between 3 and 6
percent currently. However, the latest over-6-percent figure in
the Duma polls showed that it could not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
Yabloko bloc is a long-established reformist opposition headed
by Grigory Yavlinski. It is favored by many intellectuals, but
more widely reproached for insufficiently involving himself.
Program favors limited foreign loans and liberal social and
economic policies. Prospects were boosted by arrival of former
premier Sergei Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
The six blocs will share half of the 450 seats in the lower
house of the parliament by vote proportion on the party list.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics of the Central Electoral Commission
indicated that with 98.03 percent of the nationwide ballots
counted as of 22:00 p.m. Moscow time (1900 GMT) Tuesday, the
Russian Communist Party won 24.29 percent of the votes in Sunday's
parliamentary elections, followed by the Unity bloc with 23.24
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Fatherland-All-Russia election coalition came next with 13.
12 percent; the Union of Right-Wing Forces with 8.60 percent, the
Zhirinovsky Bloc with 6.04 percent and Yabloko with 5.98 percent
of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's electoral law, half of the Duma's 450 seats will
be proportionally shared among parties which get more than five
percent of the total vote and the other half will be elected in
225 individual constituencies in the country
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Electoral Commission's preliminary
figures late Monday, the Communist Party won 43 of all 224 single-
mandate districts, Fatherland- All Russia won 29, while the Unity
movement 10, Our Home Is Russia seven and Yabloko and the Union of
Right-Wing Forces five respectively.
</P>
<P>
Nominated individual candidates seized 105 single-seat
districts with individual volunteer candidates winning in six.
</P>
<P>
No individual electoral district or voting stations were set up
this time in the breakaway republic of Chechnya because of the war
there. As a result, a total of 224 individual deputies will be
elected during the polls across the country.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Russian Communist Party, leading in the Sunday's
elections into the State Duma and keeping its No. One status in
the parliament, will win 111 seats in the lower house of the
parliament, including 68 seats by party proportion and 43 seats in
single-mandate constituencies, said Russian Central Electoral
Commission Chairman Alexander Veshnyakov Monday.
</P>
<P>
The inter-regional Unity movement is expected to win 66 seats
in the voting for party lists and nearly 10 seats in single-seat
constituencies, and the Fatherland-All Russia bloc by early
accounts is poised to win 33 seats in the voting for party tickets
while 29 of its candidates took the led in single-seat
constituencies, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Union of Right Forces is likely to win 24 and five seats
respectively, and Yabloko -- 17 and five seats respectively,
Veshnyakov said.
</P>
<P>
The Zhirinovsky Bloc will have 17 of its own candidates on the
federal list in the Duma. But unlike other parties that overcame
the 5 percent barrier needed for being represented in parliament,
it did not lead in any single-seat constituency.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections were held across the country on
Sunday with over 60 percent of the 107 million eligible voters
taking part. As many as 26 blocs and movements were registered for
the race.
</P>
<P>
The last Russian parliamentary elections in 1995 involved 41
associations, but only four managed to overcome the five-percent
hurdle. The Communist Party received 22.3 percent, the Liberal
Democratic party of Vladimir Zhirinovsky 11.18 percent, Our Home
Is Russia 10.13 percent and Yabloko 6.89 percent.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Leader Hails Regional Efforts for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
has hailed the latest efforts made by regional leaders in
restoring peace to the Great Lakes region and other areas on the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi made the comments at a regional summit in Tripoli
Tuesday which brought together leaders from Uganda, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan and Eritrea, the Ugandan
President's Office said in a press release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader was quoted as saying that their meeting
demonstrated the leaders are determined to consolidate the peace
process in the region as consolidated by the signing of the Lusaka
Peace Agreement aimed at bringing peace to the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi called for full implementation of the agreement and
paid tribute to Zambian President Frederick Chiluba for his
unwavering commitment to the restoration of peace in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader also commended Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and his Sudanese counterpart for signing the Nairobi
peace agreement thereby committing themselves to the normalization
of relations and easing of tension between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
At the regional summit, Gaddafi appealed to Ethiopia and
Eritrea to stop their 19-month conflict and re-establish a stable
and normal relationship.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the regional leaders in Tripoli was hailed as a
sign of goodwill and of their confidence in Libya and showed their
commitment to peace and conflict resolution in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit is expected to find practical solutions to
conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi has been very active in mediating between belligerent
countries on the continent.  He has contributed a lot to the
peace restoration process in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, under the mediation of Gaddafi, Museveni and DRC
President Laurent Kabila signed an agreement in Sirte, Libya,
giving fresh impetus to the sluggish peace process in the third
largest African country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Visit Nigeria Next Year: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
directed a construction company to rehabilitate the country's
International Conference Center in capital Abuja for the expected
visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton next year, the Guardian
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Julius Berger Company, a German contractor with long
establishment in Nigeria, said that it would immediately begin
work on the center to convert some of its facilities into a
banquet hall with all necessary facilities for the proposed visit.
</P>
<P>
Although the company did not indicate the time of the proposed
visit, the News Agency of Nigeria reported that Clinton would
honor an invitation from Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo who
paid a state visit to the U.S. this year.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the management of the Sheraton
Hotels and Towers in Abuja was also preparing to embark on a major
rehabilitation work to meet with U.S. requirements, apparently in
connection with the visit.
</P>
<P>
Americans always prefer to use Sheraton Hotel facilities
wherever these exist in the world and Nigeria will not be an
exception during their president's visit, the sources were quoted
as saying.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Yobe State to Ban Prostitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Prostitution will be banned in
Nigeria's Yobe State in the new millennium as the state assembly
has adopted a resolution ordering prostitutes to reform, get
married or leave the state by December 31.
</P>
<P>
In the past seven days, no fewer than 40 prostitutes in
Damaturu city had either left for their states of origin or
neighboring areas, the Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Similar exodus has been reported in other cities in the state.
</P>
<P>
The House of Assembly of Yobe on December 14 adopted a
resolution calling on the governor to ban prostitution and sale of
liquor on or before December 31.
</P>
<P>
The move of the assembly has been hailed because it might be
instrumental to do away with the vices.
</P>
<P>
However, some liquor dealers said the December 31 deadline for
the revocation of liquor licenses was too short.

<HEADLINE> New Study Reevaluates E-Commerce's Size, Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 21 (Xinhua) -- One-fourth of all U.S.
business-to-business purchasing will be done on-line by 2003,
according to a new study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Between 1998 and 2003, U.S. business-to-business e-commerce
will grow by 33 percent per year and reach 2.8 trillion U.S.
dollars in transaction value, according to the study conducted by
the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a management consulting firm
widely regarded as a global leader in business strategy and e-
commerce.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, BCG said, U.S. business-to-business e-commerce was 671
billion dollars, comprising 92 billion dollars in Internet-based
transactions and 579 billion dollars in transactions using
electronic data interchange (EDI) over private networks. By 2003,
the transaction value of business-to-business e-commerce over the
Internet will be two trillion dollars, and an additional 780
billion dollars in purchases will be made over private networks
using EDI.
</P>
<P>
BCG's definition of business-to-business e-commerce include EDI
over proprietary networks, EDI over the Internet, and pure
Internet transactions to arrive at total market size estimates.
</P>
<P>
Internet activities, such as information gathering that
influences off-line purchases, were not included. Non-sales
related transactions, such as e-mail exchanges of proposed product
specifications and drawings, are important business facilitators,
but do not result directly in a commercial transaction.
</P>
<P>
BCG's estimates also exclude purchases of financial capital,
labor and benefits such as health insurance, all of which are
migrating on-line.
</P>
<P>
While business-to-business e-commerce is a global phenomenon,
BCG said, the North American market currently dominates. The 700-
billion-dollar North American market is twice the size of business-
to-business e-commerce in the rest of the world combined, which is
330 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In western Europe, which lags 18 months behind North America in
business-to-business e-commerce adoption, several countries have
accelerated their e-commerce investment and will significantly
close this gap.
</P>
<P>
Asia and Latin America remain further behind. But BCG said this
could change rapidly as global supply chains go on-line.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, over 65 percent of all business-to-
business e-commerce will be made by six sectors by 2003: retail,
motor vehicles, shipping, industrial equipment, high technologies
and government.

<HEADLINE> Delta Air Lines Orders 5 Boeing Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the world's
largest airplane maker, on Tuesday confirmed an order of five
jetliners from Delta Air Lines, according to the reports from the
company.
</P>
<P>
The order, part of a recently announced package of 163 orders
to "unidentified customers", comprises three single-aisle 737-800s
planes and two twin-engine 757-200s, the company said, adding that
deliveries are scheduled to begin in January, 2001 and continue
through May, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said last week it had sold 163 aircraft to unidentified
buyers, a claim that Airbus described as implausible.
</P>
<P>
Airbus's published 1999 order book had been twice Boeing's
before the U.S. company said it would now adopt the Airbus policy
of counting orders to customers that did not want to be identified.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Trade Deficit Drops to Lowest Level Since 1993 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's trade deficit in the
first 11 months of this year registered the lowest level compared
with the same periods since 1993 due to the gradual rise in exports
and drastic fall in imports.
</P>
<P>
In the period, exports rose to 630 million U.S. dollars, up by 6
percent from 594 million dollars in the same period of 1998, and
imports fell by 13.7 percent to a record five-year low of 5.7
billion dollars, the Daily Star newspaper reported Wednesday
</P>
<P>
As a result, the trade deficit dropped by 16 percent to 5.05
billion dollars, down from 5.86 billion dollars in the same period
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall in imports, customs revenues rose to 1.3
billion dollars, a jump of 4 percent over last year's figure of 1.
25 billion dollars, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
From January to November of 1999, Lebanon's fuel bill rose to
443 million dollars, compared to 416 million dollars for the whole
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Precious metals and jewelery, worth 86 million dollars,
maintained its top position on the country's export list, taking a
13.7 percent share of total exports.
</P>
<P>
Chemicals, valued at 75 million dollars, took the second
position with a 11.9 percent share. This left base metals amounting
to 71 million dollars and 11.3 percent of the total in third place.
</P>
<P>
In imports, machinery and mechanical appliances worth 834
million dollars, 14.7 percent of total imports, led the way.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by vehicles worth 561 million dollars and
mineral products equaling 551 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reconsiders Arms Talks with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 22 (Xinhua)-- Israel is reconsidering to
give a positive response to an Egyptian proposal to open a "quiet
dialogue" on arms control, to be held with the support of the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue will be a substitute for a renewal of the
multilateral talks on arms control and regional security, which
were frozen more than four years ago over disputes between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in Jerusalem said Israel has no intention of
discussing regional nuclear disarmament at this stage, as the
Egyptians are demanding, the local daily Haaretz reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, Israel will present its traditional position
at the talks, that nuclear issues will only be discussed after "a
long procession" of confidence-building measures, the creation of a
framework for regional cooperation, and a disarmament of
conventional, chemical and ballistic weapons.
</P>
<P>
The official added that Israel "has no cause to remain deaf and
avoid discussing the issue of regional security," and claimed that
the Egyptians have softened their position of late and are now
speaking of regional security in a broader sense and not just in
regard to nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian proposal initially met with an Israeli rejection
when first raised several month ago. The rejection was a response
to Egypt's refusal to renew the multilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
But in the wake of the recent breakthrough in Israeli-Syrian
peace talks, Egypt and the U.S. declared the renewal of the talks,
at which point the U.S.appealed to Israel to reconsider the
Egyptian proposal.

<HEADLINE> Large Turkish Military Delegation to Visit Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 22 (Xinhua)-- A large delegation of Turkish
generals and defense officials is scheduled to visit Israel next
week to participate in the biannual strategic talks between Israel
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Chief of General Staff Gen. Edit Baser will lead
the Turkish delegation of about 30 senior defense officials and
defense industry executives to the talks.
</P>
<P>
While Amos Yaron, the newly-appointed Director-General of the
Israeli Defense Ministry, is expected to chair the talks, the local
daily Jerusalem Post quoted Turkish and Israeli sources as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which will start next Monday at the Defense Ministry
in Tel Aviv, are expected to focus on the Israeli-Syrian peace
process and its effect on Turkey and military cooperation between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
On military cooperations, Israel is expected to push the Turks
on the Israeli offer to sell Turkey attack helicopters in a joint
venture with the Russian firm Kamanov.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also expected to raise the matter of upgrading the
Turkish army's fleet of M60-A3 battle tanks, a program valued at
about one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has planned to produce 3,000 new main battle tanks, but
has now cut that down to about 1,000 due to expenses incurred by
recent earthquakes.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 22 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Tuesday night held
secret talks about the latest developments on the Palestinian and
Syrian peace tracks in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, Barak's chief of staff
Danny Yatom and chief negotiator Oded Eran also attended the talks,
while Arafat was accompanied by his deputy Mahmoud Abbas and chief
negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo.
</P>
<P>
The two sides did not give details about the meeting, but an
informed source said the talks lasted about three hours, at which
Barak briefed Arafat about the Israeli-Syrian peace talks and tried
to ease the Palestinian concerns regarding movement on the Syrian
track coming at the expense of the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on the difficulties faced in the
final-status talks, such as the settlement, and ways to overcome
them with a view reaching a framework agreement on the final-status
talks by February as originally envisioned, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat signed the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal in Egypt
early September, which asks them to reach a framework agreement on
final-status by next February and a final peace treaty by September
the same year.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating teams from the two sides so far have held 11
sessions, but the talks were held up due to Israel's continuation
of settlement expansion activities.
</P>
<P>
This was the third secret meeting held between Barak and Arafat.
The previous two were held on November 14 and September 17 inside
Israel.

</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- All banks in Uganda will
remain closed from December 31 to January 3 of 2000 to avoid
possible Y2K-related failures.
</P>
<P>
The precaution measure was announced by the Bank of Uganda's
Spokesman Walugembe Musoke Tuesday, according to a Monitor daily
report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
 January 3 of 2000 is meant to ensure that by the time the
banks reopen for business, everything is okay. Otherwise if there
is any problem they can rectify it then, Musoke was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
 Uganda Bankers' Association had already run advertisement
warning customers of the closures, the report said, adding that
the holiday would not apply to bank staff and that they would
work fully but not serve customers.
</P>
<P>
 The banking system recently launched a Y2K exercise drill and
proved that the whole system is wholly Y2K compliant. The
decision of closing banks during the turn of the century shows
the national Y2K task force is not so confident of its work.
</P>
<P>
 Uganda has nearly 30 commercial banks, most of which are
based in the capital city of Kampala.

<HEADLINE> New Poll Shows Y2K Confidence Rising in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A new national poll
released Tuesday by the Air Transport Association (ATA) of the
United States shows that the general public in the country is
gaining confidence in the airline industry's Y2K efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to ATA, only 14 percent of those polled believed that
the Y2K computer bug would cause major problems -- a dramatic drop
from the 48 percent response when the same question was posed in
June 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 83 percent said that they had a "great deal"
or a "fair amount" of confidence in the major airline companies'
readiness for Y2K and in their ability to handle any Y2K computer-
related problems.
</P>
<P>
The poll asked interviewees whether or not they had changed
their plans to avoid flying on or around January 1, 2000. Less
than seven percent said they had changed their plans because of Y2
K fears and only two percent said they planned to avoid flying on
December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted between December 13 and 15, sampled 800
American adults nationally.
</P>
<P>
Last week, ATA said that a record of 34.2 million Americans
would travel by air over the two and one-half week holiday period.
On January 1, 2000, 1.3 million travelers are expected.
</P>
<P>
ATA, the U.S. airline industry's trade association, has been
coordinating a project to help the commercial aviation industry in
the U.S. and Canada prepare for the year 2000. With a budget of 16
million dollars, the project has worked with 102 airlines, more
than 500 airports, air traffic control systems and hundreds of
suppliers and manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> China Amends Regulations to Allow Foreign Telecom Firms in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China is amending certain
regulations in the telecom sector in accordance with the rules of
the WTO, said Wu Jichuan, the Minister of Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
China will also make sure that irregularities in telecom
businesses involving foreign participants be properly dealt with,
said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Under the present telecom regulations, foreign companies are
not allowed to run telecom businesses. However, some companies
have ignored these regulations.
</P>
<P>
"Violations of rules governing participation of foreign
companies in ISP (Internet Service Provider) and ICP (Internet
Content Provider) services must be rectified," Wu said, adding
that resolving the problem will help foreign investors compete on
an equal footing after China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Supervising the internet market is very complicated, and rules
should be worked out in accordance with the guideline of "taking
advantages and correcting malpractices to promote development", Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
Work involves differentiating ordinary telecom services from
those value-added services under the surveillance of the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Wu also noted that foreign companies are still required to
obtain approvals and licenses from the Chinese government to
invest in Telecom businesses after China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"This is common practice all over the world," he said. "We are
now improving related rules and regulations according to
international standards."
</P>
<P>
Wu reiterated the ministry's stance on a "China-China-Foreign"
venture, a malpractice of China United Telecommunication
Corporation in raising fund, and urged both parties to settle the
problem as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that China's entry into the WTO will
help telecom companies in China establish modern enterprise
systems as well as utilize foreign funds and expertise. "It is
both a challenge and opportunity for China's telecom industry."

standing at 73.25 shillings to one dollar on Wednesday morning,
following the International Monetary Fund (IMF) decided to resume

</P>
<P>
The Kenyan currency went up to 73.91 shillings during the week
ending Tuesday from 74.59 shillings in the previous week, the East
African Standard newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Against other major currencies, the Kenyan currency rose to

<HEADLINE> China to Optimize Structure of Machinery Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China will push to optimize
the structure of its machinery industry by promoting technical
upgrading and finely-tune its competitive edge, a senior official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaohua, director of the State Administration of Machinery
Industry (SAMI), said that China will also eliminate dual
construction and out-dated productions.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, much of China's machinery industry is poorly
run, resulting in a sharp decline of economic returns for
manufacturers. The glut of machinery products may last a long
period. This means that the machinery industry will steadily
develop rather than increase rapidly as it has down in the past.
</P>
<P>
China's machinery industry consists of 14 sectors, with more
than 40,000 manufacturers turning out 60,000-strong products. SAMI
will support leading manufacturers in key industries and help some
50 giant companies.
</P>
<P>
SAMI will remove energy costing and heavily polluted products.
Factories manufacturing these products will become a thing of the
past to make room for key enterprises in China.

museum in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The museum will undergo a one-year period for installing

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM on Economic Mission to Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing visit to Baghdad by
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib was strictly an
economic mission and is not aimed at persuading Iraq to join the
Middle East peace process, Jordanian officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Khatib arrived in Baghdad Tuesday night from the 1200-kilometer-
long Amman-Baghdad highway, the only land exit for Iraq due to the
no-fly zones imposed by the United States and Britain after the
1991 Gulf War which was triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The two-day visit, the first by a Jordanian foreign minister
since the 1991 Gulf War, is aimed at boosting bilateral trade and
resolving differences over renewing an oil protocol between the two
countries, said Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Majali on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khatib is also expected to deliver a message from King Abdullah
Bin Hussein to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The visit is purely economic in nature, and Khatib is expected
to convince the Iraqi side to renew the oil protocol, enhance trade
with Jordan and to discuss bilateral ties as well, said Majali, who
is also the information minister.
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomats in Amman denied that Washington had asked Amman
to use Khatib's visit to convince Iraq to take part in the peace
process in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Khatib is expected to meet his Iraqi counterpart Mohammad Said
al-Sahaf and other Iraqi officials for the renewal of the 500-
million-U.S.-dollar annual oil protocol between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, Iraq has been providing crude oil and oil
products to the kingdom within the framework of the U.N. oil-for-
food program.
</P>
<P>
Iraq provides some 75,000 barrels of crude oil and oil products
to the kingdom everyday.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraqi and Jordanian officials failed to renew the
protocol earlier this month due to price differences.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said Iraq is asking for 19 dollars a barrel for
the oil it sold to Amman, and the latter said it can only pay 15
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan depends on Iraq for oil supplies after Saudi Arabia cut
off its oil supplies to the kingdom after the 1990 Gulf crisis, for
which Jordan was isolated by Arab countries for its siding with
Iraq after President Saddam's troops stormed into Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan is mending ties with Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and
other Gulf states which were damaged by the Gulf war, while it is
also trying to keep its friendly ties with Iraq, its only oil
supplier.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Falcon Poachers Caught in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Police caught two foreign
falcon poachers recently in a county in northwest China's Qinghai
Province and set free the two falcons free back into the forests.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, the two foreign poachers were from
an unspecified country neighboring China, to which they were later
sent back.
</P>
<P>
The falcon is a rare wild bird under class two state protection,
and because one falcon may eat as many as 2,000 rats a year, it
plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
There are many falcons in Qilian County along the Qilian
Mountain Range in Qinghai, and they attract greedy Chinese and
foreign poachers seeking huge profits by smuggling the birds to
countries in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Local police have caught dozens of falcon poachers this year in
their efforts to combat poaching.

LOS ANGELES, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Boeing Corp.
employees are back at work Tuesday afternoon after they were
evacuated from the facility following a bomb threat, according to
a report from the company.
</P>
<P>
A bomb squad searched the premises after the threat was issued,
but didn't find anything. Most of the workers were on their lunch
break at the time, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokeswoman Debbie Nomaguchi said a search of the
factory turned up no evidence of a bomb and workers at the plant
were allowed back into the building about two hours after the
company received an anonymous threat to explode a bomb in the
sprawling building.
</P>
<P>
The bomb threat came amid heightened security in Washington
state following the arrest on Friday of Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian-
born man residing in Montreal who allegedly tried to bring bomb-
making materials into the United States from Canada.
</P>
<P>
Ressam was scheduled to be arraigned in Seattle on Wednesday.
Officials have said he may have had accomplices in a suspected
year 2000-related bomb plot. Customs agents have tightened
security along the 4,800-kilometer U.S.-Canadian border.

<HEADLINE> 35 Pct Job-hunters Not Use Govt Agencies in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- More than one-third of
unemployed people in Australia are now choosing not to use
government agencies in their hunt for a job, a survey released on
Wednesday showed.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey on the
experiences of job seekers found only 65 percent of the unemployed
were registered with the government services provider Centrelink.
</P>
<P>
This continued a steady decline in registration with the
Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) or Centrelink from a high of
83 percent in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
Of the unemployed looking for full-time work, about three in
four were registered with Centrelink, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that most common active step taken by
those looking for part-time work was contacting prospective
employers without registering with Centrelink.
</P>
<P>
Being considered too young or too old by employers was the most
commonly reported difficulty for job hunters, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
Unemployed people reportedly being considered too young or too
old by employers were generally long-term jobless, with an average
period out of work of 52 weeks, it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
on Tuesday issued another warning of "terrorist" attacks on U.S.
citizens worldwide during the New Year celebration period.
</P>
<P>
In a public announcement, the State Department said it believes
that "terrorists may be planning to conduct attacks including
against official and non-official Americans, in and around the New
Year period with particular emphasis on locations where large
groups of people may congregate for millennial or religious
festivities."
</P>
<P>
Eleven suspects were arrested in Jordan last week. The State
Department said that investigation results show that possible
sites that are attacked in Jordan include hotels, tour buses and
tourist sites.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot rule out the possibility that attacks still may be
planned for this and other parts of the world," the announcement
said.
</P>
<P>
American citizens overseas during the period are urged to
review their security practices, to remain vigilant to their
surroundings and to exercise caution, according to the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
"American citizens should avoid large crowds and gatherings,
keep a low profile, and vary routes and times of all required
travels," it said.
</P>
<P>
The State Department issued a similar announcement on December
11. The new announcement, which will expire on March 9, 2000, said

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Fails to Announce Official Results of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican National
Elections Commission has failed to announce definitive results of
the December 3-5 presidential and parliamentary elections by the
Monday deadline.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the delay of the announcement was not known.
</P>
<P>
But watchers of the polls believe that Wednesday is a likely
date for the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Jamisse Taimo, chairman of the electoral commission, told a
press conference that his commission "is continuing to work so
that the final results of the Mozambican general elections may be
publicly known" soon.
</P>
<P>
He asked the political parties and the public to understand
that the electoral commission needs "more time to do its job
meticulously."
</P>
<P>
The commission is currently verifying purported invalid votes
and problematic polling station notices from Nampula, the largest
of the 11 provincial constituencies, which was last to declare its
preliminary results.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican non-governmental organizations who observed the
general elections have agreed with international observers, such
as those from the European Union and the American Carter Center,
that the elections were free and fair.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo), main
opposition party of the country, last Saturday called for new
elections in the beginning of the year 2000 under the direct
supervision of the international community, the Mozambique News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Renamo demanded that the National Elections Commission
declare the December 3-5 general elections null and void, unless
it announces Renamo's victory.
</P>
<P>
Raul Domingos, head of the Renamo group in the outgoing
parliament, was quoted as saying that the election process had
been rigged from the outset in favor of the ruling Mozambique
Liberation Front Party (Frelimo).

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Backs Easing of Abortion Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark is backing a law change to make it easier for women to
have abortions.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post Wednesday quoted the prime minister as saying
that she tried in 1989 as health minister to amend the law to
allow doctors to decide on abortions rather than women having to
go to certified consultants.
</P>
<P>
Clark said so in response to a latest call of the NZ Abortion
Supervisory Committee for a relaxation of the law. The committee
wants the law changed so all doctors can authorize abortions.
</P>
<P>
Placing abortions under criminal law has prevented them
becoming an integral part of women's health services, it said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Justice Minister Phil Goff will recommend to the
Cabinet that there be a review of the Contraception, Sterilization
and Abortion Act 1977, which, he said, has failed, as the annual
abortions in the country have nearly trebled to more than 15,000
since 1980, according to the Wellington-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the issue will be a conscience vote for MPs
if a law goes before the Parliament, and it is unclear whether
there will be majority support for a change.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: US Ambassador Seeks Consensus Between Bangladeshi Gov't and Opposition  (by Pan Xiaozhu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Any initiative taken by the president for making a consensus
among the political parties will help bringing about political
stability which is necessary for economic development of the
country," he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy called on President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed
here and expressed his concern at the "confrontational politics"
between the government and the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin thanked the ambassador for his keen
interest in the economic development of Bangladesh and expressed
the hope that consensus on major political issues will be quite
possible.
</P>
<P>
The donor countries that take part in the Bangladesh Aid
Consortium Meeting in Paris had two important meetings with Begum
Khaleda Zia, the leader of the opposition, on March 25 and Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina on April 4. The two Bangladeshi leaders
explained their respective position.
</P>
<P>
The donors were not much encouraged by the strident attitude of
the ruling Awami League and the main opposition the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP), they kept pressure on the conflicting
sides.
</P>
<P>
The donors sought appointment with the president, but the
meeting could not take place as the prime minister in her remarks
to the press said there was no need for the president to get
involved in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury Monday sent a letter to
Khaleda Zia, formally requesting her to join the forthcoming
parliament session and break their boycott.
</P>
<P>
The speaker explained the importance of the coming session in
the letter, urging Khaleda Zia to attend the session scheduled to
begin on January 1, the first day of the millennium, "in greater
national interest". But the BNP's approach remains negative.
</P>
<P>
There is no room for joining the parliament unless the
opposition's conditions are fulfilled in order to make the
parliament effective, BNP Acting Secretary-General Abdullah Al
Noman told the press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the opposition has no option but to go
for intensifying street agitation as the ruling party resorts to
repressive measures to eliminate its political opponents.
</P>
<P>
As a part of a program to build up a relentless anti-government
united movement across the country, a process is underway to form
an action committee at the grassroots level of the like-minded
political parties, the BNP leader pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We are forced to take such stand following undemocratic and
anti-national activities of the ruling Awami League," he said.
</P>
<P>
Any negotiation across the table can only take place if the
Awami League agrees in principle to step down for an early general
election under a caretaker government, he asserted.

 In the first phase of the project, the port city plans to
build a 107-kilometers canal linking rivers in the north with
those in the south. The project is scheduled to be completed next
year.

<P>
DALIAN, China, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China's defender Sun
Jihai has been banned for one year from international matches for
head-butting an assistant referee in an Olympic qualifying match
in October, his club Dalian Wanda said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The club said in the statement that they were notified by the
international soccer's governing body FIFA, who said the ban
started on December 17, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The former Crystal Palace player was also banned for one month
from taking part in any match in China, which means that the
national defender will miss several league matches, the club said.
</P>
<P>
Li Jisan, Managing Director of Wanda, told Xinhua that his club
will not appeal the ban.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said Sun hit the assistant referee with his head after the

final whistle in the October 3 match against South Korea in Seoul.
The hosts won 1-0.
</P>
<P>
After the failure to qualify for the 2000 Olympic Games in
Sydney, the Chinese Football Association fired the head coach
Bobby Houghton of Britain last week.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion O'Neill May Continue after Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Olympic swimming
champion Susan O'Neill is considering shelving her retirement
plans in an aim to improve the elusive world record that has
haunted her for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old, the reigning Olympic and world champion for
200 meters butterfly, said on Wednesday that she might keep going
after the Sydney Olympic Games in a last-ditch bid to break Mary T.
Meagher's 18-year-old world record of two minutes 05.96 seconds.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill has not been beaten in her pet event since she finished
third behind two Chinese at the 1994 world championships in Rome
but has been thwarted in her attempts to beat Meagher's magical
time, the oldest world record on swimming's books.
</P>
<P>
The Australian says she does not expect to break the record at
next year's Olympics because of the high expectation of winning
gold.
</P>
<P>
She will be in heavy training in the lead-up to the Games,
swimming up to 70 kilometers a week, but says she may be tempted
to postpone her retirement so she can have a shot at the record in
early 2001 when the pressure is off.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said: "You know, the Olympics are in September and
January's pretty close after that and I could do it at the state
titles."

<P>
JINAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of 56 ethnic
groups from across China will gather at the peak of Mount Taishan
in the wee hours of January 1 to await the first rays of sunlight
to beam down on the famed tourist spot.
</P>
<P>
At midnight on December 31, the group, along with a group of 10,
000 selected mountaineering fans will begin their climb of the
mountain at the Daizong Memorial Archway, one of the three routes
leading to the summit of Mount Taishan, a symbol of grandeur to
the Chinese.

<P>
Just before dawn, the climbers are scheduled to reach the
mountaintop and sing a song composed to herald the new century
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
Other millennial celebrations to be held at the peak of Mount
Taishan include the burning of millennial sacred firewood
collected at the site of the Neolithic Dawenkou Culture in the
province, which dates back some 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of college and university students clad in
golden robes also will scale the mountain and scatter to form the
shape of a dragon stretching from the foot of the mountain to the
peak.
</P>
<P>
All these events will be broadcast live from the CCTV and other
Chinese TV stations to a worldwide audience.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bank Postpones 500-Million-Dollar Loan to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank
Tuesday decided to postpone a loan of 500 million U.S. dollars to
Russia's oil industry at the request of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the end of a board meeting of the bank
after receiving a letter from Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on the matter.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the bank said Albright's letter contains "a
determination that it would be in the national interest and
clearly and importantly advance U.S. policy in Russia for Ex-Im
Bank not to approve, for the time being, financing for two
transactions in Russia."
</P>
<P>
"The Ex-Im Bank board of directors acted in accordance with the
secretary's determination," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The loans would have supported the sale of U.S.-made oil and
gas equipment, and technical services to be provided by
Halliburton Co., Dallas, Texas, and ABB, Stamford, Conn., and 23
other U.S. companies to the Tyumen Oil Co., Russia.
</P>
<P>
The transaction was preliminarily approved by the bank board in
May and June of 1999.
</P>

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. administration on Tuesday decided to
postpone a loan guarantee of 500 million U.S. dollars for Russia's
oil industry as a punishment on Moscow for its operation in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sent a letter
telling the Export Import Bank to "not approve for the time being"
the loan guarantee for Tyumen Oil Corporation because it would not
be in the U.S. national interest.
</P>
<P>
The administration has been urged to block the funding for the
loan guarantees being considered by the U.S. Export-Import Bank
for Russia's Tyumen Oil to protest Russia's operation in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> DCR Raises Hong Kong's Outlook from Negative to Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Duff &AMP; Phelps Credit
Rating Co. (DCR), a leading U.S.-based global rating agency, has
revised its rating outlook on the sovereign ratings of Hong Kong
to stable from negative.
</P>
<P>
DCR currently rates Hong Kong's foreign and local currency
obligations "A" and "A+", respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook change reflects Hong Kong's resilience amid
volatile economic conditions in Asia," DCR said Tuesday in a
report. "The recovery in Hong Kong's trade and domestic economy is
well under way and demonstrates this resilience."
</P>
<P>
After registering a negative export growth of 7.4 percent in
1998, Hong Kong's exports started showing positive growth in
recent months and should end the year close to 1998 levels, DCR
said.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, Hong Kong's trade will keep improving because of the
rebound in China's exports and a step-up in intra-regional trade,
DCR expects.
</P>
<P>
The medium-term impact of China's entry into the WTO would also
be positive for trade and trade-related services provided by Hong
Kong, DCR added.
</P>
<P>
The rating agency affirmed Hong Kong's policy response to the
external shocks since mid-1997, such as the government
intervention in the equity markets in 1998 to counter speculation.
</P>
<P>
It said that Hong Kong's fiscal deficit is expected to be 1.5
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the fiscal year ending
March 2000, down from an earlier estimate of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that the ongoing financial sector reform
will bolster the competitiveness of Hong Kong's highly capitalized
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Having weathered an economic decline of more than 5 percent in
1998, Hong Kong banks now keep non-performing loans at around 10
percent of total loans, DCR said.
</P>
<P>
The stable outlook also reflects the region's improving
economic environment underpinned by decline in interest rates,
rebound in equity prices, stabilization in property prices,
positive growth in retail sales volume and lower pressures on the
Hong Kong dollar, DCR said.

<HEADLINE> Wider Use of Robots in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- As China's robotics industry
continues to flourish, more and more Chinese industries are using
robots to pump up production, a scientist has said.
</P>
<P>
 Robots developed by the Shenyang Automation Research
Institute (SARI), known as the birthplace of China's robots, are
now widely popular in auto, motorcycle, engineering, mechanics,
electronics and other industries, said Wang Tianran, director of
the institute.
</P>
<P>
Wang said robots created by SARI, which is under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, have taken one third of China's market shares.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, various companies signed contracts worth 200
million yuan (about 24 million U.S. dollars) with SARI, based in
Shenyang, the capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
SARI has won 18 top prizes in robotics research. The country's
first submergible robot was made at the institute in 1985, and it
now can make robots capable of exploring deep sea areas with
depths of up to 6,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Chinese enterprises have discovered
the value of robots which can work in special environments such as
those full of dust, toxic gas, noise or under water.
</P>
<P>
SARI's robots have been purchased by such companies as
Shenyang Jinbei, Guangzhou Sanshui and Shanghai Huizhong, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
Findings from a survey of 12 enterprises which started to use
robots from 1995 show that the devices are responsible for an
additional output value of 8.5 billion yuan (about one billion U.S.
dollars).

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Dengfeng City in central
China's Henan Province, where the famed Shaolin Temple is located,
now is the country's largest training base for students of
traditional Chinese martial arts.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 10,000 Chinese martial arts
practitioners studying in Dengfeng's 30 special schools and
training centers. Over the past 20 years, the schools have trained
250,000 people from at home and abroad, both professionals and
amateurs.
</P>
<P>
Dengfeng was backward and remote until the Shaolin Temple was
brought to the world in a movie with the same name in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tourists visit the temple every year to see the
Shaolin style of martial arts or to practice the exacting and
strenuous skills for themselves. The local government has invited
monks from the temple to give martial arts demonstrations and to
be coaches for the novices.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city has also opened many martial arts courses in
primary and middle schools to introduce traditional culture to
young people and help them keep fit. So far, 50,000 students in
the city have participated in the training program.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has hosted six international Shaolin
martial arts festivals since 1991, attracting 20,000 fans
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Martial arts professionals from Dengfeng have won a total of 1,
500 medals, the most for any Chinese city, in domestic and
international sports competitions.

<HEADLINE> Oversupply of Housing Being Slashed in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The oversupply of housing is
being reduced in south China's Hainan Province which has been
severely hit by the real estate market bubble.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, more than seven million sq m of open-
market housing remains unsold in the province, causing the
stagnation of well over 40 billion yuan in bank loans.
</P>
<P>
To tide over this crisis, various measures have been tried to
help market the unsold housing in this southernmost Chinese
province, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
In the provincial capital of Haikou, it recently sold 1,350
open-market apartments at fixed prices. These flats, with a total
floor space of 125,000 sq m, were just part of the first 200,000
sq m unsold open-market apartments Haikou has prepared for sale as
low-cost but practical housing.
</P>
<P>
Like other areas of Hainan, Haikou has also been hit hard by a
bloated real estate industry. By late 1998, some 2.64 million sq
m of open-market housing had remain unsold, including 1.53 million
sq m of residential apartments, of which, 800,000 sq m can be
treated and sold as low-cost housing.
</P>
<P>
To spur sales of the stockpiled open-market apartments, in late
October the city published a provisional regulation offering a
range of preferential policies to real estate developers if they
sell their unsold flats as low-cost apartments and at lower fixed
prices. These preferential policies include exemption from
related taxes and rebates for land use right fees.
</P>
<P>
At the Hainan Provincial Economic Trade Talks and Haikou
Investment Promotion Week held late month, a large hall was given
exclusively for real estate transactions. During the fair, 160,
000 sq m of open-market housing were sold, and the volume of
business was 260 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Haikou city government published a list
of real estate projects inviting domestic and overseas investment
during a special press conference in Beijing. The city will soon
prepare another 200,000 sq m of open-market housing for sale as
low-cost apartments.
</P>
<P>
In a related case, the city of Sanya on the southern tip of
Hainan, has confiscated 480 hectares of idle land which was
previously bought for real estate development, accounting for half
of all the idle land in Sanya.

<HEADLINE> Piracy Harms Software Sales in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Software piracy caused 637.
6 million U.S. dollars of losses to software producers in Brazil,
Mexico and Argentina in 1998, Richard E. Neff, juridical counsel
of the Business Software Alliance (BSA) firm for the region, said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three countries registered the biggest sale of packaged
pirated software in Latin America, with Puerto Rico reporting the
smallest number of software piracy, Neff said.
</P>
<P>
He said software piracy had caused losses in sales of packaged
software worth 366.7 million dollars in Brazil, 147.1 million
dollars in Mexico, and 123.8 million dollars in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, sales of pirated software accounted for 62 percent of
the total in Brazil, 59 percent in Mexico, 53 percent in Chile,
and 49 percent in Puerto Rico, Neff added.
</P>
<P>
Citing the case of Mexico as an example, he said the sale of
pirated software dropped from 78 percent in 1994 to 59 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
Legitimate software sales amounted to 519.57 million dollars in
Mexico last year, and the figure may reach 712.3 million dollars
in the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Software sales in 1998 yielded 185 million dollars in taxes,
which will grow to 253 million dollars in 2002, said the BSA
juridical counsel.
</P>
<P>
The BSA represents many software firms, such as Adobe Systems,
Apple Computer, Autodesk, Bentley Systems, Lotus Development,
Microsoft, Novell, Symantec, Compaq, Digital Equipment, IBM, Intel
Sybase, and Computer Associates.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Africa to Usher in 21st Century With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- As the clock is ticking to the
dawn of the new century, Africa, the least developed continent on
the earth, vows to speed up its development in the long march to
catch up with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
While the outgoing 20th century is often described as "a
century of Africa's liberation and independence", the new
millennium can surely bring fresh hope and opportunity to the
backward continent which, like elsewhere, also has huge potentials
for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At present, the social development and economic recovery in
many parts of the continent are still hindered by some major
problems left over mainly from the colonial age.
</P>
<P>
One third of sub-Saharan countries are involved in civil
unrest, bilateral conflicts or regional wars. As a result, more
than half of Africans are still living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
However, African leaders have come to realize that the
continent can not afford to remain one of perpetual insecurity and
instability.
</P>
<P>
They share a unanimous view that peace and development are,
more than ever, two things that Africans have been yearning for,
as it was demonstrated in a declaration issued at the end of the
35th summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in
July.
</P>
<P>
This important meeting, attended by 46 African heads of state
and government, was undoubtedly aimed at making full preparations
for the African continent entering the new century.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo called on
leaders of African countries in his keynote speech to make "2000 a
year of peace and security in Africa," stressing that "Africa's
reputation as a continent at war against itself must be arrested."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo himself was elected as President of the Fourth
Republic of Nigeria and sworn in on May 29, an eye-catching event
of this year which has brought an end to the 16 years of
uninterrupted military rule in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
It is also encouraging to see in the year that African leaders,
"through concerted and collective efforts", succeeded in bringing
all players involved in the conflict of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) -- which had sucked in five other African
countries -- and the two warring sides of Sierra Leone to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Both the peace agreements, one for the DRC signed in Zambian
capital Lusaka on July 10 and the other for Sierra Leone signed in
Togolese capital Lome on July 7, show that "where there is
determination and persistence, there is a solution to the crisis,"
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said.
</P>
<P>
"They should encourage us to work even harder in order to
address the other hotbeds of tension which are still prevailing on
the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid and solve conflicts, the 53-member OAU and other
sub-regional bodies have adopted a series of measures and set up a
mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution,
which are meant to seek home-grown solutions.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the 16-member Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) approved the establishment of such a mechanism at
its 22nd summit which ended on December 10 in Lome.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism includes a Mediation and Security Council, a
multi- national stand-by force, and four Zonal Observation bureaux
to monitor and deal with potential conflicts in the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese White Dolphin Returned to Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- An injured Chinese white
dolphin, which was captured by accident in east China's Fujian
Province, has been given medical treatment and returned to the sea.
</P>
<P>
The 200-kg dolphin was found injured in a fishing net by local
fishermen at Xinghua Bay on December 15. The near-extinct Chinese
white dolphin is under top State-level protection. They can be
found in the east and south China sea areas.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen sent the dolphin back to the port, where it was
treated for wounds and then released back to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution and illegal fishing have reduced the total
population of Chinese white dolphins to only about 200.

<P>
The formal launching of such a mechanism means the ECOWAS,
which has successfully quenched war-fire in Sierra Leone and
Guinea-Bissau in the past year, is shifting from its past role as
a "fire-fighter" to a more active role of peace-builder.
</P>
<P>
All these show the strong will of the African leaders and
people to seek peace and political stability which will pave the
way for social development and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 also witnessed that African countries quickened
their steps toward economic integration and cooperation, which
will get them better prepared for economic expansion in the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
The 21 member states of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA), at its fourth summit in May, voiced
their determination and commitment to the realization of the
COMESA free trade area by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The three east African countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
in November signed a treaty for the reestablishment of the East
African Community. And the 16-member ECOWAS decided at its 22nd
summit in December to make January 1 of 2004 as the launching time
of the west Africa single monetary zone.
</P>
<P>
So far, all the existing 10 regional or sub-regional
organizations in Africa have respectively mapped out their
blueprints of integration and cooperation for the next 10 years,
which include the establishment of economic community, monetary
union, free trade area and customs union to facilitate the free
movement of goods, services, labor and capital across the borders
of member states. All these will lead to the final formation of
the African Economic Community scheduled for the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
Given the challenges of globalization and international
competition, "Africa's strength, both internally and in its
relations with the rest of the world, lies in pursuing vigorously
the goal of economic cooperation and integration," OAU
Secretary-General Salim said.
</P>
<P>
It is observed that for Africa, if the political stability and
economic integration serve the long-term interest of development
in the new century, its economic prospects will also bode well in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), Africa's economic growth rate is predicted to reach five
percent in 2000, compared with 3.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the economic power-house of the continent, is
expected to see an economic growth rate of 3.7 percent in the
first year of the new century, representing a giant leap forward
after this year's expansion of 0. 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Morocco, another two important economies in Africa,
are expected to achieve growth rates of 3.3 percent and 5.1
percent respectively in 2000, up from 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent
of this year, according to IMF prediction.
</P>
<P>
Other African countries such as Tunisia, the Sudan, Cameroon,
Cote d' Ivoire, Ghana, Rwanda and Mozambique may secure a growth
rate between four and five percent this year, and they are
expected to enjoy faster economic expansion in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The IMF report attributes the continent's faster economic
growth in the new century to the readjustment of economic
structure carried out in some African countries, apart from a
positive role that the regional economic integration will play.
</P>
<P>
All in all, Africa will lurch and march along its road of
development in the new century despite many daunting challenges it
is facing or will face.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders can feel the weight of burdens on their
shoulders more than ever before, because they need not only to
address the social, economic and political problems in their
respective countries, but also to brave the torrential wave of
globalization.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Parliament Endorses New Cabinet, Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Romanian parliament approved
late Tuesday the line-up of a government headed by new Prime
Minister Mugur Isarescu and its administrative program in a secret
ballot.
</P>
<P>
 A joint session of the parliament's two chambers endorsed
Isarescu's cabinet and its program by 305 votes to 35 in the poll,
with the largest opposition Social Democratic Party boycotting the
vote to protest against President Emil Constantinescu's "
unconstitutional" dismissal of former prime minister Radu Vasile,
the Romanian state television reported.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu, 50, is a career economist who has been leading the
central bank since 1990. His designation as premier last Thursday
ended a political crisis triggered by the removal of Vasile
earlier last week.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the last cabinet, the new one has made few
changes except that two more posts of minister of state (vice
prime minister) are added so that each of the four major parties
of the ruling coalition can hold one in the 20-minister government
led by Isarescu who is affiliated to no political parties.
</P>
<P>
The government has formed an administrative bureau composed of
the prime minister, four ministers of state and the interior
minister.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the program of the new government, Isarescu stressed
that the prime task of his government is to promote economic
reforms and improve the people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that a three-year consecutive decline in the
Romanian economy will have to be ended and a growth of 1.3 percent
be achieved by the end of the year 2000, with inflation falling by
nearly 50 percent over this year's to 25-30 percent. The financial
deficit will be kept under 3 percent of gross domestic product (
GDP).
</P>
<P>
The new government will reform the current taxation system, a
target of public criticism, to attract domestic and foreign
investment, promised the prime minister.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Raptors coach Butch Carter,
who has guided Toronto into a competitive team, was rewarded for
his efforts on Tuesday with a three-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
Carter was in the final year of a contract he signed following
1997-98 season. But the Raptors, thrilled with the team's best
ever start this season, locked up their coach through the 2002-
2003 campaign.
</P>
<P>
Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald said: "Butch has done a
tremendous job in leading the team since his first day on the job.
He stepped into a very difficult situation two seasons ago and now,
without question, he has the team pointed in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Carter had the Raptors in first place in the
Central Division earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Carter joined the Raptors as an assistant coach in October 1997
and replaced the fired Darrell Walker as head coach on February 13.
He has since compiled a 41-66 mark with the young franchise.

<HEADLINE> Serbians Doing Good Job in Rebuilding: Yugoslav Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian people have done
a good job repairing damages caused by NATO's bombs, the Yugoslav
Serb Republic Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovich said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Marjanovich put the damage estimates at 3.7 billion U.S.
dollars. But signs have manifested an improvement in the economy
and people's life thanks to the people's determined efforts to
reconstruct. he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In his report to congress, the prime minister said that among
the 136 construction projects initiated by the government
following the end of the bombing, 80 have been completed and 56
others are still in progress.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output increased 100 percent in the past eight
months, and the agricultural production this year not only meets
domestic needs but will also contribute to exports.
</P>

Referring to the economic objectives of the year 2000,
Marjanovich said the second phase of reconstruction work is of the
highest priority, while the policy of reforming and market economy
building will also be pursued.

<HEADLINE> "Green Card" Popular in China to Mark New Millennium (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- As the New Millennium's Day
approaches, many Chinese people intend to send electronic cards to
friends through the Internet rather than traditional paper cards.
</P>
<P>
Li Yi, a staff member at a Beijing-based company, has the habit
of surfing the Internet, and he now has one more thing to do --
send electronic cards to his friends. He said it only takes him
about two minutes to log-on, choose a card, fill out the forms,
select pictures, and send it.
</P>
<P>
It was much more time-consuming to mail paper cards years ago.
"I sometimes got frustrated because the cards and envelops would
cost me half a day," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma Binbin, a designer at the Art Studio of Sohu, one of China's
largest search engines (http:// www.sohu.com), told Xinhua that
his company's website is visited about six million times a day and
more than half of the visitors click the button for free
electronic cards on the web page.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that by the end of late July, about four million
Chinese people had access to the Internet and that he believes
this figure has doubled in December. "The number will continue to
rise as the government has recently cut the fees for Internet time,
and the New Millennium is coming," he added.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that 4,000 paper cards use the wood of
a full-grown tree, and a ton of paper pulp will use 15 to 16 trees
10 meters high and 20 centimeters in diameter.
</P>
<P>
Experts say, it is too much for China, a country with a huge
population of more than 1.2 billion and a tiny forested area of
less than 14 percent of its territory. They added that there is
also pollution brought about by the chemicals used in paper
production.
</P>
<P>
Ma said, "electronic cards can not only help people say hello
to each other via the Internet, but also save trees and even the
planet, so many people call the electronic card a 'green card'."

<HEADLINE> Moldovan New Government Wins Parliament Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Dumitru Braghis was sworn in
as the new Moldovan prime minister right after his new government
passed the confidence vote in the parliament on Tuesday, said
reports from the Moldovan capital of Chisinau.
</P>
<P>
A total of 57 deputies out of the 101-seat parliament voted in
favor of Braghis, five votes more than the minimum votes of 52.
The parliament of Moldova, a republic of the former Soviet Union,
had rejected two previous candidates, since the former government
of Ion Sturza resigned on November 9.
</P>
<P>
Braghis told reporters that the new government will press ahead
with reforms and European integration.
</P>
<P>
The new government will also try to resume talks with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to win their
financial support, he said. Moldova will, however, rely on its own
strength to survive the current crisis, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister said that his government will speed up
the modification of the current budget and draft another for the
year 2000 as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The new government comprises 17 members, three less than the
former one. Braghis, 42, was instructed to form the new cabinet on
December 16. He worked as economic and reform minister in the
former government.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the IMF announced it was suspending aid to Moldova
after parliament deputies failed to approve a privatization
program which it backed. Parliament then issued a vote of no-
confidence which led to the former government's resignation.

<HEADLINE> "Green Card" Popular in China to Mark New Millennium (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang Xin, a design director at Sohu, said that in order to
attract more people, especially those between 20 and 40 in age,
the free electronic cards will have a variety of styles, such as
Chinese traditional, western, classic and those designed for
Christmas and the New Millennium Day.
</P>
<P>
She said that a competition for "Green Card" design through the
Internet, the first of its kind in China, is underway at a website
called "Chinese people" (http://www.ChinaRen.com).
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, it also costs less money to send green cards.
At present, an ordinary paper card costs about two yuan (0.25 US
dollars), but an electronic card costs less than 0.2 yuan, she
added.
</P>
<P>
When Christmas and New Year's Day approached in the past, the
huge number of cards would often force post offices to announce
that they could not guarantee timely deliveries, and required
additional postage to insure quick deliveries. This year, however,
these notices have not appeared.
</P>
<P>
"Fewer people are coming here to buy cards this year, even
though they are of high quality and finely designed," said a
shopkeeper in the bustling Xidan district of Beijing. "Last year
my cards sold very well."
</P>
<P>
However, not everyone has said bye-bye to paper cards. After
buying ten cards for his family and friends, a soldier who repairs
aircraft said he did even think of using electronic cards but the
Internet is unavailable in his office and he does not own a
computer.
</P>
<P>
He thinks green cards may be good for environmental protection.
"When I can afford it, I will certainly say hello to my parents by
green card," said the young soldier who is from a remote village
in China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Zealand Ready to Greet Millennium (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand, as the first
country on the globe to welcome in the first rays of 2000, has
been intensifying preparations to greet the dawn of the new
millennium these months, as it will attract huge attention from
within New Zealand and around the world.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Millennium Office, which was established in
1998, will organize three official dawn celebrations on Pitt
Island in the Chatham Islands, which is 800 kilometers from New
Zealand's east coast, at Mt Hikurangi, a site of strong cultural
significance for Maori, and Gisborne, a city on the east coast.
The activities in the three places will open up the national and
even global millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Children will take center stage in official first down
millennium celebrations planned for the Chatham Islands, which is
composed of Chatham Island, Pitt Island and about 40 uninhabited
small islands.
</P>
<P>
The 50 people on Pitt Island and 700 people on Chatham Island
will be the first communities in the world to greet the dawn of
the new millennium and celebrations will be shown live to a
worldwide audience.
</P>
<P>
Pitt Island children will send greetings to the world from the
top of Mount Hakepa as the sun touches the first inhabited land at
5 a.m. (New Zealand Daylight Saving Time). One and a half minutes
later the children of Chatham Island will greet the sunrise with a
"Dawn Chorus" performance in dance and song in which they "gift"
birds symbolizing peace, kindness, hope and strength.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony involving Moriori, the first people to settle the
Chatham Islands, a "Beacon of Hope" will be lit. The official
midnight ceremony will be followed by a dawn vigil which
culminates in a traditional Maori welcome to the dawn performed by
a local cultural group. This group will also perform a traditional
Sunset Ceremony earlier to herald the millennium sunrise.
</P>
<P>
Following the first dawn observances, the Chathams community
will gather for a communal breakfast during which the first horse
race of the new millennium will be run.
</P>
<P>
The Chathams will host a number of millennium "first" events
including a wedding, golf tournament, beer, fishing and the first
haircut. The islands will also stage a program of local community
events from Christmas to mid January featuring concerts, movies,
races, dances, sport, fishing and a Chathams food and beer
festival.
</P>
<P>
Mt Hikurangi, 120 kilometers north of Gisborne City, will be
the first place on mainland New Zealand to welcome the dawn of the
new millennium. It is expected that the people in the area will
see the first sunrise of the new millennium at 5:40 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Because of very limited safe space to assemble on the slopes of
the mountain, only 2,500 members of the local tribe and their
invited guests including representatives of the other indigenous
peoples of the world will be allowed to attend the celebrations
there.
</P>
<P>
The cerebrations there will include: a salute to the 20th
century by commemorating the deeds of their heroes and heroines of
the past, the lighting of battery-powered helium balloon beacons
atop more than 10 mountains from Hikurangi to Titirangi in
Gisborne City, traditional call of welcome to the dawn of the new
millennium, prayers of tribute, and a performance of traditional
Maori songs, Maori war dance and traditional chants by a 500-
strong cultural group.

<P>
Gisborne, the first city on the globe to see the dawn of the
new millennium, is well underway to delivering a "stunning" dawn
celebration. It is reported that about 60,000 domestic and foreign
tourists will pour into the city with less than 50,000 permanent
residents for the biggest party the city has ever had.
</P>
<P>
The Gisborne's official millennium dawn celebration to be held
on the waters and foreshore of Poverty Bay at Midway Beach South,
will be free and open to the public. It will begin at 3:15 a.m. on
January 1 with a special Maori blessing. Following this will be a
dance show which portrays the story of New Zealand from the birth
of the land and into the new millennium. Accompanied by the New
Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, the most popular
New Zealand-born opera singer who is now residing in England, will
perform for the people of her hometown. Her performance is
scheduled to begin an hour before the sun touches the city at 5:46
a.m. She will use her beautiful singing voice to greet the dawn of
the new millennium. The internationally famous Waiherere Maori
Cultural Group will also give a colorful performance.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for greeting the new millennium have been carried
on throughout New Zealand. It is learnt that several hundred large-
scale activities have been arranged for the special occasion,
including carnival style parties, theatrical performances,
continuous entertainment, international food stalls, lantern
parades, fireworks displays and various sports activities.
</P>
<P>
Both Auckland, which claims to be the "first major city to see
the dawn" on the globe, and Wellington, capital of the country,
have prepared varied, attractive and interesting activities for
the new year's eve and dawn.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, students of about 2,500 primary and
intermediate schools around the country were encouraged to plant
trees for the new millennium. Totara and kauri were chosen as the
official trees of the new millennium because they consistently
live beyond 1,000 years and for their cultural significance.
</P>
<P>
"planting totara and kauri is a great way for schools to leave
a legacy for the children of the next millennium," said NZ
Millennium Office Manager Sharon Van Gulik said.
</P>
<P>
"The tree planting is a way for young people to celebrate and
be part of New Zealand's unique natural heritage," she added.
</P>
<P>
A millennium song, composed by Jim Hall and Boh Runga and sung
by Dave Dobbyn and Bic Runga, has been prepared for the nationwide
celebrations. The song is entitled "I'll Meet You There".
</P>
<P>
New Zealand TV3 has been appointed by the government as New
Zealand's official millennium host broadcaster. In cooperation
with foreign TV organizations, the NZTV3 will send images of New
Zealand's midnight and dawn millennium celebrations to an
unprecedented 2.5 billion viewers in 130 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Ask Chapters to Host Satellite Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Tennis
Association (Pelti) must improve its performance by asking its
provincial chaptersto stage satellite and future tournaments next
year.
</P>
<P>
"By staging both events in the chapters, I believe the
tennissociety will boost their motivation and love of the sport as
has happened before," Pelti spokesman Benny Mailili said.
</P>
<P>
Pelti plans to stage six satellites and six future tournaments
next year in the Kemayoran tennis center, Central Jakarta. During
the six futures and four satellites this year, only a few
spectators visited the center to watch the tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"Pelti must be proactive and its officials must lobby the
chapters' officials to jointly host the events. So far, chapters
have no idea of the procedures to stage satellite and future
tournaments. We have to inform them of the procedures," he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The women's satellite tournament needs 35 million rupiah (5,000
U.S. dollars) to stage the event and 10,000 U.S. dollars for the
prize money. While a series of men's future tournaments,
comprising of two consecutive matches, will cost 72 million rupiah,
with 35,000 U.S. dollars for prize money and also certain
allowances for the International Tennis Federation supervisors.
</P>
<P>
Pelti must also pay a sanction fee of 600 U.S. dollars for each
satellite and 225 U.S. dollars for each future tournament.
</P>
<P>
In total, Pelti must provide 150,000 U.S. dollars for next year
's prize money. It is excluded from the sanction fee and the cost
of staging the event.
</P>
<P>
Benny named all the chapters in Java, South Sulawesi and Bali
as the most likely chapters to stage the events.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing the tournaments levels is also good for local
players as they have a chance to improve their world rankings.
That's why Pelti must be more proactive in persuading the chapters
and promoting the tournaments throughout the country," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States
government plans to spend 1.4 billion U.S. dollars related to the
2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
About 1.1 billion dollars of that will be for transportation
projects such as highways and a commuter railway that probably
would have been built anyway, the General Accounting Office report
said. The figures are preliminary because the games have not been
held and federal agencies often do not specifically track Olympics-
related spending, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The report cited 272 million dollars of scheduled spending
solely for the planning or operation of the Utah Olympics,
including about 200 million dollars by the FBI and other agencies
for safety and security.
</P>
<P>
Congressional critics of the Salt Lake City games said winter
games should be smaller and less expensive than summer Olympics,
and the 1.4 billion dollars estimate was far higher than any
previous figure.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- In the first 11 months of
this year, Shanghai exported 16.9 billion U.S. dollars worth of
goods, fulfilling the year's export target one month ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The city's export goal this year is 15.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that Shanghai's export volume was up 22.
23 percent over the January-November period of 1998, 15.6
percentage points higher than the national level.
</P>
<P>
Imports and exports stood at 34.1 billion dollars, an increase
of 27.26 percent, or 14.56 percentage points higher than the
national figure.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that exports from overseas-funded
enterprises in Shanghai amounted to 9.4 billion dollars during the
first 11 months of this year, 76.6 percent of the city's total.

while general trade increased by 18.1 percent to reach 6.2 billion

<HEADLINE> Dick Button Named Skating Figure of the Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Dick Button, the 1948 and
1952 Olympic champion turned television commentator and event
producer, was named figure skating's person of the century by
International Figure Skating magazine on Tuesday, according to
reports from Worcester.
</P>
<P>
Button was honoured for his 53 years of contributions to the
sport.
</P>
<P>
"We feel no other individual represents the sport of figure
skating better than Dick Button for the entire 20th century," said
IFS publisher Mark Lund.
</P>
<P>
"His technical innovations in the 1940s and '50s, his creation
of the World Pro Championships in 1973, convincing ABC to put
figure skating on television (in 1962), his 40 years as a
commentator, set him apart," Lund said.
</P>
<P>
Button, now 70, was the first to perform a double Axel in
competition, the first to do a triple loop, and along with his
coach Gustave Lussi, invented the flying camel spin.
</P>
<P>
Button said that he has no immediate plans to retire from
broadcasting and hopes.

BRASILIA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's coffee production in

<HEADLINE> Chinese College Teachers Become Taxpayers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Teachers from 11 universities
in Beijing's Haidian district, including Beijing University and
Qinghua University, have paid 13.16 million yuan in personal
income taxes this year.
</P>
<P>
Teachers from Qinghua paid 4.78 million yuan, an increase of 2.
16 million yuan over last year. This university has started giving
special bonuses to outstanding teachers, and about 100 renowned
scholars have received 50,000 yuan each annually. Teachers were
previously considered at the lower ladder of incomes.
</P>
<P>
Ren Yanshen, secretary of the Beijing University Committee of
the Communist Party of China, said that China has allocated a
large amount of money to increase college teachers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
Ren said the state is expected to earmark 1.8 billion yuan for
Beijing University over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wenshen, assistant president of Beijing University, said
his school came up with an incentive plan under which good
teachers are rewarded with higher pay, and the government has
helped achieve this goal within the century.
</P>
<P>
More nationally-known professors have stepped into China's
college classrooms and opened some key basic courses to
undergraduates, who previously had no opportunities to study under
the famed professors.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Education said that now is a
prime time to be a college professor in China.

But endless speculation in the Spanish media over a possible
return to Real Madrid, the club he coached for 22 days in the
summer of 1998, put pressure on Camacho to make an early decision.

<HEADLINE> Ghana, Nigeria on Fast-track Into Single Monetary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 21(Xinhua) -- Ghana and Nigeria have agreed
to adopt a fast-track approach towards the achievement of a single
monetary zone in the West Africa sub-region, Ghana News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The process will first involve the creation of a second
monetary zone for the Anglophone area of ECOWAS, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This was the outcome of two-days' intensive consultations
between Ghana and Nigeria at a high-level ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Executive Secretary of ECOWAS
Lansana Kouyate, representatives from the Economic Commission of
Africa, and officials from Ghana and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Foreign Minister Victor Gbeho described the meeting as
highly successful, saying it is very important that the ECOWAS
nations work strongly toward integration given the recent trends
in the world.
</P>
<P>
"West Africa cannot afford to lag behind," he said, noting that
the process of integration is now inevitable.
</P>
<P>
According to Jerry Gana, Minister of Co-operation and
Integration of Nigeria, the process would involve co-ordination in
the areas of finance, commerce and trade, aviation and central
banks.
</P>
<P>
This would involve the establishment of a Convergence Council,
which will advice the heads of state on ways to facilitate the
quick move toward the second monetary zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a technical committee would also be established to
research into the major areas of co-operation to ensure that the
meeting's recommendations are carried through.
</P>
<P>
Gana disclosed that the Joint Group of Ministers of the two
countries on bilateral matters will meet in the middle of January
and the second week of February next year.
</P>
<P>
The major issues that come up are the establishment of regional
 infrastructures, implementation of the ECOWAS Trade
Liberalization Scheme, effective establishment of free trade areas
and the harmonization of customs procedures, he said.

<HEADLINE> Guerrilla Truce Gives Colombia Breathing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The 23-day truce
unilaterally decreed by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC) during the year-end aroused the hope for a long ceasefire
in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
The FARC, the largest rebel group in Colombia, declared its
first truce in a decade Monday, waving an olive branch to the war-
ravaged country for the Christmas and New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
People are expected to advance the peace talks to be renewed,
reactivated tourism, and reestablished peace in the municipalities
of the zones ravaged by violence.
</P>
<P>
Colombian attorney general Jaime Bernal Cuellar said Tuesday
that "the truce is a peace gesture that must be used at the
negotiations table to make the first point of discussion the
ceasefire while the peace dialogue advances."
</P>
<P>
"We must try to extend this truce and create confidence in the
peace process," said the attorney general, who held talks with the
National Liberation Army (ELN), the second rebel group in the
country, to open another peace process.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders hailed the truce as a first step toward the
goal of recovering the country's calmness.
</P>
<P>
Banking Association president Jorge Enrique Botero said that "
from truce to truce we can arrive at peace."
</P>
<P>
The truce that started Monday and will end on January 10 can
help the depressed tourism industry in the season of the biggest
movement of travelers.
</P>
<P>
Hotels and travel agencies reported an increase in the
reservations made by travelers who move on roads, who are afraid
of going on vacation for fear of holdups and kidnappings made by
the guerrilla groups in the road network of the country.
</P>
<P>
A calm atmosphere is felt now in the 90 municipalities that
suffered this year attacks from the guerrillas, although in some
of them there still exists an environment of fear.
</P>
<P>
The three-decade-old war has claimed more than 35,000 lives in
just 10 years. The Colombian government and the FARC started peace
talks, aiming at ending the war.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts have suggested a Christmas truce may pave
the way for longer ceasefires in the future.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Wins Support from FA Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager
Kevin Keegan has been given the unqualified backing of Football
Association chairman Geoff Thompson to carry on as England coach
even if the national side struggle at next summer's European
Championship finals.
</P>
<P>
Keegan has reportedly admitted that he would have quit if his
side had lost in the Euro 2000 play-offs to Scotland and would be
unlikely to keep his post unless England did "fantastically well"
in the tournament itself.
</P>
<P>
However, the FA chairman has sought to relieve any semblance of
pressure on Keegan by insisting that qualifying from the group
stages would represent a "major achievement" in itself.
</P>
<P>
Thompson insisted that Keegan was - and remains - the right man
for the job, and he declared: "If we hadn't qualified, there would
have been no pressure on Kevin Keegan. The main aim has always
been the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"There's no pressure on him, none at all. There's no point
giving somebody the job if you give him a gun with a bullet in it.
</P>
<P>
"I have the utmost confidence in him. He's got a contract until
the 2002 World Cup, I'm sure that he will see that out and that is
the end of the issue as far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
"I'm more than happy with Kevin and there is a unity at the FA
behind that point of view. We picked the right man and I'm sure
that he'll prove to be a very good England manager.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wanted us to appoint him, we believed he was the
right man anyway - we wouldn't have appointed anyone on a
newspaper poll -and clearly we needed somebody to lift the nation.
"
</P>
<P>
He added: "We'd like to win the European Championships and we'
ve perhaps got the players to do so.
</P>
<P>
"But to be realistic, if you're in the fourth pot of seeds then
your first aim is to get through that first stage and then you can
use that as a springboard for further success."

<TEXT>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 56.27 at 11,200.54.
The blue chip index fell 113.16 points Monday in fears that the
Federal Reserve would make a change of its policy directive to "
tightening" bias from "neutral" at its Open Market Committee
meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor
's 500 index rose 15.34 at 1,433.43 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 127.28 or 3.3 percent at 3,911.15,
surpassing the record closing high of 3,783.87 points set Monday.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied strongly after the Federal Reserve announced
its decisions. The Associated Press described the Federal Reserve'
s move as an "early Christmas present" to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Investors were surprised after the Federal Reserve announced
that its policy directive stays at neutral. Earlier, traders
expected the monetary policy makers to adopt a "tightening" bias
while leaving rates alone at the Federal Reserve's last meeting of
1999.
</P>
<P>
A "tightening" bias means that the Federal Reserve would raise
rates again at any future sign of inflation. The Federal Reserve
has raised rates three times this year to cool off the U.S.
economy in an effort to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve also expressed its concerns about the rapid
growth rate of the economy and said its unchanged rate decision
was aimed at ensuring a smooth transition to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.45 at 632.89 and the American Stock
Exchange rose 3.49 at 834.64. The Russell 2000 index of smaller

Advancing issues barely outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,567 up, 1,527 down and 460 unchanged.

Seletiva Tournament, but Atletico took the title 4-2 on aggregate
to win Brazil's last berth in next year's Libertadores Cup.

<HEADLINE> Nazarbayev Warns Against isolating Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON,December 21 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's President
Nursultan Nazarbayev Tuesday warned against isolating Russia and
reaffirmed his commitment to the construction of the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium (CPC).
</P>
<P>
He briefed reporters at the Blair House about his meeting with
President Bill Clinton at the White House, saying that he told the
U.S. president it was important not to "isolate Russia,
economically or politically."
</P>
<P>
"If we want to keep Russia moving in the direction of liberal
reforms, then we need to support their government or it could play
into the hands of nationalists or other groups," he said. "And I
can say that President Clinton shared that opinion."
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev met with Clinton for almost an hour. Their
discussions covered U.S. investment in the country and Kazakhstan'
s efforts to liquidate its nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev told reporters that his country was supporting
construction of the CPC, a major oil pipeline between Tengiz in
Kazakhstan and Noverossiysk, Russia's port on the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
The CPC pipeline, which is scheduled to be completed in 2001,
will allow Kazakhstan to export through 2004 or 2005. Then another
pipeline will be needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some investors believe that the second best pipeline would be
through Iran, but there are political problems there," he said. "
The other option is from Baku to Ceyhan and the fact of the matter
is that after the CPC, the project that's best developed is the
Baku-Ceyhan project." Baku is the capital of Azerbaijan, while
Ceyhan is a Turkish port.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Population to Reach 15.862 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch population will
reach 15.862 million on January 1 next year, the Statistics
Netherlands' forecast published Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
In 1990 there were 14.893 million people living in the
Netherlands, the government forecast said, the population
therefore grew by almost a million over the last decades.
</P>
<P>
The number of "new" residents is as large as the total number
of people living in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam and the city of
Utrecht. More than half of the increase can be ascribed to non-
Western ethnic minorities, the Dutch government said in a news
release.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990s, more than 300,000 non-Western ethnic
minorities came to the Netherlands as immigrants, and more than
250,000 children with a non-Western mother or father were born.
The number of indigenous people and Western immigrants has
increased by 400,000, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch population grew by 11 million during the 20th century.
The rate of growth will decrease in the new century and a
population of 17 million is forecast in a hundred years' time.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Urges ECOWAS to Promote Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 21(Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings Tuesday urged the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) to shake off their over-reliance on colonial
masters and work towards promoting the economic integration of the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are trapped in over-reliance on our relations with
our colonial masters, placing more emphasis on their perceptions,"
the president was quoted as saying by Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting with a Nigerian Trade
delegation led by Minister of Co-operation and Integration Jerry
Gana.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS, a 16-nation sub-regional economic grouping formed 15
years ago to spearhead economic integration, is facing serious
challenges from UEMOA, a monetary union formed by French-speaking
ECOWAS members.
</P>
<P>
Ghana and Nigeria have, therefore, decided to pursue programs
that would rejuvenate ECOWAS and make it respond to the needs of
member countries.
</P>
<P>
West Africa should not allow itself to be balkanized
economically and praised the initiative being taken by Ghana and
Nigeria to make ECOWAS move at a faster rate, Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
He said concrete decisions have been taken regarding
co-operation between Ghana and Nigeria in terms of a common
currency and free movement of goods and people.
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about a rail link between Accra and Lagos. We
are moving fast because time is not on our side," he said.
