Hall of Fame honor puts crowning touch on Dickerson's career
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN McCLAIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ In the City of Angels, Eric Dickerson was heaven-sent
for frustrated fans of the Los Angeles Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Picked second in the 1983 NFL draft behind quarterback John
Elway, Dickerson was a sculpted 6-3, 218-pound running back from
SMU. He was a single, handsome, intelligent and talented
millionaire _ a sometimes-deadly combination, especially in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, the pride of Sealy, was so cool his feet never
touched the ground. As he became one of the greatest running backs
in history, he moved with a style and elegance seldom seen in the
NFL _ like a ballerina in shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw Eric run, I knew we were dealing with a
different kind of cat,'' says former Rams offensive tackle Jackie
Slater. ``We weren't dealing with a Ford _ we were dealing with a
Ferrari.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, the runner, and Slater, the blocker, have been in
Hawaii as part of the Pro Bowl festivities for the Pro Football
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, Class of 1999, will be inducted into the Canton,
Ohio, shrine in July. Slater, who played 20 years for the Rams and
is expected to be elected in 2001, will be Dickerson's presenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized how special Eric was when he came to work every
day,'' says Slater, who works as an NFL analyst for Fox Sports.
``He had so much God-given talent, but he never missed a practice.
He became the centerpiece, the standard-bearer.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first season, Dickerson helped turn coach John Robinson's
Rams into a perennial playoff team. He rushed for a rookie-record
1,808 yards and scored 20 touchdowns. He obliterated the so-called
sophomore jinx by rushing for 2,105 yards and breaking O.J.
Simpson's single-season record. In his first four seasons with the
Rams, he averaged 1,742 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   In the bright lights of Los Angeles, few celebrities sparkled
like Dickerson. He rubbed elbows with stars, owned two Porsches and
a Mercedes and resided in a $1 million home in Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson co-authored a book, On The Run, posed for Playgirl
magazine, made guest appearances on such television shows as Good
Morning America and Hollywood Squares and was pursued by Nancy
Reagan for her ``Just Say No'' anti-drug program and Joan Rivers
for her talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was always just a small-town boy,'' Dickerson says. ``In
the offseason, I'd go home to Sealy or to Georgia to visit my
girlfriend, and the Rams wouldn't hear from me for three or four
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still that way. It's such an honor to be elected to the
Hall of Fame, but it's not going to change me. I'm still the same
guy I've always been. When I go home to Sealy, I'm still just
Eric.''
</P>
<P>
   City fathers in Sealy, which is 50 miles west of Houston on
Interstate 10, should put up billboards on each end of town that
say, ``Sealy, home of Eric Dickerson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric put Sealy on the map,'' says Tasha Johnson, Dickerson's
younger sister.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and their other sister, Lisa Johnson, are part of
Dickerson's family that made the trip to Hawaii from Sealy. His
mother, Helen Johnson, is also here.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, 38, wishes his great-great aunt, Viola Dickerson, who
adopted him when he was 3 months old, could be with them. But she
is 94 and resides in a rest home in Katy. His grandmother, Johnnie
Mae Shavers, was unable to make the trip from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really understand what a special player Eric was
until we went to one of his games at SMU,'' says Tasha, 27. ``All I
wanted to do was to play with Peruna (SMU's mascot), but one time I
remember that Eric scored, and the stadium just erupted. Everybody
stood and cheered, and the band played and I thought, `Wow. That's
my big brother.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the (Hall of Fame) vote, I was so nervous for him. I
was worried about what I'd say if he didn't get in. I knew I was
going to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Tasha Johnson still loves to get her brother's goat. After
Dickerson and the other new inductees _ Giants linebacker Lawrence
Taylor, Rams guard Tom Mack, Browns tight end Ozzie Newsome and
Bills guard Billy Shaw _ had a news conference in Los Angeles on
Thursday, they came to Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson's plane was still on the runway in Los Angeles when
Tasha approached three pilots standing outside the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them Eric Dickerson was onboard,'' she says with a
mischievous grin. ``The captain said he was going to tell the
passengers. I knew Eric would kill me.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we were airborne, the captain came over the speaker
system and said, `By the way, I'd like to congratulate Eric
Dickerson for making the Hall of Fame.' Eric was half asleep, but
he raised up his head and said, `I heard my name.' Everyone was
clapping for him. He looked at me. You should have seen the look he
gave me. I loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, I wrote him a letter telling him how proud I am of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, Slater and many of Dickerson's former teammates at
SMU, Los Angeles and Indianapolis came to Hawaii to support him.
Many more will be in Canton for the induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   If Dickerson had the power to bring one more person, he would.
But he doesn't. There is nothing he can do to bring back his uncle,
Kary Dickerson, who died 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he'll be there in spirit,'' Dickerson says.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson still calls his uncle ``dad'' because he raised him
like a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my dad's watching over me, but I still wish I could see
him,'' Dickerson says. ``He was my role model, the biggest
influence on my life. I wish to God that he could be at my
induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been dead for 21 years, but I still get choked up talking
about him. I love him, and I miss him because he was my best
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dickerson was developing into a Friday night hero at Sealy,
his biggest fan was Kary Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was soft-spoken, but he was a very strict Christian
man,'' Dickerson says. ``When I was growing up, he'd get to my
games before I got there. He'd sit in the stands and read his
Bible. That was so important to be warming up and look in the
stands and see my dad watching me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to sit on the edge of my bed and talk to me about the
Bible. At that age, you don't want to hear things like that. Once,
he said, `Sit up, son,' and I did. He said, `Let me tell you
something: One day I'm going to die and I'm not going to be here.
I'm going to heaven. You don't want to go to hell, and I can't go
to heaven for you, so you better listen to what I'm trying to tell
you and learn from it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that if you have a problem, go into the closet
where it's quiet and pray. There have been times when I've gone
into my closet and got down on my knees and prayed. It's amazing
how many things he told me 25 years ago that I still include in my
everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a senior in 1978, Dickerson helped Sealy finish 15-0 and win
the Class 2A state championship. He signed with SMU and joined
another blue-chip recruit, running back Craig James, who had led
Houston Stratford to the Class 4A state title.
</P>
<P>
   At SMU, Dickerson and James formed the famed Pony Express. They
alternated and were called DickerJames. They have remained friends.
This season, Dickerson went to Dallas to be on a weekly football
show called In The Huddle with James and Gil Brandt, the former
Dallas Cowboys personnel director.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, who resides in Malibu, might pursue a career as an
NFL analyst. James, who has become so successful working for CBS'
college and NFL coverage, has a company for potential sports
broadcasters. Dickerson has taken the classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first experience in television, and it's gotten me
interested,'' he says. ``Craig's got a gift for gab. I learned a
lot about the broadcasting business by going to Craig's school. I
really enjoyed doing it with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Few will disagree with Slater that if Dickerson had remained
with the Rams, he would have shattered Walter Payton's NFL career
rushing record. Payton rushed for 16,726 yards, and Dickerson is
third with 13,259.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, Eric would be the all-time leading rusher had
he stayed with us,'' Slater says. ``I played with Walter three
years in college (Jackson State). He was a technical runner. He
didn't have Eric's speed or acceleration. Walter also never had a
line to rival ours.''
</P>
<P>
   After his record-breaking season in 1984, Dickerson held out for
46 days and got a new contract. He signed an agreement not to try
to renegotiate the new deal until it expired. After rushing for
1,821 yards in 1986, Dickerson wanted a new deal that would pay him
like a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who were one of the thriftier teams in the league at
the time, traded Dickerson to the Colts on Oct. 31, 1987, as part
of a three-way deal with Buffalo. He signed a new contract with the
Colts, paying him $5.3 million over four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks I pushed that trade, but I never did,'' he
says. ``I was trying to get the Rams to pay me $1 million. I just
wanted to be close to everybody else. I think I went from $200,000
to $600,000 ($682,000).
</P>
<P>
   ``John Robinson told me, `Eric, I just don't think a running
back's worth $1 million.' When I tell him that today, he laughs and
says, `Eric, I'd pay you $10 million today.' That's how much times
have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I heard that I was money-hungry, but that's not
true. I just wanted to be able to take care of my family in a way I
thought they deserved _ a way I saw other players be able to take
care of their families. I didn't have to be a rich man. I wanted to
be able to buy my mom a dress or a car.''
</P>
<P>
   After he signed his new contract with the Colts, Dickerson
bought his aunt a Cadillac, a house and a mink coat.
</P>
<P>
   Colts coach Ron Meyer, who recruited and coached Dickerson at
SMU, called him on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I was dressed in an Indian costume and going to a
masquerade party when he called and asked me if I was ready to play
for the Colts,'' Dickerson says. ``He told me the Rams had given
them permission to talk to me. He wanted me to fly to Indianapolis
because we had 24 hours to get it done. I took my costume off, went
to Indianapolis and we got it done pretty fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank the Colts for giving me an opportunity to play, but I
never wanted to leave the Rams. I wanted to play for the Rams for
the rest of my life. I laid it on the line for the Rams. I loved my
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I said some things that weren't always right, and I
know I didn't always make the right decisions. When I look at some
of the things players do and say today, man, I was a choirboy. But
I had some tough times in my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it was hard on me because I wanted to have a great
game and a great season so bad. I'd be so stressed out because I
felt like I wasn't playing up to my expectations. It took a toll on
me physically and in my attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson rushed for 1,288 yards with the Rams and Colts in the
strike-torn 1987 season. He compiled 1,659 and 1,311 yards in his
next two seasons with Indianapolis. He played two more seasons with
the Colts, one with the Raiders and one with the Falcons in 1993,
his last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret it,'' he says about not finishing his career
with the Rams and possibly surpassing Payton. ``I just don't think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Dickerson is thinking about today is being immortalized
with the greatest players in the history of pro football. He is
humbled by the magnitude of the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time the Hall of Fame was ever mentioned to me was
after my 2,000-yard season,'' he says. ``I was on the beach at the
Pro Bowl, and Rickey Jackson (Saints linebacker) told me what a
great season I'd had and how hard I was to tackle and that he
thought I had a chance to make the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never thought about it. I'd never even heard about it,
actually. But as my career went on, I heard about it more and more.
After I finished playing, I started to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater is honored Dickerson chose him to present him in Canton.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start of his career with the Rams, we had a special
friendship,'' Slater says. ``I imagine that on 85 percent of his
carries, I helped him up because I didn't want him to expend any
more energy than he had to on anything but carrying the ball. I
think he realized early on that I was in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``During his career with the Colts, we got together at the Pro
Bowl. He told me one year that if he ever got to the Hall of Fame,
he wanted me to be his presenter. I didn't think much about it at
the time. But he continued to say it often. When I finally saw his
name on the ballot, I said, `Oh, I've got to get a speech ready.'``
</P>
<P>
   Slater should be president of Dickerson's fan club.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Former 49ers safety) Ronnie Lott told me at the Super Bowl,
`I've never tackled a guy that big who was as deceptive about
getting his center of gravity down at the point of impact as
Eric,''' Slater says.
</P>
<P>
   About Dickerson's contract problems, Slater says: ``It's easy to
say Eric was getting some bad advice. He was young and
impressionable, and he was dealing with some serious issues. His
prime came right out of college. He wasn't making the money he
thought he deserved compared to others around the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point in Eric's career, he was the standard-bearer.
Once he hit that zenith, he started competing against himself. On
the field, he was rivaled by few. As far as his compensation
package, he was rivaled by many.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Dickerson smiles a lot and signs autographs for
everyone who asks. Looking back on his playing days, he laughs and
says: ``I had a God-given gift. Sometimes I'd watch film and amaze
myself. I'd see me make a move and think, `Man, how'd I do that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played at Sealy, some people said I wouldn't make it in
college, that I was too tall, that I ran too upright, that I wasn't
tough enough, that I came from a Double-A school and played against
guys half my size.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my senior year at SMU, I began to realize I was a pretty
good player. Before my first year with the Rams, I thought a real
good season would be about 600 yards and eight or nine touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year was phenomenal. It didn't come easy, but it
was just so natural. At times, my cuts were so crisp it was almost
like I was doing a dance.''
</P>
<P>
   During his rookie training camp, Dickerson and some other
rookies went to Venice Beach in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a crowd around somebody and realized it was Magic
Johnson,'' he says. ``After we walked away, I told the others that
I wanted people to know me like they knew Magic. That was one of my
goals, that people in LA would know who Eric Dickerson was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show the world my talent. I wanted people to see
what kind of football player I was. I think I attained those
goals.''

RAVE REVIEWS FOR OLOWOKANDI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now playing at the Sports Arena: ``He's All
That,'' starring Michael Olowokandi as the brainy son of a European
diplomat who is transformed into a bonafide NBA star.
</P>
<P>
   It debuted Friday to much the same sparkling reviews that
accompanied the recent opening of the revisionist Cinderella story
that has teens tittering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emerging as a special delight,'' does aptly describe
Olowokandi, the Clippers' No.1 draft pick. He had 14 points in 22
minutes in a nine-point, season-opening loss to Phoenix. Olowokandi
will be coming off the bench again today when the Clippers host
Chicago because, well, there's no director dictating the pace of
his metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   In the box-office hit, Freddie Prinze Jr. needs a few weeks to
draw out Rachael Leigh Cook's natural beauty. It hasn't taken
Clippers first-year head coach Chris Ford and his staff that long
to enhance Olowokandi's natural abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Five days was all Ford and Co. required to refine Olowokandi's
foul-shooting technique and streamline his balletic moves under the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Cook hardly required a facelift. Neither does
Olowokandi's game. In the case of his free-throw shooting, all Ford
had to do was show the 7-foot-1 center where to place his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. In the four years Olowokandi has been playing
basketball, no one had told him to try resting his fingers on the
seams of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is spherical. No matter how I hold it, it's still
round. That's all I knew,'' said Olowokandi, who was a 46.7-percent
free-throw shooter in his three years at University of Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   After a few days of feeling for the seams before letting the
ball fly, Olowokandi, 23, converted 4 of 5 foul shots against the
Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, his wit is as quick as his shot release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him about a few things and since then he's changed
his foul shooting,'' Ford marveled.
</P>
<P>
   In the week he has been working with Olowokandi, Ford hasn't had
to repeat himself once, except to say, ``Good job, Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Darrick Martin, who picks Olowokandi up every day
and takes him to practice, said the player ``picks things up very
quickly'' (presumably that will hold true for driver's education,
too, once he clears time in his schedule to tackle it).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to try to impart so much knowledge to him,'' Ford
said, ``sometimes it must seem like we're picking on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix center Luc Longley was the one who felt he was being
unfairly singled out Friday. After Olowokandi spun around the
ex-Bull for one of his five baskets, Longley had words with the
closest official.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does that again,'' Longley complained, ``you've gotta
call a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi was amused but said nothing. The last thing Longley
likely wants to hear is the truth: The rookie has plenty more moves
where that one came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has very special abilities,'' Ford said. ``Innate
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what Olowokandi does, he learned by watching the
Michael Jordan highlight videos that served as his introduction to
basketball. He was 20 when he started playing very unorthodox hoops
games with his friends and began paying attention to Bulls' games.
</P>
<P>
   Those Chicago jerseys he'll see today are a lot more
recognizable than the bodies inhabiting them. It's a funny thing,
life: Jordan was the one who turned an athletic kid in England onto
basketball and now, in the first week of the NBA after Jordan, the
Bulls are in L.A. and that kid is the Michael worth paying to see.
</P>
<P>
   The 7,689 fans who turned out for the Clippers' 1999 season
opener gave Olowokandi a warm welcome when he checked into the game
with a little under two minutes remaining in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   His first few trips up the court, he felt all 15,378 eyes
bearing down on him, which may account for why he missed his first
shot. Olowokandi made his next two, though, and the way he did it
was particularly pleasing to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   He posted up down low and moved ever-so-methodically, like
something straight out of all those basketball textbooks Olowokandi
has never thumbed through.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very patient in making his moves,'' Ford said. ``He was
doing them the way they should be done instead of hurrying them.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easy for Olowokandi to try too hard to fill a
highlight reel in his NBA first half for the benefit of all those
people sitting forward in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi has two college degrees and remains a voracious
reader of books and people. So no one needs to tell him there are a
lot of fans poised to make a quick judgment as to whether or not he
warranted being taken first overall in the 1998 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see exactly what the (big deal is) about this
player they've heard so much about,'' Olowokandi said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford refers to those expectations as Olowokandi's ``burden.''
</P>
<P>
   That no one, certainly not Ford, is calling the challenge of
turning a basketball neophyte into an NBA All-Star a burden augurs
a happy ending.

CHIROPRACTORS FIGHT FORSHARE OF MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Petite and 50ish, she crosses her arms over her chest as if to
protect herself from a body blow. Then her doctor stands over her
and then leans into her, his hand shoving her shoulder like a stuck
door.
</P>
<P>
   That done, he moves up to her head, runs his fingers
matter-of-factly down her neck. He puts his hand at the base of her
skull; places the other hand on her forehead and then twists her
head like a balky pickle-jar lid.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what you believe, what just happened to
Alicefayehall Orban with her chiropractor, Dr. Edwin Weathersby,
was either health care or hocus-pocus.
</P>
<P>
   Since it started in 1895, when an Iowa grocer said he cured a
janitor's deafness by manipulating his spine, chiropractic care has
fought for its legitimacy in courts, scientific studies and in
examining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   As it has won over more patients and medical doctors,
chiropractors moved the battlefield to the Legislature; their fight
for more than 10 years is to get more reimbursement by managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   This year's legislative attack, led by Dr. Alan Immerman, a
prominent chiropractic lobbyist, could upend the state's entire
managed-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona seems to have plenty of chiropractic ground forces for
battle. With the highest number of chiropractors per capita in the
country, Arizona has one chiropractor for every 1,472 people. In
fact, the chiropractor business in the early '90s was so good that
it was touted by commercial lenders as one of the Valley's best
business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But just as it became more competitive, managed care has cut
into chiropractors access to patients, chiropractors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one more thing we have to fight for. You get used to
this in this profession,'' Immerman said.
</P>
<P>
   From that one crack of his janitor's back, storekeeper Daniel
Palmer developed a school of thought where the spine was the center
of the body's health. A misalignment of the vertebrae could cause
disease or prevent general health because it could interfere with
the nerves, chiropractors believed.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, chiropractors split into two camps: The
``straights'' and the ``mixeds,'' with the straights believing only
in traditional spinal manipulation while the mixers believed in
other therapies such as heat, ultrasound, exercise and vitamins
could help.
</P>
<P>
   Immerman adds another category to the list: ``cuckoos'': ``Those
people who think they can cure a disease like diabetes just by
working with the lower back. Of course they can't. Anyone who
thinks that is just an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any cuckoos out there,'' Immerman said, adding he
believes chiropractors' old nemesis, members of the American
Medical Association, promoted the images of chiropractors as
cancer-curing quacks.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, chiropractors are accepted by medical doctors for
their ability to treat back, neck and other joint damage without
using drugs or surgery. Some chiropractors, however, argue that
their practice can treat respiratory conditions, gastrointestinal
disorders, sinusitis, bronchial asthma, heart trouble and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   There have been splits among Valley chiropractors that weren't
caused by anyone other than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Immerman sued the Arizona Association of Chiropractors,
which represents about 400 members _ a quarter of chiropractors in
the state _ because they threw him off the board.
</P>
<P>
   Immerman said it was a matter of priorities: Association
executives wanted to require chiropractors to take more
continuing-education classes; he and others just wanted to take on
the HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   There's a ``live, let-live'' philosophy among the two camps,
said David Morrison, an attorney for the Arizona Association of
Chiropractors.
</P>
<P>
   Immerman, who lost the lawsuit and had to pay more than $12,000
in court costs, said the disagreements were ``infantile'' _
especially compared to the threat posed by managed care.
</P>
<P>
   As managed care replaced traditional insurance plans, it limited
the number of chiropractor visits covered by insurance. It also
required patients to get approval from their primary-care providers
before going to chiropractors.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since the days when the AMA forbade
members from referring patients to chiropractors but medical
doctors are still reluctant to send patients their way,
chiropractors say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Whitney Calkins, a Glendale family practice physician, said
during her first two years of practice, when patients asked her to
send them to a chiropractor, she'd just roll her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she can tell them to walk down the hall. Calkins and four
other family practice doctors work with a chiropractor, Dr. David
Berg.
</P>
<P>
   Calkins said she now easily refers patients with head, back,
shoulder and neck aches as well as carpal tunnel, rotator cuff
injuries and tennis elbows to her colleague Berg.
</P>
<P>
   Berg usually see patients for three sessions. If there's no
signs of improvement, he'll send them elsewhere for other types of
care. Berg said the idea of chiropractors limiting their visits is
pretty new.
</P>
<P>
   The vision of the eternal chiropractic visit hovers around
chiropractors and irks medical doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I kept the same kind of records that they did, I would be
kicked out of medicine,'' said Dr. Neil Rockowitz, a Phoenix
orthopedic surgeon, who is frequently called by insurers or defense
attorneys to review the chiropractic care for people who have
workers' compensation claims or who were in motor vehicle
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just read a chiropractor's records for 100 visits, every
page is the same for except for the dates. There's no change; no
progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rockowitz said that he feels chiropractors will purposely drag
out care in order to run up medical bills so legal settlements from
motor vehicle accidents and workers' comp claims will be larger.
</P>
<P>
   While patients may not be physically hurt by prolonged
treatments, they could be psychologically damaged by health-care
providers repeatedly telling them they are in pain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even skeptic Rockowitz says he believes chiropractors can
treat some back injuries within a limited six- to 12-week period.
</P>
<P>
   Successfully treating back pain remains an elusive quest for the
medical community. Roughly four out of five Americans complain of
back pain; it is the second most common reason for visiting a
doctor, yet doctors have remedies other than medications, said Leah
Garrett, editor of the ``Harvard Health Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   To figure out the best way to treat back pain, the federal
Agency for Health Care Policy Research conducted a landmark study
in 1994 and found that spinal manipulation appeared to provide
temporary relief for back pain _ no matter if the manipulation was
done by a doctor, physical therapist or chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   The study found patients gave chiropractors higher marks because
they explained back problems better, but they ended up being more
costly because of the frequent visits.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a study in the ``New England Journal of Medicine''
tracked 321 patients who either got chiropractic manipulations or
lessons in back exercises from a physical therapist. Both groups
recovered at about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Patient demand has caused more managed-care plans to cover
chiropractic care. Currently, five plans offer chiropractic
coverage for 2 percent to 4 percent above normal premiums, said Gay
Ann Williams, executive director of the Arizona Association of
HMOs. One plan, CIGNA Healthcare of Arizona, offers it as a regular
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Even though plans cover chiropractic care, that doesn't mean
they believe chiropractors should be primary-care providers as they
have lobbied for and plans have fought against.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have the training or the skill,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is purely a financial matter for them. This is just a
self-serving interest. It's all about them wanting to make more
money and wanting direct access to our members.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, chiropractors pushed through a bill that would forbid
HMOs from not paying claims just because the care was provided by a
chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't think that we are part of mainstream medicine,''
Immerman said. ``We are not a frill. We are not a luxury. Our
patients need us.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the chiropractors have returned to the Legislature
again, with their even more radical plan to overhaul managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, chiropractors say, they want managed-care plans to
recognize them as primary-care providers. Chiropractors, then,
could be the ``gatekeepers'' and refer patients to medical doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is one of 10 states where chiropractors are pushing the
envelope and fighting for greater rights under managed care. Only
Maine allows patients to go to whichever type of doctor they want
as a primary-care provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want is equitability,'' said Weathersby, who has been
in practice for more than 20 years and has treated everyone from
corporate CEOs to newborns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love helping people, especially those who come in here and
think what I do is voodoo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Weathersby speaks, he looks at his activator, a device that
looks a little like a tire-pressure gauge to stimulate damaged
nerves. He uses it frequently on people who have just been in car
accidents, sounding like he's using a staple gun as he presses
against their muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Rockowitz, among others, scoffs at the idea of activators,
saying there's no proof that devices like that work.
</P>
<P>
   But usually chiropractic patients don't complain about how well
treatments work, said Patrice Pritzl, director of the Arizona Board
of Chiropractic Examiners.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently complaints come up over billing and sexual conduct,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual misconduct complaints come from hands-on healing nature
of the practice, Pritzl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the twisting and turning and touching, a person who
doesn't understand what is going on and can misinterpret things,''
Pritzl said. Six of the 172 complaints filed at the board dealt
with alleged sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Patients also are confused by why their chiropractor charges
more when insurance companies are paying the bills, Pritzl said.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent misunderstandings, chiropractors and patients need to
discuss thoroughly what happens during treatment and how it is
going to be paid. It's also a good idea to get it in writing,
Pritzl said.
</P>
<P>
   Billing. Sexual misconduct. That's all news to Orban, who has
been coming in for chiropractic treatment for years after a car
accident. After a brief, five-minute visit, she leaves Weathersby's
office a little sorer than when she went in. But hours after her
appointment, the soreness disappears, taking the pain and stiffness
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it work?'' Orban asked. ``Well, if it didn't, I wouldn't
come back, would I?'' &QL;

POWERFUL SPECIAL INTERESTS SQUARE OFF OVER HMO REFORM MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It's billed as the Patient Protection Act, a dramatic
reform of health maintenance organizations designed to protect
patients' rights and expand health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents are questioning whether the real motive for the
proposal is help for a powerful special interest: chiropractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a big part of this push,'' said Gay Ann
Williams, executive director of the Arizona Association of HMOs.
``Their lobbyists and some of their members are very influential
with some lawmakers. They're pulling out all of the stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say HMOs are lining up to fight the bill because it
includes major reforms that the health-care industry has resisted
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motives, the proposal has ignited an intense debate
at the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 2034 would allow patients to sue HMOs for
malpractice, allow patients to receive care from any doctor and
provide patients access to any drug that doctors prescribe.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions include expanded access to treatments by
chiropractors, naturopaths and homeopaths. And the bill would
prohibit HMOs from offering financial incentives and penalties to
doctors to limit some procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it says is we are challenging the HMOs ability to make
money hand over fist,'' said Alan Immerman, a lobbyist who
represents chiropractors.
</P>
<P>
   Williams says the bill, by expanding access to services like
chiropractic and homeopathic and making it easier to sue HMOs,
would dramatically increase health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also point to the close political relationship between
Immerman and the bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Debra Brimhall.
</P>
<P>
   Brimhall, R-Snowflake, accepted nearly $6,500 in campaign
contributions from chiropractors during the 1998 election cycle,
according to campaign finance records. The contributions accounted
for 36 percent of the money she raised.
</P>
<P>
   She said she also worked closely with Immerman to both write and
line up support for the bill. Immerman has become the measure's
biggest booster, distributing news releases and fact sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded access to chiropractic care has failed repeatedly at
the Legislature and was vetoed last year by Gov. Jane Hull.
</P>
<P>
   But Immerman, in a letter to members of his Independent
Chiropractic Physicians group, wrote that this was the year to get
the measure passed.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to capitalize on widespread voter discontent with
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance Committee Chairperson Debra Brimhall and I have
worked together all week to successfully secure signatures for the
bill . . .'' Immerman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to point out that the group realized that the direct
access chiropractic bill would not pass in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the appointment of Rep. Brimhall as chairperson of the
Banking and Insurance Committee, the climate of the Legislature has
dramatically changed and ICP determined that direct access can pass
as part of an overall HMO reform plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Brimhall says she's proud of the donations from chiropractors.
She said she helped mediate a dispute several years ago between
rival chiropractic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say to me that I received that many donations from
chiropractors. . . . I bet those are the same people who have been
calling be saying thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds that the bill is about more than chiropractic coverage.
Brimhall says she's responding to an avalanche of complaints about
HMOs. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Paul Johnson sounded a
similar note in the 1998 campaign. He offered an almost identical
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of passion for the public,'' he said. ``This is
the people's government. We are supposed to be here serving them.
When the public has the outcry that they have on this issue, then
we have to respond to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Immerman says the influence of chiropractors is slim compared to
the cadre of lobbyists fighting the bill. Interests include the
Arizona Chamber of Commerce and giant health-care companies,
represented by lobbyists such as Jim Norton, Michael Green, Kevin
DeMenna, Ed Wren and Mike Williams.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by Arizona Citizen Action, a liberal
advocacy group, doctors contributed five times more money than
chiropractors to political candidates in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Driscoll, executive director of ACA, pointed out a
bipartisan coalition of lawmakers joined Brimhall in sponsoring the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a consumer protection bill. It's absolutely not a
chiropractors bill,'' Driscoll said. &QL;

KINGS MAKE PLANS FOR TRAINING FACILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Staples Center isn't the only new home
the Kings are slated to move into next season, with groundbreaking
for the new training facility they will share with the Lakers
roughly one month away.
</P>
<P>
   Kings vice president of special projects Rogie Vachon said
bidding by construction companies will conclude in the next couple
of weeks. The new facility, which will be located on what currently
is a vacant lot on Nash Street between Mariposa and Grand avenues
in El Segundo, is expected to open sometime between the start of
October and the middle of November.
</P>
<P>
   ``In early March, we should be able to start to push some
dirt,'' Vachon said. ``It's pretty exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The training facility will have two rinks - one NHL-sized and
the other Olympic-sized - and a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Trials of Duchesne (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   It's been a season of struggles for defenseman Steve Duchesne,
who signed a three-year, $11.25-million contract with the Kings
last summer. But Duchesne's three-point performance in Thursday's
3-2 victory over Chicago was a sign his struggles may be lifting.
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne insisted he's not been bothered by recent trade rumors,
and one reason for that is he has a no-trade clause in his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Of the possibility of being dealt, Duchesne said, ``I don't
worry about being traded. There's not much I can do about it
(rumors). I don't want to worry about it right now. I'm going to
worry only about the things I can control.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne admitted he wishes he'd been able to exercise greater
control over the way most of his season has gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a struggle,'' he said. ``I didn't come here to lose.
I didn't come here to not play well. I'm definitely disappointed
with the way it's been going. Confidence has a lot to do with it.
You start with a little snowball and it keeps rolling and rolling
and rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I came here was I definitely thought we would have
an unbelieveable season. At this point of my career, it's not a
matter of getting a lot of points. It's a matter of winning. Even
if I had 50 points now, I would still be devastated because we're
not winning. When you lose, it's not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   San Jose was without its captain, center Owen Nolan, who has a
back injury, and right wing Ron Stern, who has left the team
temporarily to tend to a personal matter. ... Kings winger Steve
McKenna, sidelined since undergoing abdominal surgery a month ago,
could return to the lineup sometime in March. ``It's all
conditioning now,'' he said. ``I have no pain at all. It's getting
frustrating watching the games. It got frustrating about three
weeks ago.''

PEDREGON, AMATO SHUT OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA -- Nothing is guaranteed in drag racing.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Cruz Pedregon and Joe Amato found that out the hard way
after failing to qualify for the 39th Winternationals at Pomona
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, who last failed to qualify at Atlanta in April of 1996,
could muster no quicker then a 5.093.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough way to begin the season, not to qualify,'' Amato
said. ``We just had a lot of problems (Saturday). The track was a
little tight and we shook the tires. We were just too conservative.
But it's a long season and we'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon's failure to make the 16-car field brought back
nightmares of last season when he failed to make the 1998
Winternationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to us this weekend is surprising because we had
a great test session in Phoenix two weeks ago,'' said Pedregon, who
went on to qualify on the pole 12 times enroute to a third-place
finish in points last year. We got behind when we didn't get down
track in the first two sessions. In the final session the car left
hard and it was on a good pass, but then the supercharger
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Top Fuel veteran driver Cory McClenathan was noticeably missing
from Saturday's two qualifying sessions.
</P>
<P>
   McClenathan, who qualified eighth with his pass of 4.631
attained Friday, was treated for a minor gastro-intestinal and
dehydration condition and released from Pomona Valley Hospital
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He became ill Friday night and was checked by NHRA medical
officials Saturday morning and advised to seek further medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
   McClenathan, who finished second in points last season, is
expected to compete when final eliminations begin at 11 this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pedregon, the eldest of the drag racing Pedregon brothers,
has been very busy this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon, the driver of the Penthouse Magazine Nitro Funny Car
owned by Jim Dunn, is also driving in the Federal Mogul Dragster
class for Team In-N-Out Burger.
</P>
<P>
   The major difference between (the two cars) is that the funny
car is about 50 mph faster, said Pedregon, who won two national
events in the Nitro Funny Car class last season. I personally don't
notice the difference in speed. Both cars run on nitro, both have
the same clutch systems and both have the same fuel systems. On the
track, both cars seem to pull the same.
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon had originally planned to drive the In-N-Out dragster
for the entire season, but was recently named to drive the
Penthouse Pontiac Firebird when Kelly Magrath had a recurring eye
injury.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only event that he will drive the dragster in
national event competition.

CREW CHIEF VITAL TO FORCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA _ How important is the crew chief in National Hot Rod
Association drag racing?
</P>
<P>
   One only has to examine the career of veteran Funny Car driver
John Force to find the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Before signing Hall-of-Fame tuner Austin Coil, Force was a
journeyman. He had never tasted victory in a national event, had
advanced to just four final rounds in seven seasons and had
finished no higher then eighth in the Winston point standings.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Coil in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Force, a Bell Gardens native, has since become a NHRA icon,
winning 70 national events en route to an unprecedented eight Funny
Car championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been a great partnership,'' said Coil, who has
tuned Force's race car for 110 final rounds. ``Force knows nearly
nothing about mechanical things, and I know nearly nothing about
the promotional end of the business. It's been a very good marriage
and, between the both of us, we possess all the skills needed to
have a top-quality race team.''
</P>
<P>
   Most believe success depends on the crew chief. Drag racing is a
sport that depends between 60-90 percent on engine tuneup, and
success or failure can often hinge on the decisions of one man --
the crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (80-90 percent) is a little high,'' said veteran
driver Kenny Bernstein who, in his 20-year association with
Budweiser, has worked with two of the best crew chiefs, Dale
Armstrong and Lee Beard. ``It's more like 60 percent (crew chief).
You could have the best crew and the best crew chief, but if I
don't do my job on the (starting line), you're not going to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination (driver and crew chief). I do think,
mechanically, that our sport, because we don't have pit stops, we
have to be mechanically sound because there is nothing I can do as
a driver to make the performance better.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the top duty of the crew chief, who some have compared
to a head football coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good comparison,'' said Roland Leong, tuner for Ron
Capps' Copenhagen Chevrolet Camaro Funny Car. ``A crew chief's job
No. 1 is to get (the crew) to do it the way you want it done. I try
to teach why we do something because I believe that a guy will do a
better job if he knows why he is doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has worked for Leong. He tuned legend Don ``Snake'' Prudhomme
to Victory Lane in the 1965 Winternationals and helped turn around
Prudhomme's Funny Car effort since replacing Tom Anderson in May
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But while a crew chief's success or failure can rely on his
people skills, it's mechanical experience that matters most. He
must make the call to either back down the power of a
6,000-horsepower engine, or to ``go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew chief's primary job is to evaluate the race track
based on the weather conditions and arrive at a setup that will
make your car go down the track and be fast enough to win (a round)
or qualify,'' Coil said. ``There is probably 100 variables on each
one of these race cars, between clutch and fuel systems and engine
tuneup. It's up to our own judgment to look at the race track and
make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, that was based purely on the crew chief's experience.
Today, he gets help from in-car computer systems that provide data
with which to make an educated decision.
</P>
<P>
   John Force Racing has been one the leaders in this regard. It
has provided Coil and co-crew chiefs Bernie Fedderly and John
Medlin with the Castrol Technology Center, a state-of-the-art
computer system that includes racing programs and weather station.
</P>
<P>
   Coil has created a program that allows him to make a decision
based on previously tested superchargers, with the amount of
horsepower percentage they have decided for a particular run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it's a seat of the pants kind of feel,'' Coil said.
``Hopefully, we make the correct call that will give us enough
power to the tires to run real good, but not so much that it spins
the tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather conditions at the time of the run play a big part in
that call. So Coil, who must predict what those conditions might
be, also keeps a laptop computer in the team's tow truck, enabling
him to make las-minute adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he believes that, sometimes, the computer age can hinder
more than aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier to some degree,'' said Coil, who also tuned
former driver Frank Hawley and his Chi-Town Hustler entry to a pair
of Funny Car championships in the early 1980s. ``Not as much as you
might think. Although, the computer will provide us with enough
background knowledge, it gives us more to work from when we have to
make these calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition has these computers, too, so you have to be so
much closer to being perfect than you did years ago. The job isn't
any easier. If anything, it's become more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still an educated guess, and sometimes its a
hit-and-miss. But the end result, more often than not, is you're
going to have real good performance.''

BIG HOLE TOO DEEP FOR ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Arizona State is a better basketball team than it was
when it beat Washington by 24 points in Tempe more than a month
ago. But Washington is a different team altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's rematch against the Sun Devils at Hec Edmundson
Pavilion, the transformed Huskies made their first eight shots, 12
of their first 13 and 14 of their first 16.
</P>
<P>
   All that led to a 32-13 lead midway through the first half, and
if there's one rule of the road, it's that it is awfully difficult
to come back from 19 points down on the home court of an opponent
that is playing very well at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the Sun Devils fought back but lost, 93-85. ASU
senior forward Mike Batiste had a season-high 28 points, 22 in the
second half, and scored his 1,000th career point.
</P>
<P>
   But that was wiped out by the Huskies shooting 67.3 percent from
the field, their best of the season, the highest against ASU since
1992 and the fifth-highest all-time, and something totally foreign
to first-year ASU Coach Rob Evans, who built a reputation for
defense during his six years at Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had anybody shoot that kind of percentage against a
team of mine,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of it was the Huskies (14-7), who beat No. 10 Arizona on
Thursday and have won seven of eight games to extend their Pac-10
record to 7-4. With senior guard Donald Watts now healthy, and
freshman Senque Carey established at the point, the Huskies have a
lot going for them other than Todd MacCulloch, their 7-foot,
280-pound senior center.
</P>
<P>
   Not that MacCulloch isn't a load. He made 10 of 11 shots for 22
points, and added 11 rebounds. The two-time defending national
field goal percentage leader, MacCulloch again tops the nation at a
crisp 70 percent. But he has help.
</P>
<P>
   Junior guard Deon Luton, who made 1 of 8 shots in Tempe, came
through with a season-high 27 points, going 9 of 11 from the field.
Carey, who will be the next big thing to hit the Pac-10, if he
isn't already, added 18 points and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a long time ago,'' Luton said of the first meeting.
``We just wanted to redeem ourselves. That's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Luton, who holds every Washington three-point shooting record,
has made 27 of his last 47 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally found my rhythm,'' he said. ``It's looking good
right now. I feel like I'll make every shot I take.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, 10-0 at home this season, were so efficient on
offense _ both in transition and half-court _ that they relegated
ASU's five turnovers, the lowest total for the Sun Devils in more
than six years, to an interesting but insignificant footnote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty hot, but we just didn't defend them very
well,'' Evans said. ``If a team shoots almost 70 percent on you, it
means they're getting a lot of good looks. We're a better defensive
team than we showed tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we were supposed to do. We took care of the
basketball. We shoot almost 50 percent (47.9) and we did a credible
job on the boards. We just didn't defend like we've got to
defend.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU (13-10, 5-6) regrouped and used a 13-0 run to get within six
with 6:47 left in the first half. Then Luton and MacCulloch helped
push the Huskies' lead to 50-37 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Batiste scored the Sun Devils first 10 points of the second
half, but Washington led by as many as 16 and held a 78-64 lead
with 5:47 remaining. That's when ASU mounted its final charge,
outscoring Washington, 12-4, to close to within six with 2:07 left.
But no closer. The Huskies made enough free throws down the stretch
to keep the Sun Devils at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward Bobby Lazor had 16 points and six assists for ASU
before fouling out late, and sophomore point guard Alton Mason, in
his first year at ASU, scored a season-best 14 points and added six
assists. But guard Eddie House, whose clutch play in the second
half helped the Sun Devils beat Washington State in Pullman on
Thursday, never got it going.
</P>
<P>
   House, the No. 2 scorer in the Pac-10 (19.9 coming in), made
just 4 of 16 shots and had 10 points. He did add nine rebounds,
after grabbing a career-high 11 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ASU's offense wasn't the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got easy looks,'' Batiste said. ``We didn't get to their
shooters. That really hurt us. . . . That's not the way Rob Evans
teaches defense.'' &QL;

WEARIN' OF THE GREEN BRINGS LUCK  
 COYOTES BLANK BLACKHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Green was the color of the day.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd at America West Arena saw it Saturday as the
Coyotes donned their new green jerseys for the first time to much
acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jyrki Lumme saw it as another chance to get the green
light offensively, snapping in two goals to give him four in his
past four games.
</P>
<P>
   And green was the color of Chicago Blackhawks Coach Dirk
Graham's face after he watched a stomach-turning, 3-0 loss, his
team's fifth in six games to wrap up a disastrous 1-5-1 trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough. You work hard and you still see the same bad
results,'' said Blackhawks defenseman Dave Manson, a one-time
Coyote. ``We were getting close to turning the corner and then we
lose another wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game had the feel of a playoff game, which is the
closest the bumbling Blackhawks will ever get to the postseason. It
was a tight-checking game filled with big hits, a little
controversy, and several standing ovations _ most of which were
directed at Coyotes All-Star goalie Nikolai Khabibulin during his
28-save performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an interesting game,'' Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick
said. ``There was a lot to cheer about. There was a lot of good
hits, a couple really nice goals and some unbelievable saves by
Niki. It was a fun game to play, but I betcha it was just as fun to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   It really was fun for Lumme, who came within inches of scoring
his first career NHL hat trick after snaring the two goals, his
sixth and seventh, during a span of 2:03 in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been nice. I haven't had a hat trick since I
was a kid growing up in Finland,'' said Lumme, who last scored two
goals in a game in December 1993 while playing for Vancouver. ``I
guess it would have been one of those things you could say when
you're old and gray. But I'll just take the win.''
</P>
<P>
   So will the Coyotes (27-12-10), who now are undefeated in 11 of
their past 13 games, going 6-2-5 and improving to 2-0-1 after three
games on their five-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Up next are two very winnable games Monday and Wednesday against
visiting San Jose and Los Angeles, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well. We played 60 minutes for a change,'' said
Phoenix center Daniel Briere, who also scored a goal, his eighth.
``This feels good, especially with six regulars out of the
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who improved to 15 games over .500 for the first
time since March 31, 1985, were without captain Keith Tkachuk (back
strain), fellow forwards Dallas Drake (separated shoulder), Brad
Isbister (hernia) and Mike Sullivan (ribs), and defensemen Gerald
Diduck (knee) and Deron Quint (shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   They also lost enforcer Jim Cummins midway through the second
after he drew a game misconduct for a questionable hit on Chicago's
Brad Brown. Cummins, who returned from a three-game suspension for
abusing an official during a fight in Philadelphia, badly elbowed
Brown in the chin and could be facing further banishment.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was furious over the incident and even more irate that
his players didn't seek retribution on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a guy pretty much knocked out today and there was no
response,'' Graham bellowed. ``That to me is something I find very
hard to understand and it was a guy who battles for his teammates
every day and there was nothing done.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Chicago seemed to get back at Cummins by taking
liberties with Roenick, a former Hawk, who was involved in several
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously if (Cummins) is in the game, somebody is going to go
after him. But he got kicked out,'' Blackhawks captain Chris
Chelios said. ``I think guys responded by going after Jeremy.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick said he had no problem being the center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all right,'' he said. ``They're running around hitting
our guys, slashing our guys, punching our guys, running our guys.
You don't sit back. You have to come back with some of your own. If
they want to play that way, that's the way we'll play.'' &QL;

MCDYESS ON HOT SEAT  
 INDECISION BIG PART OF LEAVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ About 18 months ago, Antonio McDyess stood at a news
conference in Phoenix and talked about how happy he was to have
escaped the Nuggets. He looked like a very happy man. But he
wasn't. Not really. His new uniform was the first sign that he was
about to assume an unlikely, uncomfortable role.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns had given him a jersey with No. 34. It was like asking
a saint to play the devil. McDyess had Charles Barkley's old number
and none of his profanity, much less his personality.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess spent the rest of a season as though he were an actor in
an ill-fitting costume. He said his lines. He tried to fit in, but,
as it turned out, he never did. At least, he said he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year later, McDyess was back in a Nuggets jersey
with his old number, 24. This was no costume. It was like a
familiar suit of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels so good, it feels like home,'' McDyess said last
Monday as he stood in the Nuggets' locker room at McNichols Arena.
``I feel like I'm really part of something. I need that. I'm that
kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   McDyess returns tonight to a place in which he says he was never
really comfortable. In a somewhat appropriate twist, this time
there probably will be no doubts. No interpretations. America West
Arena could be very uncomfortable for McDyess when he is introduced
before the Denver-Suns tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   Boos?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, no question,'' McDyess said. ``I think the fans think
I'm a traitor or I disrespected them for coming back to Denver. But
I hope they can see my point. I wanted to feel comfortable. I think
that should matter.'' &QL; 
Back and forth
</P>
<P>
   To Suns Coach Danny Ainge, it does. But Ainge also is not
certain what to make of a McMystery. He's heard rumors. He's been
handed conflicting reports as to the reasons McDyess turned down a
seven-year, $86.5 million offer from the Suns for a six-year, $67.5
million contract with the Nuggets. But, in the end, he says he
never heard any of it from McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that disappointed me the most was that he wasn't man
enough to let us know what he wanted to do,'' Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge's disappointment might be rooted in the fact that McDyess
never really knew either. He admits he was reluctant to tell Ainge
exactly what he was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably didn't know,'' McDyess said. ``But I felt the team
wasn't mine. I didn't real feel like a part of the team. I didn't
feel that it was my place to say anything. We had a lot of veteran
guys _ Jason Kidd, Rex Chapman, Danny Manning, ``Hot Rod''
Williams. Those guys had been there. It seemed like it was more
their team.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime McDyess friends and former teammates in Denver, Phoenix
and even Quitman, Miss., his hometown, unfailingly call him a nice
guy who is afraid to offend anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hardly ever tells anybody no,'' said Denver's injured
rookie Kelly McCarty, a high school teammate and close friend of
the McDyess family in tiny Quitman. ``He doesn't want to hurt
anybody's feelings. You can hardly be mad at him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not mad, perhaps. But McDyess' shy, somewhat withdrawn nature
has forced him, unwittingly perhaps, into a difficult corner as he
returns to Phoenix after just one season with the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   After he re-signed with Denver, he explained his discomfort with
the Suns by saying at that he wasn't allowed to post-up against
smaller, less explosive forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how to post-up anymore,'' he said. ``. . .
That's hurting me right now. . . .I was a lot better here than in
my first two years in Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge dimisses the comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compare `Dice's statistics in his first two years in the NBA
to his stats in his third year, and I would take the Dice with the
Phoenix Suns any day of the week,'' Ainge said of the 6-foot-9
forward, who is beginning his fourth professional season. ``He
shoots 54 percent from the field as opposed to 47 or 48. That's a
big factor. He has more steals, more blocks, fewer turnovers and
and he won 56 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel the need to defend myself about how I treated
Dice.''
</P>
<P>
   McDyess' former Phoenix teammates believe complaints in Denver
about his role in Phoenix are further examples of his uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, you have to make your own decisions, and in his
behalf, he said he wasn't comfortable here,'' Suns forward George
McCloud said. ``You can't put yourself in a situation where you're
not comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, to leave Jason Kidd, to leave this style of
play . . . He should have realized he was leaving what was best for
him. I'm not saying the Denver situation is bad, but it doesn't fit
his style. He's an up-and-down, open-court kind of player.'' &QL; 
Too nice a guy
</P>
<P>
   McCloud, joined Kidd and Chapman on a wild journey to Denver on
the night he anguished over whether to sign with Denver or Phoenix,
because they wanted him to be comfortable. McDyess initiated the
trip with a call to Kidd. McCloud, Kidd and Chapman acted as
friends with their own interest. Make no mistake, they had hoped to
talk McDyess out of Denver and back to Phoenix. But they were
friends, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called them and talked to them,'' said McDyess, who
expressed initial reluctance at signing when he arrived at Denver
and was told that the Nuggest had renounced the rights to his
friend, LaPhonso Ellis, ``They felt that this was not the place for
me. I guess out of friendship they came up here. But at that point,
I didn't want to talk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, McDyess never did talk to McCloud, Chapman or
Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   They were never got inside McNichols. They sat in a limo outside
of the arena during a blizzard as McDyess sat inside, watching and
agonizing during an ice hockey game. McCloud is convinced they were
kept out the arena, because they and the Nuggets knew the same
thing about McDyess. He couldn't say no. It was just a question of
who spoke to him last.
</P>
<P>
   ``That night, I felt, if he had talked to Jason, Rex or George,
he would have been a Phoenix Sun,'' said guard Nick Van Exel, who
signed with Denver last summer after several seasons with the Los
Angeles Lakers. ``Dice is just that type of person. He's real nice,
real considerate of other people's feelings. He doesn't want to
hurt anybody's feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Would McDyess be in a Suns uniform tonight if he had spoken to
any of three?
</P>
<P>
   ``Could have been, yeah,'' he said. ``You know, Phoenix never
did anything wrong or bad. I had a friendship with Jason, George
and Rex. They're great, great friends. I felt that I owed it to
them to at least call. At the same time, I felt I had to make my
own decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets, aware of McDyess' uncertainty, acted in way to help
McDyess decide. Re-enter Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   When Nuggest General Manager Dan Issel discovered that Chapman,
Kidd and McCloud were waiting outside McNichols, he called the
training camp at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, south
of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Issel ordered Van Exel, Coach Mike D'Antoni and new assistant
John Lucas to drive up the road through a blizzard. They came in
from the cold and saved a player the Suns believe Denver had been
courting all summer.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel and McDyess played in Houston in a summer pick-up
league run by Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always were on the same team, for some strange reason,''
said Lucas, who organized the league before he joined Denver's
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel downplays his role in what McCloud has called an A-1
recruiting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know he was interested in coming back to
Denver until about three weeks before it happened,'' he said. ``I
always thought it was either Phoenix or Houston. It's not like I
gave him $15 million under the table or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   An agent switch is another factor in a plot that, for the Suns,
might as well be an Oliver Stone script. McDyess fired Arm Tellem,
who brokered the deal in which the Suns acquired the 24-year-old
power forward in a three-way deal that resulted in Denver getting
four draft picks _ two in the first round and two in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Suns President Jerry Colangelo said he and Tellem have had a
good, long-term working relationship. In Phoenix, at least, that
suggested the outlines of an agreement that would have kept McDyess
in a Suns uniform for several years. &QL; 
New agent, new tack
</P>
<P>
   ``But it had nothing to do with Phoenix,'' McDyess said. ``I
just didn't think he (Tellem) paid enough attention to me. I almost
never heard from him.''
</P>
<P>
   McDyess proceeded to hire Tony Dutt, a Houston agent who also
represents Van Exel and McCarty. Coincidence? The Suns don't think
so. Colangelo has said that when McDyess fired Tellem, he had a
hunch the forward would not stay.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess also suggested last week that he was unhappy with
anybody who had a hand in the deal that sent him to Phoenix in the
first place. That would include Tellem and then-Nuggets General
Manager Allan Bristow, who once nearly exchanged blows with Tellem
while in Charlotte over contract negotiations for Kendall Gill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really my choice,'' McDyess said. ``Then, I had
intended to spend the rest of my career here. But it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what was right for Antonio. I might have wound up
spending six or seven years at a place I really didn't want to be.
Look, the fans were great to me. I hope they can understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, he will hear whether they do. &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - Brad Brown lay face down on the ice, separated from
his stick and his senses. For a long time, he didn't move.
</P>
<P>
   When medics finally helped him to his feet, the Chicago
Blackhawks defenseman returned to the bench, where he sat the
remainder of the game in a daze, face pale, his blue eyes wide and
unblinking.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Coach Dirk Graham called it a ``vicious'' hit.
</P>
<P>
   Brown agreed as he gingerly rubbed his chin and touched his
reddened lower lip. He expected to be hit. But he never saw Jim
Cummins' ``flying elbow'' coming.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Section 227 did either.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes drew another sellout crowd Saturday, and like every
hockey game at America West Arena, only three-fourths of the paying
public had the luxury of seeing the entire rink.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000 seated in the ``limited view'' sections in the north
balcony couldn't see one end of the ice or the net below.
</P>
<P>
   If they saw Cummins unload on Brown, they watched it on a big
screen or a TV monitor, like senators who watched taped testimony
of Monica Lewinsky during arguments at the president's impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine going to a football game and not being able to see one
end zone. Or attending the Phoenix Open and being told you have a
restricted-view ticket.
</P>
<P>
   You can watch Tiger Woods tee off at No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't see him putt.
</P>
<P>
   How many Diamondbacks fans would attend a game knowing in
advance they could see first, second and third base, but not home?
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes sell out because their supporters are the most avid
sports fans in town. They pack the place night after night, even
though a fourth of the ticket buyers know they can see goalie
Nikolai Khabibulin at work for only one period, or a third of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   That's ridiculous. Hockey fans in this town deserve better.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Quick and his family love the Coyotes. Quick, a border
patrol agent, his wife, Sharon, and their two children (both wore
Keith Tkachuk jerseys) drove three hours from their home in Yuma to
attend Saturday's matinee. Two weeks ago, they purchased a family
package. For $48, they received four $9.50 tickets in a ``limited
view'' section, four hot dogs and four soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets in hand, they climbed six flights of stairs to the upper
concourse. Catching their breath, they marched on, up, up, up, 34
steps to the next-to-top row of Section 227.
</P>
<P>
   Weary, they sat down and gazed at the translucent sheet of ice
below. Three fourths of the rink was visible. From the rafters, a
Zamboni machine appeared no bigger than a child's toy, an inch
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's a limited view,'' Mark said. He laughed.
``They're not kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quicks didn't complain, though. They were excited just to be
inside the arena and part of the howling fun. But they had to watch
the best moments on a screen.
</P>
<P>
   From their seats they couldn't see the end of Tony Amonte's
breakaway, when the Blackhawks star skated headlong toward the
Coyotes net, unguarded, working the puck, his long dark hair lank
with sweat flying out behind him. Unless they watched a screen,
they didn't see Amonte draw back his stick and fire. They didn't
see the masked man in the net turn the shot away _ one of three
breakaways Khabibulin foiled in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Fans in the north balcony didn't see Jyrki Lumme score twice in
the second period. Before the light came on, the puck disappeared
from view below them.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't see Brown go down in a heap. They saw only one third
of Khabibulin's masterful performance, his fifth shutout of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes chose the occasion to unveil their new uniform tops.
Shawn Hunter-green, the jerseys are designed to portray ``a true
expression of the American Southwest.'' They feature a coyote head,
a rising crescent moon, desert mountains, cactuses, lizards, the
Grand Canyon, and I think I saw two blue-corn enchiladas with rice
and beans.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes now have three uniforms and one less-than-suitable
place to play at home. Hopefully, a vote in May will be the first
step in making a proposed new arena in Scottsdale a reality.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes need their own place. Something is wrong when the
soloist sings ``Oh, say, can you see . . .'' and a fourth of the
crowd mutters, ``Not really.'' &QL;

COMEBACK OF THE CADDIE  
 AREA COURSES REVIVE TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Once on the brink of extinction, small groups of
caddies have been spotted recently, ``looping'' their way back into
existence on Arizona's fairways and greens.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the introduction of electric and gas-powered carts,
one of golf's oldest traditions has been locked in a battle for
survival. The irony is that carts tend to produce slower play,
damage the course, make for unnecessary distractions and ultimately
lead to a style of play that never was meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Caddies also provide a more intimate experience. A good caddie
is a player's consultant, coach and psychologist rolled into one.
At times, he will praise the shot, and at other times not. A good
caddie will give advice only when asked, and stay positive in the
face of the worst hacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing golf with the aid of a caddie is such an outstanding
experience,'' said Director of Golf Bruce McNee, who has developed
a caddie program at Phantom Horse Golf Club (formerly the Pointe at
South Mountain).
</P>
<P>
   ``A caddie allows you to slow down a little in this fast-paced
world we live in, so you can stop and smell the roses.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar thoughts have popped up at other public courses, such as
the Wigwam in Litchfield Park, where the newly founded Caddie
Foundation of Arizona (CFAZ) provides its services to resort
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, caddies always have been available at some of the
elite private courses in Arizona. But the movement to stand by your
man on public tracts is a relatively new development, at least in
this state.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so great about hiring a caddie is, it works out well
for both parties,'' noted Doris Siefker, the founder and president
of the CFAZ, a non-profit organization that is seeking a grant from
the U.S. Golf Association to further develop its program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The player benefits, because he gets to play golf the way it
was meant to be played. And the kids get to earn a little money and
be around a great game, which strengthens their foundation of
values. That's so important, and it's really the reason that I
founded the CFAZ _ for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the CFAZ and Phantom Horse have a pool of caddies that
range from junior golfers to older, more savvy bag-toters. Prices
range from $40 to $55 per bag, or $70 to $80 for two bags. Caddie
fees are added to the green fee, although the Phantom Horse deducts
$10 off its posted green fee when a caddie is employed. Tips for
good service also are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Several other courses of note also offer caddie services, such
as the Troon North, Legend Trail and the Boulders, which uses
Caddie Master Enterprises, the same group that supplies caddies to
Augusta National. But those can be expensive outings, as the green
fees range from $155 at Legend Trail to $200 at the Boulders and
Troon North _ about twice what it costs to play at Phantom Horse or
the Wigwam.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so caddies aren't cheap. But it is a treat to be taken care
of so well. And there is a market for them, according to Jon
DeBuvitz, the caddie master at Phantom Horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot of research on the subject before we started our
program, and I found out that caddies are actually making a
comeback on the East Coast and in the Midwest,'' DeBuvitz said.
``It's just a matter of getting the word out, because requests for
caddies, especially this time of year, seem to be coming in more
and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, caddies were commonplace. The term caddie
comes from the word cadet, which was the name given to those who
attended to the golf needs of King Charles I of England and Mary
Queen of Scots in the 16th century. From that point, caddies were
part of the game up until the mid-1950s, when carts changed golf's
path dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 40 years, most of what the general public knew
about caddies and their sometimes nomadic lifestyles came through
professional golf or the movies. Among the flicks that kept the
occupation from completely dying out were ``The Caddy,'' a dud done
by Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis; ``Caddyshack,'' the classic
starring Bill Murray and Michael O'Keefe as caddie Danny Noonan;
and the more recent ``Tin Cup,'' in which Cheech Marin tried to
keep the wayward Kevin Costner on course.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Goldwater, one of the pioneers of Arizona golf, remembers a
day when caddies were a integral part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out as a caddie when I was 10 years old,'' recalled
Goldwater, 88, who toted bags with his late brother, Barry, at
Phoenix Country Club. ``It was a great thing, and we got about
seventy-five cents a bag. It kept us involved in the game and we
made a little spending money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was so different back then. In fact, most of the great
players of our day, fellows like (Ben) Hogan, (Bryon) Nelson and
(Sam) Snead all started out as caddies. That's where all of the
professionals got their start. Caddie programs were breeding
grounds for the pro ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater said he recently employed a caddie at the Phoenix Open
for $50 a bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nowadays, most of the fellows that caddie are older and do
it for a living,'' he said. ``I just wish we could get more kids
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Spiller, a senior at Desert Vista, is one of those
exceptions. When he's not working on his game, Spiller works as a
caddie at Phantom Horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love golf, and I love being outdoors, so this is the perfect
job for me,'' he said. ``I've done it five or six times, and I'd do
it more if the opportunities were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Miller, a freshman at Chandler High School, works for the
CFAZ. He said being a caddie ``provides me with good money for just
five or six hours of work. Plus the tips are pretty good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot better than flipping burgers at McDonald's,'' he
noted. ``You get fresh air and it's peaceful. It's also got me
interested in golf, possibly as a career.''
</P>
<P>
   It works both ways, said Phantom Horse's DeBuvitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hear (from the players) is how great they feel after
playing a round of golf with a caddie,'' he said. ``Walking the
course gives you such a different perspective, and it's good
exercise, something you don't get when you ride in a cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caddies also keep you on a nice pace, and can do so many
things for you. In fact, I recently put together a list of 15
responsibilities that our caddies must know before they pick up a
bag. People enjoy that. In fact, they tell us there is no better
tradition in golf than playing with a caddie.'' &QL;

VISIT TO ARPAIO'S JAIL HOUSE WAS A WARM-UP FOR TYSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Mike Tyson visited Sheriff Joe Arpaio's jail complex
about six weeks ago to counsel juvenile inmates.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Tyson was just getting reacquainted.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, he is back in a very similar place, the Montgomery
County Detention Center in Maryland. He could find himself there
until next year as the result of a sentence Friday, when he was
ordered back to jail for one year on misdemeanor assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   An irony is that his visit to Arpaio's jails served as testimony
in his behalf before Judge Stephen Johnson handed down the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The visit on Christmas Eve was part of concerted public
relations campaign to remake Tyson's image. It started with his
arrival in the Valley last October, when he began to train at
Phoenix Madison Square Garden for his victory over Frans Botha on
Jan. 16. He passed out turkeys and toys. He kissed babies. He paid
for the funeral of a young Valley girl killed in a crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   But the cell door swung shut behind him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to say whether Tyson's angry outbursts in
television interviews from Las Vegas during the week before the
Botha bout torpedoed the PR blitz. But the judge and prosecuting
attorneys could have watched. All they had to do was pick up the
remote control and punch the power button. The video replays of
Tyson's rage couldn't have helped.
</P>
<P>
   Tick tick tick . . . He sounded like a time bomb, which was
exactly the word used by the prosecution to describe the former
heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   What's next for this 32-year old fighter, whose life and career
appear to be in free fall?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's pretty much history,'' said veteran boxing
promoter Bob Arum, who has never held promotional rights to Tyson.
``It may very well be we've seen the last of Tyson as a major
fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Tyson is allowed to fight again, he is getting old.
He'll be 33 in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the age of 32, you're on the down side,'' Tyson advisor
Shelly Finkel said. ``You have about another year or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there always seems to be another chance in the ring, no
matter how dire his personal life. Within 24 hours of the sentence,
there were reports that German Axel Schulz had agreed to be his
next opponent if Tyson is able to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Kushner, Schulz's manager in the United States, told the
``New'' ``York Daily News'' that he ``already sent a letter of
acceptance'' to Tyson's camp hours before the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Las Vegas' MGM Grand Hotel said it still is holding
open April 24 as the date for Tyson's second bout since he bit
Evander Holyfield's ears in June 1997. There's a possibility that
he could fight in April while on bail. His training equipment is
stacked and waiting at central Phoenix's Madison Square Garden,
which will soon be renamed after him and Ricky Ricardo, a trainer
at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   To be released, however, he would have to withdraw a no-contest
plea and ask for a trial on charges that he assaulted two
middle-age men after a minor auto accident Aug. 31. If found guilty
in trial, he would face a maximum of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   He also could return to prison if Indiana rules that he violated
terms of his parole on a rape conviction. He served three years of
a six-year sentence. His parole expires March 15.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a looming possibility that the Nevada State
Athletic Commission will again revoke his license. He won his
license back last fall on condition of staying out of trouble. At
the hearing, he told the commission he had done nothing wrong in
the auto accident. Friday's sentence says otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   So does his temper. &QL;

COYOTES, KHABIBULIN NOT NEGOTIATING YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Colorado locked up  &UR; Patrick Roy and Anaheim did the
same with  &UR; Guy Hebert, will the Coyotes be the next club to re-sign
their No. 1 goalie, All-Star  &UR; Nikolai Khabibulin, before he becomes
a restricted free agent in July?
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been no negotiations whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Odd? Perhaps. But both Roy and Hebert were due to become
unrestricted free agents this summer, which put a premium on their
teams to do something now. Phoenix has the first chance to
negotiate with the vastly improving elite-level netminder, who
blanked the Chicago Blackhawks on Saturday, 3-0. The team also has
the right to match any offer the 26-year-old may receive on an
offer sheet, rare for a Group II free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget, a few teams in recent years have made major
overtures for top-level talent. Detroit decided to match Carolina's
obscene offer sheet to  &UR; Sergei Fedorov last season. Colorado
matched the Rangers' equally absurd offer for  &UR; Joe Sakic. And
remember the Chicago Blackhawks, who tried to bankrupt the Winnipeg
Jets in a similar deal for  &UR; Keith Tkachuk?
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche plunked down $15 million over three years to keep
Roy, the Ducks $12 million over three to keep Hebert. The Coyotes
likely will need to spend at least $9 million, maybe more, if they
re-sign Khabibulin to a three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his contract situation, Khabibulin said after a
recent practice he is trying not to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to think about money right now,'' he said.
``I've got too many other things to think about. I'd like to get it
settled, but if it doesn't happen until the summertime, that's
OK.'' &QL; 
Murphy's law &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Larry Murphy's &UR; NHL record for appearing in the most games ever
by a defenseman is astonishing. He played in his 1,447th game on
Friday when his Detroit Red Wings met rival Colorado, eclipsing
 &UR; Tim Horton's &UR; old mark.
</P>
<P>
   What's just as impressive, however, is the fact the 19-year
veteran has missed only three of his past 455 games. And he can
still produce offensively. He entered the weekend third overall
among defensemen in scoring with 34 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be that durable for that amount of time in this league is
very special,'' said Boston's  &UR; Ray Bourque. ``I know how tough it
is to keep your health in this league when you're getting hit left
and right and the wear and tear of the schedule and the grind of
things and what it's like to go out and compete every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murph has played one year less than I have and he's played
more games than me. And I haven't missed all that many. To be where
he is now and the amount of years he's played is pretty scary.'' &QL; 
The King and I &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR legend  &UR; Richard Petty has been hired by the Carolina
Hurricanes to do advertising spots for the NHL team as its gears up
to move into its new stadium next season in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In a television commercial, Petty is seen driving a souped-up
Zamboni with 'Canes center  &UR; Keith Primeau in the passenger seat.
The club is hoping Petty's popularity in the area will help win
over more hockey fans, an endeavor Petty is taking very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sell 'em on hockey,'' Petty said, ``but I think I can
slow 'em down enough so that if they take a look at hockey they'll
like it.'' &QL; 
Cap-sized &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it in Tampa Bay? Just when you think it can't get any
worse, the Lightning get zapped by the equally-struggling
Washington Capitals, 10-1, the other day.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps scored eight of their goals in one period. They scored
four of them in a span of 2:39 and five in just 3:54.  &UR; Peter Bondra
scored four goals himself, giving him 27 in 28 career games against
the dead Bolts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly the lowest point I've seen in my seven years
here,'' Tampa's  &UR; Rob Zamuner said. &QL; 
Fine print
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's just plain fun to scan the transaction items in
the back of the sports pages. If you did last week, you may have
noticed a seemingly innocuous line about the Toronto Maple Leafs
assigning center  &UR; Dallas Eakins to St. John's of the American
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing special, right? Well, not until you dig a little deeper
and learn that St. John's is now the 15th different team Eakins has
played for during his 10-year career, and the 13th in just the past
five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Eakins has made NHL stops in Miami, St. Louis,
Winnipeg, Phoenix, the Rangers and Toronto. In the minors, he's
passed through Worcester, Binghamton, Baltimore, Springfield, New
Haven, Moncton, Cincinnati and the Chicago Wolves. &QL; 
Drake mistake? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While visiting with reporters recently in Los Angeles,  &UR; Colin
 &UR; Campbell, the NHL's new disciplinarian when it comes to fines and
suspensions, said he may have erred by handing out only a four-game
punishment to the Coyotes'  &UR; Dallas Drake for his December hit on
the Kings'  &UR; Doug Bodger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll admit it. I'm not perfect,'' Campbell said. ``There are
(suspensions) I look back on and I look back on that one and that's
one I'd like to have back again.'' &QL;

NO ARTISTIC TRIUMPH FOR CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You remember those bullet polls showing so many fans
not caring if the NBA ever played another game and wishing it just
would go away? This was their night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers and Celtics set back David Stern's goodwill
reconstruction plan a few light years Saturday night with a truly
noxious performance before a near sellout of hostages at the
FleetCenter. In a game no one deserved to win, the Celtics
outlasted the Cavs, 77-73.
</P>
<P>
   This was as close to consumer fraud as you're going to see,
especially if you happen to have a vested interest in the fortunes
of the Cavaliers. They scored 32 points in the first quarter _ and
41 in the final three. They had 13 field goals in the first quarter
_ and 14 in the final three. They shot 76.5 percent in the first
quarter _ and 24.5 percent in the final three.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to grow up and educate ourselves as to what's right
and what's wrong,'' Cavs coach Mike Fratello said. ``We had a
chance to win. Unfortunately, we made too many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding, coach. But the Celtics were just as bad. The teams
combined for 50 turnovers, 52 field goals, and 33 assists.
</P>
<P>
   From the Celtics' standpoint, however, this was a big win. Huge.
Rick Pitino even used the word ``elated'' to describe how he felt,
and that was on the mark because the Celtics couldn't have beaten
Seton Hall the way they played.
</P>
<P>
   He also was elated for another reason. You hate to even use the
words ``must win'' in Game 2, even in a 50-game season. But with
the next six on the road, and 15 of the next 20 away from Boston,
Pitino did not want his team to leave town 0-2 at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be realistic about the season, you can't
start 0-2 at home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had said earlier that the opening-night loss to Toronto was
``the biggest disappointment in my 25 years of coaching,'' which
might be a bit hyperbolic. He was referring to the disappointment
he felt not simply with the performance of his team, which had been
mauled, but because of the luminous presence of Red Auerbach (who
also was there Saturday night and probably called for the blinders)
and the returning fans and all the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was discouraged we let the fans down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what mood swing would have followed had not Paul
Pierce rescued the team down the stretch? The Celtics were severely
depleted, taking the floor without Ron Mercer (knee), Walter
McCarty (toe), Andrew DeClercq (back), and Popeye Jones (thigh).
They got abused in the first quarter by Zydrunas Ilgauskas, falling
behind by 11. They trailed by 5 after one, by 3 at the half, and by
3 after three. They led only once in the middle two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers wanted this one just as badly and, for a while,
looked like they'd get it. They had lost the night before in
Atlanta and, despite their odious play, might well be 1-1  &UR; today &LR; 
had Pierce not abused Cedric Henderson, not used Shawn Kemp as a
launch pad (there's plenty of available space there) on a critical
play, or not made 9 of 10 free throws in the last five minutes. The
rookie also got a big rebound in traffic in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Pitino talks about smelling the ball, and I think I'm
pretty good at it,'' said Pierce, who had 19 points. ``I guess
that's a gift that I have. How can I explain it? I don't know if
it's hard work or a natural gift.''
</P>
<P>
   The cerebral rook had 15 in the fourth, which matched the
Cleveland output, with the biggest hoop coming with 40 seconds
left. Boston trailed, 73-72, and Eric Riley (40 minutes of yeoman
work in the trenches) missed both free throws. But Pierce went
right around Kemp and tipped the ball in off the glass. That gave
Boston the lead for good, 74-73. (Pierce also had scored the team's
previous 7 points, all from the line.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to slide in and get my hand on the ball,'' Pierce
said. ``I tried to just keep it alive, hoping one of my teammates
might get it and put it back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp (18 points) was then smothered on the Cavs' next possession
and missed a shot. Pierce got the rebound, was fouled, and made
both freebies. Cleveland then fittingly botched two 3-pointers, one
a terrific look from bomber extraordinaire Wesley Person. The Cavs
deserved what they got.

ARE FANS AS EAGER AS SUNS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Early last week, Suns guard Rex Chapman was icing down
his hamstring and watching his teammates finish up a workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Chapman said, looking around the practice court,
``I don't think there's one guy on this team who isn't more
concerned about winning than anything else. Every guy out there
really loves to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Suns still love this game, but what about their fans?
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the Suns play host to the Denver Nuggets in their first
regular-season home game since last April, three months late thanks
to a labor dispute that shortened the season to 50 games and left a
lot of basketball fans disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   There still were 600 tickets available as of late Sunday that
will have to be sold to keep alive the club's home-court sellout
streak that dates to the day America West Arena opened in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reception is going to be good,'' Chapman said.
``Maybe I'm naive to think that, but I've always felt like the fans
in Phoenix are the best the league has to offer. Even when the
lockout was going on, most of the season ticket holders I ran into
said they couldn't wait until it was over and we could get back to
playing basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are reparations to make. Like teams that opened the
season at home on Friday night around the league, the Suns will try
to offer an olive branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be there 20 minutes early,'' said Suns Coach Danny Ainge,
``The players and coaches will go out there early and do something
for the fans, throw some T-shirts out there and that sort of
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't make up for 32 lost games, but it's a start.
And if the Suns play as well as they did Friday night during the
second half of their season-opening victory against the Clippers in
Los Angeles, it will go a long way toward soothing the ache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was one of the better halves of basketball we've
played since I've been coaching this team,'' Ainge said of the
onslaught, which started with a 17-0 run at the beginning of the
third quarter. ``As far as ball-movement, offensive and defensive
execution, we played very well. I thought our shooting was a little
rusty, but that will come.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Suns appear capable of playing the kind of
basketball that fans enjoy watching. They moved the ball around
almost to a fault against the Clippers, over-passing on a couple of
occasions rather than taking an available shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season, that third quarter was really our Achilles'
heel,'' said assistant coach Frank Johnson. ``But if we come out
and play with that kind of defensive intensity every night . . .
whew!
</P>
<P>
   ``And the other thing you could see in that quarter is that we
have a very unselfish basketball team. These guys take pride in
passing the ball to the open man. A couple of times we did
overpass, but you can build off that.''
</P>
<P>
   It beats the alternative, which is a bunch of players looking
for personal statistics above winning.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is likely to get a warm welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Suns don't hear too many hoots, it's a safe bet that
Denver forward Antonio McDyess will be greeted by some booing. He
signed as a free agent with the Nuggets when the lockout was
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns responded by signing Tom Gugliotta, who had 24 points
and 17 rebounds in his debut. It was more rebounds than any Suns
player had during all of last season. McDyess came closest with 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about Googs' scoring,'' Kidd said of
Gugliotta, an All-Star in 1997 who also was named to last summer's
World Championship team that never played because of the labor
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put up 24 points, but to get 17 rebounds . . . you're
talking about a Dream Teamer and an All-Star. I don't think we got
the short end of that deal at all.'' &QL;

DREAM RIDE WINS COPPER POLE

<P>
   PHOENIX - Surprise, surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Grady, who never has finished higher than 38th in seven
previous stock-car appearances and has successfully qualified for
only two, almost gave himself a heart attack Saturday by capturing
the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series pole position in the U.S.
Tobacco Co. Copper World Classic at Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Grady, 39, didn't even qualify for this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tore out some fencing and put a hole in the wall in
practice,'' said Grady, who lives in Farmington, N.M. ``The car was
unrepairable. It bent it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady's 130.976 mph speed in a mostly unsponsored Chevy Monte
Carlo was the highlight of a day that began with a thick fog bank
engulfing the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   But as the fog cleared, so did Grady's memory from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here just wanting to make the show,'' said Grady, a
former sprint-car champion who became enthralled with the Copper
World as a spectator sitting in the grandstands. ``I used to watch
this race from the other side of the wall a lot of years. I thought
one day I'd like to be (driving a stock car).''
</P>
<P>
   That one day came last year.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Grady is atop the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest moment of my career,'' said Grady, who edged Steve
Portenga (130.618) for the pole. ``They can check underneath my
hood all the want. I'm not cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided to go for it. I stood on the throttle. I was
either going to not make it or make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady made it.
</P>
<P>
   So did Dave Steele of Indianapolis by way of Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Steele enjoyed capturing last year's U.S. Auto Club
Coors Light Silver Bullet pole position so much he decided to do it
again.
</P>
<P>
   Steele also qualified third in USAC midgets, which is where he
qualified last season.
</P>
<P>
   Deja vu all over again?
</P>
<P>
   Steele hopes not.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Steele led half the Silver Bullet race, then faded
to eighth because of tire woes. He finished runner-up in midgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always seem to qualify well here, but we have bad luck in
the race,'' said Steele, who like so many open-wheel drivers at the
Copper World, is hoping to land a full-time Indy Racing League
ride. ``We learned some things with the tires last year (in the
Silver Bullet race). I think it will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other polecats stepping to the podium were Jason Leffler
(132.856 mph) of Indianapolis via Laguna Beach, Calif., in midgets
and Rebel Jackson Jr. (151.476) of Buckley, Wash., in
supermodifieds.
</P>
<P>
   Leffler, however, was the only driver to better existing track
records.
</P>
<P>
   But Grady, who was about half second off the track mark, came
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were about a second quicker in qualifying than we were in
practice,'' said Grady
</P>
<P>
   Now he's determined to add a winner's trophy to the pole award,
which amounted to $350.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going for the win,'' Grady beamed. ``I'm going to try and
lead every lap. I may burn my tires up, but I'm going for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leffler, too, is anxious to flip the ignition switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really came prepared for this race,'' Leffler said. ``We
did a lot of preseason testing (the team spent three days last
month at PIR) and you don't always get those kinds of opportunities
in midget racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is (car owner) Steve Lewis' biggest race of the year.
It's why he runs three cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a strong car, but trying to break free from
the pack is hard to do because of the draft. But we think we can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Leffler can't, it might be because of Steele, who Leffler
believes may be the toughest obstacle blocking potential victory
lane.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, who is Leffler's teammate in midgets, is starting third,
one position behind outside front-row starter Ricky Shelton. Dave
Darland, the third Lewis driver, is starting 15th.

NORTHRIDGE SCORES KEY WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They pressed and trapped and pressed some more.
</P>
<P>
   Just ``40 minutes of heaven,'' as it is called by the Cal State
Northridge men's basketball coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven was the CSUN gym at 9 o'clock on Saturday night. The
near-capacity crowd almost rushed the court, then launched into
song after the Matadors upset Northern Arizona 76-74 and push
themselves right back into the Big Sky Conference title hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Celebration time, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest games since I've been here,'' is how CSUN
coach Bobby Braswell described the Matadors' fifth consecutive
victory in front of 1,358 raucous fans.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Heinle's tip-in with 5.7 seconds left gave CSUN a 75-74
lead. Heinle then hustled back on defense and stole the ball when
NAU tried a long pass.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle made 1 of 2 free throws and the Lumberjacks, who sit atop
the conference but now by only by one game, didn't get off a final
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle, a 6-9 sophomore center, scored a game-high 23 points
despite playing the last six minutes with four fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we had to do down the stretch,'' said Heinle, who
made 9 of 14 shots and has scored 45 points in the Matadors' last
two games.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is 6-4 in the Big Sky, 14-8 overall, and NAU dropped to 8-2
and 16-5. With six conference games left, the Matadors now are
within striking distance of first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we say we are 2-0,'' Braswell said, referring to the
Matadors' record in the second half of their Big Sky schedule. ``I
just want to continue to play good basketball as we get toward the
end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks jumped to leads of 9-0, 21-10 and 27-14 in the
first half. But Braswell continued with the Matadors' plan to put
on a full-court press and sometimes trap with two or three
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   The gap narrowed and the Matadors' intensity rose. Jason Crowe,
who came off the bench to get a game-high eight assists, sensed the
strategy was working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of dead,'' he said. ``Everybody was waiting for
someone else to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Braswell gave the green light to press, the Matadors
sprung to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we didn't get steals, we slowed them up from getting
into their half-court offense,'' Crowe said. ``They have a great
half-court offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowing down NAU wasn't even Braswell's plan by using the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it to get our team into another gear,'' he said. ``It
lifts our guys up, it gets them more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN trailed by nine (42-33) at the half but cut the lead to one
twice before Crowe made an off-balance layup in the lane with 7:01
left to give the Matadors a 64-63 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Four lead changes and two ties followed. Kawika Akina, who led
the Lumberjacks with 23 points, made two free throws with 18
seconds left to give NAU a 74-73 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle was the best player on the court in the first half so it
seemed fitting he was the hero in the end. He countered the
Lumberjacks' 56 percent shooting in the first 20 minutes with 18
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have Brian in the first half we probably would
have been down by 20 or 25,'' Braswell said.

KEMP'S GAME NOW HEAVY DUTY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Cleveland Cavaliers say Shawn Kemp weighs 280
pounds. Of course, they say it with a wink. Kemp will indeed be 280
pounds when he loses 10 more.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp was at the FleetCenter Saturday night, putting some new
creaks and dents into the parquet. He scored 18 points and had
seven rebounds in 34 minutes, but there wasn't one second when he
looked like a man who should be paid $96 million over the next
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But that was fine with me. I expected Kemp to be the bloated,
landlocked forward he now is, rather than the defiant dunker he
used to be. I had a different agenda Saturday night; I came here to
be a weight watcher. If it were up to me, Kemp and the Cavs would
have been the Celtics' Opening Night opponents. For some reason,
stories of Kemp's dramatic weight gain have roused the voyeur in
me. I hadn't been this excited about seeing a notably fat person
since I was 4 years old and my mother took me to the circus.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp's story is one of the most intriguing to come out of the
lockout. You may have heard that the Celtics' Bruce Bowen worked at
a funeral home during the 204 days the NBA went away.You may not
have heard that Kemp spent his time becoming as big as a funeral
home.
</P>
<P>
   We are a nation obsessed with weight, certainly. That was
obvious when Kemp's poundage became national news after he played
in a December charity basketball game televised on Showtime. The
reports were that he got tired in the pregame warmup lines. Later,
when asked about his weight, he replied that the only numbers that
mattered were ``20 points and 10 rebounds.'' Never mind that those
weren't his averages last season.
</P>
<P>
   All this weight talk had me eager to get out of bed Saturday
morning. I wanted to find Kemp. Exactly how big would he be?
</P>
<P>
   Word is that the Cavs weighed Kemp after the lockout and refused
to reveal the number that assaulted their scale. Go ahead, guess
what that number was. (Hint: If you are in the 200-somethings, you
are much too low.) Kemp supposedly checked in at 303.
</P>
<P>
   A Cleveland columnist mused that she enjoyed the weighty
descriptions of Kemp because it was one of the few times a man's
weight was scrutinized, not a woman's. I wanted to see if Kemp
compared with some of the biggest men in Cavs history. This team
once had a man named Geoff Crompton who could have passed for one
of the cranes crowding Boston's Big Dig-influenced skyline. They
also had ``Dinner Bell'' Mel Turpin, who used to load up on
cheeseburgers before and after practices. Was Kemp that big?
</P>
<P>
   I had heard that Kemp and his Cavs would be staying at the
Boston Harbor Hotel. So at about 11 a.m., I ventured to the hotel's
cafe, Intrigue, and waited near the buffet line. I thought it would
be the most logical place to find the man. I stayed there for a
while, didn't see the 6-foot-10-inch forward, and, as a tribute to
him, decided to take a crack at the buffet myself (no grits; how
disappointing).
</P>
<P>
   Turns out my information was wrong. Kemp was staying at the
Ritz-Carlton. I didn't find that out until I got to the FleetCenter
and went on a new search for Kemp. How big would he be?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he doesn't look like me,'' Cavs broadcaster Joe Tait
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tait calls himself fat all the time. He will also acknowledge
that, when he wears a sweater, it looks as if he is hiding a stack
of telephone books underneath. Kemp may not look like Tait, but the
two could definitely have a long conversation about one of the
broadcaster's loves: trains. Tait has tons of books on them; Kemp
now has a caboose for a backside.
</P>
<P>
   That was obvious when Kemp was finally spotted, lounging in the
visitors locker room. He wore headphones as he sat, slowly moving
his head to the music. I was afraid to ask him if he was listening
to the ``Nutty Professor'' soundtrack. I know he is a fan of
hip-hop, so I wanted to ask him about the new hip-hop aerobic craze
called Taebo. But that would have qualified as a dumb question
because, clearly, Kemp hasn't been doing any aerobic activity.
</P>
<P>
   I did notice that he wasn't nearly as big as I imagined. I also
meant to get his opinion on Tipper Gore, leader of the President's
Council on Physical Fitness, being appointed to a WNBA post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him with his shirt off,'' a Cleveland reporter said of
Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   And?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't obscene or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Kemp if he wanted to talk. ``Not right now,'' he said.
Seconds later, he left to speak with a television reporter. What,
am I too skinny for this guy?
</P>
<P>
   Kemp has promised that he will play himself into shape. He did
that last season, when he also came in overweight. By April 1998,
he was torturing Larry Bird's Pacers in the first round of the
playoffs, averaging 26 points and 10 rebounds. He also brought hope
to a group of kids in his hometown (Elkhart, Ind.), when he dressed
up as a very believable Santa Claus near Christmastime.
</P>
<P>
   He got off to a decent start Saturday night. He took three
first-half shots and made them all. After one sequence, he fell to
the floor and was helped up by Bob Sura, a 200-pound guard. Sura
used only one arm to help Kemp up. I have new respect for Sura.
</P>
<P>
   Size doesn't matter when you are a 300-pound banker, engineer,
accountant, or journalist. But 300-pound basketball players who are
supposed to be 270 don't make life easier for coaches or teammates.
The Cavs found that out the hard way Saturday night. In the game's
final minute, the Celtics' Eric Riley had two free throws attempts
that, if good, would have given his team a 74-73 lead. Riley missed
both. On the second miss, Paul Pierce got around Kemp and tipped in
the ball. That wouldn't have happened with a conditioned Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   On their subsequent possession, the Cavs went to Kemp in the
pivot. He missed his shot. Pierce got the rebound and added two
more free throws. Now the Cavs have two losses and one star who is
severely out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   There were some fans at Saturday night's game who certainly
remember the svelte Kemp who had some great years with the Sonics.
During those days, he would dunk and some hip kid would yell,
``That was phat,'' meaning that it was very good. But these days,
Kemp might take that phrase the wrong way.

JOURNEYMAN RILEY HOPES HE'S FOUND A HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Journeyman'' is a label despised by athletes, perhaps
because there is little distinction about its use. You can argue
with someone for days over whom to attach labels such as
``warrior,'' ``streak shooter,'' ``tough defender,'' or ``selfish
player.'' But ``journeyman'' is quite simple: If your biography
looks like an airline flight timetable, well ...
</P>
<P>
   Eric Riley need not argue whether the label fits. The Celtics
center is a fifth-year veteran playing for his fifth NBA team, the
others being, in order, Houston, the Los Angeles Clippers,
Minnesota, and Dallas. The Mavericks are the team that originally
drafted him in 1993, but they traded his rights to Houston before
reacquiring him last season. He also spent a season playing in
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guy who'd like to see his luggage gather some dust, and
it appears that might finally happen. Riley is taking advantage of
the Celtics' injuries at the pivot to show he has the makings of a
reliable inside presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so. I'm sick of moving around,'' said Riley Saturday
night after the Celtics' 77-73 victory over Cleveland. Riley
started at center and finished with 6 points, 11 boards, and 5
blocks. All of his rejections came in the second half, when he shut
down Cleveland's Zydrunas Ilgauskas, who had burned Boston for 12
points on 5-for-5 shooting in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to go out there and block every shot _ that was
my mentality,'' said Riley. ``Antoine (Walker) and I talked about
shutting down the middle at halftime. We said if we shut the middle
down and make them make the extra pass, we have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilgauskas scored just 4 points after the first quarter, and
backup Vitaly Potapenko was also ineffective (no points and two
boards). Riley's biggest block came with 57 seconds left, on an
attempt by Cleveland's Cedric Henderson, with the Celtics trailing,
73-72.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Riley was really, really big for us defensively,'' said
coach Rick Pitino. ``He gave us a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley keyed a defensive charge that limited Cleveland to 26
percent shooting in the fourth quarter. ``Eric Riley played very
well. He's a big body with the capability of blocking shots,'' said
Ilgauskas.
</P>
<P>
   He had his share of errors, though. After blocking Henderson,
Riley came up with the ball and was fouled with :41 left. He missed
the two free throws _ though teammate Paul Pierce tipped in the
second miss to give the Celtics the lead for good, at 74-73.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul made a great tip-in, so he made up for me,'' said Riley.
``I have to repay him, make one on a tip-in when he misses.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley managed to make up for the missed free throws _ and a
1-for-5 shooting night from the floor _ with a strong effort at the
other end.
</P>
<P>
   A center on the University of Michigan's 1988-89 national
championship team, Riley played on Houston's 1993-94 NBA
championship team as a rookie. But backing up Hakeem Olajuwon meant
a career-low 219 minutes, and he signed as a free agent with the
Clippers a year later.
</P>
<P>
   He said this stop seems like the best fit and added that the NBA
lockout and subsequent flurry of free agent signings has helped
players like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other place I've been, I was with centers who had
already signed five- or six-year contracts,'' said Riley. ``I was
basically there for a backup role. Here, I can see they have a need
for me to block shots and rebound, so I can become the center they
need. The (lockout) helped me because I landed in the best
situation I've been in the last five years.''

USC CAN'T GET PAST OREGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This time, not even a half-court shot by Adam
Spanich would have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   USC defeated Oregon last month on Spanich's desperation basket
at the buzzer, but the Trojans didn't even get close enough in the
final seconds to try and pull off similar heroics Saturday night,
losing to the Ducks 60-55 before 3,173 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans went scoreless in the final 1 minute, 15 seconds. At
that point, the contest was tied, but Mike Carson hit two free
throws to give the Ducks a 57-55 lead with 1:02 remaining. Carson
then blocked Brian Scalabrine's layup on USC's next possession.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine appeared wide open, but Carson came from behind and
swatted the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a great play,'' Scalabrine said. ``I guess I should
have tried (to dunk the ball). Any other similar play, I wouldn't
have dunked, but this was a game-winner.''
</P>
<P>
   A.D. Smith rebounded Scalabrine's miss, was fouled and made two
free throws to extend Oregon's lead to 59-55. USC freshman Brandon
Granville then drove to the basket but missed a close-range shot,
and Alex Scales added a free throw with 14.6 seconds left to close
out the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks (11-9, 3-8) continued their trend of close games in
the Pacific-10 Conference. Eight of their past nine games have been
decided by five points or less.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (11-9, 3-8), who entered the week in the throes of a
six-game losing streak before beating Oregon State on Thursday,
fell to 2-5 at the Sports Arena in conference play, a primary
reason they fell back into a three-way tie for last place in the
Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts a lot because we're back in last place again,'' USC
guard Elias Ayuso said. ``This was a game we were supposed to win
and we let it get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon used an 11-0 spurt two minutes into the second half to
break away, taking a 45-37 lead with 13:31 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   USC was forced to play catch-up after that, not an entirely
unfamiliar position for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' offensive problems appear to stem partly from the
continuing effects of losing point guard Kevin Augustine, who quit
the team in December. When USC coach Henry Bibby rested Granville,
he inserted forward Jarvis Turner at the point, and Turner had two
turnovers in two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby finally subbed Quincy Wilder in for Granville in the
second half, but Wilder is a natural shooting guard, and the
Trojans had difficultly getting a handle on their offense.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, USC also got next to nothing from its
senior shooting guards, Spanich and Ayuso. The pair made just four
of 14 shots, and USC was just four for 17 on 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't score,'' Bibby said. ``They played pretty
good defense and limited the touches of Adam and Elias. We didn't
go with any other options out there. We couldn't score. I don't
know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team did much early, but the Trojans had a nice run
midway through the half, outscoring the Ducks 14-3 to take a 25-17
lead. The impetus for their improved play was forward Sam Clancy,
who had eight points and seven rebounds. He finished with his third
double-double (11 points, 14 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   But Oregon quickly came back and scored eight straight points,
capped by Scales' 3-pointer to tie the game at 25-25.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks made six of their 3-point shots in the first half, and
shot 46 percent behind the arc. Oregon made just 29 percent of its
two-point shots, however, allowing the Trojans to hold a 32-29
halftime advantage.

HOPKINS STOPS ALLEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Executioner's Song began harshly late in the
sixth round and turned to Taps for Robert Allen early in the
seventh Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard ``The Executioner'' Hopkins successfully defended his
International Boxing Federation middleweight title for the ninth
time by dropping Allen twice at the Washington Convention Center
before landing 11 unanswered punches at the end of Round 6,
including three crushing lefts to the body that sent him to the
floor, and 16 more early in Round 7 before referee Rudy Battle
stepped in and stopped the bout at 1:18.
</P>
<P>
   The only voice disputing that decision was that of Allen's
manager, Jim Troy, who stood on the ring apron and berated Battle
while Allen stood with his legs stiff and his mouth voicing not a
word of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that particular point it was like he was a sitting duck,''
Battle accurately stated. ``It was a very good stop, in my
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a very good stop in the opinion of anyone with eyes and
even Troy later agreed after watching the replay.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ending that began with a right to the head, three
lefts to the body, and one right to the side of the face that
crumbled Allen to the floor in the final seconds of the sixth
round. When Allen came out to answer the bell for the seventh, his
balance was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins (35-2-1, 27 KOs) sensed that immediately, taking a
left-right combination from Allen without flinching and then
blasting Allen to the body. The challenger retreated and Hopkins
moved in, battering him on the inside as he lay on the ropes
without moving his hands until Battle came to his rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me 15 months to beat someone I knew I could beat and
it didn't have anything to do with boxing,'' said Hopkins, who
suffered a no-contest against Allen last August when he was pushed
out of the ring by referee Mills Lane and sprained his ankle so
severely he could not continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like we got some clean breaks the first time,''
Allen (23-3-0, 1 no-contest) said. ``We didn't get any this time. I
never been hit in the groin before. I saw white. They took
something out of me but not that much. He hit me with some good
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, World Boxing Association super
lightweight champion Sharmba Mitchell (44-2) successfully defended
his title but was taken the distance by New York journeyman Pedro
Saiz (23-5-3).

IS EDWARDS'S INJURY CAREER-THREATENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There were conflicting reports Saturday
night concerning the severity of Robert Edwards's knee dislocation
injury, one from the Patriots saying the running back may miss all
of next season and that his career is in jeopardy, the other, from
the Edwards camp, outlining a best-case two-month recovery period.
</P>
<P>
   A medical source in Honolulu said Edwards, who was injured while
playing with NFL rookies in a flag-football game on a Honolulu
beach as part of Pro Bowl festivities, needed immediate surgery on
his left knee because stress on the sole artery in the leg had
caused a blood clot. If surgery wasn't performed in a timely
fashion, the source said, amputation of the foot was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Honolulu doctors who requested anonymity explained that any time
a knee is dislocated there is concern about blood flow to the
extremity because there is only one artery in that region. The
popliteal artery is located in the hollow behind the knee. When a
dislocation occurs, the knee is bent backward and if that artery is
damaged, clotting begins.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards also suffered a tear of the posterior cruciate ligament,
but that appears to be the least of his problems.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Lawyer Milloy, who along with cornerback Ty Law and tight
end Ben Coates is representing the Patriots in Sunday's Pro Bowl,
said he visited briefly with Edwards Saturday and came away upbeat.
``Robert said his doctor told him two months of rehabilitation and
he should be fine and his spirits were definitely up,'' said
Milloy. ``I was bummed out (Friday) not being able to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my teammate and I care about him. It was a humbling sight
to see him on the respirator after surgery. I just wanted to show
my face and let him know ... I knew his girlfriend was coming in. I
just wanted to represent all three of us. He just said, `Tell Ty
and Ben to go out and have good games and represent us well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy said he and Edwards laughed about the timing of the
injury and the running back's reputation of being injury-prone
coming out of college. ``He said to me about 12 games into the
season, `This is the longest I ever lasted,''' said Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility Edwards will need to take anticoagulant
medication to prevent further clotting. Being on that medication
would prohibit Edwards from any contact. One of the problems may be
that if the blood doesn't flow properly to the knee, full healing
cannot take place.

KINGS WIN 2-0; BLAKE TOSSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Not for the first time, the Kings found themselves
without their most important player Saturday night, this time in
one of the most important games so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   But on this occasion, the absence of defenseman Rob Blake didn't
cost the Kings, and they have the comfort of knowing their
captain's absence won't last any longer than one game.
</P>
<P>
   When Blake received a game misconduct 13:49 into the first
period for being the third man into an altercation involving his
defense partner Mattias Norstrom and San Jose Sharks enforcer
Brantt Myhres, the Kings already held a two-goal margin, thanks to
a pair of goals by Luc Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   The lead held up, with the Kings recording a 2-0 victory over
the Sharks before a Forum crowd of 13,434. Jamie Storr stopped 27
shots as the Kings (19-28-4) recorded their second consecutive
victory and moved to within two points of the Sharks in the race
for the final playoff berth in the Western Conference. The Sharks
(16-22-12) dropped to 0-2 on their NHL-record 10-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the intensity was there from the start of the
game for our guys,'' Blake said when asked if he'd been concerned
about how his teammates would respond in his absence, given their
3-15 record without him this season. ``We understood how important
the game was. I don't think it made any difference me coming out of
the game that early.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Sharks on a power play late in the first period,
Norstrom drilled Sharks right wing Alex Korolyuk into the boards
with a hard but legal check, then headed to the bench for a change.
When he got there, he was run into by Myhres, who apparently had
just stepped onto the ice to replace Korolyuk. Myhres entered the
game with one point and 72 penalty minutes, so it's doubtful he was
on the ice for a Sharks power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's a big power-play guy,'' Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   Myhres appeared to use the butt end of his stick on Norstrom,
opening a cut above the Kings defenseman's right eye, leaving a
trail of blood streaming down his face.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just sit there and watch that stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exit Blake. Also, exit Myhres, who received a game misconduct
among several punishments from referee Kerry Fraser. Blake was left
with a four-stitch cut on the middle knuckle of his right hand, and
was asked if that had come from punching Myhres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it was him and not Matti,'' Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the brawl, Robitaille scored his two goals, the first a
one-timer 7:46 into the game off tic-tac-toe passes from Jozef
Stumpel and Donald Audette, the second the redirection of a
centering feed from Olli Jokinen 2:07 later.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's goals gave him 507 in his career, moving him into a
tie for 24th on the all-time goal-scoring list with Montreal
Canadiens legend Jean Beliveau.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Robitaille has 29 goals this season, matching Glen
Murray's total from last season, when Murray led the Kings in goal
scoring. With one more goal, Robitaille will become the first King
to score 30 in a season since 1993-94, when Robitaille (44), Wayne
Gretzky (38) and Jari Kurri (31) accomplished the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Storr recorded his fourth shutout and the Kings' sixth this
season. It also was the sixth shutout of Storr's career. He got the
start because Stephane Fiset suffered from stiffness in his groin
Saturday afternoon, and the Kings didn't want to take any chances
considering their No.1 goalie's season-long problems in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Sharks' offensive pressure came in a second period
in which San Jose outshot the Kings, 15-7. But Storr saw the
majority of San Jose's shots, and had some help during one Sharks
power play when Ian Laperriere, playing without his stick for a
harrowing 60-second sequence, sprawled to the ice to block a shot.

USC FALLS TO OREGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This time, not even a half-court shot by Adam
Spanich would have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   USC defeated Oregon last month on Spanich's desperation basket
at the buzzer, but the Trojans didn't get close enough in the final
seconds to try to pull off any heroics Saturday night, losing to
the Ducks 60-55 before 3,173 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, who were held to a season-low 23 points in the
second half, went scoreless in the final 1 minute, 15 seconds. At
that point, the contest was tied, but Mike Carson hit two free
throws to give the Ducks a 57-55 lead with 1:02 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Carson then made a huge defensive play, blocking Brian
Scalabrine's layup.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine appeared wide open for an easy basket, but Carson
came from behind and swatted the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a great play,'' Scalabrine said. ``I guess I should
have tried (to dunk the ball). Any other similar play, I wouldn't
have dunked, but this was a game-winner.''
</P>
<P>
   A.D. Smith rebounded Scalabrine's miss, was fouled and made two
free throws to extend Oregon's lead to 59-55. USC freshman Brandon
Granville then drove to the basket but missed a close-range shot,
and Alex Scales added a free throw with 14.6 seconds left to close
out the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't score,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``They
played pretty good defense and limited the touches of Adam and
Elias (Ayuso). We didn't execute. We didn't go with any other
options out there. We couldn't score. I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (11-9, 3-8), who entered the week in the throes of a
six-game losing streak before beating Oregon State on Thursday,
fell to 2-5 at the Sports Arena in conference play, a primary
reason they reside in a three-way tie for last place in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts a lot because we're back in last place again,'' Ayuso
said. ``This was a game we were supposed to win and we let it get
away.''
</P>
<P>
   USC got next to nothing from Spanich and Ayuso. The pair made
just 4 of 14 shots, and USC was just 4 for 17 on 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty upset,'' Spanich said. ``We should have beat that
team. I'm frustrated. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks (11-9, 3-8) continued their trend of close games in
the Pac-10. Eight of their past nine games have been decided by
five points or less, and this was their biggest margin of victory
in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally figured out how to get the job done,'' Oregon coach
Ernie Kent said. ``They proved that they could push through the
wall tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon used an 11-0 spurt two minutes into the second half to
break away, taking a 45-37 lead with 13:31 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   USC was forced to play catch-up after that, not an entirely
unfamiliar position for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' offensive problems appear to stem in part from the
continuing effects of losing point guard Kevin Augustine, who quit

forward Jarvis Turner at the point, and Turner had two turnovers in
two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby finally subbed Quincy Wilder in for Granville in the
second half, but Wilder is a natural shooting guard, and the
Trojans still had difficulty getting into their offense.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Freshman forward Sam Clancy was one of the few bright
spots for the Trojans, recording his third double-double (11
points, 14 rebounds) of the season.

USC FALLS TO OREGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This time, not even a half-court shot by Adam
Spanich would have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   USC defeated Oregon last month on Spanich's desperation basket
at the buzzer, but the Trojans didn't get close enough in the final
seconds to try to pull off any heroics Saturday night, losing to
the Ducks 60-55 before 3,173 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, who were held to a season-low 23 points in the
second half, went scoreless in the final 1 minute, 15 seconds. At
that point, the contest was tied, but Mike Carson hit two free
throws to give the Ducks a 57-55 lead with 1:02 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Carson then made a huge defensive play, blocking Brian
Scalabrine's layup.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine appeared wide open for an easy basket, but Carson
came from behind and swatted the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a great play,'' Scalabrine said. ``I guess I should
have tried (to dunk the ball). Any other similar play, I wouldn't
have dunked, but this was a game-winner.''
</P>
<P>
   A.D. Smith rebounded Scalabrine's miss, was fouled and made two
free throws to extend Oregon's lead to 59-55. USC freshman Brandon
Granville then drove to the basket but missed a close-range shot,
and Alex Scales added a free throw with 14.6 seconds left to close
out the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't score,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``They
played pretty good defense and limited the touches of Adam and
Elias (Ayuso). We didn't execute. We didn't go with any other
options out there. We couldn't score. I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (11-9, 3-8), who entered the week in the throes of a
six-game losing streak before beating Oregon State on Thursday,
fell to 2-5 at the Sports Arena in conference play, a primary
reason they reside in a three-way tie for last place in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts a lot because we're back in last place again,'' Ayuso
said. ``This was a game we were supposed to win and we let it get
away.''
</P>
<P>
   USC got next to nothing from Spanich and Ayuso. The pair made
just 4 of 14 shots, and USC was just 4 for 17 on 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty upset,'' Spanich said. ``We should have beat that
team. I'm frustrated. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks (11-9, 3-8) continued their trend of close games in
the Pac-10. Eight of their past nine games have been decided by
five points or less, and this was their biggest margin of victory
in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally figured out how to get the job done,'' Oregon coach
Ernie Kent said. ``They proved that they could push through the
wall tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon used an 11-0 spurt two minutes into the second half to
break away, taking a 45-37 lead with 13:31 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   USC was forced to play catch-up after that, not an entirely
unfamiliar position for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' offensive problems appear to stem in part from the
continuing effects of losing point guard Kevin Augustine, who quit
the team in December. When Bibby rested Granville, he inserted
forward Jarvis Turner at the point, and Turner had two turnovers in
two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby finally subbed Quincy Wilder in for Granville in the
second half, but Wilder is a natural shooting guard, and the
Trojans still had difficulty getting into their offense.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Freshman forward Sam Clancy was one of the few bright
spots for the Trojans, recording his third double-double (11
points, 14 rebounds) of the season.

PETE WILSON LEGACY FAST BECOMING HISTORY UNDER CALIFORNIA GOV. GRAY
DAVIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Gray Davis won the California governor's
race by taking a cue from President Clinton: Call yourself a
centrist and swear you'll consider good ideas from both sides of
the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   But since his inauguration a month ago, most of Davis' actions
have been dyed-in-the-wool Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   He has sought to undo or weaken Republican former Gov. Pete
Wilson's political legacy in issues as wide ranging as labor,
affirmative action, Indian gaming and relations with Mexico and
Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   Some see Davis' actions as the righting of Wilson's overly
conservative policies or simply political payback to his supporters
-- and not an indication of a sharp shift to the left.
</P>
<P>
   But others, including some San Fernando Valley business leaders,
voice trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is panicking yet, but there are some concerns,'' said
Bob Scott, vice chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to assume that when you have a Democrat governor for
the first time in 16 years that things will be different. We're
watching to make sure that when changes are made, all sides will be
represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis administration officials dismiss the notion that the
governor is concentrating on the ``undoing of Wilson'' and say he
is concerned only with his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a centrist, moderate agenda with a primary focus of
reforming California's education system, and dealing with economic
and other issues,'' said Michael Bustamante, Davis' spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Of direct concern to VICA -- as well as Republicans -- is Davis'
call to bring back overtime after an eight-hour workday, rejecting
Wilson's policy of overtime after a 40-hour work week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly a step backward,'' Scott said. ``It makes
California less attractive to business.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Sean Walsh, Wilson's spokesman, said Davis' actions are
devastating to California at a time when the state must become more
economically competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to undo the strides Wilson worked for in jobs and
the economy,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilson is certainly concerned. Groups like VICA and other
Valley organizations who worked to change bad laws and policies
should be very concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Davis camp questions why there is such concern over the
eight-hour workday hurting the economy when it is clear to him that
working people need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right thing to do, pure and simple,'' Bustamante
said.
</P>
<P>
   Differences between the two governors were vividly underscored
last week when Davis visited Mexico in what was unabashedly
depicted as a diplomatic mission. Wilson's high-profile support of
measures that banned state services to illegal immigrants, ended
affirmative action and eliminated bilingual instruction in public
schools angered many Latinos both north and south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said undoing Wilson's
policies is exactly what many voters hoped for in November's
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wanted someone who wouldn't undo Wilson's actions,
they would have voted for Dan Lungren,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Latinos especially, I think they cast votes as much
against Wilson as they did in favor of Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   H. Erik Schockman, a political science professor at the
University of Southern California, believes Davis' rapprochement
with Mexico will do much to stimulate trade and heal wounds. Like
Jeffe, he doesn't see Davis veering leftward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis has taken a rubber band approach and is undoing many
Wilsonian policies that may have stretched too far to the right,''
Schockman said. ``Davis is bringing it back to the center.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Still, Schockman acknowledges that steering that center course
will not be easy for Davis, who has been heavily supported -- and
funded -- by liberal labor and environmentalist groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberal Democrats will expect him to be more activist, to
erase Pete Wilson,'' Shockman said. ``For years, these groups have
been withering under Republican governors and there will an
expectation that things will be different.''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the message during a news conference last
Thursday as environmentalists offered a plan on population growth
and urged more spending for environmental programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Dinno, natural resources director for the Planning and
Conservation League, said the groups believes it has a friend in
Davis, who in his State of the State speech called for careful
growth planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in years a governor is addressing
environmental issues,'' Dinno said. ``We are encouraged by his
remarks and have every reason to believe we will be working closely
with the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the Davis administration may even have
unintentionally appeared to step to the left.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the new Democratic administration shocked the
agribusiness and water community when it quietly withdrew a
``friend of the court'' brief which state officials under Wilson
had filed in support of farmers who sued the federal government in
a major Central Valley water fight.
</P>
<P>
   Water agency officials said they wondered if Davis' action
signaled disaster for the State Water Project delivering water to
businesses and residents in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wondered if this was a statement by the Davis
administration that they preferred a straitjacket approach to
regulation,'' said Jason Peltier, manager of the Central Valley
Water Project Association, a group of 80 water districts. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Peltier said they have been assured by the Davis administration
that a mistake was made, and the governor planned to work with the
water companies. However, there was no indication that the governor
would be re-filing the critical document in support of their fight.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif.: critical document in support of their fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a misfire that needs to get straightened out,''
Peltier said. ``We believe the governor means what he says when he
says he's going to govern from the middle. We want to believe that
he will strive for balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said he would not comment on the withdrawal of the
opinion. However, state government sources said that the action was
taken without Davis' knowledge and the administration was searching
for a way to correct it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mistake that Davis ordered the withdrawal of another
sensitive legal opinion filed by the Wilson administration that
argued Proposition 5, which would allow Indian tribes to use
casino-style slot machines, was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was a chief opponent of Proposition 5 while Davis, who
took $700,000 in campaign funds, directed new Attorney General Bill
Lockyer to file papers that took a neutral position on the
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he wasn't surprised by Davis' actions, especially
given the $8 million the tribes donated to lawmakers' campaigns,
mostly Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian tribes have become the new E.F. Hutton of state
politics,'' Walsh said, referring to an advertising campaign which
claimed that when the financial company speaks ``people listen.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; One of Wilson's hardest-fought battles was the passage of
Proposition 209, a measure that bans affirmative action in public
education, including prohibiting consideration of race in
admissions to the University of California.
</P>
<P>
   University officials have said they believe that policy has led
to a downturn in Latino and African-American students on UC
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   One of Davis' first actions, proposed in his State of the State
address, was a call for changes that would make the top 4 percent
of each high school's graduating class eligible for UC admission.
Education Secretary Gary Hart said the administration hopes the
change would lead to higher minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   USC's Schockman said it would be a mistake for Davis to override
the will of the voters by finding ways around Proposition 209.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said the governor has pledged his intention to abide
by the laws, and that the 4-percent proposal is a logical,
merit-based way of enrolling.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers believe that Davis will also be more likely to sign
gun control legislation that stiffens regulations against assault
weapons and the sale of cheap handguns known as Saturday night
specials.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators also expect that Davis will be more apt to crack
down on HMOs and approve bills that are more patient-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has also proven to be a hard-liner on abortion. More than
once, including in his State of the State and inaugural addresses,
Davis warned those who would seek to deny a woman's right to an
abortion, saying, ``Please don't waste our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ray Lehmann, spokesman for The Independent Institute in
Oakland: ``In his first few weeks in office Davis has followed the
typical partisan Democratic line -- it was to be expected.''

FOREST AREAS BEING CLOSED FOR PRESERVATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA MASCARO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. -- Just a few miles from city life lies the wild
outdoors -- 3.5 million acres of rugged national forest land where
a hiker can wander a trail, a cyclist can tear up some dirt and a
prospector can mine a stream.
</P>
<P>
   Except in the growing number of areas that rangers are posting
as off-limits, to protect city life from creeping into the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seen by L.A. as a picnic ground,'' said Angeles
National Forest spokeswoman Gail Wright. ``They bring their
barbecues; they come in high heels. ... They have their picnics
with no understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, you don't really have bears up here, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the wild has proved rocky terrain for the four
Southern California forests that see millions of visitors a year,
increasingly so as urban areas become populated and the U.S. Forest
Service has fewer resources to care for its vast acreage.
</P>
<P>
   At Los Padres National Forest in Ventura County, campsites that
have been trampled beyond use are closed in disrepair, backcountry
trails infrequently maintained, and animals trying to call the
forest home have fewer staff biologists to keep tabs on their
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Grumbling from some corners has risen to a roar -- from
recreational users now required to buy a $30-a-year Adventure Pass
for forests once accessed for free, from off-roaders whose favorite
spots have been closed to protect the Southwestern arroyo toad, and
from eco-enthusiasts who worry about the state of more than 50
threatened or endangered species in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   One group, the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity in
Tucson, Ariz., has filed suit, claiming the four Southern
California forests -- Angeles, Los Padres, Cleveland and San
Bernardino -- have not provided adequate planning for various
threatened and endangered species. The center, whose lawsuit was
filed in June 1998, hopes the legal wrangling will force the Forest
Service to pay closer attention to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wildlife has always gotten the short end of the stick,''
said the center's conservation biologist, Peter Galvin. ``What we
have is a biological meltdown across Southern California, and the
Forest Service was a participant in this process.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes as the Forest Service's recreational budgets
have been slashed -- 40 percent over five years at Los Padres, for
example, and more than 30 percent at Angeles -- spelling cuts in
personnel and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Adventure Passes have brought in $3 million for the
Southern California forests since the pilot program started in June
1997. That money is funneled back to the sites for upgrades, from
cleaner restrooms at Los Padres to trash hauling that has allowed
Switzer's Picnic Area in Angeles to reopen to vehicles, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national forests in Southern California have had a tough
time,'' said Matt Mathes, a spokesman for the Forest Service's
regional office in San Francisco, which is in the process of moving
from its headquarters of 90 years in the well-heeled financial
district to a defunct military base on Mare Island to save on rent.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Forest Service was established in 1905, it has
maintained a balance between recreational uses, wildlife
preservation and commodity activities such as mining and timber
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Mathes said the Los Angeles-area forests face the added
challenge of being on an urban edge that brings 11 million visitors
a year to Los Padres and 32 million to Angeles, a situation unlike
any other forest in the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's faced with intense human pressures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service has been closing campgrounds and roads across
the area -- about 10 percent of the campsites in Los Padres and a
popular off-road facility in the Antelope Valley -- to help protect
endangered species, including the arroyo toad, steelhead trout and
others, which will be inventoried and monitored for future reports,
in addition to closures that had been in place for wear and tear on
the sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real shocker to us,'' said Patrick Keene, a
Calabasas gold prospector and member of the group Public Lands for
the People, who said users already were upset over having to pay
the new Adventure Pass fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you stop millions and millions of people from going to the
forest because of a toad?'' said Keene, who operates a company that
sells mining and gold prospecting equipment and often takes his
school-age children to pan for gold at Piru Creek in Los Padres
National Forest, which is now mostly off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think too many people are going to be hurt,'' he added.
``They're not going to be able to go to the area to enjoy outdoor
recreation.''
</P>
<P>
   Also critical of the closures has been Galvin's Tucson-based
organization, which said the Forest Service needed to take such
action long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scurrying around to get its house in order,'' he said.
``These kinds of things should have been happening 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials would not comment directly on the
lawsuit, but said in general that concerns over the endangered
species are a priority for the service, which has been working for
years to do its part for species protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite downsizing and cutbacks, we know where our priorities
are,'' Mathes said. ``In Southern California, the threatened and a
lot of the other species have been driven by the development. The
national forest is really a last refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   As the forests continue to provide a getaway for city dwellers,
some say they will be increasingly caught in the dilemma of trying
to be all things to all users, leaving them with some tough
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible position to be in. There is no solution,''
said Sam Sweet, a professor of ecology and evolution at the
University of California, Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can (anger) a million people individually, or they can end
up being subject to the sort of litigation some of the stuff has
been in response to,'' he said. ``The way you balance all these
things out is going to be a reflection of what things you think are
important and what things you think are not.''

KINGS SHUT OUT SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Not for the first time, the Kings found themselves
without their most important player Saturday night, this time in
one of the most important games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But on this occasion, the absence of defenseman Rob Blake didn't
cost the Kings, and they have the comfort of knowing their
captain's absence won't last any longer.
</P>
<P>
   When Blake received a game misconduct 13:49 into the first
period for being the third man into an altercation involving his
defense partner, Mattias Norstrom, and San Jose Sharks enforcer
Brantt Myhres, the Kings already held a two-goal margin, thanks to
a pair of goals by Luc Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   Even minus Blake, the lead held up, with the Kings recording a
2-0 victory over the Sharks before a Forum crowd of 13,434. Jamie
Storr stopped 27 shots as the Kings (19-28-4) recorded their second
consecutive victory and moved to within two points of the Sharks in
the race for the final playoff berth in the Western Conference. The
Sharks (16-22-12) dropped to 0-2 on their NHL-record 10-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the intensity was there from the start of the
game for our guys,'' Blake said when asked if he'd been concerned
about how his teammates would respond in his absence, given their
3-15 record without him this season. ``We understood how important
the game was. I don't think it made any difference me coming out of
the game that early.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Sharks on a power play late in the first period,
Norstrom drilled Sharks right wing Alex Korolyuk into the boards
with a hard but legal check, then headed to the bench for a change.
When he got there, he was run into by Myhres, who had just stepped
onto the ice. NHL rules stipulate an automatic 10-game suspension
for a player who steps off the bench and immediately gets into an
altercation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that young man is going to be in big trouble,'' Kings
coach Larry Robinson said of Myhres.
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom said: ``It was tough for Blakey being thrown out (for
being the third man in). I felt I was more on the bench than on the
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Myhres appeared to use the butt end of his stick on Norstrom,
opening a cut above the Kings defenseman's right eye and leaving a
trail of blood streaming down his face.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just sit there and watch that stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exit Blake. Also, exit Myhres, who received a game misconduct
among several punishments from referee Kerry Fraser. Blake was left
with a four-stitch cut on the middle knuckle of his right hand, and
was asked if that had come from punching Myhres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it was him and not Matti,'' Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the brawl, Robitaille scored his two goals, the first a
one-timer 7:46 into the game off tic-tac-toe passes from Jozef
Stumpel and Donald Audette, the second the redirection of a
centering feed from Olli Jokinen 2:07 later.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's goals gave him 507 in his career, moving him into a
tie for 24th on the all-time goal-scoring list with Montreal
Canadiens legend Jean Beliveau.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Robitaille has 29 goals this season, matching Glen
Murray's total from last season, when Murray led the Kings in goal
scoring. With one more goal, Robitaille will become the first King
to score 30 in a season since 1993-94, when Robitaille (44), Wayne
Gretzky (38) and Jari Kurri (31) accomplished the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Storr recorded his fourth shutout and the Kings' sixth this
season. It also was the sixth shutout of Storr's career. He got the
start because Stephane Fiset suffered from stiffness in his groin
Saturday afternoon, and the Kings didn't want to take any chances
considering their No. 1 goalie's season-long problems in that area.

   MOJAVE, Calif. -- When some couples go into business together,
they open a flower shop, or an accounting office or maybe an
advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   Not Roderick and Randa Milliron.
</P>
<P>
   They've invested a chunk of their own money into building a
rocket ship -- and they hope to conquer space with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our desire to personally travel in space is one motivation,''
said Randa Milliron, a community college radio and television
instructor whose husband is a chemistry professor and former
aerospace engineer. ``The romantic aspect of this is we both want
to walk on Mars before we're 70.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a more pragmatic reason, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Millirons are part of what is turning out to be the start of
an space gold rush -- the push to develop spaceships that will
dramatically lower the cost of getting goods and people into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money to be made from this,'' Roderick
Milliron said last week. ``Even if we all succeed there still won't
be enough to satisfy the need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Millirons, 48-year-old space aficionados who met while
attending the University of Pittsburgh, estimate they have invested
$80,000 to $100,000 into Interorbital Systems -- most of the money
they earned by fabricating the propane tanks used by balloonist
Dick Rutan on his failed round-the-world venture.
</P>
<P>
   They spend three days a week at Mojave Airport, working in a
6,000-square-foot hangar. A 1-acre rocket-engine test site features
a hardened underground blockhouse, gantry and horizontal engine
test block big enough for liquid- and solid-fuel rocket engines
with thrusts up to 150,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Their work force is composed of about a dozen people who have
real jobs at places like the China Lake Naval Air Warfare Center.
They volunteer their time for the Millirons, working strictly for
the thrill of being involved with a space project.
</P>
<P>
   According to California officials, there is a potential $10
billion market over the next decade for launches of satellites that
could transmit cell phone calls, navigate cars, measure
environmental conditions or even tell farmers when to plant or
fertilize.
</P>
<P>
   Large companies such as Lockheed Martin and small
entrepreneurial start-ups like Interorbital are trying to bring the
cost of getting a payload into space from $10,000 a pound to under
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven California companies are developing space launch
systems -- some rockets, some aerospace planes that would fly into
space -- all with the idea of being cheaper than the space shuttle
or conventional disposable rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really anticipating an explosion in the space
industry,'' said Andrea Seastrand, executive director of the
California Space and Technology Alliance, the state's spaceport
authority. ``It's a shift in paradigms. Most people think in terms
of government-driven (space programs.) As we enter the 21st
century, it is an explosion of this market, of the new space
services industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Before traveling 35 million miles to put on their Red Planet
walking shoes, the Millirons' more immediate goal is to launch
their Tachyon S rocket this spring, though the launch site hasn't
been picked.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the 24-foot-long rocket will be propelled 90
miles up, coast for a few minutes in space and then come tumbling
back to earth a few miles from the launch site.
</P>
<P>
   To launch they need permission from the Federal Aviation
Administration, which licenses private launch sites and spacecraft,
under legislation passed by Congress in 1984 to regulate,
facilitate and promote the American private space industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress passed a bill enabling private companies to
fly spacecraft back from space, just like the shuttle does.
</P>
<P>
   Tachyon S -- tachyon is a theoretical subatomic particle
supposedly able to travel faster than the speed of light -- will be
followed by the larger and more powerful Tachyon L, a 30-foot-tall
rocket the Millirons expected to travel 150 miles up.
</P>
<P>
   Neither rocket will be powerful enough to put a satellite into
orbit. Like military and scientific research rockets launched in
the years before Sputnik in 1957, the rockets will go into space,
then fall to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Each will be capable of carrying payloads of up to 20 pounds,
which would eject at the highest point and parachute to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Millirons see customers using their rockets for such things
as testing instruments, conducting environmental sampling and
zero-gravity experiments. &QL; 
The Millirons have been married 25 years, and have chosen not to
have children. Instead, they are devoting their time to their
college jobs and space effort, working seven days and 80 hours a
week -- four days in Los Angeles, three in Mojave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up on hard-core science fiction of the 1950s ... all
of the space stuff, and we always wanted to do this,'' Randa
Milliron said. ``It's an obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Roderick Milliron is a chemistry instructor at California State
University, Los Angeles, and the president of the Pacific Rocket
Society. Before becoming a professor five years ago, he worked as
an engineer for Grumman Aerospace and General Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Randa Milliron is a radio and television instructor at Mount San
Antonio College. She also handles public relations for their
company, works with composite components for the rocket casing and
lends a hand wherever and whenever needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Millirons intend for the Tachyon rockets to serve as a
springboard for a bigger, much more ambitious effort: the
development of a two-stage, four-pilot orbital launcher called
Solaris.
</P>
<P>
   Solaris would launch vertically and have a two-member crew for
each stage. The 63-foot-long booster stage would power Solaris to
an altitude of about 220,000 feet, at which time the orbiter stage
would ignite at half power.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-foot-long orbiter stage would then detach from the
booster stage and go to full throttle on its way to orbit. While
that was occurring, the crew of the booster stage would glide back
to the launch site.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching orbit, the second stage crew would deploy their
satellite payload. The crew would then begin its re-entry
procedures and glide back to the launch site.
</P>
<P>
   The Solaris would be capable of delivering payloads ranging from
2,400 pounds to 3,100 pounds, depending on the type of orbit, for
$500 a pound. It now costs about $10,000 a pound for a space
shuttle to put a payload into space.
</P>
<P>
   The Millirons think they can develop Solaris for $30 million,
about the price of a jet fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A private-sector rocket company that carries out all
operations in-house, and avoids doing business with the
government-supported prime contractors can drastically cut costs.
It can freely apply `minimum cost design' practices and keep its
work force small,'' Randa Milliron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few engineers with superior talent and a creative approach
can accomplish more than 10 buildings full of run-of-the-mill
engineers for a lot less money.''

IS EDWARDS'S INJURY CAREER-THREATENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There were conflicting reports Saturday
night concerning the severity of Robert Edwards's knee dislocation
injury, one from the Patriots saying the running back may miss all
of next season and that his career is in jeopardy, the other, from
the Edwards camp, outlining a best-case two-month recovery period.
</P>
<P>
   A medical source in Honolulu said Edwards, who was injured while
playing with NFL rookies in a flag-football game on a Honolulu
beach as part of Pro Bowl festivities, needed immediate surgery on
his left knee because stress on the sole artery in the leg had
caused a blood clot. If surgery wasn't performed in a timely
fashion, the source said, amputation of the foot was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Honolulu doctors who requested anonymity explained that any time
a knee is dislocated there is concern about blood flow to the
extremity because there is only one artery in that region. The
popliteal artery is located in the hollow behind the knee. When a
dislocation occurs, the knee is bent backward and if that artery is
damaged, clotting begins.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards also suffered a tear of the posterior cruciate ligament,
but that appears to be the least of his problems.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Lawyer Milloy, who along with cornerback Ty Law and tight
end Ben Coates is representing the Patriots in Sunday's Pro Bowl,
said he visited briefly with Edwards Saturday and came away upbeat.
``Robert said his doctor told him two months of rehabilitation and
he should be fine and his spirits were definitely up,'' said
Milloy. ``I was bummed out (Friday) not being able to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my teammate and I care about him. It was a humbling sight
to see him on the respirator after surgery. I just wanted to show
my face and let him know ... I knew his girlfriend was coming in. I
just wanted to represent all three of us. He just said, `Tell Ty
and Ben to go out and have good games and represent us well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy said he and Edwards laughed about the timing of the
injury and the running back's reputation of being injury-prone
coming out of college. ``He said to me about 12 games into the
season, `This is the longest I ever lasted,''' said Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility Edwards will need to take anticoagulant
medication to prevent further clotting. Being on that medication
would prohibit Edwards from any contact. One of the problems may be
that if the blood doesn't flow properly to the knee, full healing
cannot take place.

A NEW COURSE FOR CADDIES  
 SIEFKER PLANS TO KEEP KIDS ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - How Doris Siefker became the founder and president of
the Caddie Foundation of Arizona is a most unusual story. How she
got Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan _ Tiger Woods' caddie _ to be her
organization's biggest supporter is another unlikely tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started when a friend asked me if I'd like to caddie
for him,'' recalled Siefker, 36, who grew up in Brazil before she
moved to the Valley in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was between jobs at the time, so I said, `Why not?' We went
out, played the round and I really liked it. Afterwards I was
thinking, `What a great game!' I liked everything that golf stood
for _ tradition, values, rules, doing the right thing, holding
yourself accountable. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   So Siefker got an idea. What if she could get kids interested in
being caddies?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to help kids out, because I love them,'' she said.
``Golf is the one sport that really emphasizes being a gentleman.
Kids need a strong foundation, and being a caddie gets them off the
street and on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish her rather large task, Siefker sought the help of
Jamie Waggoner, the executive director of the Arizona Women's Golf
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to know how to get organized, how to set up a
non-profit organization, and how to get funding from the U.S. Golf
Association and other governmental agencies,'' she said. ``Jamie
turned out to be a good friend, who really has helped me get the
CFAZ off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot more she had to pick up during her on-the-job
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we developed a mission statement, then I started out
recruiting caddies,'' she said. ``After we got the caddies, then I
had to set up training programs, as well as monitoring their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, of course, we had to find the courses. The Wigwam was
the first to come on board, although we've sent caddies to a lot of
other courses since. We also furnished caddies to the Thunderbirds
during the Phoenix Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Siefker, a former computer programmer, uses her technical skills
to cross-reference caddies with courses throughout the Valley. The
fee is $40, with $5 going back to the CFAZ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week we've gotten a little stronger,'' Siefker said of
the infant organization that is based in Glendale. ``I'm getting
stronger, too. When I send them out on a job now, I tell them to be
a `walking, talking yardage book.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Siefker's biggest coup might have been a recent clinic she did
with Cowan at the Wigwam Resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fluff understands the impact he can have on kids, and he was
nice enough to spend the evening with us, as well as do a video
that we plan to use in future caddie instruction,'' said Siefker,
who has affiliated the CFAZ with scholarship opportunities provided
by the Evans Scholarship Foundation for Caddies.
</P>
<P>
   What stuff did Fluff tell the youngsters?
</P>
<P>
   ``He told them to remember their three `ups,' '' she said,
smiling at what many consider a caddie's credo.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Show up. Shut up. Keep up.' If you're a caddie, that's
pretty good advice.'' &QL;

SUN DEVILS WOMEN DE LIVER; NOW IT'S THEIR COACH'S TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Desperate for respect, Arizona State took down
Washington, desperate to make the postseason, 72-69, in overtime of
a women's basketball thriller at Wells Fargo Arena on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Tom made a turnaround three-pointer with 5.3 seconds left
to force the five-minute overtime, much like the buzzer-beating
three-pointer that downed the seventh-ranked Huskies here last
year. Then a frenzied crowd of 2,614 carried the Sun Devils through
OT, the key shot being a three-pointer by Kristine Sand with 1:11
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The win sends ASU Coach Charli Turner Thorne to the hospital
today or Monday to deliver her first child with the inspiration she
asked for before tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told us her job is to inspire us, but she asked us to
inspire her,'' said Leaf Newman, who led the Devils with 15 points.
``She said when we win, it'll be her inspiration to push.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving birth is a little daunting for me,'' Turner Thorne
said. ``I wanted them to go out and inspire me by giving it
everything they've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne's son Conor, who will be induced if he doesn't
come naturally, is in for a wild ride in the first four weeks of
his life if ASU's final seven Pac-10 games are anything like his
due date.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils (10-10, 4-7 Pac-10) built a 28-14 lead, then were
outscored, 30-7, over the final 6:23 of the first half and opening
9:05 of the second half as Washington (10-10, 6-5) went ahead,
44-35.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies took some ill-advised shots, particularly Megan
Franza who keyed the comeback and had a game-high 21 points, and
were horrible from the free-throw line, finishing 8 for 21.
</P>
<P>
   That included 4 for 12 for senior forward Amber Hall, who single
handedly could have shut the door on a team Washington crushed by
32 points in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Redd, who played only 16 of 45 minutes after a verbal
confrontation with Coach June Daugherty when she was taken out
following a mix-up with Sand in the first half, missed on a 1-and-1
and Hall missed a follow near the end of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-point miss by Newman that went out of bounds to
ASU with 7.1 seconds, Georgie Lang inbounded to Tom, whose
three-point turnaround with Franza in her face tied the game at 59
and forced the Devils' second overtime of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it crossed my mind,'' said Tom of her 1998 heroics.
``We were down by 3 or 4 and they kept missing free throws. I was
like, it's mental, whoever wants it more.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU jumped ahead, 63-60, but the Huskies pulled even on a Hall
layup and 1 of 2 free throws. Sand's three-pointer followed, then
Franza and Julia Gray missed. Tom hit a free throw and, after
Natalie Tucker came up with a steal, Kitch Kitchen hit two more to
essentially seal the upset with 27 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ASU, striving for its first winning season since 1992-93,
remains at home next Saturday against Arizona (12-8, 7-4), another
team trying to reach the NCAA Tournament. &QL;

<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Cincinnati Bengals assistant John Garrett has
emerged as a candidate for the vacant coaching position on the
Cardinals' staff.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, who has been with the Bengals since 1995, is expected
to interview for the job early this week.
</P>
<P>
   He would replace departed quarterbacks coach Geep Chryst on the
Cardinals, but it is not known whether he would coach the
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett has spent most of his time in Cincinnati in quality
control, breaking down film of upcoming opponents and supervising
the team's computer operations. He also coached the Bengals wide
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Chryst handled the Cardinals' offensive quality control duties
in addition to coaching the quarterbacks. He resigned last week to
become offensive coordinator of the San Diego Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   If Garrett is hired, offensive coordinator Marc Trestman also
could handle the quarterbacks coach duties. Trestman was
quarterbacks coach of the Detroit Lions when the Cardinals hired
him 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, 33, is the brother of Dallas backup quarterback Jason
Garrett and the son of Cowboys scout Jim Garrett. He previously was
in the pro personnel department of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also are looking for a replacement for Keith Kidd
in their pro personnel department. Kidd resigned last Monday to
become pro personnel assistant of the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   One name that has surfaced for Kidd's old job is Indianapolis
Colts scout Duke Tobin, nephew of Cardinals head coach Vince Tobin
and son of former Colts Vice President Bill Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals hope to have both positions filled before the NFL
scouting combine, which begins Feb. 18 in Indianapolis. &QL;

CARDS TEETER ON FREE-AGENT PRECIPICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Cardinals need to sign outside linebacker  &UR; Jamir
 &UR; Miller or wide receiver  &UR; Rob Moore this week to avoid a potentially
messy off-season.
</P>
<P>
   If one signs before the free-agency period begins Friday, the
Cardinals can slap the franchise tag on the other and protect both.
</P>
<P>
   If neither signs, the Cardinals can put the franchise tag on
one, quite possibly alienating that player, and then sweat out the
signing of the other.
</P>
<P>
   It never should have come to this, because the Cardinals could
have signed Miller last year, a mistake that could cost them
dearly.
</P>
<P>
   Miller wasn't trying to become the NFL's richest linebacker last
spring. He just wanted the team to tear up the last year of his
rookie contract, which paid him a base salary of $710,000, more
than $3 million below market value.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Miller said he would have accepted a two- to
three-year deal worth between $4 million and $4.5 million a year
last spring. But the Cardinals didn't want to tear up his deal,
deciding to wait until he became a free agent at the end of the
1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if the Cardinals could sign him for $4 million a year,
they'd be getting a steal. Miller is seeking between $5 million and
$7 million a year, with his eye on the $6.5 million a year
Baltimore recently gave starting middle linebacker Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals maintain they haven't decide which player to
franchise _ Miller or Moore _ if neither agree to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 25, is the most valuable. He's five years younger and
has a chance to become one of the most dominant linebackers in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who turns 31 next season, probably is signing his final
contract, but he is in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson wants him to be the team's top
receiver and has made him his No. 1 free-agent priority. The New
York Giants and New Orleans also are interested.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals can't afford to lose either player.
</P>
<P>
   There are no linebackers in the draft anywhere close to being
ready to step in for Miller, who showed in the Dallas playoff game
how dangerous a pass rusher he could be if he were primarily used
in that role.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and Frank Sanders are one of the best pass-catching
combinations in the league and much better as a tandem than apart.
Plus, the Cardinals already are in the market for a receiver
because they are expected to lose Eric Metcalf, the team's third
receiver and return specialist last season. The loss of Moore would
mean they would have to completely rebuild that position.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals wouldn't be in this predicament had they shown
some foresight. Unfortunately, the people ultimately making the
money decisions in the organization usually don't do their best
bargaining until a gun is pointed at their heads. &QL; 
Coaching dilemma &QL; 
In a perfect world, the Cardinals would replace departed
quarterbacks coach  &UR; Geep Chryst with two people.
</P>
<P>
   They would hire a quarterback coach to work with  &UR; Jake Plummer _
you don't pay Plummer an NFL-record $15 million and not give him a
position coach to work with him.
</P>
<P>
   They also would hire a quality control coach to take over most
of the computer duties Chryst had.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unlikely Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin is going to get the OK from
ownership to make two hires because he increased the staff by one a
year ago when he added  &UR; Hank Kuhlmann to coach tight ends. So the
key might be finding a quarterback coach who also has a strong
computer background.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer is pushing hard for Arizona State quarterbacks coach
 &UR; John
 &UR; Pettas to get the job. It was Plummer who first mentioned Pettas as
a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also must find a replacement for  &UR; Keith Kidd in
their pro personnel department.
</P>
<P>
   Until a replacement for Kidd is found, former Cardinals
defensive line coach  &UR; Jim Stanley, who is a pro scout for team,
will handle many of Kidd's duties. &QL; 
Banks basher &QL; 
Former St. Louis Cardinals players recently were asked by the
``St.'' ``Louis Post-Dispatch'' newspaper about ways to fix the
mess on the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams enter next season with the NFL's worst record in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Several ex-Cardinals suggested that Rams Coach  &UR; Dick Vermeil get
tougher. They point out that five Rams players missed the team's
season-ending meeting without being punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to make some laws and some consequences,'' said
 &UR; Cedric
 &UR; Mack, who came to Phoenix as a cornerback with the team in 1988 and
now is a high school math teacher in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals running back  &UR; Willard Harrell said the Rams
need to do something about starting quarterback  &UR; Tony Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go to war with a doo-rag, an earring and a dog named
Felony,'' Harrell said of Banks. ``Hey, show me some urgency. Show
me some Jake Plummer-type leadership.'' &QL; 
Illegal contact &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heard about the San Diego Chargers' latest gaffe?
</P>
<P>
   Chargers General Manager  &UR; Bobby Beathard contacted former
Cardinals quarterback  &UR; Boomer Esiason, now an ABC-TV ``Monday Night
Football'' analyst, about coming out of retirement and becoming the
Chargers starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason told Beathard he still was property of the Cincinnati
Bengals because he retired with a year left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an honest mistake,'' said Bengals General Manager  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Brown, who has decided not to file tampering charges against the
Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason said he's not interested in coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I'm certainly flattered, I would only entertain serious
offers, and I don't think I'm going to get what I think it's going
to take to make me leave ABC,'' Esiason said. ``I'm not in serious
negotiations with anyone.'' &QL; 
Poor timing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston doesn't like the way he found
out he was made available to Cleveland for Monday's expansion
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there for 10 years,'' Johnston said. ``I shouldn't
be getting a call at 9:30 the morning of the day the list is
finalized and that's the first I hear about it. It's very
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys Vice President Stephen Jones said he understands why
Johnston is upset, but that the ``NFL didn't give us (enough) time
to put the list together.'' &QL;

<P>
   To the end, he was a king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal had spoken of his own mortality many times,
and his last journey Friday _ six thousand miles from an American
deathbed to the land he ruled for 46 years _ became him. Soldiers
prefer to die at home.
</P>
<P>
   He was an honorable man. He believed that if he trusted enough
in another person, his good faith would be returned; he was cruelly
rewarded...
</P>
<P>
   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to
drive his most vociferous political prisoner home?
</P>
<P>
   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man
easily riled _ and was imprisoned for asking why the queen wept at
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. When the king arrived at the prison,
Shubeilath delayed him ten minutes while he said goodbye to his
fellow inmates. Hussein waited patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done
that? Would King Fahd? Would President Mubarak? Would Benjamin
Netanyahu?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the
monsters of the Middle East, he appeared such a reasonable man.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Arabs and Israelis fear for the future. What are they
going to do now that there is no one to defuse the bombs? &QL;

</P>
<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah... &QL;

between more powerful countries, notably Israel and Iraq. King
Hussein's political career was spent playing off his enemies

(correctly) that Jordan's weakness _ 4.4 million people and no
natural resources or defenses _ left him no choice.

</P>
<P>
   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Hussein is dead, having succumbed to his toughest
enemy, cancer. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd can barely stand, and
stumbles on the simplest sentences. Yasser Arafat suffers ever more
from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal air crash.
Syria's Hafez Assad suffers from a heart condition, and has lost
his heir-apparent son, Basil, in a road accident. Egypt's Hosni
Mubarak has never appointed a vice-president, let alone a
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Succession'': it's the Middle East's unspoken crisis. The
great unmentionable. But it is real.
</P>
<P>
   We in the West, of course, accept the Arab world's odd,
dangerous system of inheritance. Why? Because we like
dictatorships. We know how to do business with the kings and
generals _ how to sell them our arms, fighter-bombers and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families... &QL;

<P>
   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan is dead, having succumbed to his toughest
enemy, cancer.
</P>
<P>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia _ plump to the point of obesity _ can
scarcely stand, and stumbles on the simplest sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat _ he of the shaking hand and trembling lip _
suffers ever more from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal
air crash.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad of Syria, who suffered a heart problem as
far back as 1983, has already lost his favorite son, Basil, in a
road accident.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has never _ not once in all his
18 years in power _ appointed a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Even to mention the word ``succession'' in public provokes a
familiar gesture by friends in the Middle East; their eyes move
ever so carefully over their shoulders. It is the unspoken crisis,
the great unmentionable, a subject heavy enough to poison any
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But it is real. And we in the West, of course, accept this odd,
cantankerous, dangerous system of inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Not once have we ever encouraged a democratic state in the
Middle East, one which would allow Arab citizens to choose their
own leaders. Because we like dictatorships. We know how to do
business with the kings and generals _ how to sell them our tanks
and fighter-bombers and missiles _ unless they disobey us, like
Gamal Nasser and Muammar Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bizarre feature of our present relations with the Arab
world that Saddam is the only leader whose overthrow President Bill
Clinton has called for in the name of ``democracy,'' demanding that
the Iraqis should have a government that ``represents its people
and respects them.''
</P>
<P>
   A likely tale. How many other Arab governments, for heaven's
sake _ with their secret police and their torture chambers _
``represent'' their people? And how many of them has President
Clinton sought to depose? Not one.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families.
</P>
<P>
   True, we were happy to see King Farouk booted out of Egypt and
King Idris out of Libya (we liked Qaddafi then) and to depose the
Sultan of Oman in favor of his public-school son. But we want
strong leaders who will be loyal to us. Let them have human rights,
we say. But we do not want democracy in their countries (which
means, of course, that there will be no human rights).
</P>
<P>
   And no choice for their people. At least King Hussein had the
wisdom and humility to discuss death with his people when he first
learned he had cancer. But the king _ whose kingdom falls into the
category of liberal amid the other xenophobic states of the region
_ never bothered to consult his citizens about their future leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians were given no chance to decide whom they wished to
rule them. His Majesty ordained that it would be his son Abdullah,
that power would be kept in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone expect anything else? It takes a brave Jordanian to
call for a real constitutional monarchy. Indeed, the only man who
consistently does just that, Leith Shubeilat, finds himself
frequently inside Amman's state security prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the titans of the Middle East have planned
their succession.
</P>
<P>
   President Assad _ whose energy still stuns the diplomats who sit
through his six-hour conversations _ has groomed his son Bashar, an
ophthalmologist by profession but an increasingly public
personality with an enthusiasm for computer technology, to follow
in his steps.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taken at face value, Syria's constitution provides for a
democratic system of succession, but Assad controls military,
political, and legislative power; he can dissolve governments and
assemblies; he is secretary-general of the Baath party, commander
in chief of the armed forces. Presumably, Bashar Assad will one day
do the same.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about Arafat? He has no obvious successor and no real
constitutional framework to create one. He has turned his back on
the democracy of the Palestinian assembly and survives by cronyism,
bribes and 13 different security services _ the latter in
cooperation with the CIA and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   So the Palestinians cannot choose their successor. But be sure
that the Israelis already have someone in mind to take over
``Palestine'' when Arafat leaves us.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, direct succession suggests a struggle to come
among the defense minister, Prince Sultan, Prince Naif and Crown
Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, aware of Abdullah's growing criticism and dislike of
the American presence in the Gulf _ he is said to have told U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen that not only could the United
States not use Saudi air bases to bomb Iraq, but that America might
have to leave those air bases altogether _ might favor Prince
Sultan.
</P>
<P>
   His son, it should be noted, is the influential Saudi ambassador
to the U.S., Prince Bandar, who in 1990 was reported in Washington
to be almost as powerful in President George Bush's office as the
secretary of state, James Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The result of our support for all these potentates is regularly
distorted by their Western supporters in Washington, London and,
less obviously, Paris. If we demand full democracy for these
nations, we are told, the Islamists will try to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Cannot we understand, our diplomats point out, that ``whatever
their failings'' (another of my favorite expressions in the Middle
East), these ``friends of the West'' are fighting Islamic
fundamentalism?
</P>
<P>
   So ``Islamic fundamentalism'' becomes the only real opposition
to the Arab governments. We support those undemocratic countries in
their battle against ``fundamentalist terror'' _ and shore up their
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that why we backed Saddam Hussein so generously during
his eight-year aggression against Iran? Because he was preventing
``fundamentalism?''
</P>
<P>
   So who will we put in Saddam's place? My guess is that the
Americans are still looking for a good old-fashioned Iraqi
brigadier-general, a military man who knows how to keep his tribes
in order.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it would have to be a powerful man, someone who
did not allow dissent to rock the regime, someone with a powerful
security service and a family that might provide a successor.
Someone, in fact, just like Saddam.  &LR;  &QL;

   So who will we put in Saddam's place? My guess is that the
Americans are still looking for a good old-fashioned Iraqi
brigadier-general, a military man who knows how to keep his tribes
in order.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it would have to be a powerful man, someone who
did not allow dissent to rock the regime, someone with a powerful
security service and a family that might provide a successor.
Someone, in fact, just like Saddam.  &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ From across the Middle East, there has come an
intriguing _ not to say astonishing _ chorus of approval for Crown
Prince Abdullah of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In the pages of ``Babel'' _ produced by the one editor you would
never contradict, Saddam Hussein's son, Oudai, readers have been
told Abdullah's appointment is ``one of the King's most intelligent
political decisions since the start of the Sixties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked
of King Hussein's ``magnificent job'' in arranging for his
succession.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, a former Israeli defense ministry official, Alon
Pinkas, said Abdullah was an ``excellent student'' in America.
Pinkas should know; he taught Jordan's future king at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   But when Saddam Hussein, Madeleine Albright and the Israelis all
sing the same tune, something has got to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israelis were prepared to send a killer squad to Amman to
assassinate a Palestinian leader after the peace treaty with
Jordan, why should they be any more prepared to respect the
integrity of Abdullah's kingdom?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the first meetings that Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu held to discuss Abdullah's succession included
Ephraim Halevy, head of the Mossad intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials were quoted as saying they would be behind the
Crown Prince ``in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Saddam Hussein was prepared to send his killer squads to
knock off the Iraqi opposition in Amman, why should his son
suddenly wish to improve relations with the Hashemite dynasty that
gave political asylum to President Saddam's son-in-laws?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the Iraqis have suddenly remembered King
Hussein's former friendship with Saddam? Or are they anxious to
ensure Abdullah does not allow the United States to use Amman as a
base to overthrow Saddam's regime?
</P>
<P>
   Closer study of Mrs. Albright's tribute shows she hoped the
transition to Abdullah was ``one that does not cause problems.''
What sort of problems, one wonders, was she anticipating?
Resistance to his leadership from Palestinian Jordanians? Or
resistance by Crown Prince Abdullah to pressure from Washington?
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to be a ``friend'' of America _ another to be
obedient to the wishes of an American president. What if Abdullah
shows as much independence of spirit as his father did in 1991,
when he refused to support the West's military campaign against
Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, a disturbing irony in the fact that while
British aircraft fly the skies of Iraq's ``no-fly'' zones, a
half-British prince is preparing to rule Iraq's closest Arab
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial history of Jordan can only be reemphasized by
Abdullah's succession. It is not just his English accent _ after
all, the British put his grandfather on the throne, propped up his
father with military leaders (until King Hussein grew tired of
them) and can now claim a half-share in the next king's bloodline.
</P>
<P>
   It's as well for the Palestinians of Jordan _ perhaps 65 percent
of the country _ that Abdullah's wife, Rania al-Yassine, is
Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arabs, it should be said, have accepted the new crown
prince's appointment, not with enthusiasm but with the kind of
weariness born of knowing that they will never have a say in the
appointment of their leaders (and only occasionally in their
overthrow).
</P>
<P>
   ``America decided it should be Abdullah,'' one of Lebanon's more
cynical politicians said Friday. ``Without Washington's approval,
he would never have been appointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is true that American fighter-bombers are based _
albeit with less publicity than in the Gulf _ on at least one major
Jordanian airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that before King Hussein's original journey to
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota last year, the Americans were trying
to persuade him to allow the principle Iraqi opposition groups to
use Amman as their headquarters for the future overthrow of Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there was much talk in Jordan of a move eastwards
by the Jordanian army into the Iraqi desert, where the Jordanians
(sponsored by the Americans) would set up a ``sanctuary'' to which
Saddam's dissident legions would supposedly flock before setting
out on a crusade to destroy their Iraqi tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah knows all about dissent _ and how to
suppress it. His special forces units were used to quell riots in
several Jordanian towns last year. Is he then the man the Americans
might now choose to open up a corridor into Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder ``Babel'' lavished praise on Abdullah's appointment.
This is not the time for Saddam Hussein's son to offend the son of
King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder Netanyahu _ while claiming to pray for the
``miracle'' of King Hussein's return to health _ described his
country's peace with Jordan as ``one of the cornerstones of
Israel's national security.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew when King Hussein's anger would break _ Netanyahu was
lucky to get his would-be assassins back from Jordan without a
show-trial in Amman _ but cannot guess when Abdullah's patience
might become exhausted. &QL;

ensure Abdullah does not allow the United States to use Amman as a
base to overthrow Saddam's regime?
</P>
<P>
   Closer study of Mrs. Albright's tribute shows she hoped the
transition to Abdullah was ``one that does not cause problems.''
What sort of problems, one wonders, was she anticipating?
Resistance to his leadership from Palestinian Jordanians? Or
resistance by Crown Prince Abdullah to pressure from Washington?
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to be a ``friend'' of America _ another to be
obedient to the wishes of an American president. What if Abdullah
shows as much independence of spirit as his father did in 1991,
when he refused to support the West's military campaign against
Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, a disturbing irony in the fact that while
British aircraft fly the skies of Iraq's ``no-fly'' zones, a
half-British prince is preparing to rule Iraq's closest Arab
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial history of Jordan can only be reemphasized by
Abdullah's succession. It is not just his English accent _ after
all, the British put his grandfather on the throne, propped up his
father with military leaders (until King Hussein grew tired of
them) and can now claim a half-share in the next king's bloodline.
</P>
<P>
   It's as well for the Palestinians of Jordan _ perhaps 65 percent
of the country _ that Abdullah's wife, Rania al-Yassine, is
Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arabs, it should be said, have accepted the new crown
prince's appointment, not with enthusiasm but with the kind of
weariness born of knowing that they will never have a say in the
appointment of their leaders (and only occasionally in their
overthrow).
</P>
<P>
   ``America decided it should be Abdullah,'' one of Lebanon's more
cynical politicians said Friday. ``Without Washington's approval,
he would never have been appointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is true that American fighter-bombers are based _
albeit with less publicity than in the Gulf _ on at least one major
Jordanian airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that before King Hussein's original journey to
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota last year, the Americans were trying
to persuade him to allow the principle Iraqi opposition groups to
use Amman as their headquarters for the future overthrow of Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there was much talk in Jordan of a move eastwards
by the Jordanian army into the Iraqi desert, where the Jordanians
(sponsored by the Americans) would set up a ``sanctuary'' to which
Saddam's dissident legions would supposedly flock before setting
out on a crusade to destroy their Iraqi tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah knows all about dissent _ and how to
suppress it. His special forces units were used to quell riots in
several Jordanian towns last year. Is he then the man the Americans
might now choose to open up a corridor into Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder ``Babel'' lavished praise on Abdullah's appointment.
This is not the time for Saddam Hussein's son to offend the son of
King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder Netanyahu _ while claiming to pray for the
``miracle'' of King Hussein's return to health _ described his
country's peace with Jordan as ``one of the cornerstones of
Israel's national security.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew when King Hussein's anger would break _ Netanyahu was
lucky to get his would-be assassins back from Jordan without a
show-trial in Amman _ but cannot guess when Abdullah's patience
might become exhausted. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ From across the Middle East, there has come an
intriguing _ not to say astonishing _ chorus of approval for Crown
Prince Abdullah of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In the pages of ``Babel'' _ produced by the one editor you would
never contradict, Saddam Hussein's son, Oudai, readers have been
told Abdullah's appointment is ``one of the King's most intelligent
political decisions since the start of the Sixties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked
of King Hussein's ``magnificent job'' in arranging for his
succession.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, a former Israeli defense ministry official, Alon
Pinkas, said Abdullah was an ``excellent student'' in America.
Pinkas should know; he taught Jordan's future king at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   But when Saddam Hussein, Madeleine Albright and the Israelis all
sing the same tune, something has got to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israelis were prepared to send a killer squad to Amman to
assassinate a Palestinian leader after the peace treaty with
Jordan, why should they be any more prepared to respect the
integrity of Abdullah's kingdom?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the first meetings that Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu held to discuss Abdullah's succession included
Ephraim Halevy, head of the Mossad intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials were quoted as saying they would be behind the
Crown Prince ``in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Saddam Hussein was prepared to send his killer squads to
knock off the Iraqi opposition in Amman, why should his son
suddenly wish to improve relations with the Hashemite dynasty that
gave political asylum to President Saddam's son-in-laws?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the Iraqis have suddenly remembered King
Hussein's former friendship with Saddam? Or are they anxious to
ensure Abdullah does not allow the United States to use Amman as a
base to overthrow Saddam's regime?
</P>
<P>
   Closer study of Mrs. Albright's tribute shows she hoped the
transition to Abdullah was ``one that does not cause problems.''
What sort of problems, one wonders, was she anticipating?

<TEXT>
<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Glubb had disagreed with Hussein over military strategy _ the
young king wanted to retaliate against the Israelis for raids on
his border _ and Glubb also presented Hussein with a list of Arab
Legion officers whom he claimed were ``subversives'' and should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, it is fair to ask why we were surprised
by the suddenness of the political upheaval in Amman. The
Hashemites have always lived on the edge, provoking disaster and
recovery with a drama and nerve that astonishes other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tendency to move rapidly between rage and
contemplation, political folly and eternal friendship that might be
a characteristic of the Gulf Arabs rather than the Levant.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein's family does, indeed, come from the Gulf, from the
province of Hejaz, and it was his great-grandfather (also Hussein)
whom the Ottomans named as emir, sheriff of the holy Muslim city of
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   An austere religious group faithful to the al-Saud family _ the
``Islamic fundamentalists'' of their time _ were to drive the
Hashemites from what was to become Saudi Arabia, and Winston
Churchill was to appoint King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah as
emir of Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had wanted to be King of Palestine (for which the
British had other plans). Abdullah's brother, Feisel, would become
King of Iraq _ a consolation prize for losing the monarchy of Syria
(for which the French had other plans).
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah tried to make peace with the Zionists who were
planning their new state on Palestinian land _ and after the
Palestinian catastrophe of 1948, the monarch's life was forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   He had annexed the West Bank of the Jordan River; almost all the
rest of Palestine had become Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year old Hussein personally witnessed Abdullah's
assassination in Jerusalem, a killing organized by Palestinians,
but involving one of the Arab Legion's most trusted officers _ the
very man who had signed the cease-fire agreement for Jordan in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites were thus a family of loss, a dynasty used to
suspicion as well as resolution. They lost the Hejaz, lost the west
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad 10 years later, King Feisel the Second (grandson of
old Abdullah's brother, who had been appointed by the British) was
assassinated in a Baathist coup which, 20 years on, would bring
Saddam Hussein to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, King Hussein _ in the greatest disaster of his career _
chose to join Egypt and Syria in their war against Israel, and was
driven out of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, therefore, the Hashemites had lost
the Hejaz, Iraq and all of Palestine. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the story of the Hashemites has become the story of
the Plucky Little King, who now lies dying in the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   His English schooling naturally endeared him to the British who
admire courage in adversity. When he married Antoinette Avril
Gardiner, daughter of a Royal Engineers lieutenant colonel, in
1961, it felt as though Jordan had become a British protectorate
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni,'' who became Princess Muna, gave birth to two sons,
Abdullah _ now the crown prince _ and Feisel. She was the second of
four wives for a king whose marriages could be as dramatic and
turbulent as his nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   He had divorced his first, older wife Dina within 18 months (the
Jordanian ambassador to Egypt delivered the king's goodbye letter
to the queen when she was visiting a sick relative in Cairo).
</P>
<P>
   The marriage to Toni foundered when his roving eye settled upon
the beautiful Alia Toucan, an employee of Royal Jordanian Airlines,
whose love for the king may have given him lasting peace of mind _
they married in 1972 _ had she not been killed in a helicopter
crash five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he married Lisa Halaby, who became Queen Noor, an
equally beautiful but forceful woman who physically towered over
the king and who developed a strong, and well-founded, distrust of
his introverted, over-intellectualizing brother Hassan (if he had
become king, it was said in Amman, she would have left Jordan). &QL;

   Having lost the West Bank, the king had to face the
consequences: Palestinian contempt, and what amounted to an
attempted coup d'etat by Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   With a ruthlessness that has still not been fully acknowledged,
Hussein's Bedouin troops slaughtered their way through the
Palestinian camps of Jordan and crushed guerrilla power.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned from his rash decision to go to war in 1967, he
sat out the 1973 Middle East conflict in near-silence, maintaining
semi-secret contacts with Israeli leaders, just as his grandfather
had done.
</P>
<P>
   What he had, he would hold. The Plucky Little King would be a
friend of the West. When a Washington newspaper claimed that the
king had received millions from the CIA, the stories were
suppressed in Amman. &QL;

   Hassan, the youngest brother, married a Pakistani wife, and
devoted himself to Jordan's development before ambition took
control of his loyalty. A friend of the king once dangerously

   Long regarded as a pliable ``friend'' of the west, King Hussein
astonished his American allies by embracing Saddam Hussein _ quite
literally _ after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Did he really believe
Saddam would ``liberate'' Jerusalem? Or that Jordan could survive
without the Gulf Arabs?
</P>
<P>
   He grew a beard; in Amman, he was called ``Sheriff of Mecca.''
The Saudis were enraged. He appeared to be looking towards lost
lands. He knew the Palestinians would support Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He became the most popular monarch in the Arab world at the very
moment he became the most unpopular monarch in the west.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Americans were ready to roll up the Hashemite
carpet. U.S. newspapers were predicting the end of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   But then _ stunned by Yasser Arafat's secret ``peace'' deal with
Israel and himself now politically and economically weakened (an
essential ingredient for any nation wishing to make peace with the
Israelis), the king made his own peace with Yitzhak Shamir and
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   And overnight, the treacherous ally of the beastly Saddam became
again the Plucky Little King. &QL;

   His appointment of Crown Prince Abdullah as regent may safeguard
the Hashemite inheritance. But the pressures will grow greater in
the coming months and years.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would like Abdullah to host the anti-Saddam Iraqi
opposition in Amman, and encourage him to make a military foray
into western Iraq to create a ``safe haven'' for Saddam's Iraqi
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jordanians, as usual, have been given no role in the
succession. The Hashemites may claim their ancestry back to the
Prophet Muhamed _ as they do _ but they are Tudors rather than
democrats, an oligarchy rather than a modern monarchy, however
liberal and decent they are as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is a tank commander, a proven general of Hussein's
Praetorian Guard. In Amman, they tell you not to be fooled by the
soft smile, that Abdullah is a tough guy. He needs to be if he is
going to inherit his father's formidable mantle. &QL;

   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, it is fair to ask why we were surprised
by the suddenness of the political upheaval in Amman. The
Hashemites have always lived on the edge, provoking disaster and
recovery with a drama and nerve that astonishes other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tendency to move rapidly between rage and
contemplation, political folly and eternal friendship that might be
a characteristic of the Gulf Arabs rather than the Levant.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein's family does, indeed, come from the Gulf, from the
province of Hejaz, and it was his great-grandfather (also Hussein)
whom the Ottomans named as emir, sheriff of the holy Muslim city of
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   An austere religious group faithful to the al-Saud family _ the
``Islamic fundamentalists'' of their time _ were to drive the
Hashemites from what was to become Saudi Arabia, and Winston
Churchill was to appoint King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah as
emir of Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had wanted to be King of Palestine (for which the
British had other plans). Abdullah's brother, Feisel, would become
King of Iraq _ a consolation prize for losing the monarchy of Syria
(for which the French had other plans).
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah tried to make peace with the Zionists who were
planning their new state on Palestinian land _ and after the
Palestinian catastrophe of 1948, the monarch's life was forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   He had annexed the West Bank of the Jordan River; almost all the
rest of Palestine had become Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year old Hussein personally witnessed Abdullah's
assassination in Jerusalem, a killing organized by Palestinians,
but involving one of the Arab Legion's most trusted officers _ the
very man who had signed the cease-fire agreement for Jordan in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites were thus a family of loss, a dynasty used to
suspicion as well as resolution. They lost the Hejaz, lost the west
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad 10 years later, King Feisel the Second (grandson of
old Abdullah's brother, who had been appointed by the British) was
assassinated in a Baathist coup which, 20 years on, would bring
Saddam Hussein to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, King Hussein _ in the greatest disaster of his career _
chose to join Egypt and Syria in their war against Israel, and was
driven out of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, therefore, the Hashemites had lost
the Hejaz, Iraq and all of Palestine. &QL;

Abdullah _ now the crown prince _ and Feisel. She was the second of

<P>
   He had divorced his first, older wife Dina within 18 months (the
Jordanian ambassador to Egypt delivered the king's goodbye letter
to the queen when she was visiting a sick relative in Cairo).

<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Glubb had disagreed with Hussein over military strategy _ the
young king wanted to retaliate against the Israelis for raids on
his border _ and Glubb also presented Hussein with a list of Arab
Legion officers whom he claimed were ``subversives'' and should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.

   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his

 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF THE INDEPENDENT  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the West pays its respects to the memory of King Hussein of
Jordan, it should pause to acknowledge a conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   The King has been a good leader, of his own people and of wider
Arab interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, his achievement was to hold together the country
he inherited from his father, despite the loss of the West Bank and
the influx of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, his legacy is to have made peace with Israel,
and helped broker more realistic positions by his Arab neighbors in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be hoped that the rather Shakespearian deathbed
maneuvers, dashing at the 11th hour his brother's 34-year
expectation of inheriting the crown in favor of his eldest son,
Abdullah, will come to good.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Hassan had a high reputation abroad, especially in
Israel where his fluent command of Hebrew and friendship with
leading politicians meant he was a known and trusted quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Son Abdullah, on the other hand, has a reputation merely as a
top soldier. It is assumed that he has learned political skills
from watching his father for the past 37 years, but it is not
certain.
</P>
<P>
   And it is assumed that, as someone educated in Britain, he
shares _ or at least understands _ the values of liberal democracy,
and will thus continue King Hussein's pro-Western, pragmatic and
peaceful policy.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the values of liberal democracy that the conundrum
lies. Western liberal democrats tend to take it as read that, if
the Arab countries were democracies, the prospects of peace in the
Middle East would be better. But it could be that it was preferable
that an enlightened despot should have ruled Jordan for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of democracy in a culture dominated by grievance
against external enemies is that it could throw up an Islamicist
demagogue who would want to fight again the wars of 1967 and 1973
against Israel, or fight the holy war against the
American-dominated world order.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, though, it could be argued that it is only by moving
towards democracy that the rage of Moslem fundamentalism will be
channelled into a constructive engagement with the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence from other parts of the globe is unclear. India and
Pakistan are both democracies, and that has not stopped a series of
``hot'' wars, or an escalating ``cold'' war of nuclear weapons
competition. Nor have the excesses of Islamic theocracy been
noticeably curbed in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of democracy is not raised by the succession in Jordan
alone. Power has been effectively handed down in the house of King
Fahd in Saudi Arabia, while leaders in Egypt and Syria will be
replaced in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Gaddafi in Libya is not a well man, while even Saddam
Hussein must be approaching his rendezvous with mortality.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, King Hussein's limited moves towards a
constitutional monarchy should be seen as a welcome attempt to
secure power based on popular consent. King Abdullah should be
given support to broaden his democratic base.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for advancing the Middle East peace process,
though, lies in a different succession battle later this year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israeli elections replace Benjamin Netanyahu with a
leader who can unite the forces committed to peace and dialogue
with the Palestinians, which are greater than the forces of
hostility, then King Hussein's life work stands a chance of being
completed. &QL;

<P>
   As the West pays its respects to the memory of King Hussein of
Jordan, it should pause to acknowledge a conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   The King has been a good leader, of his own people and of wider
Arab interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, his achievement was to hold together the country
he inherited from his father, despite the loss of the West Bank and
the influx of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, his legacy is to have made peace with Israel,
and helped broker more realistic positions by his Arab neighbors in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be hoped that the rather Shakespearian deathbed
maneuvers, dashing at the 11th hour his brother's 34-year
expectation of inheriting the crown in favor of his eldest son,
Abdullah, will come to good.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Hassan had a high reputation abroad, especially in
Israel where his fluent command of Hebrew and friendship with
leading politicians meant he was a known and trusted quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Son Abdullah, on the other hand, has a reputation merely as a
top soldier. It is assumed that he has learned political skills
from watching his father for the past 37 years, but it is not
certain.
</P>
<P>
   And it is assumed that, as someone educated in Britain, he
shares _ or at least understands _ the values of liberal democracy,
and will thus continue King Hussein's pro-Western, pragmatic and
peaceful policy.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the values of liberal democracy that the conundrum
lies. Western liberal democrats tend to take it as read that, if
the Arab countries were democracies, the prospects of peace in the
Middle East would be better. But it could be that it was preferable
that an enlightened despot should have ruled Jordan for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of democracy in a culture dominated by grievance
against external enemies is that it could throw up an Islamicist
demagogue who would want to fight again the wars of 1967 and 1973
against Israel, or fight the holy war against the
American-dominated world order.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, though, it could be argued that it is only by moving
towards democracy that the rage of Moslem fundamentalism will be
channelled into a constructive engagement with the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence from other parts of the globe is unclear. India and
Pakistan are both democracies, and that has not stopped a series of
``hot'' wars, or an escalating ``cold'' war of nuclear weapons
competition. Nor have the excesses of Islamic theocracy been
noticeably curbed in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of democracy is not raised by the succession in Jordan
alone. Power has been effectively handed down in the house of King
Fahd in Saudi Arabia, while leaders in Egypt and Syria will be
replaced in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Gaddafi in Libya is not a well man, while even Saddam
Hussein must be approaching his rendezvous with mortality.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, King Hussein's limited moves towards a
constitutional monarchy should be seen as a welcome attempt to
secure power based on popular consent. King Abdullah should be
given support to broaden his democratic base.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for advancing the Middle East peace process,
though, lies in a different succession battle later this year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israeli elections replace Benjamin Netanyahu with a
leader who can unite the forces committed to peace and dialogue
with the Palestinians, which are greater than the forces of
hostility, then King Hussein's life work stands a chance of being

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the end, he was a king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal had spoken of his own mortality many times,
and his last journey Friday _ six thousand miles from an American
deathbed to the land he ruled for 46 years _ became him. Soldiers
prefer to die at home.
</P>
<P>
   A military man, a field commander, Sandhurst graduate. King
Hussein had the disconcerting habit when I first met him of calling
me ``Sir'' _ he used it with everyone, a gesture of respect that
humbled the visitor (and was intended to).
</P>
<P>
   That's why we called him the Plucky Little King, the PLK. Honor
was the word that came to mind. He was an honorable man. He
believed that if he trusted enough in another person, his good
faith would be returned; he was cruelly rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who betrayed his hopes will come to his funeral.
The Gulf rulers, for example, who never understood why he could not
condemn Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1991; the Israelis
who showed their respect for their peace treaty with King Hussein
by sending a murder squad to Amman last year; Yasser Arafat, who
allowed his Palestinian guerrillas to attempt a coup d'etat in 1970
and lied to him about his secret deal with Israel in 1994; and the
American president who repeatedly promised the king a just peace in
the Middle East _ and then proved too cowardly to confront the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   And we shall have to suffer all the glitzy adoration that the
guilty show for dead kings.
</P>
<P>
   We've already heard President Clinton's soliloquy _ ``a
wonderful human being...a champion of peace'' _ and we know what
Arafat will say because he's said it before: that King Hussein has
been a Salaheddin, the warrior knight who drove the crusaders from
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it was the Israelis who drove the Hashemites from
Palestine, but Clinton's words _ despite the gutless nature of the
man who uttered them _ somehow got it right.
</P>
<P>
   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to
drive his most vociferous political prisoner home?
</P>
<P>
   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man
easily riled _ and was imprisoned for asking why the queen wept at
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   When the king arrived at the prison, Shubeilath delayed him ten
minutes while he said goodbye to his fellow inmates. Hussein waited
patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done
that? Would King Fahd? Would President Mubarak? Would Benjamin
Netanyahu?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the
monsters of the Middle East, he appeared such a reasonable man.
</P>
<P>
   He was also, in an odd way, a careless man. His folly at joining
Egypt's war against Israel in 1967 was compounded in 1990 by his
support for Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein demonstrated an equal but more personal recklessness _
hubris, perhaps? _ when he rode in the cold, rain-lashed streets of
Amman two weeks ago in an open-top car.
</P>
<P>
   After his first brush with cancer, I asked the king if he had
been cured of his illness. ``The doctors gave me an excellent bill
of health,'' he replied _ how painful those words sound now _ and
then I noticed the packet of cigarettes lying on the table in front
of him. ``Ah, yes,'' he said. ``These are the only things I haven't
yet given up.'' And he flicked his finger at the packet in disdain.
</P>
<P>
   If his desire for peace showed vision, he lacked foresight. With
their usual obsequiousness, western as well as Arab leaders have
been praising the King for returning to Jordan Jan. 19 to fire his
brother Hassan and create his eldest son crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``Setting his affairs in order'' was what they called it. But
even if we ignore the lack of any democratic process for the
succession, it was a bit late in the day to start switching your
crown princes around.
</P>
<P>
   The man who had cemented relationships with scores of kings and
generals and presidents _ albeit not always impressive
relationships _ was suddenly replaced by a man who knew none of
them. No wonder Jordanians fear the future.
</P>
<P>
   For Prince Abdullah is going to have a spot of bother with the
kings and presidents at that funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for example, will be keen to get the new monarch to set
the Iraqi opposition up with hearth and home in Amman, perhaps even
to risk a little military foray into Iraq to set up a ``safe
haven'' for Saddam's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis would be smiling along with that idea. At which
point Saddam would become a threat. But refuse the United States
president _ which is what Jordanians would want him to do _ and
Abdullah may start his reign with an unsympathetic if not downright
hostile Washington at his back.
</P>
<P>
   Threaten Saddam and the Americans will love him. Ignore
Washington and his people will love him; it's the same old trap his
father walked into in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But what Abdullah cannot be is his father. If relations are
breaking down between Egypt and Sudan, call King Hussein. If
there's civil war in Lebanon, ask King Hussein's advice.
</P>
<P>
   When Arafat and Netanyahu cannot abide each other at the Wye
Plantation, drag King Hussein from his sick bed to sort them out _
much good did it do the monarch, who was betrayed yet again.
</P>
<P>
   But it symbolized what the PLK was so good at: defusing the
Middle East explosion.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Arabs and Israelis fear for the future. What are they
going to do now that there is no one to defuse the bombs? &QL;

haven'' for Saddam's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis would be smiling along with that idea. At which
point Saddam would become a threat. But refuse the United States
president _ which is what Jordanians would want him to do _ and
Abdullah may start his reign with an unsympathetic if not downright
hostile Washington at his back.
</P>
<P>
   Threaten Saddam and the Americans will love him. Ignore
Washington and his people will love him; it's the same old trap his
father walked into in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But what Abdullah cannot be is his father. If relations are
breaking down between Egypt and Sudan, call King Hussein. If
there's civil war in Lebanon, ask King Hussein's advice.
</P>
<P>
   When Arafat and Netanyahu cannot abide each other at the Wye
Plantation, drag King Hussein from his sick bed to sort them out _
much good did it do the monarch, who was betrayed yet again.
</P>
<P>
   But it symbolized what the PLK was so good at: defusing the
Middle East explosion.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Arabs and Israelis fear for the future. What are they
going to do now that there is no one to defuse the bombs? &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the end, he was a king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal had spoken of his own mortality many times,
and his last journey Friday _ six thousand miles from an American
deathbed to the land he ruled for 46 years _ became him. Soldiers
prefer to die at home.
</P>
<P>
   A military man, a field commander, Sandhurst graduate. King
Hussein had the disconcerting habit when I first met him of calling
me ``Sir'' _ he used it with everyone, a gesture of respect that
humbled the visitor (and was intended to).
</P>
<P>
   That's why we called him the Plucky Little King, the PLK. Honor
was the word that came to mind. e was an honorable man. He
believed that if he trusted enough in another person, his good
faith would be returned; he was cruelly rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who betrayed his hopes will come to his funeral.
The Gulf rulers, for example, who never understood why he could not
condemn Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1991; the Israelis
who showed their respect for their peace treaty with King Hussein
by sending a murder squad to Amman last year; Yasser Arafat, who
allowed his Palestinian guerrillas to attempt a coup d'etat in 1970
and lied to him about his secret deal with Israel in 1994; and the
American president who repeatedly promised the king a just peace in
the Middle East _ and then proved too cowardly to confront the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   And we shall have to suffer all the glitzy adoration that the
guilty show for dead kings.
</P>
<P>
   We've already heard President Clinton's soliloquy _ ``a
wonderful human being...a champion of peace'' _ and we know what
Arafat will say because he's said it before: that King Hussein has
been a Salaheddin, the warrior knight who drove the crusaders from
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it was the Israelis who drove the Hashemites from
Palestine, but Clinton's words _ despite the gutless nature of the
man who uttered them _ somehow got it right.
</P>
<P>
   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to
drive his most vociferous political prisoner home?
</P>
<P>
   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man
easily riled _ and was imprisoned for asking why the queen wept at
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   When the king arrived at the prison, Shubeilath delayed him ten
minutes while he said goodbye to his fellow inmates. Hussein waited
patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done
that? Would King Fahd? Would President Mubarak? Would Benjamin
Netanyahu?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the
monsters of the Middle East, he appeared such a reasonable man.
</P>
<P>
   He was also, in an odd way, a careless man. His folly at joining
Egypt's war against Israel in 1967 was compounded in 1990 by his
support for Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein demonstrated an equal but more personal recklessness _
hubris, perhaps? _ when he rode in the cold, rain-lashed streets of
Amman two weeks ago in an open-top car.
</P>
<P>
   After his first brush with cancer, I asked the king if he had
been cured of his illness. ``The doctors gave me an excellent bill
of health,'' he replied _ how painful those words sound now _ and
then I noticed the packet of cigarettes lying on the table in front
of him. ``Ah, yes,'' he said. ``These are the only things I haven't
yet given up.'' And he flicked his finger at the packet in disdain.
</P>
<P>
   If his desire for peace showed vision, he lacked foresight. With
their usual obsequiousness, western as well as Arab leaders have
been praising the King for returning to Jordan Jan. 19 to fire his
brother Hassan and create his eldest son crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``Setting his affairs in order'' was what they called it. But
even if we ignore the lack of any democratic process for the
succession, it was a bit late in the day to start switching your
crown princes around.
</P>
<P>
   The man who had cemented relationships with scores of kings and
generals and presidents _ albeit not always impressive
relationships _ was suddenly replaced by a man who knew none of
them. No wonder Jordanians fear the future.
</P>
<P>
   For Prince Abdullah is going to have a spot of bother with the
kings and presidents at that funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for example, will be keen to get the new monarch to set
the Iraqi opposition up with hearth and home in Amman, perhaps even
to risk a little military foray into Iraq to set up a ``safe
haven'' for Saddam's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis would be smiling along with that idea. At which
point Saddam would become a threat. But refuse the United States
president _ which is what Jordanians would want him to do _ and
Abdullah may start his reign with an unsympathetic if not downright
hostile Washington at his back.

Washington and his people will love him; it's the same old trap his

   AMMAN _ It was always a balancing act. Jordan is a buffer state
between more powerful countries, notably Israel and Iraq. King
Hussein's political career was spent playing off his enemies
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy. The king needed to keep in with the great
powers, but preserve his nationalist credentials.
</P>
<P>
   An early act of the young Harrow and Sandhurst-educated monarch
was to fire his British military adviser Glubb Pasha.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 he joined Egypt and Syria to fight Israel only to lose
the West Bank. In 1991 he won overwhelming popular support from
Jordanians by maintaining a friendly neutrality towards Iraq during
the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   But the king was also the man who crushed the Palestinians in
Jordan in a bloody civil war in 1970. Three years later he secretly
flew to Israel to tell a disbelieving Israeli prime minister that
Egypt and Syria were about to launch a war.
</P>
<P>
   He played both ends against the middle because he believed
Jordan's weakness _ 4.4 million people and no natural resources or
defenses _ left him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   The king also knew that foreign policy failure would have
immediate domestic consequences. More than half the population of
Jordan is Palestinian, largely excluded from power but dominating
private business. He needed an Israeli guarantee against Iraq, but
not at the price of permanently alienating the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   His death comes at a bad moment for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the King signed a peace treaty with Israel. It has
produced no economic and few political dividends, though it got him
back into the good graces of the U.S. after the Gulf war. It is
unpopular among Jordanians and Palestinians alike. A year later he
broke with Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   But peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians are
stalemated and Saddam Hussein has survived. Both have felt free to
send their assassination squads into the streets of Amman.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is pressuring Jordan to turn itself into a base for
action against Iraq, a policy wildly unpopular among ordinary
Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   There is a much bigger question mark over the future of
Jordanian policy than expected a month ago. This is because of the
dismissal of Crown Prince Hassan, the king's brother and primary
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   The new heir to the throne, the king's eldest son, Abdullah, is
an unknown quantity. The Washington Post says that his supporters
recently hired a former CIA section as ``public relations
consultant'' creating doubts about the judgement of the men around
him.
</P>
<P>
   One of Abdullah's strengths may be an ability to improve
relations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, who never forgave
King Hussein for his stance in the Gulf war. The Jordanian embassy
in Kuwait is reopening and Gulf rulers are reported to have offered
financial support.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment Jordan is weaker, because part of its strength
was the political astuteness and prestige of King Hussein. It is
less capable of sustaining political shocks stemming from the
American and British confrontation with Iraq or the deteriorating
relations between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Its neighbor are waiting to see if the house King Hussein built
will hold together. &QL;

   EDS: The following stories are moving in response to the death
of King Hussein today.
</P>
<P>
   HUSSEIN-JORDAN _ AMMAN, Jordan _ The 47-year reign of King
Hussein ended on Sunday after the ailing monarch has been kept
alive on life support for two days. He was 63. As if on cue, a
dense fog rolled into the capital city indicative of the cloud
hanging over this tiny desert kingdom known for its stability in a
turbulent region. Crown Prince Abdullah, Hussein's first-born son,
was quickly sworn in in a five-minute ceremony. But the loyal
subjects of King Hussein, most of whom have known no other ruler,
were focused only on their mourning. World leaders prepared to
descend upon Jordan for Monday's funeral. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox
News Service)
</P>
<P>
   w/HUSSEIN-WORLDREAX _ MOSCOW _ The death of King Hussein
dominated Russian news broadcasts, displacing the usual fare of
stories on the country's ongoing economic crisis and political
infighting. Also to include reactions from other countries.
Developing. (Holmes, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   w/CLINTON-HUSSEIN _ WASHINGTON _ Mourning the loss of a close
partner in his quest to broker a Mideast peace, President Clinton
and other political heavyweights flew Sunday to Amman to attend
funeral services for Jordan's late monarch, King Hussein. (Deans,
Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   HUSSEIN-NOOR _ AMMAN, Jordan _ She stood up for her adopted
country when the United States accused it of being too soft on
Iraq. Yet still, in this tiny desert nation, the American-born
Queen Noor is seen as being just, well, too American. And now, as
she sits diligently and loyally by the sick bed of her husband,
Jordan's King Hussein, the woman who has worked hard to straddle
two cultures faces an uncertain future. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox
News Service)
</P>
<P>
   w/HUSSEIN-OBIT _ AMMAN, Jordan _ King Hussein of Jordan, who
grew from an underestimated boy-monarch into a tireless
international peacemaker and keystone of Middle Eastern stability,
died of cancer Sunday. He was 63 years old and, after nearly 47
years in power, the longest-ruling hands-on leader in the world.
Only England's Queen Elizabeth among current leaders, in her
symbolic post, has served longer as a head of state. Developing.
(Kaplow, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   KING-PALMBEACH _ PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Palm Beach was King
Hussein's ``home away from home,'' a place where he could unwind
after state visits to Washington, away from politics and threats of
assassinations and coups, while still enjoying the trappings of
royalty. He loved to dine out, mostly Italian food, and liked to
experiment with different dishes. With Jan Kimberly, the ``Kleenex
heir'' and sportsman, Hussein shared a love of hunting, fishing and
boating. Hussein and his family loved to shop. In May 1975, he
spent $261 at a record store in Royal Poinciana Plaza _ music by
Elton John, Olivia Newton-John, Roberta Flack, Johnny Mathis and
Frank Sinatra. Two years before, he bought four motor homes at a
West Palm Beach dealership, including a 31-footer for his personal
use. He always paid cash. Once he came unprepared, and a bank vice
president opened the bank on a weekend to get him $50,000. He also
didn't have bathing suit, so he had Saks opened. (Smith, Palm Beach

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ She stood up for her adopted country when the
United States accused it of being too soft on Iraq. She sat
diligently by her husband's bedside until her beloved king died.
But still, in Jordan, the American-born Queen Noor is seen as being
just too American.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Noor, 47, is a grieving widow. Her husband, King
Hussein, died Sunday after a seven-month bout with cancer. He
leaves the future filled with uncertainty for the woman who has
worked hard to straddle two cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, the ailing Hussein, 63, shocked his country and
the restless Middle East region by removing his brother Crown
Prince Hassan from the role of heir, which he held for 34 years,
and replacing him with Hussein's first son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The change was notable for its transparent intrigue. Hussein
wrote, in a letter to Hassan, that ``parasites'' and ``climbers''
were poisoning the palace atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor was most certainly in the mix. Friends and observers,
though most speaking anonymously, said she had long hoped that her
first-born son Hamzah, could be the next King. Hamzah is Noor's
first son, but not the king's.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Ambassador to the United States, Marwan Muasher,
``categorically'' denies that Noor ever got involved.
</P>
<P>
   It is common knowledge among palace watchers that Hamzah is
Hussein's favorite son, but the prince is only 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Before the King's death, some said Noor would be, in any case, a
respected queen mother maintaining her charitable works. Her place
was enhanced Sunday, when the new King Abdullah chose Hamzah as his
crown prince, meaning Noor is now the mother of the heir to the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   But, finding a popular role has always been a challenge for Noor
among Jordanians, many of whom still look upon her suspiciously as
a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Hassan, Hussein seemed intent on securing a
place in Jordan for his wife, apparently answering the criticisms,
however muted, he had heard of the conspicuous blonde with the
heavy American accent in her Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brought happiness and cared for me during my illness with
the utmost affection,'' he wrote in January. ``She, the Jordanian,
who belongs to this country with every fiber of her being, holds
her head high in the defense and service of this country's
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   His subjects, however, have their own opinions -- even if they
are not expressed openly. For example, Noor has been accused of
spending too freely and being too much in the jet-set. It may be
that Jordanians criticize her for things they don't want to express
about the rest of the royal family, according to palace observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not the only one (in the royal family) who's corrupt,
but, certainly, her tastes are very apparent in this poor
kingdom,'' Laith Shubailat, a Jordanian dissident, told the Cox
News Service before Hussein's death.
</P>
<P>
   Shubailat's niece is Noor's press secretary. But when he
ridiculed Noor for crying at the funeral of slain Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin -- Hussein's treaty with Israel is highly
unpopular among Jordanians -- it was one of the statements the
police cited in jailing him for 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   Noor's background makes her both an easy target, and unlikely
Arab figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in the United States as Lisa Halaby, to a mother of
Swedish background and father Najeeb Halaby, of Syrian-Lebanese
descent. Her father was also born in the United States and once
headed Pan American World Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Halaby was a cheerleader and protested against the Vietnam
War. She graduated from Princeton University-- class of 1974 --
with a degree in architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Working on an aviation college in Jordan, she met Hussein, the
avid pilot. Their courtship included palace dinners, introductions
to the children from his three previous marriages and rides on the
back of the macho King's motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   They were married in 1978, the tall blonde with the beauty-queen
looks and the short-but-regal descendent of the Islamic prophet
Mohammed. Lisa Halaby converted to Islam, and became Noor
Al-Hussein, meaning ``Light of Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   Noor has said she found adjusting to Jordan easy, relying on a
coterie of strong women friends that defied Arab stereotypes. But,
there was clearly a cultural gap to bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came here under very difficult circumstances,'' said
former chief of Noor's office, Mohammad Al-Adwan, addressing the
tough time that outsiders face in the cliquish world of Amman.
</P>
<P>
   She founded Jordan's gifted school and a music conservatory. Her
Noor Al-Hussein Foundation helps Jordan's poor, rural women find
economic independence through crafts, poultry raising and
beekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   And, since the death of Britain's Princess Diana, she has headed
the international push to ban land mines. Risking controversy in a
society steeped in tradition, she has spoken out against ``honor
killings,'' in which brothers or fathers in Jordan sometimes kill
female family members who have sex outside of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after U.S. officials vilified Hussein for staying
neutral in the Persian Gulf War, Noor traveled to Washington, D.C.,
to help explain her country's position.
</P>
<P>
   But her first duty is to stay in her husband's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not supposed to be the star. You cannot have a Princess
Diana in Jordan. No way,'' says Salameh Nematt, a Jordanian
journalist. ``It's a male-dominated society.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians appreciate that Noor raised four children to speak
excellent Arabic -- although she is not fluent in the language
herself. She often wears embroidered Jordanian Bedouin dresses and,
according to a friend, will serve tea and sweets herself at
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   She moved Jordanians with her attentiveness to Hussein during a
bout with cancer in 1992. It quieted rumors that the marriage was
in trouble due to infidelities by Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, people say they like her because she is Hussein's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is nice. She is popular because she is the Queen,'' said
grocer Nwayer Naber, 37.
</P>
<P>
   In a barber shop, haircutters echoed that mild endorsement. But,
one leaned forward on his chair to add carefully: ``She is
originally American. Her name is not Noor. It is something else.''

</P>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ In the end, King Hussein of Jordan died with his
royal family around him, in a hospital that bears his name, in the
country he protected and in the war-torn region where he dared to
work for peace.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to understand why many Jordanians wept, fainted and
seemed in shock of a death that had come from a long, sadly
predictable bout with cancer. He was in their eyes, the man that
sheltered them from the turbulent Middle East, gave them cars and
scholarships, and advised them like a father.
</P>
<P>
   The world, meanwhile, had watched Hussein grow from an
underestimated boy-monarch into a tireless international peacemaker
and keystone of regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the lymph glands finally did what wars, invasions and
assassins could not do, felling Hussein after nearly a half-century
in power.
</P>
<P>
   He was 63 years old and the longest ruling, hands-on leader in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein bin(CQ) Talal was adventurous and charismatic. He rode
motorcycles and piloted airplanes -- including the one that brought
him, ill and gaunt, back to Jordan in January after prolonged
cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed the throne at the age of 17, a year after his
grandfather, King Abdullah, was gunned down by his side, but
several years before he effectively held power.
</P>
<P>
   With a mix of ego and craft, the diminutive king overcame a
playboy reputation to survive coup and assassination attempts, and
foreign invasions. At times, he brutally quelled street
demonstrations and jailed critics. But he solidified a weak,
fragmented nation in the center of a constantly shifting region.
</P>
<P>
   By holding the tiny country together, allying it with the west
and leading it to a peace treaty with Israel, Hussein made Jordan a
calming influence and mediator for the oft-restless region. Short
on natural resources, he made his country into a valuable buffer
state: Israel supports Jordan because it distances them from less
friendly Arab states and the Arab states support Jordan because it
separates them from the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein met with nine American presidents -- from Dwight
Eisenhower to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, his subjects called him ``father.'' They hung his
picture in their homes and stores and listened to songs extolling
his virtues. He helped enhance his natural charisma with
unconfirmed stories of narrow escapes and daring. His grace and
ability to reach down and touch the lives of his subjects,
individually, were undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   In his final days, his subjects reminisced about the old-school
way he answered requests for money for specialized hospital
treatment or gave cars to the disabled. They even told stories,
like the time Hussein stopped to help change a man's tire or helped
motorists in a freak 1992 snow storm.
</P>
<P>
   His public humility extended to his most celebrated achievement,
the peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After a Jordanian soldier shot dead seven Israeli girls in 1997,
the King went to Israel to kneel with their parents, in their
homes, in mourning -- over the objections of many Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   He made the visit to shore up the 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
The treaty came after 47 years of periodic warfare and was
Hussein's greatest international achievement. But it remains
unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is highly unpopular with Jordanians, who think
Hussein should have driven a harder bargain -- and who have become
embittered as the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has foundered.
</P>
<P>
   He left his sickbed at Clinton's urging in October to coax along
the deadlocked Wye River Plantation peace talks. Frail and hairless
from his radiation therapy, he offered hope by lending the weight
of his authority to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Striding into a large dining room late one evening, his striking
American-raised Queen Noor at his side, Hussein implored the
parties to imagine peace for the sake of their children and,
Clinton said, proffered ''stern instructions at the appropriate
times,'' to help push negotiators the last few inches toward the
diplomatic goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been enough destruction. Enough death. Enough
waste,'' Hussein said at the agreement's signing ceremony. ``It's
time that, together, we occupy a place beyond ourselves, our
people, that is worthy of them under the sun, the descendants of
the children of Abraham.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace process has stalled again since that speech. But,
after holding office for nearly half a century, Hussein's other
achievements are clear.
</P>
<P>
   Always his top priority, Hussein held Jordan together and
preserved his Hashemite dynasty -- the last ruling family among the
direct descendants of the Moslem prophet Mohammed 42 generations
before Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemite family traces back to Saudi Arabia. Hussein was
born in Amman, Nov. 14, 1935, but his family's outsider status
helped him be a calculating and successful broker in a country that
was cobbled together among Palestinians, Beduins and native tribes
that vied for power.
</P>
<P>
   In the region, the country separates the Arabs and the Israelis,
literally located between the defensive Jewish state on the west
and restless Iraq on the east.
</P>
<P>
   But, regional leaders previously held other designs on Jordan.
Through the 1960s, Egyptian president Gamel Abdel Nasser tried to
rally Jordanians against Hussein. Syrian troops and Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization moved in and tried to occupy
parts of Jordan until Hussein's army expelled them in a bloody 1970
campaign. Israelis shored up his effort by threatening to push the
Syrians out themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, Hussein ushered Jordan into modernity. The
country scarcely had paved roads in its capital when he was a
child. Friends recall him sneaking away from his security guards to
go hunting in what is now an posh hotel district.
</P>
<P>
   The country is still poor and its economy a near shambles --
something Jordanians say Hussein gave too little attention. But,
per capita income, according to a Jordanian economist, has risen
from about $150 in 1952 to about $1,650 today. Life expectancy rose
from 46 years to 69 years in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's population is nine times what it was when Hussein took
over, now about 4.4 million. More than half of the population are
Palestinians, who have been folded into Jordanian society after
their displacement from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legacy he will leave is that he built Jordan out of almost
nothing,'' said childhood friend and former Jordanian Foreign
Minister Marwan Qassam(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Hussein has had famous failures, as well, and there is no
question about the biggest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Egypt's Nasser convinced him to side with the Arabs in
a war against Israel. The Arab armies were routed in six days and
Jordan lost the holy sites of east Jerusalem, as well as the
economically fertile region on the West bank of the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw in 1967 that war is not a solution. Opting for peace
was the only course to pursue,'' Qassam said.
</P>
<P>
   Journalist Sultan Al-Hattab said that once on an airplane trip
in 1990, Hussein gazed out the window and told him, ``Jerusalem was
lost while I was king. I would like to see it, if only for one day
before I die, not under (Israeli) occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, with close ties to the CIA and western leaders, steered
Jordan firmly into the anti-Communist camp of the Cold War. But,
when the Cold War ended, his choices were less clear and he
faltered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Hussein angered his American allies and lost the
support of crucial Arab aid donors by refusing to condemn Iraq's
Saddam Hussein for his invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The rift illustrated the fine line along which Hussein lead his
country. Iraq was Jordan's biggest trade partner, supplier of oil
and viewed as a necessary ally.
</P>
<P>
   But, years after the Gulf War and with Saddam weakened, King
Hussein's army would take to the streets and attack protesters that
denounced the follow-up U.S. military strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   While far less repressive than many other Arab states, Jordan is
still far from being a democratic state. Moreover, Hussein had
advocated laws restricting the media.
</P>
<P>
   Dependent on foreign aid -- including $225 million a year from
the United States -- the country has few resources and is deep in
debt. But Jordan survives, and the candle of regional peace still
flickers, because Hussein convinced its neighbors, from Israel to
Syria, that they benefit from the calming buffer.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Carving that role was what drove Hussein from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of this survival story was the monarchy, the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which has survived assassinations,
displacement and mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's grandfather Abdullah allied his tribes with the
British in fighting the Ottoman empire out of the Middle East in
1918. Largely as a reward, Winston Churchill agreed in 1922 to let
him rule the area then known as Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah went to Jerusalem in 1951, for what may have been
secret negotiations with Israel. He took his grandson Hussein and,
as they entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third most holy site, a
Palestinian shot the King dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's father Talal became king. But, he showed signs of
schizophrenia and was removed from office. After intrigue and
attempts by foreign countries to place their surrogates on the
throne, it went to the 17-year-old Hussein, then studying in
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``His grandfather saw in him much more than he saw in his own
sons,'' said friend Qassam. ``(Hussein) was on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Already with a flare for self-aggrandizement, Hussein took a
tour of the country before attending the Royal Military Academy in
England.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first strokes of power, at the age of 21, Hussein
replaced with Jordanians the British post-colonial leadership of
Jordan's ``Arab Legion.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal life was as turbulent as his political life.
</P>
<P>
   He married his first wife, Hashemite Dina Hamed, in 1953. She
was seven years older than the 18-year-old King. They had a
daughter, but he divorced Hamed after 18 months and kept custody of
their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein would marry three more times and have a total of 11
children. He divorced two wives and another, Queen Alia, died in a
helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein left behind his wife of 20 years, Queen Noor, the
daughter of a leading U.S. aviation official. She is an American
architect of Arab descent. She was named Lisa Halaby until she
married the king and, converted to Islam and became Noor
Al-Hussein, or ``Light of Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   The king met her while she was helping design an aviation
college in Jordan. He courted her with palace dinners and rides on
his motorcycle. The tall blonde and the short, macho monarch,
received a modicum of notoriety in the jet-set, vacationing in
palaces in London and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of Hussein's infidelities swirled around his marriages.
Many said the union with Noor was in trouble until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Hussein, founder of hospitals and an avid reader of
medical journals, began having serious medical problems. His left
kidney and part of his intestine were removed after he was found to
have cancer. His return to health brought dancing and weeping
Jordanians into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   He would risk that popularity, however, to make the most
controversial move of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein had long held secret meetings with Israeli officials.
After the 1993 Oslo Accords appeared to put Israel and the
Palestinians on the path to peace, Hussein took Jordan into a
treaty with Israel. Again, the issue for him was survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought the survival of Jordan is best served by the peace
with Israel,'' said Fahed Fanek, a Jordanian political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The peace with Israel brought the tiny desert kingdom
international aid and recognition, but the gap between Jordan's
rich and poor have grown and most Jordanians feel they have not
seen the fruits of Hussein's peace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Hussein made his first visit to Jerusalem since the
1967 war to speak in eulogy of assassinated Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not keep silent,'' he said. ``Let our voices rise high
to speak of our commitment to peace for all times to come, and let
us tell those who live in darkness, who are the enemies of light .
. . this is where we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, fevers and fatigue were the symptoms of cancer
again, this time lymphoma. He spent six months in radiation
treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota -- the longest time he
had ever spent away from his kingdom as king.
</P>
<P>
   Her returned home in January. Despite rains and a windy January
chill, hundreds of thousands of Jordanians came to meet him. Buoyed
by their affection and again with a flare for drama, Hussein soaked
himself by riding the streets with his head poking up from the
sun-roof of his cream-colored Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   While in Amman, the man known for closely holding his
deliberations, made his last surprising move. He removed his
brother, Prince Hassan, from the post of crown prince, which he had
held for 34 years. Hussein substituted his first son, 37-year-old
army general Abdullah, as heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Hassan, he spoke of ``parasites'' and
``climbers'' spoiling the atmosphere in the palace and slandering
his family. Some observers thought the sick king, traumatized by
his own mortality, had misinterpreted logical moves by Hassan as
challenges to his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein may have wanted to place his favorite son, Hamzah, in
line for the throne, but the prince was only 18 years old and the
king was more ill than his country knew. Hours before being rushed
back to Minnesota, he appointed Abdullah to be heir. Hours after
being sworn in as king Sunday, Abdullah, in turn, appointed Hamzah
as his crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hussein's death still shocked his little nation, for
months he and the country had been pondering his mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein addressed it in an interview in July, when his latest
sickness began.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is life and there is an end to life,'' he said. ``That
is the way with everyone who has preceded us in this world, great
people, normal people, every human being.''

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ She stood up for her adopted country when the
United States accused it of being too soft on Iraq. She sat
diligently by her husband's bedside until her beloved king died.
But still, in Jordan, the American-born Queen Noor is seen as being
just too American.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Noor, 47, is a grieving widow. Her husband, King
Hussein, died Sunday after a seven-month bout with cancer. He
leaves the future filled with uncertainty for the woman who has
worked hard to straddle two cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, the ailing Hussein, 63, shocked his country and
the restless Middle East region by removing his brother Crown
Prince Hassan from the role of heir, which he held for 34 years,
and replacing him with Hussein's first son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The change was notable for its transparent intrigue. Hussein
wrote, in a letter to Hassan, that ``parasites'' and ``climbers''
were poisoning the palace atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor was most certainly in the mix. Friends and observers,
though most speaking anonymously, said she had long hoped that her
first-born son Hamzah, could be the next King. Hamzah is Noor's
first son, but not the king's.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Ambassador to the United States, Marwan Muasher,
``categorically'' denies that Noor ever got involved.
</P>
<P>
   It is common knowledge among palace watchers that Hamzah is
Hussein's favorite son, but the prince is only 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Before the King's death, some said Noor would be, in any case, a
respected queen mother maintaining her charitable works. Her place
was enhanced Sunday, when the new King Abdullah chose Hamzah as his
crown prince, meaning Noor is now the mother of the heir to the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   But, finding a popular role has always been a challenge for Noor
among Jordanians, many of whom still look upon her suspiciously as
a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Hassan, Hussein seemed intent on securing a
place in Jordan for his wife, apparently answering the criticisms,
however muted, he had heard of the conspicuous blonde with the
heavy American accent in her Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brought happiness and cared for me during my illness with
the utmost affection,'' he wrote in January. ``She, the Jordanian,
who belongs to this country with every fiber of her being, holds
her head high in the defense and service of this country's
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   His subjects, however, have their own opinions -- even if they
are not expressed openly. For example, Noor has been accused of
spending too freely and being too much in the jet-set. It may be
that Jordanians criticize her for things they don't want to express
about the rest of the royal family, according to palace observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not the only one (in the royal family) who's corrupt,
but, certainly, her tastes are very apparent in this poor
kingdom,'' Laith Shubailat, a Jordanian dissident, told the Cox
News Service before Hussein's death.
</P>
<P>
   Shubailat's niece is Noor's press secretary. But when he
ridiculed Noor for crying at the funeral of slain Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin -- Hussein's treaty with Israel is highly
unpopular among Jordanians -- it was one of the statements the
police cited in jailing him for 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   Noor's background makes her both an easy target, and unlikely
Arab figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in the United States as Lisa Halaby, to a mother of
Swedish background and father Najeeb Halaby, of Syrian-Lebanese
descent. Her father was also born in the United States and once
headed Pan American World Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Halaby was a cheerleader and protested against the Vietnam
War. She graduated from Princeton University-- class of 1974 --
with a degree in architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Working on an aviation college in Jordan, she met Hussein, the
avid pilot. Their courtship included palace dinners, introductions
to the children from his three previous marriages and rides on the
back of the macho King's motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   They were married in 1978, the tall blonde with the beauty-queen
looks and the short-but-regal descendent of the Islamic prophet
Mohammed. Lisa Halaby converted to Islam, and became Noor
Al-Hussein, meaning ``Light of Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   Noor has said she found adjusting to Jordan easy, relying on a
coterie of strong women friends that defied Arab stereotypes. But,
there was clearly a cultural gap to bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came here under very difficult circumstances,'' said
former chief of Noor's office, Mohammad Al-Adwan, addressing the
tough time that outsiders face in the cliquish world of Amman.
</P>
<P>
   She founded Jordan's gifted school and a music conservatory. Her
Noor Al-Hussein Foundation helps Jordan's poor, rural women find
economic independence through crafts, poultry raising and
beekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   And, since the death of Britain's Princess Diana, she has headed
the international push to ban land mines. Risking controversy in a
society steeped in tradition, she has spoken out against ``honor
killings,'' in which brothers or fathers in Jordan sometimes kill
female family members who have sex outside of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after U.S. officials vilified Hussein for staying
neutral in the Persian Gulf War, Noor traveled to Washington, D.C.,
to help explain her country's position.
</P>
<P>
   But her first duty is to stay in her husband's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not supposed to be the star. You cannot have a Princess
Diana in Jordan. No way,'' says Salameh Nematt, a Jordanian
journalist. ``It's a male-dominated society.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians appreciate that Noor raised four children to speak
excellent Arabic -- although she is not fluent in the language
herself. She often wears embroidered Jordanian Bedouin dresses and,
according to a friend, will serve tea and sweets herself at
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   She moved Jordanians with her attentiveness to Hussein during a
bout with cancer in 1992. It quieted rumors that the marriage was
in trouble due to infidelities by Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, people say they like her because she is Hussein's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is nice. She is popular because she is the Queen,'' said
grocer Nwayer Naber, 37.
</P>
<P>
   In a barber shop, haircutters echoed that mild endorsement. But,
one leaned forward on his chair to add carefully: ``She is
originally American. Her name is not Noor. It is something else.''

</P>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ In the end, King Hussein of Jordan died with his
royal family around him, in a hospital that bears his name, in the
country he protected and in the war-torn region where he dared to
work for peace.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to understand why many Jordanians wept, fainted and
seemed in shock of a death that had come from a long, sadly
predictable bout with cancer. He was in their eyes, the man that
sheltered them from the turbulent Middle East, gave them cars and
scholarships, and advised them like a father.
</P>
<P>
   The world, meanwhile, had watched Hussein grow from an
underestimated boy-monarch into a tireless international peacemaker
and keystone of regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the lymph glands finally did what wars, invasions and
assassins could not do, felling Hussein after nearly a half-century
in power.
</P>
<P>
   He was 63 years old and the longest ruling, hands-on leader in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein bin(CQ) Talal was adventurous and charismatic. He rode
motorcycles and piloted airplanes -- including the one that brought
him, ill and gaunt, back to Jordan in January after prolonged
cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed the throne at the age of 17, a year after his
grandfather, King Abdullah, was gunned down by his side, but
several years before he effectively held power.
</P>
<P>
   With a mix of ego and craft, the diminutive king overcame a
playboy reputation to survive coup and assassination attempts, and
foreign invasions. At times, he brutally quelled street
demonstrations and jailed critics. But he solidified a weak,
fragmented nation in the center of a constantly shifting region.
</P>
<P>
   By holding the tiny country together, allying it with the west
and leading it to a peace treaty with Israel, Hussein made Jordan a
calming influence and mediator for the oft-restless region. Short
on natural resources, he made his country into a valuable buffer
state: Israel supports Jordan because it distances them from less
friendly Arab states and the Arab states support Jordan because it
separates them from the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein met with nine American presidents -- from Dwight
Eisenhower to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, his subjects called him ``father.'' They hung his
picture in their homes and stores and listened to songs extolling
his virtues. He helped enhance his natural charisma with
unconfirmed stories of narrow escapes and daring. His grace and
ability to reach down and touch the lives of his subjects,
individually, were undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   In his final days, his subjects reminisced about the old-school
way he answered requests for money for specialized hospital
treatment or gave cars to the disabled. They even told stories,
like the time Hussein stopped to help change a man's tire or helped
motorists in a freak 1992 snow storm.
</P>
<P>
   His public humility extended to his most celebrated achievement,
the peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After a Jordanian soldier shot dead seven Israeli girls in 1997,
the King went to Israel to kneel with their parents, in their
homes, in mourning -- over the objections of many Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   He made the visit to shore up the 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
The treaty came after 47 years of periodic warfare and was
Hussein's greatest international achievement. But it remains
unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is highly unpopular with Jordanians, who think
Hussein should have driven a harder bargain -- and who have become
embittered as the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has foundered.
</P>
<P>
   He left his sickbed at Clinton's urging in October to coax along
the deadlocked Wye River Plantation peace talks. Frail and hairless
from his radiation therapy, he offered hope by lending the weight
of his authority to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Striding into a large dining room late one evening, his striking
American-raised Queen Noor at his side, Hussein implored the
parties to imagine peace for the sake of their children and,
Clinton said, proffered ''stern instructions at the appropriate
times,'' to help push negotiators the last few inches toward the
diplomatic goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been enough destruction. Enough death. Enough
waste,'' Hussein said at the agreement's signing ceremony. ``It's
time that, together, we occupy a place beyond ourselves, our
people, that is worthy of them under the sun, the descendants of
the children of Abraham.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace process has stalled again since that speech. But,
after holding office for nearly half a century, Hussein's other
achievements are clear.
</P>
<P>
   Always his top priority, Hussein held Jordan together and
preserved his Hashemite dynasty -- the last ruling family among the
direct descendants of the Moslem prophet Mohammed 42 generations
before Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemite family traces back to Saudi Arabia. Hussein was
born in Amman, Nov. 14, 1935, but his family's outsider status
helped him be a calculating and successful broker in a country that
was cobbled together among Palestinians, Beduins and native tribes
that vied for power.
</P>
<P>
   In the region, the country separates the Arabs and the Israelis,
literally located between the defensive Jewish state on the west
and restless Iraq on the east.
</P>
<P>
   But, regional leaders previously held other designs on Jordan.
Through the 1960s, Egyptian president Gamel Abdel Nasser tried to
rally Jordanians against Hussein. Syrian troops and Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization moved in and tried to occupy
parts of Jordan until Hussein's army expelled them in a bloody 1970
campaign. Israelis shored up his effort by threatening to push the
Syrians out themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, Hussein ushered Jordan into modernity. The
country scarcely had paved roads in its capital when he was a
child. Friends recall him sneaking away from his security guards to
go hunting in what is now an posh hotel district.
</P>
<P>
   The country is still poor and its economy a near shambles --
something Jordanians say Hussein gave too little attention. But,
per capita income, according to a Jordanian economist, has risen
from about $150 in 1952 to about $1,650 today. Life expectancy rose
from 46 years to 69 years in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's population is nine times what it was when Hussein took
over, now about 4.4 million. More than half of the population are
Palestinians, who have been folded into Jordanian society after
their displacement from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legacy he will leave is that he built Jordan out of almost
nothing,'' said childhood friend and former Jordanian Foreign
Minister Marwan Qassam(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Hussein has had famous failures, as well, and there is no
question about the biggest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Egypt's Nasser convinced him to side with the Arabs in
a war against Israel. The Arab armies were routed in six days and
Jordan lost the holy sites of east Jerusalem, as well as the
economically fertile region on the West bank of the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw in 1967 that war is not a solution. Opting for peace
was the only course to pursue,'' Qassam said.
</P>
<P>
   Journalist Sultan Al-Hattab said that once on an airplane trip
in 1990, Hussein gazed out the window and told him, ``Jerusalem was
lost while I was king. I would like to see it, if only for one day
before I die, not under (Israeli) occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, with close ties to the CIA and western leaders, steered
Jordan firmly into the anti-Communist camp of the Cold War. But,
when the Cold War ended, his choices were less clear and he
faltered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Hussein angered his American allies and lost the
support of crucial Arab aid donors by refusing to condemn Iraq's
Saddam Hussein for his invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The rift illustrated the fine line along which Hussein lead his
country. Iraq was Jordan's biggest trade partner, supplier of oil
and viewed as a necessary ally.
</P>
<P>
   But, years after the Gulf War and with Saddam weakened, King
Hussein's army would take to the streets and attack protesters that
denounced the follow-up U.S. military strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   While far less repressive than many other Arab states, Jordan is
still far from being a democratic state. Moreover, Hussein had
advocated laws restricting the media.
</P>
<P>
   Dependent on foreign aid -- including $225 million a year from
the United States -- the country has few resources and is deep in
debt. But Jordan survives, and the candle of regional peace still
flickers, because Hussein convinced its neighbors, from Israel to
Syria, that they benefit from the calming buffer.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Carving that role was what drove Hussein from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of this survival story was the monarchy, the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which has survived assassinations,
displacement and mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's grandfather Abdullah allied his tribes with the
British in fighting the Ottoman empire out of the Middle East in
1918. Largely as a reward, Winston Churchill agreed in 1922 to let
him rule the area then known as Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah went to Jerusalem in 1951, for what may have been
secret negotiations with Israel. He took his grandson Hussein and,
as they entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third most holy site, a
Palestinian shot the King dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's father Talal became king. But, he showed signs of
schizophrenia and was removed from office. After intrigue and
attempts by foreign countries to place their surrogates on the
throne, it went to the 17-year-old Hussein, then studying in
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``His grandfather saw in him much more than he saw in his own
sons,'' said friend Qassam. ``(Hussein) was on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Already with a flare for self-aggrandizement, Hussein took a
tour of the country before attending the Royal Military Academy in
England.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first strokes of power, at the age of 21, Hussein
replaced with Jordanians the British post-colonial leadership of
Jordan's ``Arab Legion.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal life was as turbulent as his political life.
</P>
<P>
   He married his first wife, Hashemite Dina Hamed, in 1953. She
was seven years older than the 18-year-old King. They had a
daughter, but he divorced Hamed after 18 months and kept custody of
their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein would marry three more times and have a total of 11
children. He divorced two wives and another, Queen Alia, died in a
helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein left behind his wife of 20 years, Queen Noor, the
daughter of a leading U.S. aviation official. She is an American
architect of Arab descent. She was named Lisa Halaby until she
married the king and, converted to Islam and became Noor
Al-Hussein, or ``Light of Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   The king met her while she was helping design an aviation
college in Jordan. He courted her with palace dinners and rides on
his motorcycle. The tall blonde and the short, macho monarch,
received a modicum of notoriety in the jet-set, vacationing in
palaces in London and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of Hussein's infidelities swirled around his marriages.
Many said the union with Noor was in trouble until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Hussein, founder of hospitals and an avid reader of
medical journals, began having serious medical problems. His left
kidney and part of his intestine were removed after he was found to
have cancer. His return to health brought dancing and weeping
Jordanians into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   He would risk that popularity, however, to make the most
controversial move of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein had long held secret meetings with Israeli officials.
After the 1993 Oslo Accords appeared to put Israel and the
Palestinians on the path to peace, Hussein took Jordan into a
treaty with Israel. Again, the issue for him was survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought the survival of Jordan is best served by the peace
with Israel,'' said Fahed Fanek, a Jordanian political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The peace with Israel brought the tiny desert kingdom
international aid and recognition, but the gap between Jordan's
rich and poor have grown and most Jordanians feel they have not
seen the fruits of Hussein's peace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Hussein made his first visit to Jerusalem since the
1967 war to speak in eulogy of assassinated Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not keep silent,'' he said. ``Let our voices rise high
to speak of our commitment to peace for all times to come, and let
us tell those who live in darkness, who are the enemies of light .
. . this is where we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, fevers and fatigue were the symptoms of cancer
again, this time lymphoma. He spent six months in radiation
treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota -- the longest time he
had ever spent away from his kingdom as king.
</P>
<P>
   Her returned home in January. Despite rains and a windy January
chill, hundreds of thousands of Jordanians came to meet him. Buoyed
by their affection and again with a flare for drama, Hussein soaked
himself by riding the streets with his head poking up from the
sun-roof of his cream-colored Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   While in Amman, the man known for closely holding his
deliberations, made his last surprising move. He removed his
brother, Prince Hassan, from the post of crown prince, which he had
held for 34 years. Hussein substituted his first son, 37-year-old
army general Abdullah, as heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Hassan, he spoke of ``parasites'' and
``climbers'' spoiling the atmosphere in the palace and slandering
his family. Some observers thought the sick king, traumatized by
his own mortality, had misinterpreted logical moves by Hassan as
challenges to his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein may have wanted to place his favorite son, Hamzah, in
line for the throne, but the prince was only 18 years old and the
king was more ill than his country knew. Hours before being rushed
back to Minnesota, he appointed Abdullah to be heir. Hours after
being sworn in as king Sunday, Abdullah, in turn, appointed Hamzah
as his crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hussein's death still shocked his little nation, for
months he and the country had been pondering his mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein addressed it in an interview in July, when his latest
sickness began.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is life and there is an end to life,'' he said. ``That
is the way with everyone who has preceded us in this world, great
people, normal people, every human being.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    With the passing of King Hussein, the people of Jordan are
losing a wise and tested leader and a strong and courageous
advocate of the cause of peace in the Middle East.
 &HT;    King Hussein made a great contribution to the history of the
Jordanian nation. His achievements for the benefits of his people
and other Arabs, as well as his global stature, were
internationally recognized during his lifetime. The king truly
deserved that recognition.
 &HT;    I recall my very first meeting with the king in Moscow, in 1987.
What a personality, what a strong and lively mind! Immediately, I
saw in him a wise and experienced statesman and a warm and friendly
man, a great human being. We talked at length about how best to
travel the road to peace in the Middle East. Political,
intellectual and personal courage were needed to reach that goal,
and the king clearly had it. As I worked to re-start the peace
process in that troubled region, King Hussein's advice was always
welcome and very important to me.
 &HT;    In his many years at the helm of Jordan, the king had his share
of frustrations and setbacks. He knew how to take those blows _ he
persevered, he went forward and led others. This ability will be
greatly missed.
 &HT;    As I was traveling in the United States last October, I watched
with admiration as the king left his hospital bed to help resolve
the difficulties in the negotiations between the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders. He looked frail, but I wanted to be hopeful
for his health. So it was a great shock for me to learn that King
Hussein was losing his battle to cancer.
 &HT;    Last April I visited Jordan. The king and Queen Noor invited me
and Raisa to the Royal Palace. It was a most memorable day for us.
It was as though we had seen each other and talked just a few days
before. The king and I discussed the Middle East and the many
political and psychological obstacles still to be overcome to make
peace a durable reality. He was full of ideas and vigor.
 &HT;    We met as old friends. We reminisced about our first talk in
Moscow, in 1987. Back then, I was struck by the king's total
commitment to peaceful methods of solving the Middle East problem.
I saw how concerned he was about the fate of the Middle East peace
process.
 &HT;    The king had done a great deal to preserve stability in
Jordanian society amid the turmoil in the region; yet in Jordanian
society, particularly among intellectuals and young people, there
was a growing disenchantment. Many people were viewing the peace
process as hopelessly deadlocked. Frustration was turning into
despair and a feeling of helplessness, which can be quite
dangerous.
 &HT;    It was clear to both the king and myself that, first of all, the
peace process must be carried forward, despite all setbacks. The
foundations laid down in Madrid and Oslo, we agreed, must be
preserved, for it was the only framework not just for the
resolution of the Palestinian problem but for creating a durable
system of security and cooperation in the region.
 &HT;    King Hussein and I discussed such a system in some detail. It
should encompass, among others, such countries as Iraq, Iran and
Turkey. Without it, the Middle East would not be able to respond to
the challenges of the new century, which include the issues of
security but also the environment, the water crisis and the problem
of terrorism.
 &HT;    In working for a peaceful solution of any issue it is very
important never to despair, always to remain optimistic. The
momentum for peace, set in motion by true leaders such as Yitzhak
Rabin, Shimon Peres, Yassir Arafat, Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein
is still strong. The severe setbacks of recent months have not
destroyed it.
 &HT;    But now my sympathy and condolences must go to the people of
Jordan, who I am sure will rally around their new leader, Crown
Prince Abdullah; to Queen Noor, whom Raisa and I remember fondly;
to the king's children and family. My thoughts today are about
them, and about peace in the Middle East. Its triumph will be the
best tribute to King Hussein of Jordan.

MORNING SHOW RIVALS JOCKEY FOR 2ND PLACE BEHIND `TODAY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC is finding it difficult to startle its early morning
television ratings from their slumber.
</P>
<P>
   When the prime-time journalism star Diane Sawyer made her
surprise move to a morning slot by joining Charles Gibson as
co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning America'' on Jan. 18, the
floundering program's Nielsen ratings leaped.
</P>
<P>
   But in the following two weeks, the ratings gave up most of the
gain. While they are higher than before the change of hosts, the
slightness of the increase has reaffirmed the conventional wisdom
that the Sawyer-Gibson team would not be a quick fix to revive the
show. Indeed, experts say there is no such thing as a quick fix in
morning television because people's viewing habits at that time of
the day are particularly hard to change.
</P>
<P>
   The next move is expected to come from CBS, whose morning show,
``CBS This Morning,'' is in third place behind NBC's hugely
successful ``Today'' and ``Good Morning America.'' Andrew Heyward,
the president of CBS News, sees all the attention on the morning
shows, in the wake of Ms. Sawyer's move, as an opportunity for CBS
to make a bold move to win attention for ``CBS This Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer's agreement to help her network by taking the early
shift may have inadvertently helped Heyward, by giving him more
ammunition to persuade Bryant Gumbel _ once the king of morning
television when he was co-host of ``Today'' _ to make a similar
move, and ride to the rescue of the morning show. That is one of
the scenarios under consideration as CBS tries to raise itself from
the ratings cellar.
</P>
<P>
   David Westin, president of ABC News, said on Friday that Ms.
Sawyer's move was never viewed as a quick fix, and that he was
pleased with results so far. He also said the performance has
continued to be strong in key demographic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd get an initial sampling and it'd fall back
again and then be slow build from there,'' he said. ``So I was
surprised and pleased because we've held onto the 25-to-54 and
18-to-49 audiences we attracted the first week.''
</P>
<P>
   Many millions of dollars are at stake. ``Today,'' seen on
average in more than 5.5 million households each weekday, earned
more than $100 million in profit for NBC, a unit of General
Electric Co., in 1998, according to estimates compiled by Nielsen
from advertisers' reports. The other two shows earned far less, but
final figures were not available Friday. About 3.3 million are
watching ``Good Morning America'' _ an increase of about 130,000
since the Sawyer-Gibson team took over _ and about 2.5 million
homes tune to ``CBS This Morning'' on average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movement of morning audiences is traditionally glacial,''
said Heyward. ``That's why ABC's decline occasioned such alarm,
because it was not glacial. Now they've made a bold move borne of
desperation. Their program is better, and, really, it's too early
to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he sees second place within reach. ``We've come
tantalizingly close,'' he said. In fact, for a few days in the week
after Christmas, the CBS show actually beat ``Good Morning
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences tend to be very, very loyal with respect to morning
shows,'' said Bill Croasdale, executive vice president of Western
Initiative Media, a media buying firm in Los Angeles. ``The first
week you'd expect a ratings bump, with Charlie coming back and
Diane Sawyer joining him. That's two pretty powerful names. But
they're going up against some very entrenched competition, with
`Today,' and even CBS has made great strides as `GMA' started to
slip.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Trying to seize the moment, Heyward at CBS has been meeting
weekly for the last several months with Al Berman, executive
producer of ``CBS This Morning,'' and Steve Friedman, the manager
of WCBS, the network's New York station, who is credited with
having turned ``Today'' around when it was trailing ``Good Morning
America'' in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's involvement, and the fact that he and Gumbel are
close friends, helped prompt the speculation about Gumbel. Since
his own prime-time news magazine, ``Public Eye,'' was canceled last
season due to lukewarm viewer reaction, Gumbel and CBS News have
been casting about for an appropriate new role for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then came the Diane move,'' said a CBS executive who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. ``Gumbel speculation followed like a
wake behind a boat.'' This executive added that Gumbel almost
certainly would consider such a move if Friedman were named
executive producer of ``CBS This Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward refused to comment on speculation about Gumbel or
Friedman, and took pains to say the network was pleased with Jane
Robelot and Mark McEwen, currently co-hosts of the network portion
of the show. CBS divides the program differently than ``Today'' or
``Good Morning America,'' allowing local stations to fill most of
the first hour, from 7 to 8 a.m., with their own locally produced
segments.
</P>
<P>
   He did promise change, saying he hoped CBS could take advantage
of ABC being ``still in some disarray.'' By the end of 1999, ``the
program will not be the same as it is now,'' Heyward said. ``But
the degree of change is still being determined.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Good Morning America,'' Westin said the hosts were not
the only element in need of change. The new executive producer,
Shelley Ross, has introduced a ``time capsule'' segment and more
profiles of people in the news, has pushed for more exclusive
interviews, and has experimented with devoting much of the
half-hour from 8 to 8:30 a.m. to one subject.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, for example, the subject was Alzheimer's disease, and
Ms. Sawyer interviewed Maureen Reagan, the daughter of the former
president, about her efforts to find a cure for the disease. With
Ms. Reagan live on the set, the producers surprised her by showing
a taped interview with Nancy Reagan, who praised her daughter's
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really very touching,'' Westin said. He said new ideas
were beginning to percolate with the staff, adding that Ms. Sawyer
was among the leading generators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to her almost every day,'' he said of Ms. Sawyer, ``and
she's quite excited about it. Diane has a lot of creative ideas and
this show gives her a way to express them and get done that is much
easier than in other formats she works in.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin said no timetable has been set for Gibson or Ms. Sawyer
to leave ``Good Morning America.'' For now, both are doubling up,
continuing to also work as correspondents and anchors for the
prime-time news magazine ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Croasdale, the media buyer, pointed out that viewers know the
two stars are interim hosts. ``The real key,'' he said, ``will be,
who are their replacements, and will they have the same magic or
cachet that Diane Sawyer or Charlie Gibson have? That's acid test
for return of `GMA' and we won't really know its future until
then.''

PRICE WAR BETWEEN ADVANCED MICRO AND INTEL RAVAGES CHIP STOCKS

 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Advanced Micro Devices Inc. announced on Thursday that
pricing pressures on microprocessors might leave it with a loss for
the current quarter, it helped set off a two-day rout of the
technology-laden Nasdaq. That was perhaps an understandable
response for a group of stocks that have been hitting new highs for
weeks; what is less clear is whether it was a correct response.
</P>
<P>
   For many longtime technology analysts, the announcement was deja
vu all over again. Advanced Micro said price cuts by the Intel
Corp. would prevent it from realizing the benefit of increased
production volume of its fastest chips.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Advanced Micro announced fourth-quarter earnings
that fell a few cents short of analysts' estimates because of
manufacturing problems that prevented it from shipping more of
these chips, which command higher prices and thus have higher
profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has covered the semiconductor industry for any length
of time has seen this scenario play out before. Intel introduces a
new generation of microprocessor; Advanced Micro rushes to offer a
compatible product but runs into manufacturing glitches that keep
volume low.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Advanced Micro catches up and is ready to begin
shipping increased quantities, Intel cuts prices and gets ready for
the next generation of products. Advanced Micro should be able to
do something about production, but can do little about pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro's shares fell $2.0625 on Friday, closing at
$16.8125, on the New York Stock Exchange, after losing $2 on
Thursday. Intel dropped $2.5625 Friday, to $127.5625, in Nasdaq
trading; its shares fell $8.5625 on Thursday after Merrill Lynch
cut its estimate for the company's profits in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Peck, an analyst with SG Cowen &AMP; Co., said the normal
sequence of events was exaggerated this time because Intel had
realized the significance of the low-end market and was sharply
cutting prices there to regain market share it had initially lost
to Advanced Micro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel, to my recollection, has never been this aggressive
about the low end of the market,'' he said. ``But now no one,
including Intel, can ignore the low end because that's where all
the growth is.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel would rather take a hit on profit margins than cede sales
to Advanced Micro and watch inventories pile up, Peck said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But to extrapolate a softening of demand for personal computers
and related components from the Intel-Advanced Micro price wars
would be wrong, Peck said. ``On a unit basis, all things being
equal, lower prices should lead to higher sales.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for PC-related chip companies, he said, is that
``sales may go higher, but they won't go high enough fast enough to
offset declining prices.'' Peck is thus neutral on most chip stocks
but recommends such specialized companies as Analog Devices, Texas
Instruments and the Vitesse Semiconductor Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Competing with a market leader like Intel would never be easy,
but Advanced Micro's inconsistent execution has made it even
tougher, said Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with Nationsbanc
Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think AMD's No. 1 problem is AMD, not Intel,'' he said.
``AMD just can't get their yields up.'' Among chip distributors
polled by Montgomery, he continued: ``They think the price cuts
will be 15 percent. Even if it's 30 percent, that's not out of
line. This is not a price war where everybody bleeds to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume that other chip makers will suffer, Joseph said,
even though many were brought down by the market, particularly
Micron Technology, which dropped $5.375 on Friday to close at
$70.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, after losing $3.875 on
Thursday. Micron, he noted, had nearly quadrupled in four months,
``so it's a very volatile stock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not getting any indication demand is softening,'' he
said. ``The fundamental story is still intact for both Micron and
Intel.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, reiterated the
neutral rating he has had on Advanced Micro for a long time, and
cut his 1999 earnings-a-share estimate to 10 cents from 50 cents.
``In comparison, the consensus estimate for AMD was 85 cents,'' he
said, ``and we expect the company to lose money in the first half
of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although unit demand for Advanced Micro's K6 microprocessor
family is meeting expectations, Edelstone said, ``AMD's
fourth-quarter yield problems and Intel's aggressive pricing
strategy on the low end of the market have combined to promote
lower-than-expected average selling prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until AMD is able to produce significantly more high-speed
microprocessors,'' he added, ``the company's product mix will be
vulnerable to Intel's aggressive low-end pricing strategy.''

RANKS OF THOSE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE ARE STILL GROWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tammy Soverns has diabetes and no health insurance. Her
medication costs $100 a month. The strips to test her blood sugar
cost the same. Going to a doctor can cost even more.
</P>
<P>
   So Soverns and her husband, Charles, do what many uninsured
working folks do: They ignore their health problems and use their
money to pay bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your medical condition is important, but the roof over your
head is more so,'' the Odessa, Mo., woman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sovernses are entangled in an American paradox: Our people
enjoy the longest peacetime economic expansion in the country's
history. Unemployment is at a 28-year low. But for the Soverns
family and millions of others in this country, health insurance is
still out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Census Bureau's latest estimate is that 43.4 million
Americans, like the Sovernses, were uninsured in 1997. That's up
1.7 million from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, roughly 200,000 people now lack health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say layoffs and the growth in low-paying jobs are two.
And they say that trend will continue.
</P>
<P>
   The hot economy has made it easy to get a job. Many, however,
are in the service sector, where poor benefits are the standard.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more people are now self-employed or working part
time, either by choice or because they've been laid off. They, too,
find it hard to afford health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Employee Benefit Research Institute found that between 1987
and 1993, these changes in the job market accounted for most of the
increase in the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, experts say, is welfare reform. New guidelines
put mothers to work but stripped some of their coverage under
Medicaid, the government health insurance for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, businesses are staring at substantial increases in
their health- insurance premium rates. Big employers can expect
increases of 7 percent a year. For small employers it's even worse,
sometimes as high as 40 percent. That pressures small employers to
drop coverage or shift costs to their employees. Some employees can
afford it. Some can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The net result is, even in the booming economy, we have more
people uninsured at the end of the decade than the beginning,''
said Catherine Dunham, national program director of the Access
Project, an organization at Brandeis University that monitors the
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment-obsessed Congress will not solve the problem,
health-reform advocates say. It might make minor changes in current
law, but few experts count on a comprehensive plan anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   What that means _ in the short run, at least _ is that caring
for the uninsured is a local problem. Last month area institutions
that care for the uninsured met to prepare for new surge of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether safety-net providers can continue seeing new patients
remains to be seen,'' said meeting organizer Dan Purdom, medical
director of the Kansas City Free Health Clinic in midtown. ``They
may not have the capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdom's clinic saw about 3,500 patients in 1998, a 40 percent
increase from the year before. This month the demand forced it to
start nine new sessions.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be enough, Purdom said. The Free Health Clinic
turns away about seven of 10 persons who call for an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   In Overland Park, Kan., the number of uninsured patients at the
Health Partnership Clinic of Johnson County has increased an
average of 10 percent annually since it opened. Last year its
volunteer doctors served about 3,800 patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clinic was started in 1992 in the hopes we wouldn't need
to be open for more than a few years (until health reforms took
effect), and here we are in 1999,'' said Marnie Robinett, the
clinic's outreach coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't foresee closing our doors at this point. We're
considering expanding.'' Most of the uninsured are working people
and their families. About 57 percent had full-time jobs in 1997,
according to a survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and
the Commonwealth Fund; 16 percent were employed part-time.
</P>
<P>
   They paid their medical bills late and used over-the-counter
remedies rather than doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Soverns, 36, and her husband, who is 42, both have jobs.
After taxes they make about $1,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Soverns' husband works as a janitor in a Buckner factory. The
factory offers insurance, but the premiums are too high for the
family's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Soverns was just hired as a bus driver, but she said she would
not qualify for health coverage for a year.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Sovernses need health care, they and their son,
Jake, 10, trek an hour to Truman Medical Center East's low-cost
family practice clinic in east Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have this hospital to come to, we'd never see a
doctor,'' Soverns said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenton Kaufman, Soverns' doctor at Truman East, tested her blood
sugar level when the Sovernses visited last week. He was dismayed
that she had not kept track of her diabetes, but his patients with
chronic diseases often cannot afford their medications or supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has one of the worst diseases to have if you're uninsured.
It's a very expensive disease,'' Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if they can only afford one thing, the medicine is the
most important. The test strips, unfortunately, turn out to be a
luxury a lot of the time. They're all nice people. You wish you
could get them everything they need.'' Until recently, expanding
Medicaid to cover more mothers and children offset the decline in
job-based insurance. In the mid-1990s, however, the number of
adults covered by Medicaid began to drop.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, for example, Medicaid rolls dropped from 695,000 in
1995 to 615,000 in 1997, according to the Access Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major factor in all of this is welfare reform,'' said Ron
Pollack, executive director of the consumer-health advocacy group
Families USA. ``It appears that over three out of four people who
leave welfare for work wind up in jobs without health-care
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is proposing about $10 billion for a
series of initiatives. One would help community clinics and
hospitals collaborate on caring for uninsured adults. Another would
offer tax breaks for long-term care. Still another would allow the
disabled to buy insurance through Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Congress and the White House agreed on a $24 billion
program to help states provide health coverage to uninsured
children. This year, experts say, it is unlikely they'll agree on
anything that large.
</P>
<P>
   With that federal funding, Kansas has started an insurance
program called HealthWave, for families earning up to twice the
federal poverty level. Missouri's version of the program allows
families with incomes up to three times the federal poverty level
to participate in Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to cover about half the nation's 11 million
uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   But that may only temporarily dent the growth of the uninsured,
said Dunham of the Access Project.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack, of Families USA, agreed. But so many people lack
insurance, he said, he was ``ultimately optimistic'' that public
interest would turn again to comprehensive health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're beginning to reach significantly into the middle class.
People will see this as an issue of self-interest, not just
altruism,'' he said. ``We're not there yet, but we're getting
there.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mourning the loss of a close partner in his quest
to broker peace in the Middle East, President Clinton flew Sunday
to Amman to attend funeral services for Jordan's late monarch, King
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Clinton aboard Air Force One were former U.S.
Presidents George Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, as well as
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who, like Clinton, had
worked closely with Hussein in recent months to try to keep the
fragile Mideast peace process alive.
</P>
<P>
   A small Congressional delegation was also aboard, as well as the
parents of Hussein's American-born widow, Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the White House Rose Garden in a freezing rain on a
Sunday morning that seemed tailored for grief, Clinton said Hussein
``gave life,'' to that process. He called on Palestinians and
Israelis to build on Hussein's legacy and work to end decades of
bloodshed and enmity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the relationship among peoples who share this small sacred
corner of Earth one thing and only one is predestined: all are
bound to be neighbors,'' said Clinton. ``The question is not
whether they will live side by side but how.''
</P>
<P>
   Evoking Hussein's own words, Clinton said, ``God willing, soon
all will see what he saw and preached: There can be no peace, no
dignity, no security of any of Abraham's children,'' referring to
the Biblical forebear of both Jews and Arabs, ``until there is
peace, dignity and security for all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the American flag atop the White House was
lowered to half mast, in honor of the fallen king.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the world mourns the loss of one of its great leaders,
King Hussein of Jordan,'' Clinton said. ``I mourn the loss of a
partner and a friend. He was a magnificent man, and like so many I
loved and admired him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who died Sunday after a long fight against cancer,
turned away from close relations with the United States during the
1991 Gulf War. Jordan sided, officially at least, with its large
and powerful neighbor, Iraq, though in practice the kingdom
remained neutral, offering neither military nor economic support to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The position strained Hussein's relations with Washington, but
the Bush administration never openly criticized Hussein. It was an
apparent acknowledgement that he had little choice but to align
himself with Iraq, given Jordan's close historical and cultural
ties to the oil giant.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jordan suffered serious economic difficulties as a
result of the war, because much of its trade was affected by United
Nations sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, he had become one of Clinton's most
trusted Mideast leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment last October when talks between Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were at
a critical point, Hussein journeyed to the Wye River Plantation in
rural Maryland to try to bring negotiations to a productive close.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein called on Arafat and Netanyahu to think of the future
generations of the sacred yet long pained region, and make the
concessions and take the risks necessary for peace. Arafat and
Netanyahu both said later they were moved by Hussein's late-night
eloquence, and Clinton said Hussein deserved much of the credit for
bringing Arafat and Netanyahu together for the Wye accord, an
accolade he further embellished on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The smallest man in the room that day was the largest, ''
Clinton recalled. ''He gave life to the process.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months since, however, Hussein's own health declined
steadily, even as the agreements reached at Wye unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-December, when Clinton visited Jerusalem and
Palestinian-controlled Gaza, the central elements of the Wye accord
-- Israeli troop withdrawals from occupied West Bank lands in
exchange for increased Palestinian security guarantees for Israelis
-- were essentially stalled, pending the outcome of Israeli
elections for prime minister scheduled for May.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On July 31, 1996, Anita Harkins, a copy editor at The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, was reading a column destined for the
next day's newspaper when a colleague heard her exclaim, ``They
can't do it this way.''
</P>
<P>
   A day before, The Journal-Constitution had reported that Richard
Jewell, a 33-year-old security guard, was ``the focus of'' the
federal investigation into the bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympic
Games. Jewell was not charged with anything, but the piece Ms.
Harkins was reading drew parallels between his situation and that
of Wayne Williams, a convicted murderer of Atlanta children.
</P>
<P>
   The column, by Dave Kindred, said: ``Like this one, he became
famous in the aftermath of murder. His name was Wayne Williams.
This one is Richard Jewell.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harkins went to the editor in charge to raise doubts about
the article. The response, Ms. Harkins said in a sworn statement,
was ``something along the lines of, `Well, it is a Dave Kindred
column' '' _ an apparent reference to the leeway columnists are
often allowed. Besides, she recalled, the editor complained that
``they were having color problems'' with the front page _ the kind
of production headaches that can delay an edition.
</P>
<P>
   Those moments and many others are captured in the sworn
statements of two dozen journalists who were questioned by the
lawyers handling the libel suit that Jewell filed against The
Journal-Constitution after he was cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The case is months away from trial, if it ever gets there. But
the evidence assembled offers a glimpse of the workings of a
newsroom. Most of all, it shows how news coverage, started in a
particular direction, can become a journalistic juggernaut, hard to
turn, harder to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment on Monday, July 29, when the local police
reporter, Kathy Scruggs, told her editors that Jewell had become a
leading suspect, the newspaper's coverage tended to bolster the
theory that the security guard had the motive and the opportunity
to set off the bomb and cast himself as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those involved in the newspaper's coverage declined to
discuss the case. But the newspaper, through the legal pleadings of
its lawyer, Peter Canfield, offers an impassioned defense of the
accuracy of its reporting. Since accurate reports cannot be deemed
libelous, the newspaper, which is owned by Cox Enterprises Inc.,
has asked the presiding judge to dismiss the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, however, contends that the
journalists did not simply report these suspicions but embellished
and enlarged on them _ for example, by juxtaposing Jewell's name
with that of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's task in proving libel is not simple. He must show that
the newspaper negligently or maliciously printed false statements
about Jewell, even though a Justice Department review confirms that
FBI agents once considered Jewell the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the eventual outcome, what emerges from the evidence
gathered so far is that in the first days after Jewell was named,
The Journal-Constitution gave prominence to reporting that
supported the FBI's view. Contradictory material got perfunctory
attention _ with a few exceptions. The newspaper was among the
first to disclose that it would have been nearly impossible for
Jewell to have made the 911 call warning of the blast, information
that undercut the theory of his involvement. But that came a week
after other news organizations reported that investigators'
interest in Jewell was waning.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the evidence makes it clear how tempting it is for
journalists covering a highly visible investigation to adopt the
investigators' theories as their own.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in Centennial Olympic Park, at 1:20 a.m.,
Saturday, July 27, killed one woman and injured 111 people. There
were fears that those responsible could strike again. The coverage
was intense: Reporters from around the world were on The
Journal-Constitution's home turf, looking for facts amid the
speculation. Journal-Constitution reporters followed a dozen
threads in the first 48 hours, checking whether authorities had
fumbled the 911 warning call, covering other bomb threats and
writing about ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
</P>
<P>
   One of these was Jewell, a security guard working for AT&AMP;T, who
discovered the backpack and helped clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   It was the coverage casting Jewell, then 33, as a hero, that
began his troubles. He agreed to an interview with CNN, which had
been arranged by AT&AMP;T. As Jewell recalled in a recent interview, he
arrived late and out of breath. Seated alone in a dark studio, he
didn't know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday evening interview was seen by W. Ray Cleere, the
president of Piedmont College in northern Georgia, where Jewell had
been a campus security officer a few weeks before. He was struck by
Jewell's nervousness. Sunday, Cleere called the FBI and expressed
concern about Jewell.
</P>
<P>
   After FBI agents heard Cleere's suspicions, according to a
Justice Department summary of the events, ``The FBI recalled that a
spate of fires in Southern California had recently been linked to a
volunteer firefighter who apparently had set the fires so he could
extinguish them and become a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Jewell might have set off the bomb to make himself
a hero began to form Sunday, according to the Justice report, as
agents learned in telephone interviews that he had had a
problematic history as a law enforcement officer. They knew he had
been the first to notice the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an agent was told by acquaintances of Jewell's that
the security guard had said he wanted to be ``in the middle'' of
any big event at the Olympics, and that he had access to a ``bomb
making cookbook'' _ assertions that were never substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   As that agent was headed back to Atlanta, Ms. Scruggs, who
covered the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Atlanta Police
Department for The Journal-Constitution, went to meet someone who
told her of the FBI's suspicions. Ms. Scruggs agreed not to
disclose the information unless the newspaper learned it elsewhere,
according to an account she gave to her colleague, Carrie
Teegardin, who was preparing an article on the newspaper's
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Ms. Scruggs called her editors, then filled
in a colleague, Maria Fernandez, who was sent to Piedmont College
to do more reporting. Ms. Fernandez' notes from that conversation,
revealed during her deposition, reflect the raw information on
which the early news judgments were based.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police chief of college, president of college, thought he
looked nervous,'' the notes read. ``Chasing people off campus, bad
reports. He left May 21st. Habersham County Sheriff's Department.
Wrecked four cars. Crazy chases, lots of guns in cars. He hopes he
is in the middle of it. Wants to marry people on a first date.''
</P>
<P>
   These details circulated among reporters and editors involved in
the coverage. Later reporting showed half these statements were
substantially true; half were gossip that was never printed. As an
officer, Jewell had damaged police cruisers and attracted civilian
complaints. There was no evidence that he had ``lots'' of guns in
his cars or was overeager romantically.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Ms. Scruggs got another tip. A source told her
that ``everybody'' in the Atlanta Police Department was discussing
``the security guard.'' Ms. Scruggs told her editors it was time to
publish.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the sources have been protected by the
newspaper, in line with the tradition that news organizations
shield people who take a risk to make important information public.
But Jewell's lawyer, Wood, contends that his inability to find out
who said what about Jewell cripples his case. He has asked the
judge to compel the newspaper to reveal its sources.
</P>
<P>
   After she got to the office Tuesday, Ms. Scruggs wrote a version
of her article with Ron Martz, who covered federal law enforcement
agencies, looking over her shoulder, according to several
depositions. Burt Roughton Jr., who oversaw the nonsports Olympic
coverage, edited the article, inserting a sentence saying Jewell
``also has approached newspapers, including The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, seeking publicity for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   As Roughton explained in his deposition, ``There was a general
impression at the time that he was making the media rounds.''
Jewell had talked to CNN, USA Today, The Journal-Constitution and
the NBC ``Today'' Show, but has said he was doing so at the wish of
his superiors at AT&AMP;T, for whom he worked as a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   The article's second paragraph said, ``Richard Jewell, 33, a
former law enforcement officer, fits the profile of the lone
bomber. This profile generally includes a frustrated white man who
is a former police officer, member of the military or police
`wannabe' who seeks to become a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   No source is cited for the assertion that Jewell fit the profile
of the lone bomber.
</P>
<P>
   After the article was edited, however, Martz called a federal
source, read it over the phone and was told the source had no
problem with it. Soon after, in an updated edition late in the
afternoon, it was in print, under a six-column headline.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for journalists to get reaction from an individual
before unflattering information about that person is printed. But
there is no evidence that anyone ever told Jewell what the
newspaper was about to print so that he could respond. One reporter
said in a deposition that his phone calls to Jewell went
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The editors did have had someone outside Jewell's apartment _ a
young summer intern, Christina Headrick. Rochelle Bozman, the
editor responsible for the Jewell reporting, told her to knock on
Jewell's door shortly before 2 p.m. According to Ms. Headrick's
deposition, when she did so, he refused to open it or to speak to
her, saying he was sleeping. She said she did not tell him he was a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Canfield, the lawyer, argues that Jewell gave Ms. Headrick
little or no chance to tell him of the impending article and that
it is unlikely he would have contradicted his earlier accounts of
his activities.
</P>
<P>
   The presses rolled around 4 p.m. The Journal-Constitution's
editors, proud of the staff's work, alerted The Associated Press
and CNN. These organizations alerted the world.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, television wires sprouted like kudzu outside
Jewell's apartment. His brief denial was the top news in
Wednesday's early editions, under the headline `` `Hero' Denies
Planting Bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's issue also carried five articles related to Jewell.
The headlines read: ``Change of Fortune,'' ``Security Guard Had
Reputation as Zealot,'' ``Motive? Could Be Sociopath, Attention
Seeker,'' ``Security Woes Hit AT&AMP;T Site'' and ``Crimes Committed by
Guards Plague Security Industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution's coverage did include comments of
Jewell's neighbors and friends, who scoffed at the FBI's theory.
</P>
<P>
   One headline a day later did cast doubt on Jewell's viability as
a suspect. Later editions Thursday ran a story entitled ``Reports
Say Agents Backing Off'' that quoted two network news reports that
the investigators' suspicions were cooling after they failed to
find physical evidence linking Jewell to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of seven Jewell-related articles that day. Others
were titled ``Police Work `Was His Life': Some in North Georgia
Town Say Jewell `Was on a Power Kick,' '' and `` `Hero Syndrome' Is
Fueled by Anger, Need for Attention.'' The final editions of
Thursday's front page carried a five-column headline ``No Arrest
Made Yet.'' An earlier edition had a front-page teaser to Dave
Kindred's column about the search.
</P>
<P>
   Kindred was in the crowd outside Jewell's apartment watching the
search on Wednesday. That evening, his column was passed to the
copy desk, a group of editors who backstop other editors on issues
like fairness and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Two copy editors who read the column alerted senior editors,
according to their depositions. Both said they were rebuffed,
although a supervising editor denies this. Kindred said in his
deposition that he was comparing ``the circumstances surrounding
their cases,'' not comparing Jewell to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The column noted the apparent fruitlessness of the search,
stating, ``Maybe the regular fella had nothing to do with the bomb;
the FBI has often sat on a suspect and come up empty.'' Kindred
concluded: ``Richard Jewell sits in the shadows today. Wayne
Williams sits in prison forever.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Ms. Teegardin, the Journal-Constitution
reporter, interviewed Rochelle Bozman for an article about the
coverage _ an article that was never published. Ms. Teegardin asked
Ms. Bozman, who was in charge of the coverage, ``Are you going to
feel bad, like you did some big wrong, if it turns out that Richard
Jewell is innocent?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bozman answered, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we didn't say he was guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve weeks later, on Oct. 24, The Constitution's lead article
carried the headline ``Jewell Out as Suspect in Bombing, Judge
Says.''

ASSESSING MICROSOFT'S SPIN CONTROL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Wash., Calif., N.J., Mass. )  By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a fleeting, unguarded moment that eloquently captured one
of the agendas at the Microsoft antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had finished a
two-week stint as leadoff witness for the Microsoft Corp. Well
after the trial session had ended for the day, Schmalensee walked
out a side door of the courtroom, down an all-but-deserted hallway,
flanked by two colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said to one of them, ``we'll see how it spins.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have been spinning badly for Microsoft in the four weeks
that it has been presenting its defense in the antitrust case. The
nadir came last week when the government repeatedly pointed out
inconsistencies that seemed misleading in a videotape Microsoft had
presented as important evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson called Microsoft's tape ``very
troubling.'' By the end of the week, after a couple of all-night
scrambles, Microsoft finally had produced a videotape that made its
point _ that trying to extract its Internet browsing software from
its Windows 98 operating system is fraught with peril, if not
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the courthouse steps, Microsoft's lead spinmeister, Mark
Murray, and the company's silver-haired general counsel, William H.
Neukom, gamely tried to recover. ``We make very good software. We
didn't make a very good videotape.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft foul-up was certainly lively theater, providing
some of the most prominent news reports since the trial began last
October. But was it just embarrassing or was it truly damaging to
Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   It becomes really damaging, antitrust experts say, if it
undermines the credibility of Microsoft's evidence in general in
the eyes of the judge, who will deliver a verdict in this nonjury
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something like this raises fundamental credibility
problems, it could tip a trial,'' said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor
at the New York University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few antitrust experts believe that the case will
eventually be decided, by a federal appeals court or the Supreme
Court, on the issue addressed by the tape _ the charge that
Microsoft illegally tied one product to another.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that Microsoft's Explorer browser and
Windows are two separate products bolted together to stifle
competition, while the big software maker says they are a single
product whose integration benefits consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruling in a related case last June gave
Microsoft the benefit of the doubt on this issue. It said the
company could design its products any way it saw fit as long as it
could show that there were some ``plausible'' consumer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The government keeps trying to revive its product-tying
allegation, but antitrust experts believe it will find it difficult
to prevail on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the core of the case now focuses on what the Justice
Department and 19 states suing Microsoft say is a ``pattern of
predatory practices'' and especially exclusionary contracts
intended to stymie competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft tape was an effort to counter a government
assertion that the browser and the operating system could be
decoupled, and thus are two products, using a small program devised
by a government witness, Edward W. Felton, a computer scientist at
Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice
Department's antitrust division, thinks Microsoft made a severe
tactical blunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got sucker-punched by the Felton program,'' Litan, now of
the Brookings Institution, said. The company, he said, should have
pointed to the consumer benefits derived from its melding of the
browser with Windows and should have submitted as evidence the many
product reviews in magazines and newspapers that echo that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft,'' Litan said, ``should have just said, `We put out
something that people like, period.' End of discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   As a courtroom interrogator, David Boies, the Justice
Department's lead trial lawyer, has few equals. He cross-examines
like a jazz musician, starting with a few themes but mostly
improvising. He constantly probes for embarrassing weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   He confronted Schmalensee of MIT with his previous writing,
which seemed to contradict his testimony. He forced Paul Maritz, a
group vice president at Microsoft who is a product and marketing
whiz (but not an economist), to defend the company's thinnest
economic argument _ that it is not a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's legal team says the Boies approach is more show than
substance, leaving most of the direct testimony of Microsoft's
witnesses unchallenged and trying instead to make them look bad on
the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but he has succeeded in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a very good job of rattling Microsoft's witnesses
and Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell,'' the company's law firm, said Stephen
Axinn, an antitrust litigator who is a partner in Axinn, Veltrop &AMP;
Harkrider.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in its antitrust battle, Microsoft has three levels of
concern.
</P>
<P>
   The first is public relations _ and its reputation is a bit
mud-spattered as a result of the trial. The second is the trial
verdict _ and the expectation, even on Wall Street, is that the
company will absorb a loss of some kind in Jackson's court, though
the lasting verdict will be rendered by a higher court. .
</P>
<P>
   The third, and overriding, objective for Microsoft is defending
what it regards as its way of life, the way it does business.
Antitrust experts and Wall Street investors doubt that the
government will win the kind of unqualified victory that would
justify sweeping remedies like splitting up Microsoft or forcing
the licensing of its Windows programming code.
</P>
<P>
   That is a key factor behind Microsoft's buoyant stock price,
which has advanced 56 percent since the trial started. Investors
are not ignoring the antitrust case, but it is currently a
``back-burner issue,'' said Richard Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman
Sachs &AMP; Co. As a verdict nears, however, he said the company's
shares could retreat $10 or $15 a share, based on worries about the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The real skittishness most likely will arrive if the government
gets an opportunity to propose remedies. David Readerman, an
analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco, said, ``That's
when investors will really be on the edge of their seats, watching
the news wires minute by minute.''

A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT THINKS LIKE A HUMAN (ALMOST) 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANET STITES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Silicon Alley in New York is known for many things,
but not as a hotbed for advances in computer science.
</P>
<P>
   Mention genetic algorithms or artificial intelligence, common
parlance among computer scientists, and eyes may very likely roll
among even the most respected new-media executives in New York. In
fact, an almost Luddite attitude toward hard technology seems to
prevail in Silicon Alley, where Bikini.com, ``the world's biggest
beach party,'' is an example of the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   On the fringes of Silicon Alley, though, can occasionally be
found a company like Intelligenesis Corp., which was founded in
early 1997 by Ben Goertzel, a mathematician, and Lisa S. Pazer, a
former Wall Street economist and analyst. Intelligenesis is trying
to change the way people measure business risks or make buying
decisions by combining, in a software program called Webmind,
elements of the Internet with artificial intelligence technology or
``machine learning,'' by which the software can, for example,
``remember'' who Alan Greenspan is and why he matters.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is the brainchild of Goertzel, who received his
Ph.D in mathematics at age 22 from Temple University, then did
research at the University of Western Australia and later taught
mathematics, computer science and psychology at City University of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, I had been designing an architecture for
artificial intelligence, but didn't have the machine to do it on,''
said Goertzel, now 32. ``When I started using the World Wide Web, I
realized it was a metaphor for the brain _ that the Web could be a
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Webmind gathers and processes what it perceives as ``human
intelligence'' data from text documents, like news articles _
whether on the Internet or corporate networks _ to help users spot
trends or make predictions. The results, which can be presented as
numbers, a chart or perhaps eventually even a sentence, are meant
to complement rather than replace traditional mathematical modeling
_ to help analysts, in a sense, to read between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pazer herself left off trying to outguess Greenspan and quit
Wall Street in 1993 to write a novel. But after coming across
Goertzel's research on the Web, she put aside her book to start
Intelligenesis, where she now serves as president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how she explains Webmind: ``If you want to try to
determine whether Greenspan is likely to raise interest rates,
Webmind can query news archives for Greenspan's comments over the
last six months. Because it understands aspects of natural
language, it can give a qualitative answer by building a graph
giving weight to each of his comments and showing how he reacted in
the past in relation to his comments. You don't search for
documents; you search for answers.''
</P>
<P>
   At full throttle, the software is supposed to be able to answer
specific queries that depend on establishing relationships, like
``How much money did the United States give to Russia in 1998?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pazer contends that Webmind has far-reaching applications.
``The financial market is our proving ground,'' she said. ``We can
measure risk and volatility. But the technology could be used by
anyone trying to evaluate risk or isolate trends.'' The list of
potential users ranges from risk managers at insurance companies to
market researchers to political strategists.
</P>
<P>
   But Webmind is still in its infancy. Intelligenesis is currently
testing the software with potential customers and has a
demonstration for qualified users at its Web site,
www.intelligenesis.net. ``We have to prove to them that the
technology works,'' Ms. Pazer said.
</P>
<P>
   If they do that, Goertzel and Ms. Pazer hope to develop
partnerships, supplying Webmind to financial news services or other
online information providers, in a revenue-sharing arrangement. As
the Webmind brand becomes more established, Ms. Pazer would look
for such partnerships to give way to straight licensing deals.
</P>
<P>
   Though the business viability of Intelligenesis' product remains
to be seen, the company has attracted the involvement of some
influential people.
</P>
<P>
   The vice chairman, for example, is John B. Evans, a co-founder
and chairman of another Alley-based company, Biztravel.com. Danny
Hillis, co-founder of the supercomputer company Thinking Machines,
who is now vice president of research and development in Walt
Disney Co.'s department of imagineering, recently joined the
Intelligenesis strategic advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Among others who are watching the progress of Webmind is
Alexander Chislenko, a researcher at the Media Lab at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology who has followed Goertzel's work for some
time, because it complements some of his own. ``I think it's a
credible technology, and the approach is promising,'' Chislenko
said. He predicted that Webmind would prove valuable in modeling
some parts of the financial market that other technologies cannot.
But Chislenko cautioned, ``No technology can predict the whole
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed solely by private investors so far, Intelligenesis
employs nearly 30 people, with a heavy mix of programmers trained
in the social sciences _ some working from the company's office in
New York city, others commuting by way of the Internet from Norway,
Russia, Brazil and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Goertzel and Ms. Pazer contend that all the really significant
predictions and decisions that people make are, in the end, based
on human psychology. And Webmind, they say, can use artificial
intelligence to translate the multitudinous outpourings of human
psychology into valuable data.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about Webmind, think about being at a cocktail
party,'' Ms. Pazer said. ``Think if you could process not just the
conversations you had, but all the conversations in the room.''

COMPUTER SERVICE STORES HOUSEHOLD DATA FOR DISPLAY IN 911 CALLS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Pa. N.J.)  (ms) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case of a fire or accident, the first thing people often do
is call 911. It is reassuring to know that a trained operator is
standing by to help. How much better might it be if the operator
already knew who was calling, where the caller lived, how to find a
child's bedroom in the caller's burning house or what to tell
paramedics about any drugs the caller was taking?
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters, the police and emergency medical teams need this
information, and 911 operators must be trained to elicit those
details calmly from callers who are frequently panicky. Thinking it
would be more efficient for people to provide that information in
advance, Robert Pons and Jay Snider have patented an emergency
service they named 911-Plus.
</P>
<P>
   Berks and Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania, near
Philadelphia, and Ocean County, N.J., began testing the new system
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, when someone calls 911, they're not in a very
relaxed state,'' Pons said. ``Yet 911 operators need to ask for
important information. This information is now displayed on a
screen when the person calls 911.''
</P>
<P>
   To sign up for 911-Plus, a subscriber registers his phone number
with Pons' company, Lifesafety Solutions, pays a $2.95 monthly fee
added to his local telephone bill, and provides personal
information about the people living or working in the place served
by the phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a consumer places a 911 call, two things happen without
him doing anything but dialing,'' Pons said. ``The consumer has the
opportunity to preregister important information about himself, his
household and family members that is automatically transmitted to
the 911 operator's computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a pre-existing medical condition, or simple
directions to the home,'' he said. ``Sometimes it's not obvious
where the home's entrance is. If there's a pre-existing medical
condition, the paramedics will know about it. You could even list
the location of a child's bedroom upstairs and to the right, for
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Those details are stored on a data base at Lifesafety Solutions
in Bridgeport, Pa. When a 911 operator receives a call, the
information they provide is added to the subscriber information
already stored in the computer and now transmitted to the screen;
the operator does not have to look for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're directly connected to the community 911 system,'' Pons
said. ``Ours is proprietary software installed in two ways _ either
as a dedicated screen in front of the operator, or as a pop-up
window connected with their software. The operator sees it come up,
and it says this caller is a 911-Plus subscriber.''
</P>
<P>
   The system also allows a subscriber to register the name of
three relatives or friends who should be notified. Lifesafety
Solutions will try to reach at least one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our operators begins to call to notify the person
listed,'' Pons continued. ``We attempt to notify the emergency
contact for 24 hours. For example, if you have children and the
babysitter calls 911, then Mom or Dad can be immediately notified
at their place of work by pager, or called on their cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Pons said his company's service uses a private computer network
to insure confidentiality. He said he hoped to expand the service
beyond the three counties now testing it, and to car and cellular
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Pons, who is president of Lifesafety Solutions, and Snider, a
shareholder, received patent number 5,805,670.
</P>
<P>
   RADIO CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEELS
</P>
<P>
   Fiddling with radio dials while driving can be distracting and
even dangerous. Three Chrysler Corp. inventors have won a patent
for a remote-control device that moves the buttons for a car's
audio system to the back of the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The three _ James Repp, Lawrence Achram and George Zamplas _
designed the audio control panel so that drivers can press the
channel, volume and operating buttons with their fingertips while
their hands grip the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The buttons are embedded in the rear surface of the
cross-section of the wheel, just behind the place the driver pushes
to sound the car's horn. The driver can push the audio buttons with
his hands at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock on the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The invention, which belongs to Chrysler, now DaimlerChrysler,
won patent number 5,721,541.
</P>
<P>
   A DRUG IS PROPOSED FOR USE WITH VIAGRA
</P>
<P>
   Selectus Pharmaceuticals Inc. has filed a patent application for
a drug that it says may prevent heart attacks during sexual
activity for people who take Viagra. The company says that in
clinical trials, the drug, esprolol, reduced heart rate and blood
pressure during physical exertion.
</P>
<P>
   Selectus hopes to patent esprolol for use with Viagra because it
says that heart medication like nitroglycerin cannot be taken with
Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has found no link between
Viagra and heart attacks, but a press release issued by Selectus
asserted that 77 men had died of heart failure while taking Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect to see patented esprolol for safer sex on the
market anytime soon, however; the drug has further clinical trials
to undergo before winning FDA approval, and applications take an
average of 18 months' examination at the Patent and Trademark
Office before receiving a patent.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

SHAKE-UP AT BMW MAY PROMPT RENEWED INTEREST IN AUTO MAKER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The removal of two top executives at BMW A.G. on
Friday will prompt renewed interest by other auto makers in buying
the German maker of sporty coupes and sedans, but it remains
unclear whether the controlling Quandt family wants to sell, auto
executives said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Eaton, a co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler A.G., said at an
industry conference in San Francisco on Friday night that the
management shake-up in Munich would cause a lot of activity with
other automakers. ``I figure by Monday, there will be at least
three or four companies bidding for BMW,'' Eaton said, adding,
``That was not a normal management change that occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton added that DaimlerChrysler would not be a bidder. Formed
by a merger last November of Daimler-Benz A.G. and the Chrysler
Corp., DaimlerChrysler already owns Mercedes-Benz, BMW's main
competitor, and is negotiating to buy a stake in the Nissan Motor
Co.
</P>
<P>
   BMW announced the resignation of its chairman, Bernd
Pischetsrieder, and its director of new-model development, Walter
Reitzle, on Friday and said it would also name new executives for
marketing and production. Pischetsrieder's ouster was attributed to
BMW's money-losing purchase in 1994 of Britain's Rover, which makes
cars and Land Rover sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen A.G. and the Ford Motor Co. both let BMW know in
autumn that they were interested in buying the German automaker,
executives said in recent interviews. But BMW rejected both
overtures without ever entering into formal negotiations because
the Quandt family refused to consider a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, BMW has been periodically touted as a
merger candidate but has never lost its independence. The company
was rescued from the brink of collapse in 1960 by Herbert Quandt, a
German entrepreneur. His widow, Johanna Quandt, and two children,
Stefan Quandt and Susanne Klatten, have repeatedly refused to sell
the 46 percent stake they still hold. They reorganized their
holdings last October to make any hostile bid more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Die Welt, a German newspaper, reported Sunday that a spokesman
for the Quandt family had rejected the possibility of a sale of
BMW. Thomas Gauly, the family's main spokesman, did not return
calls to his office in Germany on Sunday. Despite Rover's problems,
BMW's attraction for other automakers is clear, auto executives
said in interviews earlier this year. BMW has one of the strongest
brand names in the global auto industry along with top-notch
engineers and highly skilled designers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford agreed on Jan. 28 to pay $6.5 billion for the car-making
operations of Sweden's Volvo A.B. But that still leaves Ford with
more than $17 billion in cash reserves, and its executives refused
at the time of the Volvo deal to rule out other acquisitions.
Volkswagen has also been looking for deals. Ford and Volkswagen
officials declined to comment on BMW this weekend.

A NEW MAGAZINE, BY WAY OF STARBUCKS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ Time Inc. has joined forces with Starbucks, the
coffeehouse giant responsible for caffeinating seven million
Americans every week. The two companies will start publication this
summer of Joe, a cultural review that will be sold in the 2,000
Starbucks stores sprinkled across the United States and Canada as
liberally as the chocolate powder on top of a double-mocha
cappuccino grande.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mowbray, the managing editor of Joe, said that his
editorial goal was to replicate the ideas and the conversation one
encounters in a coffeehouse. To that end, the magazine's subtitle
will be ``Life is Interesting. Discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds similar to the subtitle for Tina Brown's Talk _
hers is ``The American Conversation'' _ it is purely coincidental,
Mowbray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't inviting comparisons to anyone,'' he said. ``It's
going to be a cultural magazine, but not in the gray sense, not in
the review sense.''
</P>
<P>
   About 400,000 copies of the first 84-page issue, which will cost
$3, will arrive in Starbucks stores in June. Three bimonthly issues
are planned for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, said:
``Starbucks has emerged as the third place, between home and work,
in America. It is the true extension of people's front porch. What
people do inside Starbucks is talk, and coffee has been the
centerpiece of conversation for hundreds of years.''
</P>
<P>
   David L. Long, president of media sales and marketing at Time
Inc., a unit of Time Warner Inc., is not as interested in
conversation as he is in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can sell a copy and a half a day in each of their
stores, we'll make a bunch of money,'' Long said, adding that
producing a magazine for a chain that already provides distribution
eliminates all the costs of building circulation. ``Our
distribution costs are zero,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Starbucks already has alliances with United Airlines,
Barnes &AMP; Noble and the Starwood hotel chain, Joe has natural
advertisers. General Motors, which is not affiliated, has signed up
for several pages of advertising in the first issue.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz would not say what writers already had delivered pieces
for Joe, but he said he had spoken to Garry Trudeau and Nora Ephron
about contributing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see `You've Got Mail'?'' he asked, referring to the
movie Ms. Ephron wrote and directed. ``She used Starbucks almost
like a character in the movie. It was incredible.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On July 31, 1996, Anita Harkins, a copy editor at The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, was reading a column destined for the
next day's newspaper when a colleague heard her exclaim, ``They
can't do it this way.''
</P>
<P>
   A day before, The Journal-Constitution had reported that Richard
Jewell, a 33-year-old security guard, was ``the focus of'' the
federal investigation into the bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympic
Games. Jewell was not charged with anything, but the piece Ms.
Harkins was reading drew parallels between his situation and that
of Wayne Williams, a convicted murderer of Atlanta children.
</P>
<P>
   The column, by Dave Kindred, said: ``Like this one, he became
famous in the aftermath of murder. His name was Wayne Williams.
This one is Richard Jewell.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harkins went to the editor in charge to raise doubts about
the article. The response, Ms. Harkins said in a sworn statement,
was ``something along the lines of, `Well, it is a Dave Kindred
column' '' _ an apparent reference to the leeway columnists are
often allowed. Besides, she recalled, the editor complained that
``they were having color problems'' with the front page _ the kind
of production headaches that can delay an edition.
</P>
<P>
   Those moments and many others are captured in the sworn
statements of two dozen journalists who were questioned by the
lawyers handling the libel suit that Jewell filed against The
Journal-Constitution after he was cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The case is months away from trial, if it ever gets there. But
the evidence assembled offers a glimpse of the workings of a
newsroom. Most of all, it shows how news coverage, started in a
particular direction, can become a journalistic juggernaut, hard to
turn, harder to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment on Monday, July 29, when the local police
reporter, Kathy Scruggs, told her editors that Jewell had become a
leading suspect, the newspaper's coverage tended to bolster the
theory that the security guard had the motive and the opportunity
to set off the bomb and cast himself as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those involved in the newspaper's coverage declined to
discuss the case. But the newspaper, through the legal pleadings of
its lawyer, Peter Canfield, offers an impassioned defense of the
accuracy of its reporting. Since accurate reports cannot be deemed
libelous, the newspaper, which is owned by Cox Enterprises Inc.,
has asked the presiding judge to dismiss the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, however, contends that the
journalists did not simply report these suspicions but embellished
and enlarged on them _ for example, by juxtaposing Jewell's name
with that of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's task in proving libel is not simple. He must show that
the newspaper negligently or maliciously printed false statements
about Jewell, even though a Justice Department review confirms that
FBI agents once considered Jewell the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the eventual outcome, what emerges from the evidence
gathered so far is that in the first days after Jewell was named,
The Journal-Constitution gave prominence to reporting that
supported the FBI's view. Contradictory material got perfunctory
attention _ with a few exceptions. The newspaper was among the
first to disclose that it would have been nearly impossible for
Jewell to have made the 911 call warning of the blast, information
that undercut the theory of his involvement. But that came a week
after other news organizations reported that investigators'
interest in Jewell was waning.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the evidence makes it clear how tempting it is for
journalists covering a highly visible investigation to adopt the
investigators' theories as their own.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in Centennial Olympic Park, at 1:20 a.m.,
Saturday, July 27, killed one woman and injured 111 people. There
were fears that those responsible could strike again. The coverage
was intense: Reporters from around the world were on The
Journal-Constitution's home turf, looking for facts amid the
speculation. Journal-Constitution reporters followed a dozen
threads in the first 48 hours, checking whether authorities had
fumbled the 911 warning call, covering other bomb threats and
writing about ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
</P>
<P>
   One of these was Jewell, a security guard working for AT&AMP;T, who
discovered the backpack and helped clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   It was the coverage casting Jewell, then 33, as a hero, that
began his troubles. He agreed to an interview with CNN, which had
been arranged by AT&AMP;T. As Jewell recalled in a recent interview, he
arrived late and out of breath. Seated alone in a dark studio, he
didn't know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday evening interview was seen by W. Ray Cleere, the
president of Piedmont College in northern Georgia, where Jewell had
been a campus security officer a few weeks before. He was struck by
Jewell's nervousness. Sunday, Cleere called the FBI and expressed
concern about Jewell.
</P>
<P>
   After FBI agents heard Cleere's suspicions, according to a
Justice Department summary of the events, ``The FBI recalled that a
spate of fires in Southern California had recently been linked to a
volunteer firefighter who apparently had set the fires so he could
extinguish them and become a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Jewell might have set off the bomb to make himself
a hero began to form Sunday, according to the Justice report, as
agents learned in telephone interviews that he had had a
problematic history as a law enforcement officer. They knew he had
been the first to notice the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an agent was told by acquaintances of Jewell's that
the security guard had said he wanted to be ``in the middle'' of
any big event at the Olympics, and that he had access to a ``bomb
making cookbook'' _ assertions that were never substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   As that agent was headed back to Atlanta, Ms. Scruggs, who
covered the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Atlanta Police
Department for The Journal-Constitution, went to meet someone who
told her of the FBI's suspicions. Ms. Scruggs agreed not to
disclose the information unless the newspaper learned it elsewhere,
according to an account she gave to her colleague, Carrie
Teegardin, who was preparing an article on the newspaper's
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Ms. Scruggs called her editors, then filled
in a colleague, Maria Fernandez, who was sent to Piedmont College
to do more reporting. Ms. Fernandez' notes from that conversation,
revealed during her deposition, reflect the raw information on
which the early news judgments were based.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police chief of college, president of college, thought he
looked nervous,'' the notes read. ``Chasing people off campus, bad
reports. He left May 21st. Habersham County Sheriff's Department.
Wrecked four cars. Crazy chases, lots of guns in cars. He hopes he
is in the middle of it. Wants to marry people on a first date.''
</P>
<P>
   These details circulated among reporters and editors involved in
the coverage. Later reporting showed half these statements were
substantially true; half were gossip that was never printed. As an
officer, Jewell had damaged police cruisers and attracted civilian
complaints. There was no evidence that he had ``lots'' of guns in
his cars or was overeager romantically.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Ms. Scruggs got another tip. A source told her
that ``everybody'' in the Atlanta Police Department was discussing
``the security guard.'' Ms. Scruggs told her editors it was time to
publish.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the sources have been protected by the
newspaper, in line with the tradition that news organizations
shield people who take a risk to make important information public.
But Jewell's lawyer, Wood, contends that his inability to find out
who said what about Jewell cripples his case. He has asked the
judge to compel the newspaper to reveal its sources.
</P>
<P>
   After she got to the office Tuesday, Ms. Scruggs wrote a version
of her article with Ron Martz, who covered federal law enforcement
agencies, looking over her shoulder, according to several
depositions. Burt Roughton Jr., who oversaw the nonsports Olympic
coverage, edited the article, inserting a sentence saying Jewell
``also has approached newspapers, including The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, seeking publicity for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   As Roughton explained in his deposition, ``There was a general
impression at the time that he was making the media rounds.''
Jewell had talked to CNN, USA Today, The Journal-Constitution and
the NBC ``Today'' Show, but has said he was doing so at the wish of
his superiors at AT&AMP;T, for whom he worked as a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   The article's second paragraph said, ``Richard Jewell, 33, a
former law enforcement officer, fits the profile of the lone
bomber. This profile generally includes a frustrated white man who
is a former police officer, member of the military or police
`wannabe' who seeks to become a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   No source is cited for the assertion that Jewell fit the profile
of the lone bomber.
</P>
<P>
   After the article was edited, however, Martz called a federal
source, read it over the phone and was told the source had no
problem with it. Soon after, in an updated edition late in the
afternoon, it was in print, under a six-column headline.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for journalists to get reaction from an individual
before unflattering information about that person is printed. But
there is no evidence that anyone ever told Jewell what the
newspaper was about to print so that he could respond. One reporter
said in a deposition that his phone calls to Jewell went
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The editors did have had someone outside Jewell's apartment _ a
young summer intern, Christina Headrick. Rochelle Bozman, the
editor responsible for the Jewell reporting, told her to knock on
Jewell's door shortly before 2 p.m. According to Ms. Headrick's
deposition, when she did so, he refused to open it or to speak to
her, saying he was sleeping. She said she did not tell him he was a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Canfield, the lawyer, argues that Jewell gave Ms. Headrick
little or no chance to tell him of the impending article and that
it is unlikely he would have contradicted his earlier accounts of
his activities.
</P>
<P>
   The presses rolled around 4 p.m. The Journal-Constitution's
editors, proud of the staff's work, alerted The Associated Press
and CNN. These organizations alerted the world.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, television wires sprouted like kudzu outside
Jewell's apartment. His brief denial was the top news in
Wednesday's early editions, under the headline `` `Hero' Denies
Planting Bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's issue also carried five articles related to Jewell.
The headlines read: ``Change of Fortune,'' ``Security Guard Had
Reputation as Zealot,'' ``Motive? Could Be Sociopath, Attention
Seeker,'' ``Security Woes Hit AT&AMP;T Site'' and ``Crimes Committed by
Guards Plague Security Industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution's coverage did include comments of
Jewell's neighbors and friends, who scoffed at the FBI's theory.
</P>
<P>
   One headline a day later did cast doubt on Jewell's viability as
a suspect. Later editions Thursday ran a story entitled ``Reports
Say Agents Backing Off'' that quoted two network news reports that
the investigators' suspicions were cooling after they failed to
find physical evidence linking Jewell to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of seven Jewell-related articles that day. Others
were titled ``Police Work `Was His Life': Some in North Georgia
Town Say Jewell `Was on a Power Kick,' '' and `` `Hero Syndrome' Is
Fueled by Anger, Need for Attention.'' The final editions of
Thursday's front page carried a five-column headline ``No Arrest
Made Yet.'' An earlier edition had a front-page teaser to Dave
Kindred's column about the search.
</P>
<P>
   Kindred was in the crowd outside Jewell's apartment watching the
search on Wednesday. That evening, his column was passed to the
copy desk, a group of editors who backstop other editors on issues
like fairness and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Two copy editors who read the column alerted senior editors,
according to their depositions. Both said they were rebuffed,
although a supervising editor denies this. Kindred said in his
deposition that he was comparing ``the circumstances surrounding
their cases,'' not comparing Jewell to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The column noted the apparent fruitlessness of the search,
stating, ``Maybe the regular fella had nothing to do with the bomb;
the FBI has often sat on a suspect and come up empty.'' Kindred
concluded: ``Richard Jewell sits in the shadows today. Wayne
Williams sits in prison forever.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Ms. Teegardin, the Journal-Constitution
reporter, interviewed Rochelle Bozman for an article about the
coverage _ an article that was never published. Ms. Teegardin asked
Ms. Bozman, who was in charge of the coverage, ``Are you going to
feel bad, like you did some big wrong, if it turns out that Richard
Jewell is innocent?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bozman answered, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we didn't say he was guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve weeks later, on Oct. 24, The Constitution's lead article
carried the headline ``Jewell Out as Suspect in Bombing, Judge
Says.''

 PLAN FOR FREE PCs HAS A FEW ATTACHMENTS  
(lb) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The personal computer, already dropping precipitously in price,
may in some cases become free _ with a few strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   In a variation on a popular cellular-telephone business model _
sign up for service and pay nothing for the phone _ a Southern
California start-up, Free PC Inc., plans to announce Monday that it
will give away Compaq personal computers and a free Internet
connection, too.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: Users of the computers must accept advertisements
that will constantly be displayed on the 15-inch screen, whether
the person is on the Internet or operating the computer off line.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but consumers who want to register for a free PC
will have to answer some 20 questions about themselves, involving
income, education and the like. The company will then decide who
actually gets a free computer on the basis of who best fits the
demographic profiles that advertisers are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of hardware and a connection has come down
dramatically,'' said Donald La Vigne, Free PC's chief executive.
``There are a lot of people who still aren't participating and a
lot of marketers who want to get at those people.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be a chicken-or-egg complication, of course, since
applying for a free computer will require visiting the company's
Web site, www.free-pc.com, where Free PC intends to start
registering applicants Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Free PC, which is in Pasadena, Calif., plans to make its
announcement Monday at the Demo Conference, a technology industry
gathering in Indian Wells, near Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Free PC is the brainchild of Bill Gross, the chairman of
Idealab, a Pasadena-based Internet business incubator and venture
capital firm that has backed other ventures.
</P>
<P>
   La Vigne said that Free PC planned to give away 10,000 computers
starting in the second quarter of this year as a way of testing and
refining the concept.
</P>
<P>
   La Vigne declined to give details about several key aspects of
the business. He said the PCs were ones that might normally retail
for around $600, for example, but he declined to specify their
power and processing speed. He also would not identify any of the
participating advertisers with whom he said he was negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   As the PC has increasingly been identified as an appliance, and
fallen well below the once-magical $1,000 retail figure, industry
analysts have suggested that an approach like Free PC's might
emerge. Already, several companies offer free dial-up e-mail access
and free Internet connections, which are subsidized by ads.
</P>
<P>
   But the free Internet business model has proved challenging,
because it has been difficult to get enough subscribers to attract
advertisers.

 &HT;    REPORTS: AILING YELTSIN WILL ATTEND HUSSEIN'S FUNERAL
 &HT;    With HUSSEIN-JORDAN-0208.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin, for months battling
his own string of serious illnesses, will lead the Russian
delegation to Amman for the funeral of the late King Hussein,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin was unable to confirm the reports by local news
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It would be Yeltsin's first foreign trip since a tour of Central
Asia last fall when he became ill and was hospitalized with
exhaustion and a lung ailment. Most recently, he was hospitalized
last month for treatment of bleeding ulcers, forcing him to cancel
a scheduled state
</P>
<P>
   visit to France.
</P>
<P>
   The death of King Hussein dominated Russian news broadcasts,
displacing the usual fare of stories on the country's ongoing
economic crisis and political infighting.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin called Hussein an ``invaluable'' statesman who helped
forge ``a new image of the Middle East free from the stereotypes of
confrontation and animosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin made his comments in a condolence message cabled to King
Abdullah and the Jordanian people. Itar-Tass news agency, citing a
highly-placed source, reported that Yeltsin would travel to Amman
for King Hussein's funeral. The Interfax agency later also said
Yeltsin intended to go to Jordan, quoting sources in the circle
close to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a former foreign minister and
Middle East expert, also is expected to represent Russia at the
king's funeral. He said he had been enriched by his many meetings
with Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel deep pain from the grief which has affected us all, the
death of a great statesman, King Hussein,'' Primakov said in his
letter of condolence.

ZIMBABWE PUSHED TOWARD CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ In an angry televised address,
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe pushed his country toward a
constitutional crisis over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The president suggested that the Supreme Court resign,
threatened ``very stern measures'' against the independent press
and appeared to support the army's decision to arrest and then
apparently torture two journalists and to defy court orders that
they be released.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that the article that led to the arrests _
which said that 23 army officers had been arrested for plotting a
coup _ had been planted by British agents. Although the two
journalists for The Zimbabwe Standard who wrote the Jan. 10 article
are black, he accused white journalists and human rights activists
of plotting against him and warned that ``they have pushed our
sense of racial tolerance to the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe was reacting to a letter sent to him on Jan. 25 by three
Supreme Court justices. It asked that the president ``confirm that
the rule of law is accepted as a necessary ingredient of a
democratic Zimbabwe.''
</P>
<P>
   It also asked that he confirm that the army has no power to
arrest civilians and that the government will not tolerate torture,
and to reassure the judiciary that the government will act in
accordance with the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In his reply, shown on state television Saturday night and again
Sunday morning, a visibly angry Mugabe defended the army's actions,
saying it had been horrified by the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Propelled by the unquestionable loyalty and commitment to the
defense and security of the state, they wanted to establish the
source of the falsehood and so they proceeded in the manner they
did,'' Mugabe said, according to an Agence France-Presse account of
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   The two journalists, Ray Choto and Mark Chavanduka, said they
were tortured with electric shocks applied to their genitals by
intelligence officers demanding the names of their sources. The
defense ministry dismissed them as liars, but a doctor who examined
them said they had been tortured.
</P>
<P>
   ``If The Standard had not behaved in such a blatantly dishonest
and unethical manner, the army would not have acted the way they
did,'' Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the judges of ``an outrageous and deliberate act of
impudence,'' and said that since they were meddling in politics,
they should ``quit the bench and join the political forum.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused the paper's two white publishers, one of whom was
also briefly arrested, of running an untrue article to plant the
idea of a coup in the army's head ``and to cause alarm and
despondency among peace-loving Zimbabweans.'' He named the
publishers as conspirators ``bent on ruining the national unity,''
along with two human rights activists _ Mike Auret of the Catholic
Commission for Justice and Peace, and David Coltart, a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Coltart was quoted as saying that ``to all intents and purposes,
this is now a military regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Department of Immigration began demanding that
reporters working in Zimbabwe for foreign news organizations like
The Associated Press submit their passports and work permits ``for
review.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Information recently set up a task force to vet
news stories and counter what it sees as negative publicity in the
parts of the press that the government does not own.

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ As Alan Huang sees it, the key to the
Internet's future may lie in a simple card trick.
</P>
<P>
   In a restaurant here recently, Huang, a 50-year-old former Bell
Labs data network designer, used a new deck of playing cards to
help explain how an esoteric branch of mathematics known as group
theory offers a simple solution to the coming explosion of Internet
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   He separated the cards into three piles, then reassembled them
into a single deck, which he riffled with a flourish to show that
they were in seemingly random order. After several more times of
separating them into three piles and reassembling the deck, he
uttered, ``Abracadabra.'' As if by magic, the cards had been
reordered into the original sequence and suits of the new deck.
</P>
<P>
   Huang offered the card trick, well known among magicians as the
Grand Tour, as a simple demonstration of a type of mathematics
called group theory _ in which it is possible with a given set of
numbers to change their sequence and then reorder them by
repeatedly sorting them by using a specific mathematical function
known as a generator. But more to his business point, Huang
presents the card trick as a symbol for the new method _ an
efficient generator _ he says he has discovered for sorting out the
welter of data that often collides at the Internet's bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   Whether theory can translate to practice, though, remains a very
open question. Despite some impressive credentials in
computer-networking circles, so far he has found no backers and has
depleted most of his life savings in an effort to keep his
technological dream alive.
</P>
<P>
   If his technique does work, there would seem to be great demand
for it. Almost everyone agrees that greater Internet efficiency
will be crucial as vast new torrents of data pour onto the network
through new voice and video communications services. What is still
subject to debate is how best to accommodate this traffic. Industry
leaders like Cisco Systems Inc., the biggest maker of so-called
router hardware for directing network traffic, insist that the only
way to increase the current Internet's carrying capacity is to
build bigger, more expensive routers. But Huang, card deck and
group-theory mathematics in hand, contends that he has conceived a
novel way to string together the kind of less-expensive routers
already widely used on the Internet to expand its data-carrying
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, if the prevention of Internet traffic jams is as deft
as Huang's card trick suggests, why have no big companies or rich
investors been willing to give him table stakes?
</P>
<P>
   Deaf ears are hardly the reception that one might expect for a
researcher with Huang's credentials. As an AT&AMP;T Bell Laboratories
researcher in 1982, he was the co-inventor of a traffic-routing
approach to computer networks called Batcher Banyan switching, one
of the first prototype data networks intended to carry both voice
and video. For several years it held the world speed record for a
data network of its type.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1990, while still at Bell Labs, Huang grabbed national
attention when he led a research team that built the world's first
optical processor _ an information traffic controller for data
conveyed as laser light. Though the invention has yet to make its
way into a commercial product, many researchers still think that
optical switching will become an essential component for the data
networks of the future.
</P>
<P>
   But as Huang now seems to be finding the hard way, theoretical
research does not necessarily translate into the practical ideas
the investors and manufacturers are willing to bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at his idea and it was solid research,'' said Mike
Volpi, vice president of business development for Cisco Systems.
``But what is lacking is a practical implementation.'' In other
words: What may work in the ivory tower of academic research may
not prove viable in the chaotic real world of the Internet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Huang, the Bell Labs ivory tower was shaken by AT&AMP;T's
decision in 1995 to break into three companies and to split the
Bell Labs team between two of them _ the remaining AT&AMP;T
communications company and the new Lucent Technologies equipment
company. At the same time, Huang was hearing the Internet's
entrepreneurial siren song. And so in 1995 he headed back to
Silicon Valley, where he had been an electrical engineering
graduate student at Stanford University years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Huang set up a company, Terabit Routers, that initially pursued
the idea of building a super-router based on optical switching. But
after about a year, while reading the literature of group theory, a
branch of mathematics credited to Evariste Galois, the early
19th-century French mathematician, Huang had an epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe bigger and more complex was not the answer to Internet
routing. Maybe there was a way to draw upon the mathematics of
group theory and create the order from seeming chaos that might let
data networks operate much more efficiently _ so much so that
clusters of cheap, off-the-shelf routers could be harnessed into
acting as a new, faster, more powerful type of router.
</P>
<P>
   Since working his router ideas out on paper three years ago,
Huang has diligently solicited Silicon Valley's venture
capitalists, hoping to convince someone that his idea deserves
financing.
</P>
<P>
   But he is finding that esoteric and high-risk technology
concepts can be more difficult to sell to venture capitalists at a
time when simple, get-rich-quick ideas for Web commerce seem much
more in vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to have mastered advanced physics, it's harder to
understand some technologies than the idea of selling wedding stuff
on line,'' said John Shoch, a venture capitalist at Asset
Management Corp. in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But Web wedding sites are not Huang's only obstacle. He contends
that his ideas also run counter to Silicon Valley's infatuation
with ``big iron'' _ ever more complex and powerful routers for
coping with the coming deluge of Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that this will accelerate the growth of the
Net dramatically,'' he said of his approach. ``But this is just
about math, and Silicon Valley is used to building faster chips.
It's not used to faster math.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Haung's so far disappointing search, his prospects have
begun to improve recently. Late last year he received a patent
covering his concept for hooking together computer routers, which
he refers to as a Galois network, in a tip of the hat to the French
pioneer of group theory.
</P>
<P>
   And lately, Huang has found interest and even enthusiasm in some
quarters of the industry. He said that British Telecommunications
was looking closely at his concept and was planning an experiment
to test his theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sat down with Alan in some fierce seminars,'' said Peter
Cochrane, head of research for British Telecom. ``The common sense
underlying his ideas kind of scream out at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Huang faces a daunting task in attempting to catch up
with the giant Cisco, which today makes the world's
highest-performance router, the GSR 12000. Moreover, there are
already three start-up companies _ Avici Systems, Nexabit Networks
Inc. and Pluris Inc. _ all shooting for the market for the next
wave of networking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, being late isn't always a disadvantage, said Farrokh
Billimoria, a research analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San
Francisco who was co-author of a recent report on the future of the
routing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a unique idea and you start six months behind,
sometimes it's an advantage,'' he said. ``You can start behind and
catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what Huang, shuffling his deck, is betting
on.

STATE ELECTION IN GERMANY A SETBACK FOR SCHROEDER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ An election Sunday in the German state of Hesse
inflicted a sharp defeat on the new Social Democratic Chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder, reflecting his uneasy start and Germany's
charged politics of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   After a campaign based on a relentless attack against
Schroeder's proposals for making German citizenship easier to
obtain for foreigners, the Christian Democrats won 44 percent of
the vote, more than 4 percent more than in 1995. They appeared
certain to oust Hesse's governing coalition of Social Democrats and
environmentalist Greens.
</P>
<P>
   A so-called Red-Green coalition, the same as that now governing
the country, had ruled the western state of Hesse for the past
eight years and had been widely expected to hold on to power. The
state contains Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
</P>
<P>
   But a petition against Schroeder's proposed new immigration law
started last month in Hesse by the Christian Democrats evidently
struck a chord. Celebrating the victory, Manfred Kanter, a leading
Christian Democrat, said, ``It is now clear that we must curb the
influx of immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the chancellor's stumbling first three months
in office, marked by frequent squabbles between his coalition
partners and a general lack of direction, clearly affected Sunday's
vote. Schroeder has suffered a wave of criticism from intellectuals
and editorialists, although his personal popularity remains high.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of what the German weekly Die Zeit last week called
``Schroeder's weak 100 days'' was felt most clearly in the vote for
the Greens in Hesse, which plunged to 7 percent, from more than 11
percent four years ago. The Social Democrats, apparently spared any
direct voters' ire, inched up to 39 percent from 38 percent.
Although very much the junior partner, the Greens have made
vociferous demands in areas including nuclear power, the
environment and taxation that have left some Germans dismayed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it appeared certain that the Christian Democrats
would have a slight majority in the Hesse Parliament with their
right-wing Free Democrat partners, who took 5 percent of the vote,
according to complete returns.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate impact of the vote will certainly be felt on
the fraught question of immigration, where Schroeder has proposed
replacing legislation still based largely on German stock and blood
lines with new laws that would allow many of the country's seven
million foreigners to gain citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's proposals _ to allow foreigners to request
citizenship after eight years of residence instead of 15 and to
hold dual citizenship instead of being obliged to abandon any other
nationality _ have represented his boldest step since taking
office, an attempt to change Germany's view of itself.
</P>
<P>
   But, after some hesitation, the Christian Democrats have decided
to turn the issue into a pivotal battle zone, although this
decision has placed the party in the awkward position of fighting a
campaign largely shared by Germany's extreme right.
</P>
<P>
   In Hesse, the Christian Democrats were at pains to say their
objections to the law did not amount to a xenophobic campaign but
were based essentially on a rejection of Schroeder's proposal to
allow dual nationality. Many of Germany's two million Turks are
reluctant to become German if the price is the abandonment of their
Turkish passports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Democrats said this was about dual citizenship,
but it was really about the integration of foreigners, and the
issue mobilized the electorate,'' said Claus Leggewie, a
sociologist who lives in Hesse. ``The campaign worked, and the
result will probably be that a compromise is necessary on the
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, it appears likely that the law may have to be
modified so that dual citizenship becomes a concession granted only
in extraordinary cases. Foreigners born here will probably be asked
to decide which nationality they want at age 18, political analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, even before Sunday's election, Schroeder had begun to
modify his tone, saying last month in Berlin that ``dual
citizenship is not my major aim'' and ``one nationality would be
better.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the chancellor may find himself more obliged to
compromise on his policies because Sunday's result, if confirmed,
would mean that the Social Democrats and Greens would lose their
majority in the federal upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat.
The governing coalition's seats would fall to 33, from 38, in the
69-seat house, made up of representatives from Germany's 16 states.
</P>
<P>
   One positive effect of the result in Hesse may be that the
chancellor will find himself in a position to impose his will more
easily on his junior partner, the Greens. His first months in
office have been plagued by conflict with the party, particularly
the environment minister, Juurgen Trittin.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreements have produced some spectacular reversals and
confusion, with Schroeder going back and forth on the fate of
Germany's 19 nuclear power stations, and announcing one week that
Germany would stop exporting its nuclear waste on January 1, 2000,
only to announce the contrary the following week.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the waste is processed in France and Britain under large
contracts, and Schroeder's initial plan to rescind these
arrangements produced an uproar in Paris and London. When he
realized the extent of the political damage, and perceived that no
alternative destination for the waste existed, Schroeder conceded,
``It was an error.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week with the Berlin paper Tagesspiegel,
Schroeder said the problems stemmed from having ``tried to start
with a very fast rhythm, sometimes too fast.'' It is true that the
pace has been frenetic even as the direction has often been
unclear; or, as Tagesspiegel put it, ``The pulse is faster, but no
concept in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   On the critical question of unemployment, which has recently
started to rise again from an already high level of 10.8 percent,
Schroeder has made little headway. A much-vaunted ``Alliance for
Jobs'' has been buried in convoluted discussions between
businessmen and labor unions about everything from part-time work
to the concept of flexibility. But at the same time, there has been
a demand from the powerful metalworkers for a pay increase of 6.5
percent that has prompted tension and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But at least initial friction with Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party and a man
with views to the left of Schroeder's, has eased, at least
superficially. Lafontaine has stopped his calls for lower interest
rates and controls on international capital flows, appeals that had
embarrassed the chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps relieved by this development, Schroeder has looked more
relaxed of late, flashing his ready smile with nonchalance. But
just what vision of Germany's future, if any, lurks behind that
smile remains as mysterious as during Schroeder's shrewdly
ambivalent election campaign.

(DW) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remote, cryptic, knowing in ways she will never share
and oh, so very magnetic despite, or because of, all that: such is
Woman as Sphinx, a type that hasn't had much currency since the
days when Garbo ruled the screen. But if anyone (detective
novelists aside) has kept this creature compellingly alive, it's
Harold Pinter, the era-defining English playwright for whom all the
world's a riddle, and nothing so much as its female inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   If you doubt that there's still major theatrical life to be
derived from Pinter's version of this prototype, you need only see
Lindsay Duncan's quiet, shattering performance in ``Ashes to
Ashes'' at the Gramercy Theater. The show, a production of the
Roundabout Theater Co., already has achieved notoriety for being
only 40 minutes long and having a top ticket price of $48.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are sure to be connoisseurs of acting who will find
ample sustenance and savor in the clouded radiance of Ms. Duncan's
portrait of a mysteriously damaged woman. ``Ashes to Ashes'' isn't
top-of-the-line Pinter. It recycles elements from his earlier,
fuller works in such literal ways that it sometimes shades into
self-parody.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ms. Duncan, a gold-and-ivory British beauty
best known here as the scheming marquise in the Broadway production
of ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' keeps pulling out fresh,
suggestive layers of meaning from the merest flickers of
expression. Her character, the idle wife of an English university
professor played by David Strathairn, may exist in a fog of blurred
impulses and recollections. But in rendering ambiguity, this
actress is a precision instrument, bringing emotional clarity to
the shifting darkness of Pinter Land.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially impressive when you consider that Rebecca,
Ms. Duncan's character, bears even more of an interpretive burden
that most of Pinter's women. Like the wives of ``The Homecoming,''
``Betrayal'' and especially ``Old Times,'' Rebecca appears to be
listening to an inner music utterly beyond the hearing range of
men.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the secrets of her sex and sexuality that
Rebecca is contemplating. No, it would seem that she has been
infected with an instinctive, personally felt knowledge of the
nastiest forms of institutionalized violence of the century in
which she lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashes to Ashes,'' which has been given an exquisitely mounted
production under the direction of Karel Reisz, folds the specific
political outrage of Pinter's plays of the 1980s _ short, harsh
dramas like ``One for the Road'' and ``Mountain Language'' _ into
the sort of tastefully appointed, upper-middle-class living rooms
in which much of his more leisurely work of the previous decade was
set. Rebecca and Devlin ( Strathairn) are close spiritual neighbors
to Kate and Deeley, the married couple of Pinter's ``Old Times''
(1971).
</P>
<P>
   The obviously affluent homes of both pairs hum with a rarefied
silence and air of isolation, despite the intrusive noise of a
police siren that is the first thing heard in ``Ashes to Ashes.''
Tony Walton's perfectly realized setting, an elegantly coordinated
sitting room on a perilously sloped stage, and Richard Pilbrow's
richly modulated lighting evoke an insular world that is finally no
fortress. The room's large corner picture window has a view of an
expensively maintained garden that, as the evening draws on,
obviously has room for things more threatening than flowers.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Old Times,'' ``Ashes to Ashes'' is built on a husband's
sleuthing around his wife's past and realizing he doesn't know her
at all. In both dramas the past is a slippery, treacherous place
that defies coherent description. In ``Ashes to Ashes,'' however,
the borders of individual memory are even further obscured. What
Rebecca recalls, under her husband's increasingly frustrated
interrogation, at first seems to be a specific, sadomasochistic
love affair.
</P>
<P>
   As she continues talking, though, she describes, with a hypnotic
calm, having witnessed scenes of babies being snatched from mothers
on train platforms; of refugees scuttling through empty, icy
cities; of groups of people being led like sheep into the sea. The
images are generic and dreamlike, but they inevitably bring to mind
the horrors of the Holocaust and, more recently, of ethnic
cleansing in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, when asked by Devlin what authority she has to
speak of such atrocities, she answers: ``I have no such authority.
Nothing has ever happened to me.'' This central paradox would
appear to suggest that our immediate history is so steeped in
blood, in instances of human inhumanity, that it has become part of
the collective unconsciousness, polluting memory and perception.
</P>
<P>
   It is a latter-day moralist's version, if you will, of original
sin. Language is corrupt. (There is banter about whether certain
words are ``illegitimate'' or not.) So, too, are everyday objects,
and Rebecca and Devlin find themselves debating the question of the
``innocence'' of a pen that has rolled off a table.
</P>
<P>
   Sexuality, needless to say, is similarly implicated. The erotic,
death-courting encounter that Rebecca describes at the play's
beginning and is replicated later is redolent of Fascist
subjugation and torture. The woman is the victim here, just as it
is the woman who is naturally attuned to a broader, insufferable
climate of cruelty. Why? Well, Pinter observed in a recent
interview that it is largely men who are responsible for historic
acts of brutality. He also said, ``I just believe God was in much
better trim when He created women.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, man gets short shrift in ``Ashes to Ashes'' for
reasons beyond his moral inferiority. Strathairn, an excellent
actor, falls prey to the problems that often conquer Americans
performing Pinter. His accent, his inflections, his timing all seem
as much part of an assumed costume as his baggy tweeds. He's not
embarrassing, but his actorly self-consciousness adds an
unnecessary level of irony in a play that is already swimming in
it. He never seems dangerous, and there are moments when he has to.
</P>
<P>
   Devlin also has been allotted the play's more thankless lines. I
could certainly have done without his metaphoric speech about a
godless world as a soccer match played in a vacuum. Yet this
dramatist still mines associative echoes from simple words and
repeated phrases in ways no one else can.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duncan knows how to set off those reverberative chains.
Everything in her performance is measured in such small, stealthy
degrees that you're never entirely aware of what she's been doing
until she's moved on to something else, and her performance keeps
developing in your mind afterward, as though she had planted the
negative of it in your head.
</P>
<P>
   Though engaged, more or less, in dialogue with her husband,
Rebecca has receded into her own realm of shadows, in which it is
no longer possible to distinguish private experience from public
catastrophe. Ms. Duncan never raises her voice and never makes a
large or abrupt gesture. Her movements, and she is seated for most
of the performance, have a slow, melting quality, and her face
often reads as an abstracted mask.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the expressions of perturbation passing over that face,
though delicately nuanced, have a devastating effect, in part
because they feel so involuntary. Ms. Duncan's Rebecca is a finely
tuned seismograph, registering the tremors of a heaving, cruel
world in ways she can't begin to understand. The clean, refined
sanctuary in which she spends most of her time is finally no refuge
at all. She is maimed beyond repair, and so, Pinter suggests, are
we all.

   EDS: The following stories are moving in response to the death
of King Hussein today.
</P>
<P>
   HUSSEIN-JORDAN _ AMMAN, Jordan _ The 47-year reign of King
Hussein ended on Sunday after the ailing monarch has been kept
alive on life support for two days. He was 63. As if on cue, a
dense fog rolled into the capital city indicative of the cloud
hanging over this tiny desert kingdom known for its stability in a

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In her poetry and prose, Lois-Ann Yamanaka writes
about families _ fragile families usually, with deep wounds and
closets rattling with skeletons. Now her work, which has led some
to call her the freshest, most dynamic literary voice to come out
of Hawaii in recent years, has kindled an emotional debate in the
world of Asian-American letters.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the uproar are some of her Filipino-American
characters. Critics have called them racist caricatures, while her
supporters have defended her work as the target of what the poet
David Mura has called ``a tribal policing for `political
correctness.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the controversy hit a boiling point with the mass
resignation of virtually the entire governing board of the
Association for Asian American Studies, the national organization
of academics in the field. The group selected ``Blu's Hanging,''
her 1997 novel, for its annual literary award and then, after a
volley of protest, rescinded it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yamanaka, 37, a third-generation Japanese-American who grew
up on the island of Hawaii, has also picked up a string of
accolades and awards that have not been as short-lived. They
include two Pushcart Prizes, for her poetry, and a Lannan Literary
Award for fiction, given last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Using the pidgin English of Hawaii, Ms. Yamanaka, who is
scheduled to read from her forthcoming novel, ``Heads by Harry''
(Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux), on Monday night in Manhattan at the 92nd
Street Y, writes about the hard, anti-idyllic lives of the people
of the islands. ``Heads by Harry'' is centered on the rituals of a
taxidermy shop of the same name. ``Blu's Hanging,'' also published
by Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, is the story of a desperately poor
family trying to cope with a mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   It is set on the small island of Molokai, where Ms. Yamanaka,
the eldest of four daughters, spent many summers at her
grandmother's house. It explores what she describes as ``the
underlying complexity of everyone's relationship to everyone else,
based on ethnicity, class, perceived class.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the controversy around the book is a sexually
depraved Filipino man named Uncle Paulo, who molests his own nieces
and finally a fat, motherless little boy named Blu.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Paulo, whom even some of Ms. Yamanaka's defenders have
described as a one-dimensional figure, is a minor character in
``Blu's Hanging,'' but his specter hangs heavy. To Ms. Yamanaka's
critics, he embodies the well-worn stereotype of the Filipino man
as a sexual threat _ a stereotype dating back to when Filipino men
went to work on Hawaii's sugar cane plantations more than 100 years
ago and lived in bachelor societies.
</P>
<P>
   What if, asked Candace Fujikane, one of Ms. Yamanaka's most
vocal critics, the writer were white and Uncle Paulo were black?
``I think it would have been easier for people to understand what
our concerns are,'' said Ms. Fujikane, a professor of English at
the University of Hawaii at Manoa. ``Because she is Japanese, the
flat portrayals seem to come from an unawareness of the
difficulties that Filipinos have faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Would the same concern have emerged if the writer were Filipino
and the character Japanese? No, Ms. Fujikane asserted, again
invoking the example of black and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whites to write a stereotype about blacks is to reinforce
a system of racism that already exists,'' she maintained. ``When
blacks write about white oppression, it's a critique of that
system.''
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Yamanaka's defenders, however, the charges of racism stem
from a fundamental misunderstanding. To conflate the author's
opinions, they say, with the narrative voice of the novel _ that of
a troubled teen-age Japanese-American girl _ is to misread the
function of literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yamanaka's detractors,'' argued Jessica Hagedorn, a poet and
novelist who is Filipino-American, in a letter to the Asian
American Studies Association at the height of the debate ``seem to
be demanding that only writers who create safe, reverent,
comforting stories are worthy of acknowledgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hagedorn herself is no stranger to literary controversy. Her
first novel, about Manila during the Marcos years, won critical
acclaim but stirred outrage among some Filipinos for its title,
``Dogeaters.'' The word is a derogatory term for Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yamanaka describes being ``blindsided'' by the storm over
`Blu's Hanging'' at first, then saddened by its intensity. Now, she
offers a blunt response to her critics. ``If I thought about all my
social responsibilities when I was creating something,'' she said,
``I'd be so stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does she write amid such dark clouds? ``Going behind the
veil, going into the world that the characters inhabit'' is how she
describes the act of writing. ``You come out, and you look at your
watch, and three hours have gone by.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, she says, her critics have so flummoxed her.
``When I step into the world of my characters, that's not me,'' she
said. ``They said it was me. I said, `Whoa now!' Let's learn how to
read fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has spread beyond the confines of fiction and into
the sometimes delicate world of relations within the huge and
disparate category of the population referred to as Asian-American.
What it unearthed, of course, was the complexity of that category.
``A literary award was really not the place to have this fight,''
said David Palumbo-Liu, an American-studies professor at Stanford
University. ``But it presented itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Palumbo-Liu, who favored rescinding the award, is, however,
teaching ``Blu's Hanging,'' and the debate it spawned, in a course
this fall, ``Introduction to Asian-American Culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, organizers of the association's annual convention in
Philadelphia in March have scheduled a panel discussion, entitled
``The Politics of Culture After `Blu's Hanging,''' as well as what
is being billed as a ``megasession'' to explore the unwieldy issues
raised by the Yamanaka affair.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Less than four years ago, the Creative Artists
Agency, the most powerful talent agency in Hollywood, was left
shocked and orphaned when its leader and founder, Michael Ovitz,
abruptly quit to join the Walt Disney Co. as president. The widely
held belief in Hollywood was that the agency would lose its star
clients to rivals or splinter apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one of us had done a budget, really run a meeting _ I mean
we didn't know about taxes,'' recalled Bryan Lourd, now a managing
partner at Creative Artists. ``We made a list of clients whom we
assumed we would lose. It was a long list.''
</P>
<P>
   How Creative Artists overcame what rivals saw as a probable
fatal blow is a testament not only to the skills of its
relentlessly ambitious agents but to the failure of competitors to
step into the breach and, in some ways, to the systems created by
Ovitz and his partners there.
</P>
<P>
   Now the agency and its founder are locking horns. Two weeks ago,
Creative Artists startled the entertainment community by openly
attacking Ovitz and his new company, Artists Management Group, for
raiding such high-priced clients as Robin Williams. ``He has
betrayed the people closest to him,'' said Richard Lovett, the
38-year-old president of Creative Artists, who worked for years
under Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz said: ``I'm very unhappy this situation has occurred. I
love the company and the people in it. It's an unfortunate
situation for all parties because it's unnecessary for this to
occur.'' He added, ``Maybe it could have been handled better by
both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Creative Artists' battle to survive and its eventual clash with
Ovitz has overtones of a Greek drama, pitting young men against a
man whom they once considered a fearful father-figure, who began
the company in 1975 with four other agents. Ovitz's decision to
leave the agency suddenly in August 1995 _ following the earlier
departure of Ron Meyer, the agency's president, for a top job at
Universal Studios _ left Creative Artists in disarray and
vulnerable to rivals like International Creative Management and the
William Morris agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``For weeks beforehand, we asked him about rumors that he was
leaving, and he said, `How dare you not trust me?' '' Lourd
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz left the agency with a package that could exceed $60
million, a figure based on estimated revenue from deals the agency
made when he was running it.
</P>
<P>
   With his departure, the agency faced some urgent tasks. Lovett,
seated in the sleek, Japanese-style office formerly occupied by
Ovitz, said last week that the immediate problem had been to keep
agents, set up a business hierarchy and retain clients.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of agents visited the homes of clients, urging them, in
many cases, to give the agency three months to prove that the new
team was up to the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it was begging,'' acknowledged Lovett, a doctor's son
from Milwaukee who started in the mail room at Creative Artists in
1982 and now represents stars like Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Stars whom Meyer had handled, like Michael Douglas and Warren
Beatty, essentially said not to worry. The director Steven
Spielberg called the agency and said, ``I'm with you guys.'' Aaron
Spelling, the prolific television producer whose shows have reaped
huge sums for Creative Artists, also agreed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that in the years before their departures, Meyer and
Ovitz were often not directly involved in the handling of clients.
</P>
<P>
   What also worked to the agents' advantage was the system Ovitz
and his partners, including Meyer and Bill Haber, who ran the
television division, created. Other talent agencies are sometimes
riven by internal competitions, but Ovitz hired and trained agents
who not only worked in teams but shared information across the
entire agency. .
</P>
<P>
   In the early turmoil, some lucrative clients departed, among
them Kevin Costner, Whoopi Goldberg and Barbra Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   So did several top agents. Jay Moloney, whose clients included
the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, left for health reasons. DiCaprio also
left. Marty Adelstein, a TV agent, left to join the Endeavor
Agency, and took along some lucrative clients, including David E.
Kelley, the writer-producer of shows like ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The
Practice.'' Jack Rapke, who represented some top directors, joined
a company owned by Robert Zemeckis, the director.
</P>
<P>
   A transition group of about a dozen agents created the
management team led by Lovett. It included Lourd, 38, who
represents the director Mike Nichols and the actor Brad Pitt; Kevin
Huvane, 40, whose clients include Meryl Streep, Sandra Bullock,
Ralph Fiennes and Nicole Kidman; Rick Nicita, 52, David O'Connor,
40, and Lee Gabler, 58, the head of the television department.
There are no women in the agency's top leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The agents say that Ovitz's departure empowered them and also
helped diminish the Hollywood community's resentment of what many
viewed as Creative Artists' hard-edged tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the power and success of the company was perceived
to be about Michael, which created fear inside and outside of the
company,'' O'Connor said. ``A lot of people were afraid of him.
When that changed, a lot of the fear inside and outside the company
was taken out of the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   But resentment remains about the agency's sometimes bullying
tactics. Moreover, rival agents say that Creative Artists
consistently takes clients at the top of their game after other
agencies have nurtured them.
</P>
<P>
   Citing this, Gavin Polone, a former talent agent turned manager,
was one of the few in Hollywood to publicly criticize Creative
Artists for refusing to do business with Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that CAA would be so outraged by another
representative stealing their clients is absurd and hypocritical,''
Polone told The Hollywood Reporter, an industry publication, two
weeks ago. ``If you want to read the longest list of stolen
clients, look at CAA's list.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his office the other day, Polone refused to discuss
the matter further.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Nicita said he was unaware of any bullying by agents. He said
the criticism that Creative Artists skimmed the cream from other
agencies' client rosters was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure we have a lot of major stars,'' he said. ``But we have
people who weren't stars when they began at CAA. Tom Cruise began
at CAA maybe 17 years ago, before he was a star. Demi Moore was a
young actress in the pack. We've been with Matt Damon, Ben Affleck,
Claire Danes.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout continues. On Thursday night, Sandy Climan, a top
Creative Artists agent, said he was leaving, and agency executives
acknowledged that Climan's departure stemmed partly from his
disagreement with the agency's open declaration of war on Ovitz.
Climan, a longtime associate of Ovitz at the agency, said he had no
immediate plans.
</P>
<P>
   Most agents not only seem to agree on the agency's strategy
toward its founder, but say that threats and bullying are outdated
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has changed; the business has matured,'' Robert
Bookman, the top literary agent at Creative Artists, said. ``I
don't think `rule by fear' works any more.''

DISNEY-OWNED FIRM SUPPLIES CINEMA SPECTACLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- Four and a half weeks before
``Armageddon'' was due in theaters, The Walt Disney Co.'s top movie
executive and the movie's producer and director decided something
was missing from the action epic.
</P>
<P>
   They turned to a small company in suburban Simi Valley for help.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Dream Quest Images immediately began working seven
days a week to make the deadline for ``Armageddon,'' pressured by
the knowledge that the Bruce Willis-Ben Affleck action-adventure
was one of the most anticipated movies of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Four and a half weeks later, Paris was in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up with destroying Paris because of its emotional
impact and the fact that it's flat with recognizable monuments like
the Eiffel Tower,'' said Hoyt Yeatman, one of the visual effects
supervisors at Dream Quest Images.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, scenes of DQI-created Gallic devastation -- viewed over
the shoulders of a pair of gargoyles on the Notre Dame cathedral --
became a key part of the revamped ``Armageddon,'' which went on to
take in more dollars at the nation's box office than any other
movie released in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   DQI executives are particularly proud of having delivered such a
complicated package, which included computer-generated images,
pyrotechnics, modeling, sculpture and satellite mapping, in such a
short time frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part of DQI is that it's very diversified,'' said
Richard Hoover, another visual effects supervisor. ``We're not just
a computer graphics facility but a one-stop shop. We're trying to
do A-level work.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its ability to create never-before-seen special effects
and the fact that it's owned by Disney, which bought the firm for
an undisclosed amount, DQI is largely unknown outside of the
industry. Its 200 employees work in an anonymous business park just
off Highway 118 in Southern California's Ventura County; a Costco
warehouse sits nearby and is really the only thing that draws
traffic to the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry certainly knows DQI. It's already won Academy
Awards for special effects in ``The Abyss'' and ``Total Recall.''
And its creations in ``Armageddon'' and Disney's ``Mighty Joe
Young'' are under consideration for Oscars this year.
</P>
<P>
   (In fact, on Tuesday three of the seven semifinalists will be
named Oscar finalists. The others: ``Babe: Pig in the City,''
``Godzilla,'' ``Small Soldiers,'' ``The Truman Show'' and ``What
Dreams May Come.'')
</P>
<P>
   There's no sign of those past glories at DQI's headquarters,
which bristles with top-end computers including a network of 100
Silicon Graphics workstations along with stages for creating
digital characters out of little more than imagination.
</P>
<P>
   DQI is currently working on Disney's major summer live-action
movie, ``Inspector Gadget,'' along with several other Disney
projects. Yeatman estimated that about 85 percent of DQI's work is
for Disney but said his company is not automatically rewarded all
the effects work for Disney films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we're a Disney subsidiary, we're a company unto
itself,'' he said. ``People assume we're mandatorily given the
effects work on Disney movies but it's often up to the directors,
who may have past relationships with other houses. We have been
fortunate to stay very, very busy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy work. Hoover, who began working on ``Mighty Joe
Young'' in early 1996, noted that one of the stumbling blocks in
creating a believable 9-foot gorilla was capturing nuances of
performance and expressiveness. ``The slightest visual hitch will
shatter the illusion of reality,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, DQI programmers spent almost a year writing a
program that would give realistic movement to Joe's 3.5 million
hairs, along with creating facial animation systems and a
skin-shader technology for the parts not covered by fur. In all,
DQI created 23 computer-generated shots of digital Joe, including
climbing a Ferris wheel and smashing a Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outward absence of glitz and glamour, DQI has become
one of the world's half-dozen top players in the increasingly
important business of supplying jaw-dropping special effects to
Hollywood studios. That roster includes George Lucas' Industrial
Light &AMP; Magic, Sony's Imageworks, Rhythm &AMP; Hues, Digital Domain and
Cinesite; also gaining prominence are Pixar Animation and Pacific
Data Images for supplying the computer-generated insects in ``A
Bug's Life'' and ``Antz,'' respectively.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of ``boutique'' productions houses able to offer
low-ball services, though, there is a pervasive concern that a
shakeout is coming similar to that in 1997 when Boss Films closed
and Warner Bros. eliminated its digital effects department. Alarms
are constantly sounded about how tough it is to succeed in the
effects business as studios pull back on big-budget projects and
how a massive consolidation is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   It is clearly a high-stakes game. Special effects can help
deliver major box office, such as in ``Titanic'' or ``Armageddon,''
which generated about $80 million in profits for Disney. But having
special effects is no guarantee, as in ``Babe: Pig in the City,''
which cost $90 million to make but grossed only $18 million
domestically.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Atkin, executive director of the Sherman Oaks-based Visual
Effects Society, points out that producers have significantly more
choices nowadays with close to 300 houses in the United States and
an additional 100 overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that the golden age of visual effects has been
tempered by the equation having changed,'' Atkin said. ``Until
recently, demand always has exceeded the supply. But now the public
has become more sophisticated so that effects can no longer carry a
film and the novelty has worn off. So at the studio level, they're
not green-lighting as many big-effects movies as they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   But the betting among industry trackers is that DQI and most
other major players will remain a key ingredient in delivering
must-see, big-screen entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little guys can play the game of delivering the frames you
need for a scene at low cost but a large chunk of what producers
need is asset management -- that is, keeping track of all the
pieces, especially the ones that are being subcontracted out,''
said analyst Joseph Butt Jr. of Forrester Research in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Butt believes the next few years will be rough but robust. ``The
business is clearly here to stay because public acceptance of the
spectacle of visual effects in movies is here to stay,'' Butt said.
``The reason why it's difficult for studios right now to keep
funding special effects movies is that they still don't have
control over it. That's because they keep asking the industry to do
something they've never done before.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Disney, Sony and Lucas maintain their own special
effects operations, the analyst noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special effects have become a major factor in the cost
structure,'' he said. ``It used to be there were absolute technical
constraints, but now, anything is possible.''

 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ He is the other president with a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that he was one of the first presidents,'' Lon Beard,
10, said of George Washington during a visit to his 18th-century
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Lon's sister, Coral Krebs, 28, added, ``He's on the dollar
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Posterity is a rough game. After more than 200 years in the
public eye, George Washington has been boiled down to a fact and
some change.
</P>
<P>
   But the first president has his first-ever media and marketing
team. And 1999 is a campaign year: the year Washington goes for the
hearts of his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by stagnating attendance and a rocky recognition
factor, especially among schoolchildren, the directors of Mount
Vernon, the capital of George Washington's legacy, have inaugurated
a $3 million public relations campaign to reposition him as a
national figure with what the spinmasters might call ``heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Leonardo DiCaprio, Diana and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for something with a lot of sizzle,'' said
Michael Quinn, one of Washington's campaign men. ``He had great
name recognition, but not a real high quotient of excitement. Dull,
boring. He was the first president. Of course. So what?''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is ``Only in 1999,'' the name for a year of
celebration tagged to the bicentennial of Washington's death on
Dec. 14, 1799.
</P>
<P>
   In what scholars are afraid is a crowd-pleasing shift from
education to entertainment at historic sites, Mount Vernon's
advance guard has sent out 2,000 press kits and contacted 50,000
communities to encourage festivities that range from planting trees
to tolling bells.
</P>
<P>
   Two new Web sites and three new books, including his diaries,
will also help to establish Washington as First Guy: architect,
environmentalist, entrepreneur, fashion plate, both flawed and
fascinating. Robert Redford wants to make the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is already on the road with a blockbuster show,
``Treasures From Mount Vernon,'' parked at the New York Historical
Society until Feb. 22. His ivory teeth, if not his smile, have been
a great photo op.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, Presidents' Day, the day he must share with Lincoln,
he will be reintroduced at his home by the Potomac River. Mount
Vernon has added a new museum and refurnished the mansion with 100
objects owned by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A new ``Death and Funeral Procession Tour'' will provide black
armbands for visitors. The master bedroom will be set up as the
death scene, complete with blood-letting equipment used by
physicians who tried to save him from his sudden cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly a third of his blood was drained,'' said Sally
McDonough, manager of media relations at Mount Vernon. ``That took
us two days to figure out.'' There was discussion of piping in bad
smells, but consideration of the idea was put on hold because staff
historians could not agree on what would be authentic to the
period.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration will be capped by a televised 18th-century state
funeral on Dec. 18. ``We're going to try to make it feel like the
Diana funeral,'' said Melissa Groppel, manager of special events,
who is handling the hand-crafted coffin and costumed cortege.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's makeover comes not a sound bite too soon. Annual
attendance at Mount Vernon is far below its peak of 1.3 million
visitors, which was reached more than three decades ago. In a 1991
Gallup Poll, the last one that asked people whom they considered
the three greatest presidents, Washington's name came up in only 21
percent of the responses, lagging far behind Abraham Lincoln, John
F. Kennedy and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly every indication is that he's on a downward slide,''
said James Rees, the resident director of Mount Vernon. Even
Washington's appearance on the dollar bill, Rees said, is a mixed
blessing. ``It's the wrong image,'' he said. ``The family never
liked that Gilbert Stuart portrait. It shows him as a grubby old
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, which for
141 years has owned and operated Mount Vernon as a nonprofit
historic site, decided that they had to dust off the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've got a great product,'' said Claire Edwards, an
association member from Connecticut. ``This is somebody more than
the guy who sells cars on Presidents' Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The current image campaign, including a nose job to the famous
Jean Antoine Houdon bust, refining its profile, is a war George
Washington cannot afford to lose: Mount Vernon needs to boost its
attendance by 10 percent to cover its bicentennial costs.
</P>
<P>
   Behind its security gates, the neoclassical mansion, in stark
fields that overlook the river, is like a White House in exile.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, a squadron of geese threaded the sky above it.
Wild turkeys crossed the driveway of the brick colonial-style
administrative buildings. It was a brilliant blue day to meet the
president's generals.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, in what used to be the Ladies' Association's dormered
bedrooms, is the war office for Washington's campaign team. In a
nearby $1 million, 23,000-square-foot center, 375 volunteers will
be manning toll-free telephone lines to answer requests for
bicentennial materials.
</P>
<P>
   In his office, Rees recalls the results of focus groups
commissioned by Mount Vernon in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``They often floated back to Jefferson, as being so creative,
interesting,'' he said. Referring to the 1995 movie ``Jefferson in
Paris,'' and a 1997 television biography produced by Ken Burns,
Rees said, ``I think he's got better PR.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's people are sensitive about Jefferson and his
winning edge in the public's imagination. ``While Jefferson and
others were yip-yapping back and forth about the Declaration of
Independence, quite frankly, Washington's out there winning the
war,'' Rees said heatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, the director of programs, said: ``He's actually led one
of the more exciting lives you can imagine. And he's absolutely the
embodiment of a rags-to-riches story.'' Washington, a self-taught
surveyor with a modest income, rose to command the Continental Army
at 43 and was unanimously elected to be the first president at age
57. ``He's a victim of his own success,'' Quinn said. ``He made it
look too easy.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the tabloid taste for scandals, scholars agree there were
none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faults are attractive in today's world,'' said Rees, who would
be happy to deal with the kind of publicity that Sally Hemings, the
slave who may have borne Jefferson's child, brought to Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   With controversy and the Burns documentary providing extra draw,
Monticello received 560,000 visitors in 1997, an increase of 30,000
from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon also takes cues from Graceland, the Elvis Presley
mansion. It received 700,000 visitors last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep a close eye on Graceland,'' Rees said. ``We get some
people coming not because they're history buffs but because
Americans like to see where famous people live and eat.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The high interest in museum-going has not been shared by
historic homes, according to Museum News, an industry publication.
An estimated 117 million people visited history museums and
historical sites in 1997, but more than twice that number visited
art museums in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Washington, Jefferson and Madison were Monet, Picasso and
van Gogh, our attendance would skyrocket,'' said Rees.
</P>
<P>
   Who is today's improved, more competitive Washington?
</P>
<P>
   He is intelligent and inventive _ an architect. ``We're talking
Frank Lloyd Wright,'' said Dennis Pogue, who reconstructed
Washington's innovative design for a 16-sided barn at Mount Vernon
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He is an environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never chopped down the cherry tree,'' said Rees, ``though
frankly, I'd be happy with the myths now, if people could remember
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He has investment savvy _ he owned 70,000 acres of shrewdly
acquired land.
</P>
<P>
   He is human _ thin-skinned, quick-tempered. As an eligible
bachelor he had a crush on a married neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   John Riley, who is director of education and scholarship at the
White House Historical Association, and was previously Mount
Vernon's historian, cautioned about making Washington contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sea change for historic homes like Mount Vernon,''
Riley said. ``It's getting into character development, which can be
a tricky thing. Washington wouldn't have wanted to be thought like
everyone else, believe me. He was the leader of the nation. You did
not pat him on the back when you met him on the street. He was not
one of the guys.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hairline cracks in the revival of Times Square
are barely visible between the crews building Madame Tussaud's Wax
Museum, the Reuters tower and the Planet Hollywood Hotel, the
throbbing neon lights, and the millions of tourists coursing
through the crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   But there they are. After spending $14 million on construction
so far, the owner of the Sound Republic music club at Broadway and
43rd Street halted work. The lease is up for sale. The battered
Times Square Theater on 42nd Street remains vacant after years of
near hits with tenants like Livent, MTV and Marvel Mania. And at
the northern reaches of Times Square, the Comedy Nation theme
restaurant closed in January and David Copperfield's Magic
Underground has sat dark and unfinished for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   The vacant spaces and failed projects do not signal that Times
Square is about to return to a time when the area was awash in peep
shows, T-shirt shops and street corner hustlers. But real estate
brokers and store owners say it does show that in the euphoria
surrounding the new Times Square, landlords may have pushed rents
beyond what many retailers can pay. Old Navy, House of Blues and
GameWorks have all given up, at least for now, on finding an
affordable location.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is becoming clear that the pool of
entertainment tenants, which were supposed to bring the razzmatazz
back to Times Square, is more shallow than anticipated. Theme
restaurants are out of favor. It has gotten to the point where the
E-Walk Entertainment complex now under construction on 42nd Street
is negotiating a lease with a drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   Rents in Times Square have doubled and tripled in recent years,
to as much as $300 a square foot for prime, ground-floor space,
retail brokers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landlords have priced themselves out of the market in Times
Square,'' said one broker, Robert K. Futterman. ``Traditional
retailers like bookstores, restaurants and specialty clothing
stores can't afford them. And entertainment retail is still waiting
to be defined.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles B. Moss Jr., who owns a long strip of retail stores
along Broadway between 44th and 45th Streets, was so confident in
the rising value of the space and the billboards atop his building
that he rejected a $92 million deal to allow Random House to build
an office tower above his stores.
</P>
<P>
   Moss feared that the support columns for the tower would knock
out too much of his retail space. But Moss' deal with Rainforest
Cafe, the theme restaurant that has long sought a home in Times
Square, also fell apart. There is now more than 100,000 square feet
of space available in his building.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, the Official All Star Cafe is making money,
but its parent company, Planet Hollywood International, has decided
to shut down the chain, and has put the lease on the market. Planet
Hollywood has also stopped work on its latest venture, the Sound
Republic at 1501 Broadway. The Times Square and Liberty Theaters on
42nd Street are empty. It adds up to a lot of vacant space.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the growing pains of Times Square,'' said Ben Fox,
executive vice president of New Spectrum Realty Services. ``When
neighborhoods become combustible, rents skyrocket and invariably
there are failures. The area changes so quickly and so drastically
that it takes time to settle in.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   There are still plenty of bright spots in Times Square. Disney's
New Amsterdam Theater is sold out through the year. Douglas Durst's
4 Times Square office tower is to open in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   On the south side of 42nd Street near Eighth Avenue, the
developer Dan Ratner is finishing his 335,000-square-foot project
with Madame Tussaud's, a 25-screen multiplex and an HMV record
store. Across the street, Tishman Urban Development Corp. is
finishing its 200,000-square-foot E-Walk complex, which will house
a Loews movie theater, the Museum Company, Chevys Fresh Mex
restaurant and Broadway City, an arcade of virtual-reality games.
</P>
<P>
   Tishman's decision to negotiate a lease with a drugstore,
however, suggests that there are fewer of the interactive game
rooms, simulated rides and theme restaurants described a few years
ago by the advocates of a Times Square revival. Proposed theme
restaurants like Vegas and Marvel Mania did not materialize, nor
did Blue Zoo, a giant aquarium in which patrons could walk through
glass tunnels to view the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out that there are a fairly narrow number of
entertainment tenants,'' said John Livingston, president of Tishman
Urban Development. ``Theme restaurants are sinking fast. Besides
Disney, Sony and Universal, they don't really exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston contended that rents have not gotten out of hand.
Rather, he said, retailers are sometimes reluctant to shell out
money because they do not understand the explosive sales figures
that can be reached in a unique neighborhood through which tens of
millions of tourists and office workers stroll every year.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark days of 1992, when many storefronts sat empty and
the redevelopment of Times Square seemed more fiction than fact,
the Gap was the first major retailer to open a store in the area,
at the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Broadway. The clothing
store, which paid about $100 a square foot for its ground-floor
space, was an immediate hit with Japanese, Italian and German
visitors who still came to Times Square to take photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Still something of a pioneer in 1995, Virgin Entertainment
opened a 75,000-square-foot store in the Bertelsmann Building on
Broadway at 45th Street. The multilevel store, which reportedly has
sales of up to $1 million a week, was jammed from the beginning
with office workers and tourists alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we could have leased every block in Times
Square,'' said Michael Townsend, a senior vice president at Virgin.
``But we didn't have one ally who thought we were making the right
decision. Now it's the most successful media store in the country
in terms of sales volume.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Disney, MTV and Morgan Stanley moved in, Times Square
took off and rents rose to the point where, real estate executives
said, ABC's ``Good Morning America'' is paying roughly seven times
Virgin's $1.2 million-a-year rent for a ground-floor studio with
large windows at 1500 Broadway that is intended to help the program
compete with NBC's ``Today'' program, which has studios at
Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There're only so many widgets you can sell out of a store,''
Townsend said. ``Some of the landlords are reluctant to leave
anything on the table for the tenants. We may find that real estate
prices have outpaced the retail tenants' ability to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Even national retailers have found it hard to compete for the
best locations against the giant media companies. Old Navy, the
clothing chain, was only inches away from signing a lease at 1500
Broadway two years ago when ABC swept in to take all the available
space. At 4 Times Square, Nasdaq, the electronic stock market,
snapped up a prime spot for its marketing operations and the
largest sign in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theme restaurants and retail tenants can't compete with Nasdaq
and Disney,'' Futterman said. ``I've been spending time with T.J.
Maxx, Staples and Barnes &AMP; Noble. They can't afford to be in the
Times Square area.''

A HIGH-TECH CHALKBOARD PUTS PLAY IN MOTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; The play looks so simple on the computer screen. Because it is
a simple play.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant starts it by screening low for Eddie Jones, then
coming up to curl off Shaquille O'Neal's high-post screen. Derek
Fisher can either feed Bryant up high or feed Shaq as he rolls to
the basket.
</P>
<P>
   With animated X's and O's and circles with numbers connected by
dotted lines swirling with each click, the Coach's Edge Website
(http://www.coachsedge.com/) provides hours of basic strategy that
the average fan can easily take in and feel like part of the team
huddle.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has been using software from the Lawrence, Kan.-based
Premier Digital Sports Media Company the last few years on its
college basketball broadcasts, but at this site, it's accessible to
study, rerun and even print out.
</P>
<P>
   Every NBA team and most top college basketball squads have an
archive of plays drawn up by the Coach's Edge. For example, on
UCLA's interactive scouting report
(http://www.coachsedge.com/analysis/ basketball/ ncaabb/ reports/
mbb-ucla/index.html), a post play diagrammed for Dan Gadzuric is
first explained in text, then drawn with arrows and lines, then
actually played out with an animated ball passed from player to
player.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball isn't the only sport featured on the site, as motion
diagrams for plays in football, baseball, soccer, tennis, hockey,
NASCAR and golf, as well as women's sports are here. There's daily
scoreboards as well as links to teams in action.
</P>
<P>
   This site is not only a valuable learning tool, but it makes
available its publishing software that hundreds of schools already
use. Youth coaches who diagram plays on chalkboards or clipboards
will likely see this and never go back to the old tools.

WAS THE VICTORIA'S SECRET SHOW A WEB FAILURE? HARDLY.
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a fashion show is Webcast on the Internet and most people who
try to see it cannot, does it still make a splash? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   New-media case study: the flaunting of Victoria's Secret spring
collection, done live in Manhattan last Wednesday evening and
simulcast on line for the masses. The lingerie company, a unit of
Intimate Brands Inc., spent $1.5 million on one 30-second
television spot during the Super Bowl broadcast and $4 million
afterward to advertise the fashion show in newspapers
internationally, yielding a bonanza of ink, video, bits and
watercooler chat worth exponentially more.
</P>
<P>
   Some news reports focused not on the event's success but on the
fact that some of the millions of would-be viewers were closed out
of the World Wide Web site during the live show. There was also
much ado that many who did manage to establish contact received
audio and video that sputtered under the Web-surfing deluge.
</P>
<P>
   Critics chided both Victoria's Secret and Broadcast.com, the
company that delivered the event over the Internet, for not being
prepared for this flood of visitors to the site. They wrote the
whole thing off as one giant publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding! Publicity is exactly what Victoria's Secret wanted.
And it got the last laugh, orchestrating what might go down in the
textbooks as shrewd multimedia manipulation. The company reports
that a million people logged on to its Web site in the hours after
the spot appeared during the Super Bowl; a full two million turned
up on the day of the fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to be an example of the cross-media
``convergence'' that industry pundits have been breathlessly
promoting as a benefit of the Web, and which has happened only a
few times previously in the medium's short history. Few advertisers
using any other combination of media and subject matter could hope
to amass the kind of reach and frequency that Victoria's Secret did
with such a one-shot campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer about advertising per se or marketing per se,
but about branding, and using all this multi-dimensional media,''
said Allan Mottus, publisher of The Informationist, a beauty
industry newsletter. ``Fashion ain't Paris anymore, and it ain't
New York, and it's not Victoria's Secret's 800 stores. Now, every
household that has an Internet connection is a fashion store.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl spot, the newspaper ads and the Web site were the
work of Resource Marketing, an agency in Columbus, Ohio, with an
estimated $75 million a year in revenue; its other clients include
Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard and Netscape Communications.
</P>
<P>
   While those in marketing looked at the Victoria's Secret ploy
with awe or envy, people more interested in the Internet's
infrastructure expressed frustration over this latest example of
the continued shortcomings of the Web as a mass medium. Invariably,
each time a Web event draws huge crowds, some piece of technology
fails, leaving a certain number of would-be viewers in the dark and
giving the naysayers grounds to declare that the medium is not
ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret was not the only company caught by an
overwhelming response. Another first-time Super Bowl advertiser,
Hotjobs.com, was unprepared to accommodate the onslaught of
visitors drawn to its job-hunters' site after seeing its
commercial, a spot on which the company spent half of its annual
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And in another recent football-related example of a convergence
promise that went awry, ABC canceled promotions for a special Web
site offering player statistics and biographies and an online
play-along game during the Jan. 4 Fiesta Bowl, after the site
reached 100,000 users just minutes into the broadcast. Executives
at ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Co., later acknowledged that they
had no idea the offering would prove so popular.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who did manage to log on to the live Victoria's
Secret fashion show did not see anything near the video quality of
the glistening, bouncing, full-motion Super Bowl promotional spot.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Dadekian, a digital video consultant in New York, called
the Victoria's Secret Webcast a ``disservice'' to the state of the
Webcasting art. No Web organization, Dadekian said, can handle the
big numbers lured to the fashion show. And he also criticized the
fashion show's production values.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put dark pictures, a couple of spotlights, a
far-away camera, on the Web; it may look great for television, but
you can't do that for streaming video,'' he said, referring to live
video on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such fretting may miss the point. The Internet doesn't have an
endless capacity to accommodate every potential viewer of a live
show, as TV does. But aside from the occasional traffic jam, the
Internet can give viewers what they're looking for when they want
it. Now that the rubberneckers are gone, the shoppers _ and gawkers
_ can turn to the Victoria's site any time and see the show at
their convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret was able to reach customers in countries where
the company doesn't have stores or doesn't distribute the 350
million catalogs that it mails annually _ that's the value of the
Web. So are the company's early numbers indicating that men seem
more willing to buy on line than in Victoria's Secret stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to mimic television,'' said Mark Cuban,
president of Broadcast.com. ``If you wanted to buy television, you
would just buy television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't trying for perfection,'' he added. ``We were just
trying to help Victoria's Secret reach their goals. This is very
much a perception-and-momentum business, and all of a sudden
they're the talk of the industry.''

</P>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ King Hussein, the boy monarch who became a giant
in the struggle for peace in this turbulent region, died of cancer
Sunday, sending his country into profound grief and beckoning
leaders from around the world to mourn him.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, 63, had battled non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for seven
months. He was with his family in the King Hussein Medical Center
as they waited through his last hours.
</P>
<P>
   He had been unconscious since before he departed cancer
treatment at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic Thursday. For days, neither
his only remaining kidney or his liver had functioned. Finally,
despite assistance from a respirator, his heart gave way, at 11:43
a.m. Jordanian time.
</P>
<P>
   World leaders from U.S. President Bill Clinton and former
presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush were headed to
Amman Sunday night for Monday's funeral. British Prime Minister
Tony Blair had already arrived, as had several Arab world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Through 46 years as king, Hussein had seen his country through
the aftermath of the assassination of his grandfather, King
Abdullah, through invasions by Syria and Yasser Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization, and the loss of east Jerusalem in the 1967
war with Israel. He survived assassination attempts, and came to be
hailed as an international peacemaker after signing a peace treaty
with Israel in 1994, one that embittered other Arab states and many
of his own subjects.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a famous personal touch, meeting many of his 4.4
million subjects personally. Most Jordanians called Hussein
``father.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of his death came after an ominous reading of
the Koran on Jordanian television and radio. It set off shrieks
among the 1,500 people who had been keeping a vigil outside the
hospital. Some fainted, others tied black flags to their cars. Some
chanted and still others set out on mourning marches, ghostly
figures walking through the dense fog and carrying black flags.
</P>
<P>
   They were a cross-section of Jordan's diverse population --
Bedouins in red and white head scarves, Palestinians, Armenians and
Circassians, non-Arabs who migrated to Jordan from Asia in the
1800s, wearing woolen round hats.
</P>
<P>
   Circassians have traditionally filled the role as guards in
Hussein's palace. Though not a guard himself, Hifem Bitar(CQ) stood
vigil outside the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to be protecting him and now he died right in
front of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the rain soaked the city, stores closed their doors and
shutters for three days of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah, just hours before he was sworn in as the
new king, appeared on television from the office of his late
father. The 37-year-old first son was seated behind a large desk
with framed photographs of Hussein and Hussein's wife, Queen Noor,
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``May God have mercy on Hussein, the father, the brother, the
commander and the man,'' Abdullah said in Arabic. ``Hussein's soul
will remain with us and among us, and will not go away from our
hearts and souls, and we shall preserve Hussein's legacy in
building and in giving, with all loyalty and sincerity, for the
sake of Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is an army general who few thought would be king until
just a few weeks ago. For 34 years, his uncle Hassan had been crown
prince. But, in the last surprising move of his life, Hussein
removed Hassan from the job in January and put Abdullah in his
place.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, Abdullah had made his first important decree and
one with a decided nod to his father's legacy. He appointed
half-brother Prince Hamzah -- long-thought to be Hussein's favorite
son but at 18 years old too young to be king -- to be crown prince
and heir to the throne. Hamzah's mother is Hussein's fourth wife
and widow, American-born Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is considered competent but inexperienced. Educated in
the United States and England, he has a poor command of the
classical form of Arabic used in public oratory. His inexperience
will be put to the test as he tries to carry on his father's
policies -- in favor of peace with Israel, wary of Iraq's Saddam
Hussein but also wary of the sanctions that have crippled the
country that was once Jordan's biggest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
   Many say his greatest challenge and the greatest threat of
unrest comes from Jordan's disastrous economic condition, with
unemployment about 20 percent and interest rates above 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Just three hours after his father's death, Abdullah strode into
the Jordanian parliament wearing the traditional Bedoiun
red-and-white checkered head scarf. He paused, ramrod straight,
with fists clenched behind his back and feet together, while facing
a full-length portrait of his father. The several seconds he stared
at the painting seemed aimed at emphasizing what many are saying --
that Jordan is safe as long as someone from the bloodline of the
Hashemite dynasty, direct descendants of the Moslem prophet
Mohammad, is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear to God to uphold the constitution and be faithful to
the nation,'' Abdullah said, pressing one hand on the Koran. The
five-minute ceremony was punctuated by open sobbing from spectators
of the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan, the spurned prince, rode with Abdullah to the
parliament, but belatedly and barely joined the crowd in their
applause for the new king, the fourth in Jordan's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stability is the first pillar of this regime,'' said Jordanian
Sen. Mohammad Rasoul Kilani.
</P>
<P>
   Kilani, 65, saw Hussein's 1953 swearing in. He said he watched
Abdullah's coronation with ``sorrow and pain,'' because of
Hussein's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a feeling of love,'' he said. ``That is the important
thing, it is not that he is a ruler, it is love.''

 &HT;    Robinson powers into ARCA 200 second-place
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ It's not often that stock-car drivers take
three years off, during which they give birth to two children and
start an interior design business.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what Shawna Robinson of Charlotte did before entering
the Daytona ARCA 200 on Sunday at Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 34, walked away from racing in 1995 after five seasons
on the Busch Grand National Series. After a three-year layoff,
Robinson acquired a one-race contract just last week to drive the
No. 1 Chevrolet of Phoenix Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Robinson might find a long-term deal after finishing second
to Bobby Gerhart, who won the Daytona ARCA 200 after an accident
caused the final two laps to be run under a caution flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely could have won,'' Robinson said. ``No question
about it, I could have gotten around him. Once I got around the
third-place car, I knew there was no question I could win.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who became the first female to win a NASCAR
traveling-series race with a victory in the Dash series several
years ago, hopes to continue racing this season.
</P>
<P>
   And her competitors certainly aren't questioning her driving
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people were questioning her after being gone for so
long,'' said Bobby Hamilton, Jr., who finished third. ``She hung in
there. Man, she's a bad girl!''
</P>
<P>
   OOPS
</P>
<P>
   There were five caution flags covering 29 laps in the Daytona
ARCA 200, but no accident was stranger than the one involving Joe
Cooksey and the No. 51 Chevy, which didn't draw a yellow flag.
</P>
<P>
   During the 57th of 80 laps, Cooksey hit the Pontiac Grand Prix
pace car, which was apparently near the bottom of the track to
check for debris. The wreck sent pace car driver Jack Wallace, 53,
to nearby Halifax Medical Center for precautionary x-rays for a
stiff neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was following another car around and he either slowed down a
bunch or stopped,'' said Cooksey, of Centralia, Ill. ``I tried to
stop. I couldn't miss him. I'm just sorry that it happened. ...
This might be the first time in the history of racing that pace
car's been wiped out in an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   CHANGE OF LUCK
</P>
<P>
   The luck may be changing for Winston Cup veteran Rusty Wallace,
who had the fastest testing time here in January and an impressive
qualifying run for the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Wallace, who drew the pole for the Bud Shootout, was
put on the back row to start the race when he missed a mandatory
drivers' meeting before the Bud Shootout qualifer on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missing that drivers' introduction killed me,'' Wallace said.
``I've never done that in my life. I just assumed that it was
before the race and not the (qualifier). It's my own fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace finished seventh in the Shootout and collected $26,000,
while Kenny Irwin, who took over the pole, didn't lead a lap and
finished 10th.
</P>
<P>
   OIL IN YOUR EYE
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and several other drivers complained that Ken Schrader,
who finished second in the Shootout, had oil flying out of the back
of his No. 33 Chevy for the final eight laps. Several cars'
windshields were coated with oil following the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happened with the rear end because I saw oil going
everywhere,'' Wallace said. ``Kenny didn't know it happened because
he was racing his guts out. He just didn't know he was coating
everybody behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, who used his qualifying engine, said there wasn't
anything he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It messes everybody up,'' he said. ``It slicks the whole track
up. (The engine) wasn't going to go much longer, but it went long
enough. I was worried it was going to blow up.

 (Eds: Pa., Minn., Fla. ,  Ga.)  (ms) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If Donald C. Drake, one of the reigning masters
of narrative journalism, were writing this article, he would not
begin with this sentence. Drake, a writer and assistant
metropolitan editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer, would craft
something more like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``The 30 American men in the barren hotel dining room were weary
from jet lag and a sleepless trans-Atlantic crossing, but it didn't
matter because they were eager to get started.'' That is the way
Drake began eight days of 1,800-word daily chapters that he wrote
last fall on the quest of a group of American men for Russian and
Ukrainian brides.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, a reporter, Joy Powell, took six days to offer
readers of The Minneapolis Star Tribune a tale of immigrant
isolation, gang viciousness and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last few months, serial narratives _ examining a
handful of people on a quest or in a crisis _ have run in
newspapers like The Boston Globe and The Washington Post. In
December, the venerable Associated Press, home of the terse
700-word news article, offered clients a five-part narrative serial
about the harrowing rescue of some fishermen whose boat sank
underneath them in the Gulf of Alaska a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a bit of deja vu here. Serial storytelling,
the fictional variety, has been part of newspapering since
Victorian times, when American readers of Charles Dickens' ``Old
Curiosity Shop'' waited at the docks, as legend has it, calling to
new arrivals, ``What happened to Little Nell?'' (She died.)
Narrative has been central to society at least since Homer's Iliad.
More recently, narrative journalism found a home in Philadelphia in
the 1970s when Eugene L. Roberts Jr., The Inquirer's former editor,
remade that newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative series, with its close-up focus on individuals,
their trials and their emotions, is gaining converts but is not
welcome everywhere, according to Drake and Maxwell King, another
former editor of The Inquirer. In a reference to the columnist who
dominated American journalism for four decades, until the
mid-1960s, King said, ``Walter Lippman and the other reformers
drove an awful lot of stuff off the news pages, and narrative
journalism was part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not helped, King said, that some narrative journalism is
just bad. Skeptical editors, he said, ``make judgments about some
narrative journalism that isn't very well executed and say it isn't
news.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another problem. As any weary panelist judging entries
for a journalism award can attest, narrative journalism, as
practiced from Baltimore to Seattle, demands a large chunk of a
reader's time _ 20 to 30 minutes for each of four to eight
installments. But in focus groups, some people say they do not have
time to read newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest solution offered by narrative journalism's proponents
is to make each piece shorter _ a 1,100-word, five-minute read _
and let the narrative run for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One prototype for this approach is a 29-day series done by Mark
Bowden, a reporter at The Philadelphia Inquirer, under King's
aegis. The series, ``Blackhawk Down,'' recreated the October 1993
battle in Mogadishu, Somalia, during which two Marine helicopters
were shot down and 18 American soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The series was supplemented on The Inquirer's World Wide Web
site with audio clips from interviews, the soldiers' own pictures
and diaries and video clips from CNN and other archives. Bowden
responded to questions on line.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Musser, who produced the enhanced version of the series
on the Web site, said that at its peak the series drew tens of
thousands of people a day. Internet return addresses showed how the
cluster of interest spread from the Philadelphia area to Fort
Benning, Ga., where the Mogadishu units had been based, to the
Pentagon and to other cities whose newspapers picked up the series
off the news wire of Knight Ridder Inc., which owns The Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   The Inquirer made 3,000 copies of a CD-ROM containing the series
and the Web site enhancements. The disks were sold, along with
series reprints and a companion video.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder has set up a video production unit, KR Video, in
Philadelphia, where producers made an hourlong program out of
``Blackhawk Down.'' It was sold with the CD-ROM and was shown on
WHYY-TV, the local public television station, last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackhawk'' is not over yet. A book of the same name by Bowden
is being published next month by Grove-Atlantic. Movie rights have
been sold. In April, CNN is scheduled to run an account of the
battle, using Bowden's reporting. About 100 to 150 visitors a day
still visit the Web site (www.blackhawk.com).
</P>
<P>
   The Inquirer is showing that newspapers that publish narratives
can do themselves good, economically as well as journalistically.
But the very commercial success of a series like ``Blackhawk Down''
may make it a little suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Narratives may prop up sagging circulation figures, but are they
news? Or are they entertainment masquerading as news? Certainly, a
narrative series, with its close-in view of events and its emphasis
on emotion, informs readers in a very different way than a series
that exposes official wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigative journalists are more prosecutors than
storytellers,'' Drake said. Serials, by contrast, are a form of
soap opera. ``You get the readers involved with a character, so
they wonder what is going to happen,'' he said. ``It's looking at
news in a totally different way.''
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, he added, three-quarters of the editors he
has met when he was invited to discuss narrative journalism have
little or no interest in narrative serials.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Peter Clark, who teaches at the Poynter Institute, an
educational center for professional journalists in St. Petersburg,
Fla., has also been proselytizing, as well as writing serials.
``You could argue that all of television, including all of TV news,
is a serial narrative, a story of a set of familiar characters who
return and who we identify with,'' he said. ``Newspapers have
rightly reclaimed'' the form.
</P>
<P>
   But can those who embrace the form avoid the pitfalls of
irrelevance and hokiness? Can they really hold segments to 1,100
words? Since this article (which is about 1,100 words) began with
the opening sentence of Drake's serial on Russian brides, perhaps
it should close with the last sentence of that series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the hard work began.''

<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ In closely guarded talks at a 14th-century
chateau here, foreign negotiators are asking the ethnic Albanians
of Kosovo to accept less autonomy than they once had in exchange
for protection by NATO ground troops, a lawyer advising the ethnic
Albanians said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As the first serious business got under way at the Kosovo peace
conference, with the ethnic Albanians and Serbs huddling in
separate work rooms on different floors of the chateau, the shape
of the agreement the negotiators are aiming for began to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the draft accord is weaker in its political, defense
and economic parameters for Kosovo than the ethnic Albanians would
like. But the negotiators, led by an American diplomat, Christopher
Hill, hope that the ethnic Albanians will accept this in exchange
for the deployment of NATO troops, said Paul Williams, a former
State Department lawyer who is advising the 16-member ethnic
Albanian delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said it appeared that by offering Kosovo less status
than it had during the 1970s and 1980s, the United States, Europe
and Russia hoped to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia to accept NATO troops on his territory.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who in 1989 stripped Kosovo of its autonomy within
Yugoslavia and subordinated it to direct _ and repressive _ rule by
Serbia, opposes foreign soldiers as peacekeepers in Kosovo. He is
more likely to acquiesce if he still maintains some substantial
control over Kosovo during the three-year transition period that is
under discussion here, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who advised the Bosnian government delegation at the
talks in Dayton, Ohio, that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, said
that by not insisting on a stronger status for Kosovo and risking
the wrath of Milosevic, Washington appeared to be minimizing the
prospects of NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO agreed last week to bomb Serbian positions in Serbia and
Kosovo if Milosevic failed to accept broad autonomy for the
province, considered the birthplace of the Serbian nation, during
the scheduled two weeks of talks here.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning the authorization for NATO air strikes _ in which
American planes would take the dominant role _ the administration
has played down the likelihood of such strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has played up the probability of a NATO-led ground
force in which the United States, according to President Clinton,
would deploy a much smaller contingent than European countries.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Britain and France have offered about 14,000 troops for
a force of about 25,000. Germany is volunteering some 3,000, and
the United States 2,000 to 5,000. Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary _ the three former Soviet bloc nations who will join NATO
this spring _ are expected to take part in the force.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Paris and Brussels say the peacekeepers would most
likely be commanded by a British general, Sir Michael Jackson,
commander of NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Force, with a French
deputy under him and an American general commanding the U.S. force
under their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned in a speech over
the weekend that failure at the talks could result in ``wide-scale
violence'' and would jeopardize gains made in Bosnia, where
American troops are the largest contingent of a NATO-led
peacekeeping force that is commanded by an American.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-month-old conflict in Kosovo has pitted Serbian forces
against guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have garnered
the sympathy of much of the province's overwhelmingly ethnic
Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are seeking to retain control over the province; the
ethnic Albanians have been seeking independence, but appear
willing, in exchange for NATO troops, to consider an autonomy that
would lead to eventual independence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that after reading a draft agreement dated Feb. 2,
he concluded that the following elements were of concern for the
ethnic Albanians:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Serbian security police, which according to American and
other foreign officials has been involved in massacres of civilians
in Kosovo, would have to withdraw the bulk of its forces, but would
be allowed to leave 2,500 officers in the province.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yugoslav Army, which has provided crucial support to the
police in the conflict, would be allowed to leave 1,500 soldiers in
three garrisons to serve as guards patrolling the borders with
Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   _ The new 100-member legislative assembly envisioned for Kosovo
would have an ethnic Albanian leader, but the speaker would be a
Serb, who could prove to be inordinately obstructive to a
smooth-functioning body. Another provision, designed to protect
minority rights, would allow a majority of legislators from a
minority group in Kosovo _ for example, the Egyptians, the Gypsies
or the Serbs _ to block legislation if it was deemed of ``vital
interest'' to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kosovo would not have a central bank and would remain
dependent on Serbia to obtain foreign loans from such institutions
as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. When it was
autonomous in Tito's old Communist Yugoslavia, Kosovo had its own
central bank, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   On the judicial front, this Feb. 2 draft accord gave far less
authority than earlier drafts to the international war crimes
tribunal investigating massacres and other atrocities in Kosovo,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the latest version had been watered down so the parties
to the accord needed only to ``cooperate'' with the U.N. tribunal,
which is based in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Milosevic's Yugoslavia has broadly refused to cooperate
with the tribunal, insisting that it will try any war crimes
suspects itself and refusing to hand over three Yugoslav Army
officers indicted by the tribunal on charges of overseeing the
massacre of 261 people outside the town of Vukovar during the
Croatian war in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The document does not address what will happen after the
three-year transition period, or what Kosovo's final status may be.
The ethnic Albanians have called for a referendum to be held then,
but the Serbs oppose that because it would almost certainly lead to
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of these key points might allow Milosevic to sell a
Kosovo deal, Williams said. The Serbs' national myth is rooted in
Kosovo _ although few Serbs actually visit the impoverished
province, which is home to the most treasured Serbian Orthodox
monasteries and churches.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he had so far been barred from entering the
chateau and working alongside his clients. He has been in touch
sporadically by cellular phone, and is drafting positions on his
computer at a nearby hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The French Foreign Ministry initially had refused to allow the
advisers to the ethnic Albanians into the chateau, but relented
late Sunday and will let three of them into the chateau on Monday,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The other two advisers are Marshall Harris and Morton
Abramowitz, the former president of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   The outside expertise is essential to the ethnic Albanian
delegation, Williams said, because it does not include any lawyers
and has few members with international experience.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Serbian delegation is headed by Ratko Markovic,
an experienced government lawyer who helped draft the 1992 Serbian
constitution and is intimately familiar with the kind of legal and
diplomatic maneuvering that has been a hallmark of Milosevic's
rule.

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Jordan crowned a new king on Sunday after
Hussein bin Talal, ruler of the Hashemite Kingdom since 1952 and a
man admired around the world as a champion of peace, succumbed at
age 63 to the cancer that had ravaged him in his final days.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein died as his heart failed in an Amman hospital at
11:43 a.m., 48 hours after he had been flown home unconscious from
a clinic in the United States. The palace said it had been his
``persistent wish'' to die on Jordanian soil.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours, in a somber yet seamless succession, the late
king's eldest son, now King Abdullah bin Hussein, appeared on
television in his debut as Jordan's new monarch to console a nation
already in tears.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 37, Abdullah, until two weeks ago an army major
general, and still untested in the affairs of state, became the
fourth leader of this small but strategically vital 76-year-old
desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will preserve the course that Hussein set,'' Abdullah said,
as he announced his father's death, with an openness that is
unusual in the Middle East. He promised to maintain the legacy that
Hussein left after nearly a half-century on the throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hussein was a father, a brother, to each of you, the same as
he was my father,'' the new king said of the only leader most
Jordanians have ever known. ``Today, you are my brothers and
sisters, and with you, I find sympathy and condolences under God.''
</P>
<P>
   As his crown prince, he named his half-brother Hamzeh, 18, the
eldest son of Queen Noor, in a gesture that appeared intended at
least in part to solidify ranks within the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of genuine grief in Jordan, as people wept in the
streets, mosques sounded with readings of sacred verses from the
Koran, and mourners huddled in the rain outside the hospital where
the late king's body lay. In capitals around the globe, heads of
state paid tribute to the wisdom, courage and humility of a man
some called one of the great figures of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through good times and bad, through health and illness, he
showed the power of a strong will applied to a worthy cause,''
President Clinton said in a statement from Washington. Clinton said
he believed that the late king ``will smile on us one more time''
when the Middle East is finally at peace.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein is to be buried Monday on the grounds of Raghadan
Palace, in Amman, among royal tombs that also house the bodies of
his grandfather, King Abdullah I, who was Jordan's first ruler, and
King Talal, who ceded the throne when his son was a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   An extraordinary array of world leaders, past and present, was
heading to Jordan to attend the state funeral. The group included
Clinton and his wife, Hillary; Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain; and a host of Arab leaders including the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   From Israel, a delegation led by President Ezer Weizman will
also include Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and two former
premiers _ Shimon Peres and Yitzak Shamir _ to honor a neighbor
whose most lasting leap of faith may have been the peace he forged
with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   During a reign that lasted nearly 47 years, Hussein lost half
his kingdom to war with Israel in 1967, and he fought off coups and
assassination attempts. But he emerged through the decades as a
force for moderation in a region wracked by extremism _ often to
the dismay of fellow Arabs who were appalled by the public and
private overtures that finally brought peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, a sometime rival as well as a peace partner, called
the late king ``a courageous leader, a loyal friend, a maker of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by Arafat's Palestinian Authority said that
with the king's death ``we lost a leader of insight and enlightened
thinking.'' And President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the only other
Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel, praised the late
king for his ``bravery.''
</P>
<P>
   The passing of the king left Jordan in the hands of a young
monarch, Abdullah, who was thrust to prominence on Jan. 25. That
day, in what proved to be a brief return home after six months of
cancer treatment, the king named his son as crown prince, in place
of his own brother, Hassan, who had held the post for 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   That shift brought hints of discord within the royal court, and
it raised questions about whether a King Abdullah would be capable
of meeting the challenges of leadership in a country with a
troubled economy and worrying neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since, however, diplomats have said they have been
heartened by signs of maturity from the young ruler, and by his
strong signals that he intends to maintain his father's commitment
to a broader Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, in his public appearances, King Abdullah wore a
coal-black suit of mourning and a brilliant red keffiyeh headdress
_ reflecting the ties both to the West and to fellow Arabs that,
under Hussein, helped Jordan to play an important role.
</P>
<P>
   Until his appointment as crown prince, he had not figured highly
in speculation about which of Hussein's sons might one day assume
the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Saturday, as his father lay dying, he was invested by
Jordan's Parliament with the full powers of the monarchy. And on
Sunday, Abdullah offered a gesture of family unity. As he entered
the chambers of Jordan's Parliament, where he put his hand on the
Koran and read a single-sentence oath of allegiance, he was
accompanied by all other senior male members of the royal family,
including his 51-year-old uncle, Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   In a poignant moment, the new king paused as he approached the
podium, standing at full attention, his back to the audience,
before a full-length portrait that showed his father in military
dress as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   The designation of Hamzeh as the new crown prince and heir to
the throne is a departure from Hashemite tradition, in which a king
is succeeded by his eldest son. But it follows the example set by
his father in 1965, when he named Hassan as crown prince at a time
when Abdullah was just 3 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's son, Prince Hussein, is now only 4. But more
important to the decision, Jordanian analysts said, may have been
the wishes of King Hussein, who had treated Hamzeh as his personal
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Because Crown Prince Hamzeh, unlike King Abdullah, is a son of
Queen Noor, the late king's fourth and final wife, the choice will
almost certainly help to bond a royal family that has sometimes
displayed divided loyalties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Palace officials said that the queen and King Hussein's children
were all at his bedside at the time of his death. The king had
never regained consciousness since his return to Jordan on Friday
from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where doctors had
concluded that they could do no more in his battle against
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, the form of cancer that claimed his life.
</P>
<P>
   The king had been kept on a respirator, the palace officials
said, but progressive organ failure had already claimed his lungs,
liver and sole remaining kidney, and finally on Sunday morning it
stopped his heart and caused brain function to cease.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Cabinet met immediately to proclaim Abdullah as king,
and news of the death and the ascension was announced swiftly on
Jordanian television, which showed a portrait of the late king
draped with the country's flag. The news of the announcement was
preceded, as is customary in the Arab world, by readings from the
Koran, the Muslim holy book.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before Abdullah delivered his television
address, flanked by Jordanian flags and pictures of Hussein and of
Abdullah's wife, now Queen Rania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is God's judgment and God's will,'' Abdullah said. ``God
bless Hussein, the father, the brother, the commander and the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before he spoke, Jordanians had begun to pour out their
grief. First scores, then hundreds of people began arriving at the
locked gates of the King Hussein Medical Center, abandoning cars
behind police barriers blocks away and walking through chilling
rain to stand beneath the portrait of the late king.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd, a dark-skinned woman in traditional desert
dress sobbed uncontrollably, comforted by red-eyed strangers from
smart urban offices. The crowds swelled, and young men pumped fists
into the air, chanting ``Hussein! Hussein! Hussein!''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, all the usual radio and television
programming was replaced by the mournful chanting of sacred verses
from the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jordan had been steeled for this moment for days, if not
weeks, almost everyone here, from Cabinet ministers to Bedouin
shepherds, appeared to be in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, we did not believe that he would die,'' said
Muhammed Bahesh, a 24-year-old hotel clerk, his work clothes soaked
through to the skin. He had been standing outside the hospital
entrance for hours, in the chance that he would catch a glimpse of
the royal hearse leaving the closely guarded compound.
</P>
<P>
   He never did. Plans to transfer the king's body to his former
palace residence were deferred until early Monday. The government
announced that all offices would be closed for a week of national
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Official three-day mourning periods were announced, too, in
Egypt and Syria _ Arab neighbors that, in years past, have openly
called for the king's overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has remained a fierce critic of the king's peace with
Israel. But its government offered a conciliatory gesture on
Sunday, announcing that a referendum scheduled for Monday, in which
President Hafez al-Assad was to be elected to a fifth term in
office, would be postponed for two days.
</P>
<P>
   With scores of world leaders and other dignitaries heading to
Jordan for the funeral, analysts of Middle Eastern affairs will be
watching Arab delegations closely to see who attends and who does
not.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi delegation is to be headed by Crown Prince Abdullah,
whose presence will mark a fresh gesture of reconciliation toward
Jordan, which angered the Saudis in 1990 by siding with Baghdad on
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has since turned its back on the Baghdad government, but
Iraq, too, said it would send a high-level emissary, Vice President
Taha Mohieddin Ma'rouf. Syria, however, is expected to be
represented at a lower level, in what would be in part a protest at
the presence of the high-level Israeli delegation.

   As bad as Jeannie Buss' sire wants to BE Rodman and add the

so money would eventually be the sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   It's come to a point, though, where instead of turning down a
$610,000 stipend, Rodman should PAY the Lakers to join. Carmen

SERVE THE SALMON AND SEND IN THE CLOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case any waiters or waitresses in Seattle have missed the
good news, the seminar on food service has been extended into
April. Never again will they have to deliver lukewarm dishes to
disgruntled customers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they will first have to develop their skills in the
Frisbee toss, used to sail dessert plates halfway across a crowded
dining room.
</P>
<P>
   The food servers at Teatro Zinzanni have all mastered this art.
They can also run the 50-yard dash in under six seconds while
holding two poached salmon salads in each hand.
</P>
<P>
   They'd better run fast. The maitre d' is an ogre, capable of
melting a serving of baked Alaska with one indignant glance.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is difficult to separate the authentic food servers
from the circus clowns, jugglers and acrobats who simultaneously
perform in the 3{-hour dinner and show being performed near the
Seattle Center.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of fine dining in a tent during the damp darkness
of a Seattle winter did not appeal to me when it was first
advertised. And no matter how entertaining a Barcelona clown and
puppeteer may be, I would prefer that he not sit in my soup.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he didn't sit in the soup the night my wife and I
attended Teatro Zinzanni with tickets we received as Christmas
gifts. What the circus performers, singers, dancers and waiters
delivered instead was a terrific evening of entertainment and an
enjoyable meal in a Moulin Rouge setting.
</P>
<P>
   One note of warning. Bald-headed dinner patrons sitting in the
front row will find themselves at the epicenter of the hilarity
more often than Juliette the Dishwasher, stage name for French
circus clown Nathalie Tarlet.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the food service seminar comes too late to help
the careers of a few clowns you and I have encountered over the
years in Seattle restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   There was one gentleman employed in a New Orleans-style
restaurant that operated briefly in Pioneer Square. One night the
waiter delivered a dessert portion of Bananas Foster. He poured
banana liqueur over the top, touched it with a match and then raced
across the room to perform service at another table. By the time he
returned the dessert looked like a nuclear meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   He removed the puddle of ashes, apologized and delivered another
portion of Bananas Foster, only to repeat his earlier error. By
this time diners witnessing the twin disasters were falling out of
their chairs laughing.
</P>
<P>
   If he had waited a few years, the waiter might have been able to
earn a living torching a couple of hundred bananas a night at
Teatro Zinzanni.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of recipes that could be included if you
decide to stage a Zinzanni dinner party in your own home.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer Street Salmon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey
</P>
<P>
   2 salmon fillet portions
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons capers
</P>
<P>
   Mix the mustard and honey and divide over the tops of the
fillets. Cover an oven dish with a thin layer of water. Carefully
lay out the fish and bake, uncovered, in a 400-degree oven for
about 15 minutes. Remove to two plates, top with capers and this
serves two.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could let the salmon cool, divide it into four portion
and serve as a salad over dressed spinach leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a suitable soup course that used to be featured at a
wonderful French restaurant in Edmonds, Wash., where the food
servers rarely burst out of the kitchen at a full sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Chez Claude Soup
</P>
<P>
   2 large potatoes, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 leeks
</P>
<P>
   2 stalks celery
</P>
<P>
   1 onion
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot
</P>
<P>
   1 green pepper
</P>
<P>
   8 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup cream
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Fresh parsley, minced
</P>
<P>
   Chop the potatoes, leeks, celery, onion, carrot and green
pepper, then dump in a heavy saucepan. Cover with waxed paper and
``sweat'' the veggies for 8 minutes over medium-low heat.
</P>
<P>
   Throw away the waxed paper, add 8 cups of chicken stock to the
pan and simmer the soup until the vegetables are tender, about 35
minutes. Puree in a blender in batches, return to the pot and add
cream, plus salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls (it serves
eight) and sprinkle with parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to throw your own dinner party, all you have to do is find
four, six or eight clowns to invite. I know what you are going to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULLAMORE, Ireland _ On the scruffy edge of this drab midlands
town, in a peat bog area of central Ireland, Bridget McInerney, 35,
lives with her husband and seven children in a small trailer on a
muddy campsite of Irish nomads, formerly called by the disparaging
term tinkers, now politely called travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In the camp, set between a railroad track and a highway, she
begins her day lighting candles so she can see to boil hot water on
an old peat-burning iron stove. There is no electricity, no running
hot water and only two portable outdoor toilet boxes for about 50
people, most of them children.
</P>
<P>
   One portable shower was installed the other day, the first in
the 6-year-old camp where Mrs. McInerney said she expects to spend
the rest of her life. She is unable to take trips in the trailer to
visit relatives because, she said, the town would prevent her from
re-entering the illegal camp.
</P>
<P>
   Her children, looking well-scrubbed, played among piles of
cinders and rubble, laughing and shouting, running after an
outsider on a recent visit as if he were a Martian, or perhaps a
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Two tired-looking horses and an old-fashioned two-wheel
Gypsy-like cart were behind a wall. One of the old men in the camp
takes occasional trips in the horse cart, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McInerney is one of 40,000 travelers, in a population of
3.6 million _ Ireland's underclass, which despite a booming
economy, has a very hard time finding regular employment or
adequate campsite facilities along the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard,'' Mrs. McInerney said in the clipped accent
that identifies her as a traveler. ``When you get up in the morning
it's very dark. You have to light candles. It's very hard to keep
the children clean with all the dirt outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they're going to fix things up,'' she said of the
local council. ``But people are just prejudiced against
travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   As a traveler, she lives along the roads in conditions most
Irishmen and women would find unacceptable. Many traveler camps
have better conditions than this one, but about 2,000 travelers
live in unauthorized camps that lack normal facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The government in Dublin has ordered local councils to provide
adequate facilities in the next five years. But travelers view the
prospect with skepticism, suspecting that local officials will
always yield to anti-traveler pressure among voters.
</P>
<P>
   For at least 800 years, Mrs. McInerney's ancestors have traveled
the country's roads in horse carts, covered wagons and now in
car-towed trailers, making a living by doing odd jobs, selling
ornate handmade tin cups and dishes and cheap rugs and furniture,
and collecting and selling scrap metal. Years ago, they were seen
as colorful characters, the stuff of Irish folklore with a history
of going from castle to mansion house, fixing the pots and pans of
the settled gentry. They also had a reputation for seducing
farmers' wives and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   They began to roam after the Viking invasions. Shakespeare
described a drunken ``tinker,'' Christopher Sly, in ``The Taming of
the Shrew'' 400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The travelers still speak _ when strangers intrude _ the
language they invented, called shelta or gammon. They were a quaint
part of national life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are described by their supporters _ including former
President Mary Robinson, who is the U.N. High Commissioner for
Human Rights _ as victims of racism.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the government says it wants to help them, but
that is still not a high priority, the Irish Travelers Movement
asserts. Travelers' problems are rarely discussed in political
campaigns or in Parliament in Dublin, which has never had a
traveler member.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a traveler, Ellen Mongan, was elected to a local
council in County Galway. There have been no others elected in
Irish governments at any level, as travelers have no tradition of
political involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ireland is for human rights in everybody else's country,''
said David Joyce, a traveler who used to help his parents sell
cut-rate appliances door to door, and is now an official of the
Irish Travelers Movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish picture themselves as standing up for the little
guy, against apartheid in Africa. But Ireland never looked at
discrimination in its own back yard. It does not have an
anti-racist or anti-discrimination law like all other European
countries. So it cannot ratify the U.N. Convention for the
Elimination of Discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Joyce noted that many of his parents' customers suspected that
the goods were stolen. But he said the family got cheap goods by
buying them in Northern Ireland, where taxes and prices were lower.
</P>
<P>
   Although the travelers are mostly churchgoing Roman Catholics,
full-blooded Celts, as Irish as James Joyce or Sean O'Casey, many
other Irishmen and women privately call them ``knackers,'' meaning
lazy troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers are also widely accused of being dirty, pugnacious and
dishonest. They are blamed for most of the crime in areas where
they make camp with their battered caravans, which have replaced
the colorfully painted old covered wagons similar to those of
Gypsies, or Romany, of Central Europe, to whom they are not related
by blood.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Calley has five children and expects to live at the
Tullamore site for the rest of her life. ``They promise a lot,''
she said of Dublin's plans to help her. ``They're supposed to fix
things up. But it's mostly talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong. People is people. Travelers, settled people,
blacks, Chinese. But they say travelers keep their children dirty.
Whenever there's crime, travelers is blamed. But we can live
without their help.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the life expectancy of travelers is about 10 years
shorter than the national average of 72 years for men and 77 for
women.
</P>
<P>
   The current government has allocated about $15 million for
improving the hundreds of campsites, but about $7 million has not
been spent, mostly because of local opposition. ``Not in my back
yard'' _ is the motto in areas where travelers stop along the
roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you live in a house, after your housework is done,
there's nothing else to do,'' Mrs. Calley said. ``Here, there's
always something to keep you busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Willie, said the family survived on welfare
payments. ``They wouldn't give you a job,'' he added. ``If you went
to the pub, they wouldn't serve you.''
</P>
<P>
   In her trailer, probably worth only a few hundred dollars,
Mrs.McInerney said she and her friends knew some of the language of
the road, whose origin is uncertain. A man is ``feen,'' a girl
``lakeen,'' a baby ``goyha,'' a child ``sublai'' and travelers are
``minkiers.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her children are now allowed in the same classrooms as
children of settled families. But, she added, the settled children
are still being taught racism at home.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, she said, a 3-year-old nontraveler child in the
street near the school yelled at her and a friend, ``You're nothin'
_ only dirty knackers!''
</P>
<P>
   Why would someone teach a child to hate travelers? she was
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't a clue,'' she said.

   INDEPENDENT-COUNSEL (Undated) _ The Senate has been using
phrases such as ``end game'' as it prepares for a final vote this
week on articles of impeachment against President Clinton, but
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has made clear his game is far
from over. As Starr presses ahead with prosecutions _ possibly
including Clinton _ Congress must decide the fate of the
Independent Counsel Act, the Watergate-era law used to send Starr
in pursuit of the president.

   INDEPENDENT-COUNSEL-SIDE (Undated) _ Reforming the Independent
Counsel Act, which expires in June, is not a task to which members
of Congress look forward with eager anticipation. But one senior

<P>
   CONCEPCION DEL URUGUAY, Argentina _ The main north-south highway
running through Entre Rios, this languid, marshy province of
gauchos and cattle, is still clogged with trucks carrying
Brazilian, Paraguayan and Uruguayan license plates. Workers
continue widening the roads and improving bridges, suggesting a
limitless future tied to expanding international commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But dark clouds are looming ever larger just to the north, over
Brazil's economy, the main engine of the region's trade union,
known as Mercosur, which means so much to the 1.1 million people
who live in Entre Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no Argentine province has benefited more from Mercosur
than Entre Rios, mainly because of its excellent roads linking
Buenos Aires with Paraguay and Brazil and its three busy bridges
connecting Argentina with Uruguay. The province's unique position
is immediately apparent from the turn of a radio dial, where sambas
are interspersed with tangos, or at the truck stops on Route 14
where Brazilian drivers practice their broken Spanish over
Argentine steaks.
</P>
<P>
   But now rice and milk producers across Entre Rios are
complaining that Brazilian companies are beginning to break their
purchase contracts because they cannot pay their bills. Local
poultry managers are complaining that Brazilians are undercutting
them by selling cheaper chickens to supermarkets in Buenos Aires.
In response, local politicians are pressing the central government
to install trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole province is nervous,'' said Horacio Roca, president
of a local rice cooperative. ``If Brazil declines and Mercosur
falls, we have no future. We have no destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The international economic slowdown, which may grow deeper as a
result of Brazil's troubles, has slashed the price of local beef,
soy, fruit juice, cheese and wood in the last year. Low prices and
reduced demand led to the closing of a Nestle plant in Nogoya last
year, which made powdered milk. It left 120 people unemployed, and
local officials fear more plant closings in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brazil floated its currency, the real, last month, it
plummeted 40 percent, before reviving somewhat. The Brazilian
currency's fall is beginning to undercut competing Argentine
exports, particularly cars, steel, rice and fruit, since the
Argentine peso remains tightly pegged, one to one, with the strong
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina has made some modest policy changes in response, like
cutting taxes for exporters.
</P>
<P>
   But pressures are increasing from industrialists and opposition
politicians for President Carlos Saul Menem to raise tariffs on
Brazilian goods, a move that would jeopardize the dream of opening
a wide regional free-trade zone that would someday include all of
South America.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine officials recently handed Brazilian officials a list
of subsidies Brazilian exporters receive _ like tax breaks and
preferential foreign exchange rates _ that put Argentine producers
at a disadvantage. The Argentines said they wanted the subsidies
cut. Brazilian officials refused to make any commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine economic officials have put together a list of scores
of Brazilian goods for which import licenses may be required
beginning March 1 _ a bureaucratic device aimed at turning down the
faucet for Brazilian goods entering the country. Menem is expected
to use the list as leverage when he meets with President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso on Feb. 12 in order to cut Brazilian export
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could erect a wall or put barbed wires between the two
countries, or even dynamite bridges,'' Jorge Campbell, the
Argentine Foreign Ministry's top trade negotiator, jokingly told
with reporters recently. But he said the government preferred to
negotiate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay signed a treaty in
1991 aimed at creating a free-trade zone with no import bans or
quotas for local products, trade among the four countries has
climbed from $4 billion to more than $20 billion a year. A full 30
percent of Argentina's international trade is with Brazil, creating
a $1 billion in surplus for the Argentine trade account last year.
</P>
<P>
   With the opening of the regional trade union, Entre Rios farmers
decided to take advantage of their river wetlands to grow an
abundance of rice _ which is not a major ingredient in the
Argentine diet _ to serve Brazilian consumers who are big rice
eaters.
</P>
<P>
   Entre Rios now produces 55 percent of the Argentina's total rice
output. Rice represents much of the province's $600 million in
total annual exports, with two-thirds going to Brazil last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rice produced few jobs directly, but it generated soaring tax
revenues for the provincial and local governments, spurring an
expansion of local public universities, improvements in river ports
and the extension of telephone and electricity lines to the most
remote villages. A boom in seed processing plants, granaries and
silos produced thousands more construction and service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   With prices rising through the 1990s, rice looked like a winner
until Brazilian consumers began tightening their belts last year.
</P>
<P>
   Roca, the local rice cooperative president, said one of his
Brazilian buyers the other day canceled a $250,000 purchase even as
the order was being loaded on trucks destined for Brazil. The
purchaser, he said, apparently either ran out of credit or was
waiting for exchange rates to settle before he retrieves dollars to
complete the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm climbing the walls,'' Roca said.
</P>
<P>
   Local rice producers are planning to send delegations to
Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela and Costa Rica in search of new
markets. But one problem they will face is that Entre Rios rice,
whose grains were designed to be long and thin to be fried in
Brazilian dishes, may not satisfy other national tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Davrieu, vice president of the local Frepasa poultry
company, is bracing for a completely different trade problem, what
he calls ``the invasion of Brazilian chickens.'' He and other
producers have filed a formal dumping complaint with the
government, noting that Brazilian chicken parts sold in Buenos
Aires are already 20 percent cheaper than the production costs in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Due to stiffer Brazilian competition, he said, Frepasa last week
shelved plans to increase its work force to 480 workers from 460.
</P>
<P>
   The provincial government is trying to ameliorate the looming
crisis by pressing local banks to give rice growers more time to
pay their debts and by speeding up purchases of powdered milk for
public schools and hospitals. The opposition in the provincial
legislature, in Parana, is putting pressure the governor to send a
delegation to Peru to find new markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can try to prevent the illness from spreading,'' said
Victorio Firpo, Entre Rios' undersecretary of agricultural
development. ``But if the real keeps going from 1.80 to the dollar
to 2.00 to the dollar to 2.20 to the dollar from one day to the
next, we're dead.''

JOINT VENTURE   AIMS TO CREATE INTERNET WORLD WITHOUT WIRES 
(DW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., La., Canada)  By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In what is being billed as the next giant step in the
Internet revolution, the Motorola &UR;  &LR; Corp., the maker of wireless
communications products, and Cisco Systems &UR;  &LR; Inc., which provides
Internet equipment, plan to form an alliance that would build the
world's largest wireless Internet system.
</P>
<P>
   The project is the most ambitious effort yet to build a global
network that would enable businesses and consumers to have
high-speed Internet access to e-mail and faxes without the burden
of wires, cables or even walls.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is expected to be announced Monday at a cellular
telephone conference in New Orleans, makes Motorola and Cisco
Systems the latest communications and networking giants to join
forces in an attempt to capitalize on the increasing popularity of
the Internet and the rapid growth of wireless communications
products.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, several telecommunications companies have
announced plans to offer new services or upgrade their wireless
communications operations so that businesses and consumers may have
some access to the Internet. The AT&AMP;T Corp., for instance, already
is offering wireless service that taps into electronic mail and
Internet information.
</P>
<P>
   The race to transform communications through the Internetalso
has led to several giant mergers that could result in greater
wireless access. In June, Northern Telecom &UR;  &LR; Ltd. of Canada, one of
the largest makers of telecommunications gear, said it would
acquire Bay Networks Inc., a large data networking company. Just
last month, Lucent Technologies, the former research arm of AT&AMP;T,
announced its acquisition of Ascend Communications, a leading
provider of Internet equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the Microsoft &UR;  &LR; Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and
Qualcomm Inc., the wireless communications outfitter, also have
expressed an interest in developing products related to wireless
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a trend,'' said Roberta Wiggins, a wireless
communications analyst at the Yankee Group in Boston. ``People have
been saying: `There are all these people with cell phones and all
these people accessing the Internet, and at some point people are
going to put these two things together.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Wiggins and other analysts say that developing a
wireless system could be costly and cumbersome _ with competing and
incompatible systems trying to transmit bulky data and video into
wireless units _ officials at Motorola and Cisco say their vision
of a world where automobiles could get tuneups by wireless signals
and sales executives could obtain company information from a remote
place is just beyond the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This extends the Internet to a world without wires,'' said Don
Listwin, executive vice president at Cisco, based in San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four or five years, Motorola and Cisco say they
plan to invest more than $1 billion to create a system capable of
transmitting voice, data and video over existing cellular telephone
stations directly to wireless telephones, laptop computers and
other devices.
</P>
<P>
   The system would create a new line of products for Motorola, a
new generation of wireless networking gear for Cisco and perhaps
even signal the convergence of several existing communications
products, like pagers, cellular telephones, televisions, radios and
computers. ``The goal is that instead of having four or five
communication devices in your briefcase, you'll have one or two,''
said Doug Wills, a spokesman for Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies also plan to open four jount research and
development centers, two in the United States and two abroad.
</P>
<P>
   A critical piece of the puzzle, Motorola and Cisco say, is that
the wireless transmissions would be delivered using an Internet
Protocol platform that is compatible with all wireless formats.
Unlike analog or digital platforms, the companies say that the
Internet Protocol, or IP platform, will be able to effectively
deliver and bundle voice, data and video feeds through cellular
stations.
</P>
<P>
   What is novel about the effort, the companies say, is that they
plan to adopt an ``open'' standard. In other words, they plan to
create a wireless industry standard that could be adopted by any
company that wants to develop different or competing products. Such
an open standard, officials say, would be different from other
wireless Internet efforts now under development. The new IP
framework will be published this spring in a ``white paper,'' the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   For Motorola, which has stumbled of late in the world of
wireless communications, the deal with Cisco is an attempt to help
resurrect its reputation as an innovative company. After two years
of earnings shortfalls and market share losses tied to its line of
wireless telephones, Motorola has been on an aggressive path to new
wireless ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., and had sales
of $29 billion in 1998, has a huge stake in Iridium, a satellite
venture that offers voice and paging systems. In May, when sharp
cuts were being made in its work force, Motorola abandoned a plan
to spend $13 billion to build what it called its Internet in the
Sky project, a satellite network capable of delivering high-speed
data communications anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Motorola said it would invest about $750 million in
Teledesic, a low-orbit satellite venture that also intends to
deliver high-speed access to the Internet, beginning in 2003. The
new wireless venture with Cisco, officials at Motorola say, is
different but would be compatible with Iridium and Teledesic, which
was founded by William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, and
Craig McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, company officials say, they have hit upon a revolutionary
scheme. ``With this system you can get Internet information any
time, anywhere,'' said Bo Hedfors, senior vice president at
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   As for Cisco, executives say the new venture will strengthen its
move into the telecommunications equipment market, where it is
battling companies like Lucent and Nortel. By forming an alliance
with Motorola, Cisco _ which among other things sells networking
gear to telephone providers _ is staking out firmer ground in its
efforts to persuade global companies to use its equipment and the
Internet to transfer information.
</P>
<P>
   Though some analysts insist that Motorola and Cisco face many
hurdles in creating a wireless Internet system, including the
prospect of transmitting bulky video feeds over a wireless network,
the two companies say the framework they have outlined already has
won strong support from big telephone service providers like
Sprint, Nextel and Airtouch Communications.

IT'S TIME TO LET MIKE TYSON GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Mike Tyson and his handlers, his one-year jail sentence for
assaulting two men in Maryland is both tragic and costly. For the
rest of us, good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   We can feel compassion for Tyson. He's a bitter, unhappy man who
is certain society is out to get him. So the judge's decision
probably was no surprise to him.
</P>
<P>
   On a more practical level, his jail time _ which could increase
when an Indiana judge determines whether he violated the parole
conditions from his rape conviction _ will cost him his livelihood
if he can't fight again.
</P>
<P>
   God help him when he gets out.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it's not hard to imagine him drifting into poverty and
ending up back in jail before long as a result of his
uncontrollable rage.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go a frightening step further: Would anyone be terribly
surprised if Tyson met an untimely death as a result of his
behavior? Some of those who have followed his life and career
closely suspect it will happen. Tyson has even implied that he
believes it's a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sad story.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who linked themselves to Tyson in his
comeback from a year's suspension for biting the ears of Evander
Holyfield. Showtime, the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Shelly
Finkel and America Presents stand to lose millions if this is how
Tyson's boxing career ends.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime, perhaps with the help of the MGM, reportedly paid off
at least part of Tyson's $14 million debt to the IRS. Finkel,
Tyson's principal adviser, has spent countless hours as the primary
architect of his client's latest return to boxing.
</P>
<P>
   And America Presents is perhaps the biggest loser. The young
promotional firm, making its first foray into truly big-time
boxing, reportedly gave Tyson a $5 million loan to promote two
fights and was negotiating to extend the contract.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the above, it is indeed a sad story.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are those who continued to buy into Tyson's act in
spite of his insolence outside the ring and his faded skills in it.
His fight with Francois Botha last month drew a pay-per-view
audience of roughly 700,000, which pales when compared to his past
fights but is a healthy number.
</P>
<P>
   However, for the rest of us, it's time to let go.
</P>
<P>
   The act is old. At one time, in the middle and late '80s, he
could get away with acting like a monster outside the ring because
he resembled one in it. It was all part of his intriguing persona,
which captivated the world and terrified helpless opponents. That
was then. He evolved into no more than a disgusting thug when his
skills eroded. Now he's boring.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who saw the Botha fights KNOWS Tyson is not the
fighter he once was. He saved himself from an embarrassing loss and
possibly the end of his career with the one thing that never leaves
a big puncher _ his power.
</P>
<P>
   But boxing's most marketable commodity is now a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   The 700,000 was a disappointment. And with the novelty of his
return having worn off, experts were predicting that Tyson's next
bout _ set for April _ would be a pay-per-view disaster.
Predictions were as low as 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The public doesn't seem to be behind him in his legal troubles,
either. For example, more than 70 percent of those surveyed last
week by AOL believe the one-year sentence was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the public has had enough of him. And boxing has, too. It's
time to shift focus from an unfortunate sideshow to the real thing
as the sport begins to make the fights so many have waited so long
to see.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield and Lennox Lewis are set to meet in a heavyweight
title-unification bout on March 13 in New York's Madison Square
Garden. It's the most significant and compelling fight in years.
And Oscar De La Hoya will face Ike Quartey on Saturday in Las Vegas
in one of the biggest lower-division matchups possible.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that boxing has more than just Mike Tyson and his
sordid existence to offer.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, we should do two things: sincerely hope that
Tyson gets his life together . . . and move on.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: Heavyweight Lance Whitaker of Northridge
might be another of those who will pay a price for Tyson's jail
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The undefeated 6-foot-8, 250-pounder faces Lou Savarese on the
undercard of the David Reid-Laurent Boudouani fight on March 6 in
Atlantic City, N.J. Word had it that the winner of that fight would
face Tyson in a big-money matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Williams, who lives in Sherman Oaks, was another fighter
in the running to face Tyson. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic class of 1996 reportedly is 138-2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Flyweight Albert Guardado Jr. has both losses. He's 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the team already are world champions: Floyd
Mayweather and Fernando Vargas of Oxnard. A third, gold medalist
Reid, will join his teammates if he takes Boudouani's IBF junior
middleweight title. . . .
</P>
<P>
   IBF junior lightweight champ Robert Garcia of Oxnard could face
tough Angel Manfredy on the undercard of Mayweather's defense
against Goyo Vargas on April 17. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Felix Trinidad, who defends his IBF welterweight title against
Pernell Whitaker on Feb. 20, is optimistic a fight with De La Hoya
can be made.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, expressed doubts because of his
relationship with Don King, Trinidad's promoter. And the fact De La
Hoya fights for HBO while Trinidad fights for Showtime makes
negotiations difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad said the fact he was allowed to fight Whitaker on HBO
means anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``HBO is really interested in putting this fight together. I
don't see any impediment to making the fight everyone wants to
see,'' Trinidad said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya-Trinidad might be the most anticipated and lucrative
lower-division matchup the sport has to offer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Vargas will defend his IBF junior middleweight championship
against No. 13 contender Howard Clarke of England on the undercard
of the Holyfield-Lewis bout. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Michael Grant-Ahmad Abdin, Andrew Golota-Jesse Ferguson
doubleheader on Jan. 30 brought HBO's ``Boxing After Dark'' an 8.3
per cent television rating, one of the highest in the program's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of Grant, perhaps boxing's next great
heavyweight, is growing.

apathetic and miserable. In some scenes, my eyes are completely
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said she left California after the movie was finished, &LR; 
and went to live with her mother in Florida. ``All my pride was
gone. I had become this meek little creature. I didn't want to act

MERITS AND MOTIVES OF REBUKING CLINTON ARE ANGRILY DEBATED
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fast approaching the end of President Clinton's
impeachment trial, Senate Democrats on Sunday pressed for a
bipartisan rebuke of the president's misconduct after the
proceedings are over, but some Republicans challenged the
constitutionality of a censure and pledged to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's acquittal all but assured, Democrats in recent
days had quietly accelerated their efforts to coax Republicans to
support a reprimand that condemns the president's affair with
Monica Lewinsky. But the behind-the-scenes maneuvering Sunday
turned into a fiery rhetorical battleground on the television talk
shows as both sides clawed for advantage in the impeachment saga's
waning days.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused Democrats of pushing a weak slap on the
wrist that, they charged, was aimed at deflecting criticism that
the Democrats, who are almost all certain to vote for acquittal,
condone Clinton's misconduct with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really trying to do here, which is not unusual for
politicians, is be on both sides of the issue,'' Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, said on ``Meet the Press,'' the NBC News show. ``This
covering-your-fanny approach has constitutional costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats bristled at Gramm's accusation that they were putting
politics ahead of principle. ``Now, you may differ with me, but I
don't question your motivations,'' Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
who is the censure resolution's main author, said icily to Gramm on
the same program. ``Please don't question ours.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the House Republican prosecutors and White House
lawyers will have up to three hours to give closing arguments in
the nearly five-week-long trial. All 13 House managers are expected
to speak, with Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., wrapping up. Charles
F.C. Ruff, the White House counsel, will present the final defense
for the president.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, senators will begin their final deliberations, first
voting whether to suspend their rules and open that debate to
public viewing. Senators are expected to vote on the two articles,
perjury and obstruction of justice, by Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that senators want nothing to delay the drive down the
home stretch, their party leaders picked only two lawmakers, Sens.
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., to attend the
funeral of King Hussein of Jordan on Monday. At any other time, as
many as a dozen legislators would have represented the Senate at
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   While some Democrats predicted Sunday that neither the perjury
nor the obstruction of justice articles would receive a majority of
51, let alone the 67 votes needed for conviction, the perjury count
appeared to be in the most trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sen.r Richard C. Shelby, a conservative Alabama Republican,
predicted as many as 10 to 15 Republicans would vote against the
perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   Sen.r Susan Collins, R-Maine, said on CBS News' ``Face the
Nation'' that the president's ``grand jury testimony is replete
with lies, half-truths and evasions. But the legal test for perjury
is a difficult one to meet, and he seems to have navigated the
shoals of the perjury laws in a way that may allow him to avoid
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And almost every senator agrees that the remaining article _
charging Clinton with obstructing justice _ will fall short of the
two-thirds majority needed to convict him the president and remove
him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic support for Clinton is overwhelming, although one
influential Democrat, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, has left
open the possibility that he might vote to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who two weeks ago offered the motion asking senators to
dismiss the case against Clinton, said in a taped interview
broadcast Sunday on ABC News' ``This Week,'' that there is ``no
doubt about it in my mind'' that the charges against the president
rise to ``high crime and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very difficult to stand and say `not guilty,' very
difficult,'' Byrd said. ``Who's kidding whom here? I have to live
with myself. I have to live with my conscience. I have to live with
the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Byrd noted that Clinton had ``done a lot of good things''
for the country and had less than two years left in his final term.
Given that, Byrd said he was struggling to decide if the penalty _
removal from office _ fit the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is in the best interest of the nation?'' Byrd said.
``There has been such polarization, such a division among the
American people, and to remove him, does it help that?'' he said.
``Or does it make the wound deeper?''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, 81, is a leading authority on Senate traditions, and while
Republican and Democratic colleagues said Sunday they were
intrigued with his comments, no one said that they would change any
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The same confusion and conflicting views disturbing Byrd are
also fueling the debate over censuring the president.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tried to incorporate a tough condemnation of
Clinton's behavior as part of the impeachment record, but Democrats
said that was unconstitutional and refused to back the measure.
</P>
<P>
   So Republicans are now weighing whether to let the final
up-or-down votes be the last word on impeachment, which is Gramm's
preference, or join the Democratic resolution and avoid the
appearance that Clinton is walking away from the scandal with
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does help the Democrats,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky
Republican, said on ``Face the Nation.'' ``On the other hand, the
question is do you really want to leave this whole matter at the
end of this this week with an acquittal of the president when in my
view he committed perjury and obstructed justice.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said he might support a censure resolution, ``if it's
got pretty tough language in it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Mrs. Feinstein and Sen. Robert F. Bennett of Utah, the chief
Republican sponsor of a censure resolution, are trying to find a
formula that is tough enough to attract people like McConnell, but
not so harsh as to drive away Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One late draft criticized Clinton's misconduct as ``shameless,
reckless and indefensible,'' and concluded that the president
``gave false and misleading testimony and impeded the discovery of
evidence in judicial proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we can craft a statement that can come together in any
kind of cohesive numbers is still very much up in the air,''
Bennett said on ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The censure wording, which is still being revised, is not the
only hurdle. Any resolution would need a simple majority, 51 votes,
to pass. But in reality, censure supporters need at least 60 votes
to break a filibuster that Gramm has vowed to wage.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats warned they will make Republicans pay a steep
political price _ on top of the beating Republicans have taken in
the polls for their handling of impeachment _ if Gramm carries out
his threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a Republican continuation of this agony that
prevents me from getting at 10,000 laid-off steelworkers in West
Virginia,'' Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, said on
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Censure proponents want a vote on their resolution this week,
after the impeachment articles. Any censure would likely lose
support on both sides if they wait until after the Senate's
one-week break, which starts next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Even as senators argued over censure, they also faced a
difficult decision on whether to open their final deliberations.
Supporters say such a debate is too important to conduct behind
closed doors, but opponents say senators should deliberate in
private, like any other American jury.
</P>
<P>
   Suspending the rules to allow the open debate requires 67 votes,
and a leading Republican vote counter, and critic of the idea, Judd
Gregg of New Hampshire, said supporters were still about four votes
short. Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said that
unless Senate Majority Leader Trent Lottbacks the proposal, it will
likely lose. Lott is undecided.

 E-Trade Turns No-Trade Again For Half Hour  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The online trading system of Palo Alto's E-Trade crashed briefly
for the third consecutive day yesterday, further embarrassing a
company that styles itself the electronic brokerage industry's
technology leader.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  At least some customers couldn't get through to the stock
trading page on E-Trade's Internet site during a 29-minute period
beginning at 9:20 a.m. yesterday, E-Trade spokesman Jerry Gramaglia
said. That was shorter than the 21/2-hour disruption that affected
some customers Thursday or the blockage that affected all online
trading attempts for more than an hour on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Like the earlier outages, yesterday's problem was triggered by
an error in the computer code E-Trade added Tuesday night to
software in its computerized system for trading securities.
</P>
<P>
   Because not all of the firm's server computers _ the hardware at
the hubs of its network _ failed, engineers were able to restore
service to all customers by routing orders through equipment that
continued to function properly.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, E-Trade said it had fixed the problem by removing
the new computer code. But, in ways company official are at a loss
to explain, glitches keep popping up in the trading system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a smaller aftershock,'' Gramaglia said. ``Obviously,
we thought we had solved the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the major electronic brokers have suffered
breakdowns as buying and selling stocks online has exploded in
popularity. Most of the problems have involved getting through to
Internet sites strained beyond capacity.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, E-Trade's woes involve compatibility between newly
added computer code and its proprietary trading software, something
tougher to diagnose and, in some ways, to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book hasn't been written about this stuff,'' said Bill
Doyle, an analyst specializing in electronic financial services
with Forrester Research in Massachusetts. ``It's rapidly evolving,
all new, and many things aren't understood.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ETRADE06 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The breakdown is particularly humiliating for E-Trade, which is
known as a technology innovator. Early last year, the company put
in place a flexible network system in which server computers can be
plugged in as needed to handle system breakdowns or surges in
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers said systems crashes could hit any online
broker.
</P>
<P>
   To protect themselves, analysts said, investors who need
immediate access to the stock market should either set up accounts
with more than one electronic broker or do business with companies
like Waterhouse or Charles Schwab, which offer extensive telephone
and branch systems, as backups.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade has a telephone support system. But it wasn't designed
as a trading channel and has been swamped as online customers
flooded the company with calls.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the breakdown mainly affects active traders and
not those who trade sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a long-term investor, I don't know how much this
would affect you,'' said Frank Lallos, an analyst with Gomez
Advisors in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Investors probably don't have a legal claim against E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   A Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman declined to
comment specifically about E-Trade. He noted, though, that the
agency requires brokers only to make their ``best efforts'' to
execute trades, not to guarantee access.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, E-Trade said it would pay back clients who lost
money because they couldn't trade. The company keeps computer
records of log-in attempts that can be used to verify claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see what they were keying in and what they were looking
at,'' said Connie Dotson, who supervises service quality for the
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The company will adjust accounts, ``if there is data that
substantiates'' claims, Dotson said.

 Pottery Barn gives birth to kids' catalog  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
When four out of 12 top staffers at Pottery Barn got pregnant at
the same time, there was only one logical result: Pottery Barn
Kids.
</P>
<P>
   The home furnishings-maker, a division of San Francisco's
Williams-Sonoma Inc., last month released a test mailing of its
newest catalog, geared to newborns through children 12 years of
age.
</P>
<P>
   As the PB moms-to-be began decorating their nurseries, ``We
found there's really a hole in the market,'' said Laura Alber, vice
president of the PB catalog division, whose daughter, Samantha, was
born in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is showing you the way to furnish your kids' rooms like
Pottery Barn does for the rest of the house,'' said Alber in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   January's mailing of 1 million test catalogs was ``one of the
most successful things we've ever done,'' said Alber, who declined
to disclose sales numbers. ``We're planning the next mailing _ we
want to maximize the opportunity as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's other divisions include Williams-Sonoma and Hold
Everything, which like Pottery Barn operate both stores and
catalogs, and the catalog-only businesses Chambers and Gardener's
Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Pottery Barn has three factors in its favor, according to people
who follow the business: a loyal following of high-income
customers, relatively little competition in upper-end kids'
furnishings and a rising birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   After falling for six years (Baby Boomer child-bearing peaked in
1990), the U.S. birth rate turned up again in 1997 and 1998,
according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   To the benefit of upscale merchants like Pottery Barn, birth
rates among older moms, who typically have higher incomes, are
rising faster than births as a whole, according to the NCHS.
</P>
<P>
   Spending is growing even more. Sales of baby products jumped 26
percent in just four years, to $4.42 billion in 1997 from $3.5
billion in 1993, according to the Juvenile Furniture Association,
headquartered in Morristown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Market research consultant Brin Bell thinks Pottery Barn Kids
has a good chance of making a dent in the children's market.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel warm and fuzzy about Pottery Barn already because
they have decorated their houses that way,'' said Bell, a vice
president in the San Francisco office of Greenfield Online. ``So if
they can do the kids' room in the same style, and do all their
shopping in the same place, it makes life that much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be very surprised if this (catalog) is not successful,''
said David Ricci, a father and analyst with William Blair &AMP; Co.
``There's no one else doing interesting, proprietary, attractive
merchandise (for kids) on the upper end.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that kids' rooms today are devoid of beds and curtains
_ department stores, specialty stores and discounters like Wal-Mart
and Kids R Us all sell furnishings for little squirts.
</P>
<P>
   But the breadth of Pottery Barn's assortment is unique, said
Ricci, as is the merchandise itself. Ninety percent of it is
designed in-house.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items are scaled-down versions of Pottery Barn's
adult offerings, such as the Manhattan leather arm chair ($699 for
kids, $1,299 for adults).
</P>
<P>
   Others are kids only, such as a puppet theater ($89), a table
with a chalk board top ($249), hooded towels with dog and elephant
heads ($39), octopus-shaped bath sponges ($14 for two), a
strawberry-shaped rug ($79 and $199) and a pine armoire/computer
desk ($899).
</P>
<P>
   ``People really want natural materials for their children and
they want to buy brands they trust,'' said Alber. ``They want their
childrens' rooms to be whimsical and kidlike but still work with
their own personal style.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the adult catalog, complementary collections of PB Kids
merchandise _ curtains, carpets, beds and chests _ are displayed
together in perfect, sun-drenched settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pottery Barn is one of a small number of specialty retailers
that is changing the face of home furnishings by essentially mass
producing high style,'' said Matthew Fassler, a Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently, we see chains like Pottery Barn gaining (market)
share pretty consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassler estimates that Pottery Barn accounts for half of
Williams-Sonoma's total sales, up from 20 to 25 percent five years
ago. Pottery Barn operates 98 stores, compared to 166 for
Williams-Sonoma and 36 for Hold Everything.
</P>
<P>
   Alber said even she is surprised at parents' willingness to
shell out big bucks for merchandise that will be outgrown in a few
years. With the $699 chair, ``I thought God, that's a lot of money.
... But it is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the chair is constructed just like the adult one, with a
sturdy wooden frame instead of plastic and foam, ``I think it's
something people can pass down from generation to generation.''
</P>
<P>
   PB Kids is poised for growth since the first mailing was sent to
just 1 million of the 18 million households in Williams-Sonoma's
customer database, Alber noted.
</P>
<P>
   The next logical step, of course, is for the company to open
Pottery Barn Kids stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only a month into this now, so it's really early,'' to
start making plans, Alber said. ``But I think Pottery Barn Kids
stores would be great.''

 Exchange Merger Doubted  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A merger between the Pacific Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market
probably won't take place despite recent flirtatious comments by
both sides, top Pacific officials said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not impossible, but very improbable,'' Nasdaq Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Robert Greber said in an interview.
``Our energy must be focused instead on making us as competitive as
possible.``
</P>
<P>
   Greber and Pacific President Warren Langley said the San
Francisco exchange now expects to stay independent and find one or
more joint-venture partners to share the estimated $20 million to
$35 million cost of developing a new electronic system for trading
stock options.
</P>
<P>
   After the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the nation's largest
options market, canceled its pending merger with Pacific last
month, San Francisco exchange officials said Nasdaq was the logical
party for a full-blown merger.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Frank Zarb, CEO of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's parent, said he was open to merger
talks with Pacific, the No.3 U.S. options market. That fueled
speculation that a deal between the two organizations was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Greber said he later had friendly but inconclusive talks with
Zarb, which didn't lead to serious negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A Nasdaq spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq and Pacific said they held preliminary merger talks about
a year ago. The conversations ended when Nasdaq opted instead to
buy the American Stock Exchange, the second-largest U.S. options
market.
</P>
<P>
   Options trading on the Pacific Exchange follows the traditional
model in which brokers scream orders to dealers on a trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   That system is threatened by the development of electronic
systems in which orders are processed entirely by computer.
Recently, Palo Alto online broker E-Trade and several partners
announced a plan to open an all-electronic options exchange to
compete with traditional markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Exchange intends to counter electronic rivals by
adopting an electronic trading system for most options issues,
while preserving the floor-based system for the most heavily traded
options.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PACIFIC0 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``We believe a hybrid system is the one most likely to evolve,''
Greber said.
</P>
<P>
   Without a merger, the Pacific Exchange needs joint-venture
partners to supply the technology and share the cost of an
electronic system, Greber said.
</P>
<P>
   Greber said Pacific has talked to several potential
joint-venture partners, which he declined to identify. In general,
possible partners include options exchanges in the United States
and Europe as well as companies developing electronic trading
technology. The exchange still plans up to a $20 million expansion
and upgrade of its options trading floor in the Financial District.
And it said it is looking at ways tor restore its stock trading
operations to profitability by promoting a new electronic trading
system known as OptiMark.

JORDAN'S NEW KING REFLECTS HIS FATHER'S STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also JORDAN-RDP, JORDAN-ISRAEL, JORDAN-PEACE, JORDAN-NOOR) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ The first clear sighting most Jordanians had of
their new king came suddenly and dramatically last May, when gunmen
who had murdered an Iraqi diplomat and at least eleven others were
found hnled up outside town.
</P>
<P>
   With news cameras rolling, a squad of Kevlar-vested army
commandos assaulted the hideout, their tousled-haired leader
exchanging fire with the fugitives in a battle that left one of
them dead and the three others in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a Hollywood movie,'' said a Jordanian journalist
who covers this usually sleepy capital. ``We couldn't believe that
it was really him out there, risking his life.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon Jordanians saw a different side of the
former commander of the Jordanian Special Forces, as a somber,
dark-suited King Abdullah II took the oath of office as the fourth
ruler of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Seeming suddenly aged, and speaking stiffly in the formal Arabic
he famously has not mastered, the new monarch sought to reassure
them that he was confidently in charge, while at the same time
acknowledging the deep grief they felt at the death of his beloved
father.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, he was compared on Sunday to King Hussein, who in
his 47-year reign essentially created the modern state that King
Abdullah now rules. Jordanians noted that he shares his father's
trim, athletic bearing, and his huskily direct tone of voice. And
his first move as king was seen as both astute and popular, in the
Hussein style: the designation of his 18-year-old half-brother
Hamzeh as crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jordanians barely know their new king, while the man who
preceded him had been their unifying national symbol for half a
century. He remains in the still-unfocused popular view more
military man than statesman, more the daredevil older brother than
the benign but powerful father, a role Hussein played to
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   But like his father in his youth, the new king was seen before
his 1993 marriage as a kind of modern Victorian man of action, a
gentleman soldier who was an accomplished marksman, a helicopter
and jet-fighter pilot, a deep-sea scuba diver and an avid collector
of antique weaponry. As a bachelor he had a taste for fast cars,
winning the Jordanian National Rally one year, and, reputedly, the
lifestyle that often accompanies fast cars.
</P>
<P>
   But since his marriage to Princess Rania, a West Bank
Palestinian whose family had worked in Kuwait but fled to Jordan in
the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Abdullah has by all accounts been a
contented and private family man.
</P>
<P>
   He has kept himself and his family _ he has two children,
4-year-old Hussein and 2-year old Iman _ far from the public eye.
Even a few weeks before his sudden elevation to the throne, few
Jordanians would have recognized him in the street, despite his
brief moment of televised derring-do last year.
</P>
<P>
   A product of elite British and American schooling, he went to
Deerfield Academy in Amherst, Mass., and the British military
academy at Sandhurst, and took yearlong course in international
studies at Oxford and Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, he said he had anticipated continuing his
life as a career military man, handling internal security matters
and strategic relationships with foreign allies.
</P>
<P>
   As Jordan's top counterterrorism specialist and a one-time troop
leader with Britain's fabled Royal Hussars, he clearly enjoys his
association with others in the close-knit Western military world of
special-forces professionals. ``I have a lot of good friends in the
Pentagon,'' he says, and he has enjoyed ``the honor and the
privilege'' of collaborating closely with his counterparts in
Israel's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Within the palace, friends say, he had a reputation as a family
peacemaker, an attentive uncle, and a fierce protector of his
father's interests. ``I always felt that it would be a great honor
for me to work behind the scenes for my father and my family,'' he
has said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also says now that his father had been talking to the
family since at least 1992 about reverting the line of succession
to his own descendants. But though he was the eldest of the king's
four sons, he said he did not anticipate being named himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This took me slightly by surprise,'' he said with a wry smile
of understatement. He said he was told of the decision by his
father just one day before the public announcement two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran palace observers say Abdullah did have every reason to
be surprised by the sudden turn of events. Had Hussein's health
deteriorated to the point of incapacitation just six months ago,
there was little question that his duties and eventually his throne
would have been assumed by then-Crown Prince Hassan, the late
king's younger brother, who had served as the constitutionally
designated heir since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   And had the 63-year-old king lived for another 10 or 15 years,
as his family expected the vigorous monarch would, the widespread
assumption was that the succession would revert to the king's sons
but not to Abdullah. Observers anticipated a battle for the
father's loyalties between Prince Hamzeh, the new crown prince, and
Prince Ali, the eldest son of Queen Alia, a widely beloved
Palestinian who died in a 1977 helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet until he was 3, Abdullah had been the crown prince of
Jordan. He was the designated and logical heir in a dynasty that
traced its lineage through 43 previous generations of eldest sons
to the prophet Mohammed. But Middle East turbulence and rumored
murder plots persuaded his father _ who had witnessed the 1951
assassination of his grandfather that propelled him to the throne a
year later _ to place his younger brother, Prince Hassan, in the
line of succession.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Welcomed in the region as politically prudent, the designation
of Hassan as crown prince was also favored by conservative
Jordanians who were uneasy at the prospect of a British Christian's
son sitting on the Hashemite throne, the traditional protector of
the holy sites of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is Hussein's eldest son, from his English-born second
wife, Toni Gardiner, who was divorced from the king in 1972. Prince
Hamzeh is the eldest son of Hussein's widow, Queen Noor, who had
made little secret of her desire to have him one day head the
Hashemite dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   But as a career military officer for 18 years, Abdullah has the
army's unquestioned allegiance, as one of their own. He has climbed
the ranks to major general without conspicuous favoritism. And for
a political novice, he shows some early signs of deftness, and an
easy common touch.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment of Hamzeh as crown prince was a sign that
Abdullah had placed the highest priority on the healing of real or
perceived rifts within the royal family, divisions that some
Jordanians believed had posed real potential risks to the country's
political stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be great,'' predicted Judith Kipper, a Middle Eastern
specialist at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York, who has
known the new king for years. ``He is confident, he is smart, he is
extremely well educated, and he shares his father's commitment to
peace. And he is not nearly as shy as his father.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow mixed with a bit of rain and sleet near the immediate East
coast will gradually end from New Jersey to southern New England as
low pressure moves out to sea south of Cape Cod. Additional
accumulations of an inch or two will occur in some locations Monday
morning. Drier air will spread south bringing sunshine to northern
New England and the eastern Great Lakes as high pressure over
eastern Canada exerts its influence. Afternoon temperatures will be
near seasonal values.
</P>
<P>
   Mild and dry weather will cover the Southeastern states.
Sunshine will be plentiful over most interior sections and in
Florida. Clouds will be mixed with sunshine in the warm and humid
air near the central and western Gulf of Mexico coast.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably warm air will spread from Texas and the western
Plains into the Middle West. Afternoon temperatures will average 15
to 25 degrees above normal over a large area from the southern
Plains to the central and northern Mississippi Valley. Sunshine
will be ample in most areas, however, clouds with patchy rain and
snow showers will accompany the arrival of the mild air over the
northwestern Great Lakes states.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a series of fronts will sweep inland from the
Northwest coast. Locally heavy rain and mountain snow will occur
from the southern Cascades to northern California. Farther north,
showery coastal rain and intermittent mountain snow will prevail.
Snow will also fall along west-facing slopes of the central Rockies
as a steady, moist flow from over the Pacific impinges upon the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Moisture Message &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several record-high minimums were set in Texas and Oklahoma on
Saturday. The mercury only reached 67 degrees for a low in San
Antonio and Austin. This unusual warmth at night was a tip-off to
the large moisture supply available to a disturbance migrating
across the southern Plains. Indeed, it is usually thick clouds or
gusty winds that keep nighttime readings well above normal. The
deep moisture, when condensed into tall rain clouds, added warmth
to the atmosphere, which intensified the storm and made its
circulation and influence considerably larger than originally
anticipated. &QL;

ONCE DERIDED, NOOR IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A POWER   IN JORDAN

 By DOUGLAS JEHL

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ For more than 20 years, she was his wife and
confidante, an American-born beauty who became a Jordanian queen.
And even with the death of King Hussein, no one here is expecting
Queen Noor to go away. At age 47, she is now the honored widow of a
monarch whose family includes his 11 children, by four wives.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor was at the king's side throughout his illness and is
said to have been a buoying force as family members gathered around
his hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   And as the king lay dying, she won hearts here by venturing into
the rain on Saturday evening, her head covered modestly in white
chiffon, to circulate outside the hospital gates _ the widow-to-be
comforting the bereaved.
</P>
<P>
   It was a graceful gesture from the queen, who has been a target
of sniping in the past but whose strength and warmth have recently
won her increasing affection, and who is now seen as likely to
endure as an important voice behind the Jordanian throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a Jordanian standing there with her fellow Jordanians,
sharing the moment and her emotion and feeling,'' said Sima Bahouf,
who has worked closely with the queen since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor was not seen in public Sunday. She had rarely left
her husband's side during his treatment for cancer over the last
six months, and her confidantes said she was grieving in private.
</P>
<P>
   But she is expected to be on center stage at her husband's
funeral on Monday, and she won praise from Washington Sunday as
President Clinton, a good friend, called her ``a daughter of
America and a queen of Jordan who had ``made two nations very
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The new king, Abdullah, is not Queen Noor's son. He was born to
Princess Muna, the king's second wife. Queen Noor's own eldest son,
Hamzeh, 18, was passed over last month when the king appointed a
new heir.
</P>
<P>
   But in an arrangement that many here believe was a parting gift
from the late king, an enduring role for her family line was
cemented Sunday when King Abdullah named Hamzeh as his crown
prince.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's widow was born Lisa Najeeb Halaby to a Christian
Arab-American family and raised in Washington, D.C. She took the
name Noor al-Hussein _ the light of Hussein _ when she converted to
Islam and married the king on June 15, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The queen quickly became a warm stepmother to two of the king's
children, Prince Ali and Princess Haya, the children of the king
and his previous wife, Queen Alia, who died in a helicopter crash
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor and the king have had four children of their own, two
boys and two girls, beginning with Prince Hamzeh, who was born in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   But the queen has not always been regarded with favor at home. A
1974 graduate of Princeton University, she has been an outspoken
advocate for women's rights, economic development and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
   She has been seen by some Jordanians as too ambitious, too
forceful and too foreign to be queen in what is a very conservative
society.
</P>
<P>
   She shocked some Jordanians several years ago when she posed for
a magazine photograph with her husband on one of the king's
Harley-Davidson motorcycles. More recently, during the internal
palace jockeying over who would succeed the king, she was subjected
to particularly harsh barbs from people close to the king's
brother, Hassan, who was then the crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   But her associates say she has tried to turn a deaf ear to
criticism from people who saw her and her son as Hassan's rivals,
recognizing as one of them put it, that, ``If you want to attack a
man in the Middle East, then the easiest target is his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   And in his last public statement, the angry Jan. 25 letter that
dismissed Hassan as crown prince, the king offered an eloquent
testimonial to a wife he said had been the target of baseless
criticism, calling her ``a Jordanian who belongs to this country
with every fiber of her being.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no constitutional place for the king's widow within
Jordan's monarchical system, but there is precedent for a powerful
role. After Hussein himself was crowned in 1952, at age 16, his
mother, Queen Zein, was a major force for well over a decade,
advising her son as he matured as a statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor almost certainly has more political experience than
Abdullah, a career soldier. She has served as a roving ambassador
for Jordan, and was a frequent visitor to the White House at the
king's side.
</P>
<P>
   Well-connected Jordanians say they believe the new king may well
turn to Queen Noor as a unifying source of institutional memory and
as someone who can help to solidify a royal family that otherwise
might find itself divided.

 &HT;    Martin takes Shootout after Gordon mistake
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Even the great ones occasionally make
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon overran his
pit stall during the mandatory two-tire pit stop of Sunday's Bud
Shootout, allowing Mark Martin to capture his first career victory
at Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, leading the 25-lap race when the 14 remaining cars
pulled into pit road during the 10th lap, stopped past the front
line of the 22-foot stall.
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon's Rainbow Warriors pit crew didn't push the car back
immediately, he drew a one-lap penalty from NASCAR officials and
pulled out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've really got to go for it,'' Gordon said. ``You've got to
get everything you can. I just carried a little bit too much speed
to pit road, and then I overheated the brakes trying to get it
slowed down. I just couldn't slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Evernham, Gordon's crew chief, said he thought his driver's
error would draw only a 15-second penalty, in which the pit crew
would have been sent back over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff just overshot the line,'' Evernham said. ``It was over
the line. The car was over the line the whole time. The crew should
have pushed him back. You can't make a mistake, and then compound
it with a second mistake, and expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, second behind Gordon in points last season, moved from
fifth to first off pit road and led the final 16 laps to collect
the $108,000 winner's purse. He held off a late threat from veteran
Ken Schrader, who finished second in the No. 33 Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte and the No. 18 Pontiac rebounded from a
disappointing Daytona 500 qualifying run to finish third.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's miscue was the second error that helped Martin get to
victory lane. Rusty Wallace, who drew the pole position for the
Shootout on Thursday, was bumped to the back row to start the race
after missing a mandatory drivers meeting on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deal with `what ifs' much, I'm that realist fellow,''
Martin said. ``The reality is that we didn't win the championship
last year, even though we tried, and (Gordon) didn't win the Bud
Shootout this year, even though he did try. That's the reality of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon holds the pole for the Daytona 500, but he was steaming
after another disappointing Shootout.

SEEKING AN EDGE IN 2000, SOME REPUBLICANS FOCUS ON TERM-LIMIT
PLEDGES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Fla., Wash., N.Y., Iowa)  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans, desperate to save their slim
congressional majority in the elections two years away, are urging
the Republicans who promised to limit their terms until 2000 to
renege on their pledges and seek re-election anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine House Republicans who pledged that 1998 would be
their last elections. Six of those are expected to retire.
Republican leaders, who never supported such term limits, want the
remaining three to run for re-election on the well-founded theory
that incumbents tend to win re-election _ though that could be
sorely tested if they break such a high-profile promise to voters.
</P>
<P>
   The three are Reps. Tillie Fowler of Florida, Scott McInnis of
Colorado and George Nethercutt of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to encourage them to back out of pledge,'' said a
top Republican aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping these three members is part of a wider strategy by
Republicans to hold on to every seat they can. They also are trying
to convince some Democrats to switch parties, although an initial
sweep of a handful of potential defectors has come up empty.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to line up early Democratic support for their
showcase bills so that they can point to a list of legislative
accomplishments to impress voters in 2000. It was the lack of an
agenda, and the preoccupation with impeachment, that cost
Republicans dearly at the polls in November.
</P>
<P>
   All of these measures demonstrate how fierce the fight for
control of the House is going to be. Since the Republicans won
control in 1994, they have only lost seats, and they now hold one
of the slimmest majorities in modern times, 222 seats, compared
with 211 Democrats. There is one independent and one vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the Republicans' electoral woes is the prospect that
they may face a heavy round of retirements before the next
election. When they took power in 1994, Republicans limited their
committee chairmen to three terms. When these members lose their
chairmanships, some may decide to retire from Congress altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee, already have announced their retirement. Others,
including Reps. Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, chairman of the
International Relations Committee, and Jim Leach of Iowa, chairman
of the Banking Committee, could follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they decide to go, that's where we start to get in
trouble,'' said a key Republican House strategist. ``We will need a
few of their guys in the South to retire,'' he said, referring to
Democrats who represent conservative Southern districts.
</P>
<P>
   At a closed-door retreat in Virginia last weekend, Republican
leaders laid out a grim scenario that culminated with the party's
loss of the House in 2000. Leading the Republican effort to keep
the House is Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, the new chairman
of the National Republican Congressional Committee, who is pushing
members to raise more money and help recruit strong candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., who announced last week that he
would forgo a run for president and instead oversee a drive to
recapture the House for the Democrats, said he was optimistic
chiefly because of the open seats that will be created in 2000 by
Republicans who have limited their terms.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Democrat, Rep. Martin T. Meehan of Massachusetts,
pledged not to run again in 2000, and he is considering reneging on
his pledge too. But Republicans will lose at least six members to
term limits, and up to nine if everyone sticks to their pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three Republicans reconsidering their pledges, McInnis
most clearly has indicated that he will run for re-election. He has
said that he did not realize that members of Congress gained power
through seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt, who deposed former Speaker Tom Foley, largely on the
strength of his advocacy for term limits, says he now understands
that the issues Congress handles are so complex that six years ``is
probably not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He has not made a final decision, nor has Ms. Fowler. She glided
to re-election last year with no Democratic challenger and was
recently elected to a leadership post within the Republican
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat, Meehan, has not made a final decision either,
though he recently said that ``arbitrarily'' limiting his terms was
a mistake. Meehan is identified with legislation that would
overhaul the way campaigns are financed and his aides have said
that the legislation faces a better chance of passage if Democrats
recapture the House. Democratic leadership aides said there had
been no effort by party leaders to persuade Meehan to break his
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as one party controls the House with just a handful
of votes, those members who promised to limit their terms will
probably become the target of nervous leaders who want them to
stay. Even though Congress has resisted term limits, and courts
have ruled that states cannot impose limits on federal lawmakers,
many candidates are limiting themselves. Five Republicans have
pledged not to seek re-election in 2002, and 32 members _ 24
Republicans and 8 Democrats _ have pledged not to run in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates who have broken their pledges, like Alfonse M.
D'Amato, the New York senator, a Republican, have lost their
re-election bids, while others, like Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa, have
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think term limits are a good idea,'' said Mark Mellman,
a Democratic pollster. ``But as an issue, it doesn't have the
juice, it's not as compelling as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   This will not keep challengers from trying to use the issue
against those who break their pledges. Paul Jacob, president of the
U.S. Term Limits Foundation, said his group planned to spend $20
million in 2000, twice what it spent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob said that Republican leaders are so obsessed with
incumbency that they do not realize that the party probably could
keep many of the seats held by term-limited incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the advantages of incumbency will outweigh the
backlash from the public when they lie,'' Jacob said. ``But the
Republicans will be sending a message nationally, to independent
voters, to Reagan Democrats and to their base that all the reasons
you voted for them, they have turned against. This is shooting
themselves in the head.''

SOME STATES ARE NOT SPENDING THEIR WELFARE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Miss., W.Va., N.J., N.Y., Conn., Kan., Minn., La.,
Colo., Wash., Iowa, Fla., Wyo.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Billions of dollars in federal welfare money is
piling up in the Treasury, unused by state officials, who won
control of the money in 1996 by arguing that they knew best how to
spend it for the benefit of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the states failed to use the full amounts of
their federal welfare grants last year, federal and state officials
say. Data compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services
show that states had an unused balance of $3 billion, out of $12
billion made available in the first nine months of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several states, including Ohio and Mississippi,
passed up the opportunity to get extra federal money from the Labor
Department to help move long-term welfare recipients into jobs.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the number of people on welfare had dropped
much faster than they expected, making it difficult for them to use
all the federal money they were entitled to. While a few states
have been innovative, many have been slow to develop new welfare
programs since responsibility shifted from the federal government
to the states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some states are saving money for use in a
recession. States can allow money to accumulate, and draw it when
their needs increase.
</P>
<P>
   The latest federal data show that West Virginia, one of the
poorest states in the nation, had an unspent balance of $72
million, representing 65 percent of its annual federal grant under
the new welfare program, known as Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aggressively looking for ways to use this money,'' said
Shana Phares, a spokeswoman for the West Virginia Department of
Health and Human Resources. ``We are keenly aware that if we don't
spend the money in a timely manner, it will be extremely tempting
for Congress to take some of it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 welfare law, the federal government provides each
state with a fixed amount of money, regardless of any changes in
the number of people who qualify for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Each state's annual allocation, which is to remain steady for
six years, was based on federal spending in 1994 and 1995, when
welfare spending and caseloads were high. States may carry over
unused federal money from year to year, but they are required to
spend specified amounts of state money, equal to 75 percent or 80
percent of what they spent on welfare in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Tweedie, a welfare policy expert at the National Conference
of State Legislatures, said, ``States see the money as a reserve
for a future economic downturn, but caseloads have dropped so fast
that many states are building much larger reserves than they
planned.'' The surplus, he said, could be used for social policy
innovations.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law gave states vast new authority to design programs
of assistance to low-income families, but Tweedie said, ``Few
states have taken advantage of the flexibility they have to develop
new programs; few broadened the population served.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials are somewhat defensive about the sums they have
allowed to accumulate, and are often vague about how they will use
the new resources.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Clinton signed the welfare law in August 1996,
the number of people on welfare has dropped 35 percent. It exceeded
12.2 million then and is below 8 million today. Reasons for the
decline include an intense emphasis on work in welfare offices
around the country, and a booming economy, with the lowest
unemployment rate in more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey had a surplus of $170 million in its federal welfare
account on Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year. That
represents 42 percent of its annual grant. Jacqueline Tencza, a
spokeswoman for the state's Department of Human Services, said that
nearly $60 million of the unused money was earmarked for
administrative costs and child care.
</P>
<P>
   The latest official data for New York, covering the first nine
months of the last fiscal year, show a surplus of $335 million,
representing 18 percent of the total awarded to New York for that
period.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, which has a low poverty rate, is in the minority,
having used almost every penny of its federal welfare grant, $267
million a year. Claudette Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the state's
Department of Social Services, said it had sharply increased
spending on child care, to $150 million last year from $40 million
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, which receives a federal welfare grant of $102 million a
year, had an unused surplus of $89 million in June 1998, and state
officials predict that the balance will be $50 million in June of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas is a fiscally conservative state,'' said John
Garlinger, a spokesman for the Kansas Department of Social and
Rehabilitation Services. ``We are being very prudent in how we
spend this money.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota receives $268 million a year from the federal
government for welfare programs. As of June 30, it had a surplus of
more than $110 million in its federal account.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Nelson, a budget analyst in the Minnesota Department of
Human Services, said: ``We project that our spending in the next
four years will be $30 million to $40 million a year under the
annual grant. We've been pretty conservative in our budgeting, so
that we'll be prepared if a recession hits.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials said such conservatism was justified because
states bore the financial risk of any economic downturn, and would
have to pay most of the cost if welfare rolls increased again.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, another of the nation's poorest states, officials
confirmed federal figures showing that they had more than $90
million of unspent federal welfare money in the federal Treasury.
That is more than half of the state's annual welfare grant of $168
million.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Watts, president of Agenda for Children, a child advocacy
group in New Orleans, said, ``A substantial portion of Louisiana's
federal welfare money is just piling up in Washington, mainly
through neglect rather than the deliberate policy choices of state
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Vera Blakes, assistant secretary of the Louisiana Department of
Social Services, said the state planned to use some of the money
for efforts to prevent teen-age pregnancy and to help fathers find
jobs, so they could pay child support.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the federal government gave states wide discretion to
run their welfare programs, some states transferred much of the
decision-making authority to county officials. Colorado is one such
state. It had a surplus of $61 million in its federal welfare
account, representing 59 percent of the money it was awarded in the
first three quarte2s of the 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caseloads have gone down very quickly, a little more
quickly than people expected,'' said Dwight Eisnach, a spokesman
for the Colorado Department of Human Services. Asked why the state
was not using more of its federal money, Eisnach said, ``It took
time for counties to get up to speed in this brave new world that
we have now.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has an unspent balance of $181 million,
according to the federal government. Kenneth Miller, the state's
welfare coordinator, said that because of the declining caseload,
the surplus could grow to $200 million, or nearly half of the
state's annual welfare grant of $404 million.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Howard, the welfare director in Iowa, said he was
worried about the message he had begun to hear from officials in
Washington: ``If you are not spending the money, you must not need
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Winstead, the welfare director in Florida, said states must
be allowed to ``complete the job of welfare reform.'' If Congress
reduces the federal grants, he said, it will not only break a
commitment made in 1996, but also undermine states' efforts to help
people who remain on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of
government, a part of the State University of New York, said, ``It
would be short-sighted for Congress to take back any of the federal
welfare money.''
</P>
<P>
   The law's work requirements will become more stringent in the
next three years. Presumably, the people who found work first were
better equipped for the job market.
</P>
<P>
   But, state officials said, the people still getting welfare have
fewer skills and less work experience. Many have physical or mental
disabilities, some lack basic language skills and some have a
history of drug abuse or have been victims of domestic violence.
States will probably have to spend more on training, drug treatment
and other services to prepare them for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Shively, the Kansas commissioner of Economic and
Employment Support, said, ``We've been blessed with a tremendous
caseload reduction'' _ 48 percent since 1996 _ ``but our most
serious work lies ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   After Congress overhauled the basic welfare program in 1996, it
went back a year later, at President Clinton's insistence, and
provided extra money for jobs. Under this Labor Department program,
states must put up $1 of state money for every $2 of federal
``welfare to work'' grants.
</P>
<P>
   George Voinovich, who was governor of Ohio at the time, turned
down $44 million in such grants because, he said, they carried too
many federal rules and requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming could have obtained $2.8 million from the Labor
Department, but Marianne Lee, the state welfare director, said the
state ``did not have enough people left on our rolls'' to justify
an application. The number of welfare recipients in Wyoming has
plunged 84 percent, to 1,821 from 11,398 in August 1996, when
Clinton signed the welfare bill.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi passed up $13 million in federal money for ``welfare
to work'' activities. Donald Taylor, executive director of the
Mississippi Department of Human Services, said he understood why
``the disciples of dependency, the self-styled defenders of the
downtrodden,'' would question that decision.
</P>
<P>
   But, Taylor said, the state does not need the money. ``We want
to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars,'' he said. ``Why would
you spend federal taxpayer dollars to solve a problem if it's being
solved without the application of those dollars?''

CLINTON GIVES CONDOLENCES AND A PLEDGE OF SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton mourned the death of King Hussein
of Jordan on Sunday and pledged support for Jordan's new ruler,
promising to work with him to continue efforts toward a
comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in remarks here before flying to Amman with three
former presidents for Hussein's funeral on Monday, mourned the dead
monarch as the architect of modern Jordan and an indispensable
peacemaker. He called him a partner, a friend and ``a magnificent
man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God willing, soon all will see what he saw and preached: There
can be no peace, no dignity, no security for any of Abraham's
children until there is peace, dignity and security for all of
them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tribute to the king's remarks, concluding the peace
talks in Wye, Md., in October, in which he said: ``There has been
enough destruction, enough death, enough waste, and it's time that
together we occupy a place beyond ourselves, our peoples, that is
worthy of them and of their sons, the descendants of the children
of Abraham.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton stressed his expectations of a smooth transition
of power in Amman and seamless continuity in U.S.-Jordan relations,
administration officials and Middle East experts cautioned that the
new king faces a number of potential challenges to his authority,
both internally and externally.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest immediate threat is economic. Jordan has suffered
through a devastating drought and a loss of public confidence in
the nation's currency, the dinar.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Clinton announced that he would seek to accelerate
delivery of a promised $300 million in U.S. aid to Jordan to help
revive its torpid economy and to help cover the costs of steps
Jordan is taking following the Israeli-Palestinian accords reached
at the Wye Plantation. Officials said that the president acted to
reassure the Jordanian people and King Abdullah that the United
States is prepared to help ease the nation's economic troubles and
to support the new king politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obviously a delicate time in Jordan; everybody has to
realize that,'' Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said
in an interview on Sunday. ``Internally, I don't believe there will
be serious challenges to his authority or legitimacy.'' Berger
predicted that other members of the Hashemite royal family would
loyally support the new king.
</P>
<P>
   But the new king faces potential challenges from his neighbors.
``He's obviously got actors on his borders that he's got to keep
his eye on, most particularly Iraq,'' Berger said, issuing a
warning to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that the United States
would act harshly against any attempt to threaten Jordan. ``It
would be an act of enormous recklessness for Saddam to challenge
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Satloff, director of the Washington Institute for Near
East Policy, said that while he expected the ascension of the new
king to be smooth, Jordan moves to the world's watch list as a
country whose future cannot be plotted with certainty.

<P>
   ``Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown,'' wrote William
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   And that goes for crown princes, too, as Jordanian politics now
demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein deposed his brother, Hassan, from his 34-year
tenure as heir to the throne, and named his eldest son Abdullah, as
his successor. It was an extraordinary birthday present for
Abdullah, who turned 37 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the king's fairytale-like return to Jordan ended
darkly, he essentially accused his brother Hassan of meddling in
the army and allowing his own supporters to criticize Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   And yet many believe there can be absolutely no question of
Hassan's loyalty. Perhaps Hussein was led to false suspicions due
to palace intrigues, possibly involving Queen Noor herself, who
wants her son, Hamza, still only 18, to succeed to the throne.
Perhaps the king had worried that Hassan would put his own son on
the throne, though the two men had agreed decades ago that
Hussein's line would rule in future.
</P>
<P>
   Many national leaders find it hard to choose replacements, and
they often become jealous and suspicious of even the most trusted
lieutenants put into that position. Perhaps, they worry, the heir
is secretly trying on the crown and dreaming of what he will do too
soon before the old ruler is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The regent is placed in a very difficult position: Doing nothing
makes him seem a poor administrator; taking decisions makes him
seem a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan apparently fell off this narrow tightrope.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's new king lacks political experience, though his strong
base in the army implies he would be able to make a stable regime.
Hussein even linked the change in succession with a defense of army
chief of staff, Field Marshal Abd al-Hafiz Kaabna, who Hassan was
seeking to remove.
</P>
<P>
   None of these developments means that Jordan is unstable. There
is not going to be any serious conflict among the factions. Things
will soon settle down into an acceptance of Abdullah's rule, and
the jockeying will begin by ambitious officials to ingratiate
themselves with the new successor.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes Abdullah will quickly become entrenched and
experienced as he moves toward success in his reign as Jordan's
fourth king.
</P>
<P>
   The key factor about Jordan is that it is a small country, in
terms of both population and territory. Compared to several
neighbors, it is inevitably weak.
</P>
<P>
   During the era of King Hussein's grandfather _ the original King
Abdullah _ in the 1940s and early 1950s, some Jordanians hoped
their state could be the nucleus of a wider Arab realm. But these
hopes soon faded and, with Abdullah's assassination in 1951,
disappeared entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Survival, not empire-building, has been the necessary theme of
Jordan's foreign policy. Today the main external threats are from
Iran, Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's successor will not find this easy to change, nor
is he likely to seek allies among the radical states. They cannot
do too much for Jordan, though there is a lot they can do against
it.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is a problem, of course, because its Islamic regime stands
for everything Jordan's government opposes, and vice versa. But
Iran is relatively far away, on the other side of Iraq, and does
not participate in the Arab political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is much closer. Damascus would like to make Amman a
satellite similar to Lebanon. The Syrians have also sponsored
anti-Jordanian terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Coexistence is possible, but alliance is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Iraq is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is potentially Jordan's largest trading partner, and the
sanctions against Baghdad have been devastating for Jordanian
business. The pressure of Jordanian public opinion and fear of
Iraqi military aggression led King Hussein to support Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein during the 1990-1991 Kuwait crisis and
ensuing war.
</P>
<P>
   After Iraq's defeat, Jordan switched sides. The United States
forgave it, but the Saudis and Kuwaitis are still angry. King
Hussein then burnt his bridges to Baghdad by welcoming Iraqi
oppositionists and attacking Saddam Hussein's regime in very strong
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have reciprocated with even harsher words.
</P>
<P>
   There are no short-term prospects of a thaw, especially as long
as sanctions remain in place against Iraq. Still, in a
post-sanctions _ and, even more, a post-Saddam _ situation, the new
king might be eager to make up with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Jordanians would waste no time in reestablishing
maximum trade the moment there was any opening to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, LESSON ONE for Jordan's new ruler is: Be very wary
about the radical regimes, both as a foreign threat and as a source
of internal subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any unilateral Jordanian-Iraqi rapprochement would
kill the kingdom's chances of getting Saudi and Kuwaiti aid.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jordan has been pursuing the delicate task of
apologizing to the gulf monarchies for its behavior a decade ago.
In recent months, the common antipathy toward Iraq has been making
the Kuwaitis more open than ever to patching things up with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis are harder to persuade. They frequently remind
themselves that, back in 1991, a few Jordanians spoke of King
Hussein as the proper guardian of Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Saud took those cities away from King Hussein's
ancestors in the 1920s, and the current rulers of Saudi Arabia
worried that the Jordanians were dreaming of a comeback there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps they would give Abdullah the benefit of the
doubt, wanting to ensure the continuing stability of the Jordanian
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   So LESSON TWO for the new ruler is: Do everything you can to
persuade the Saudis and Kuwaitis that you won't cause them any
headaches, so they'll give you lots of aid. Remember that Jordan's
main internal problems are due to economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   The next king might be tempted to distance Jordan a bit from
Israel to reduce some Arabs' antagonism and open other's purses.
Yet the strategic relationship with Israel is one of Jordan's main
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Who else is going to back Jordan against a radical threat or
help ensure a Palestinian state doesn't become a new problem for
Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   Thus, LESSON THREE: Preserve good relations with Israel,
whatever adjustments might be made to fit the new king's style.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's relationship with the Palestinians has a long and
complex history. Abdullah's West Bank wife should be an asset in
winning support from Palestinian-Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   LESSON FOUR: Express support for the Palestinians so they make
gains. More Palestinians should not need to flee to Jordan as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But make sure they are hemmed in by commitments, so that a
Palestinian state would neither subvert nor threaten Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that Arab solidarity is a wonderful thing, but
U.S. protection _ not politically correct nationalist or Islamist
rhetoric _ is Jordan's main protection from the potentially
smothering embrace of its Arab brothers.

<P>
   AMMAN - Jordanians absorbing the shockwaves of their political
earthquake back their new young ruler, Abdullah. But some express
concern over his inexperience and worry that he will have
difficulty filling his father's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   After assuming his post as crown prince last week, Abdullah
seemed remarkably well ensconced as the man who in only days would
inherit Hussein's kingdom. By Sunday, when his father passed away,
pictures of Abdullah in his new role, reviewing elite troops and
receiving kisses from tribal Beduin leaders had for days been
dominated the state media.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers, parliament members and the rest of the political
elite went out of their way to assure Abdullah of their support and
loyalty, and convey a sense of continuity as the kingdom endured
the shock of an end to the 46-year old reign of Hussein. Even the
former crown prince, Hassan, embraced Abdullah and offered best
wishes for his success.
</P>
<P>
   Some storekeepers had already removed pictures of King Hussein
with his brother Hassan and replaced them with posters of the king
with Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Hussein refugee camp in downtown Amman, Salim
Ibrahim, an aluminum worker, was worried about the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a cafe crowded with unemployed youths playing cards
and old men smoking nargilas, Ibrahim, who traces his roots to Lod,
said: ``I am concerned at this point about Jordan's future. We know
King Hussein and he knows us. But we don't know how things will be
with another person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abdullah is a military man, and he won't be like King Hussein,
who understood politics 100 percent. Abdullah doesn't have the
understanding that Hassan does,'' referring to the foreign and
domestic policy experience Hassan garnered during his 34-year
tenure as crown prince. ``Maybe, step-by-step, he will learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The main concern in the refugee camp was economic conditions,
which residents say have been deteriorating ever since the Persian
Gulf War. Unemployment in Jordan is estimated by economists to be
at 17 percent and, by all appearances, it was very much higher than
that in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Others among the camp's 50,000 residents predicted the change in
succession would have no impact on their lives. ``It won't have any
effect, because we are talking about the same family, the Hashemite
family,'' a shopkeeper said.
</P>
<P>
   One man said he was puzzled by the letter King Hussein had sent
to Hassan that was publicized by the palace last week,
</P>
<P>
   It charged Hassan with usurping authority during the king's
six-month absence at the Mayo Clinic, and said that his associates
had waged a smear campaign against Hussein's American-born wife,
Queen Noor. ``It appears there were some family problems,'' the man
said. ``This letter was very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, on the tree-lined campus of the University of
Jordan, students said they were surprised by the rapid-fire change
in succession, but seemed to support it or accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I feel badly about Prince Hassan,'' said Rami
Samain, 22, a law student, praising his academic accomplishments,
which include writing three books. As for Abdullah, he added: ``He
has a military mentality and that is a good thing for a developing
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The king has acted in the people's interest,'' added Mahmoud
Rawajdeh, a student of Islamic law. ``Perhaps Hassan can help
Abdullah. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, who asked not to be identified, said: ``The
king started ruling when he was 18 and people accepted him as king.
Abdullah is much older than that, and his father chose him. I
expect Abdullah will be good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But another student, who asked not to be identified, said: ``I
think Abdullah has no experience with what is happening in the
region. Prince Hassan better understands relations with other
countries. There are reasons for these changes that no one knows. I
think King Hussein did this for his personal interest and not for
our benefit at all.''

   In his more than 40 years as the ruler of Jordan, King Hussein
served his country and his people well. Jordan today is in far
better shape than most Arab countries, despite the absence of oil
and other natural resources, and its prospects for the 21st century
are better than those of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and certainly Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Although he could not erase the Hashemite kingdom's deep social
and political divisions, Hussein was quite successful in managing
the internal conflicts to prevent them from exploding. Slowly and
carefully, he introduced democratic norms, encouraged pluralism and
debate, and gently nudged Jordan to the front of the Arab world in
this process.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the king's stature grew throughout the Middle
East. His judgment, straightforward style and common sense were
widely respected, and his humanity and measured leadership served
as an example for all other leaders in the region. In Israel, King
Hussein was more popular than any of the home-grown politicians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is important to recall that in navigating
the Middle Eastern obstacle course that threatened the survival of
Jordan, Hussein made some major mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, he failed to take action against Palestinian
terror groups using Jordan as a safe haven for attacking Israel.
This led to unnecessary and very costly confrontations with Israel.
This only ended in September 1970, when Palestinians turned their
guns against Hussein and almost succeeded in overthrowing the
Hashemite regime.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1967, he joined Gamal Abdel Nasser's military alliance
threatening to invade Israel, and after the war began in June,
Jordan's forces joined in and were quickly defeated. As a result,
the Hashemite kingdom lost control of the West Bank and, more
importantly, of Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Much later, in 1990, Hussein briefly embraced Saddam Hussein's
madness. Perhaps his hand was forced by Iraqi- and
Palestinian-inspired demonstrations in Jordan, but as the leader,
he was responsible for the failure to prevent the creation of an
atmosphere in which popular support for the Iraqi dictator thrived.
</P>
<P>
   However, like his grandfather Abdullah, Hussein learned quickly
from his mistakes, and corrected them. In contrast to the leaders
of many neighboring countries, Iraq in particular, Hussein avoided
piling mistake upon mistake.
</P>
<P>
   He did not allow pride and inflated self-importance to dominate,
and was not afraid of admitting errors and reversing course. As a
result, the citizens of Jordan were spared the enduring pain and
suffering of the Iraqis, Syrians, Palestinians and Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1967 disaster, while the other Arab states continued
to deny the reality of Israel's existence, Jordan quickly resumed
the informal cooperation on vital issues such as security and
water. The secret meetings started again, and cooperation with
Moshe Dayan's ``open bridges'' policy allowed the Palestinians on
both sides of the river to continue to trade and travel without
interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, within a few months of end of the 1991 Persian Gulf
War, Jordan had totally disengaged from Iraq, and repaired its
relations with the United States and Israel. By the time of the
Madrid conference in October 1991, Hussein was no longer persona
non grata, and resumed his central role in promoting Arab-Israeli
negotiations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the power of Iraq and the Palestinians declined,
Jordan was able to make substantial progress toward securing
security and stability by balancing the various threats.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Oslo agreement created the necessary political
conditions, negotiation of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty
accelerated and it was signed in November 1994. As a result, the
United States agreed to erase Jordan's debts, and other economic
benefits began to flow.
</P>
<P>
   However, the final and most important test of any leader is his
(or her) ability to create a legacy that lasts into future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Hussein's brother, now the former crown
prince, Hassan, continued the the careful movement toward democracy
and pluralism. Hassan also helped to propel relations with Israel,
creating a far healthier and vital relationship between Jerusalem
and Amman. Hassan's emphasis on religious dimensions that unite
Arabs, Jews and Christians, and on the joint pursuit of scientific
and technological knowledge, provided additional dimensions to this
process.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently responding to pressures within his family, and his
own wish to see his line continued, the king abruptly replaced
Hassan with his oldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The world joins Jordanians in praying that Hussein made the
right choice and that the transition between rulers will be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's challenge is to continue and extend the policies that
were initiated by his namesake and great-grandfather, and were
extended and developed by his father. If he succeeds, he will be
able to lead Jordan to political and social stability, economic
growth, and increased democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps after Abdullah's reign, his heir will be chosen by
popular vote, and the monarchy will become more of a symbol. In
this way, Jordan will guide the rest of the Middle East toward the
stability that we all need.

<P>
   ``Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown,'' wrote William
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   And that goes for crown princes, too, as Jordanian politics now
demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein deposed his brother, Hassan, from his 34-year
tenure as heir to the throne, and named his eldest son Abdullah, as
his successor. It was an extraordinary birthday present for
Abdullah, who turned 37 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the king's fairytale-like return to Jordan ended
darkly, he essentially accused his brother Hassan of meddling in
the army and allowing his own supporters to criticize Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   And yet many believe there can be absolutely no question of
Hassan's loyalty. Perhaps Hussein was led to false suspicions due
to palace intrigues, possibly involving Queen Noor herself, who
wants her son, Hamza, still only 18, to succeed to the throne.
Perhaps the king had worried that Hassan would put his own son on
the throne, though the two men had agreed decades ago that
Hussein's line would rule in future.
</P>
<P>
   Many national leaders find it hard to choose replacements, and
they often become jealous and suspicious of even the most trusted
lieutenants put into that position. Perhaps, they worry, the heir
is secretly trying on the crown and dreaming of what he will do too
soon before the old ruler is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The regent is placed in a very difficult position: Doing nothing
makes him seem a poor administrator; taking decisions makes him
seem a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan apparently fell off this narrow tightrope.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's new king lacks political experience, though his strong
base in the army implies he would be able to make a stable regime.
Hussein even linked the change in succession with a defense of army
chief of staff, Field Marshal Abd al-Hafiz Kaabna, who Hassan was
seeking to remove.
</P>
<P>
   None of these developments means that Jordan is unstable. There
is not going to be any serious conflict among the factions. Things
will soon settle down into an acceptance of Abdullah's rule, and
the jockeying will begin by ambitious officials to ingratiate
themselves with the new successor.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes Abdullah will quickly become entrenched and
experienced as he moves toward success in his reign as Jordan's
fourth king.
</P>
<P>
   The key factor about Jordan is that it is a small country, in
terms of both population and territory. Compared to several
neighbors, it is inevitably weak.
</P>
<P>
   During the era of King Hussein's grandfather _ the original King
Abdullah _ in the 1940s and early 1950s, some Jordanians hoped
their state could be the nucleus of a wider Arab realm. But these
hopes soon faded and, with Abdullah's assassination in 1951,
disappeared entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Survival, not empire-building, has been the necessary theme of
Jordan's foreign policy. Today the main external threats are from
Iran, Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's successor will not find this easy to change, nor
is he likely to seek allies among the radical states. They cannot
do too much for Jordan, though there is a lot they can do against
it.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is a problem, of course, because its Islamic regime stands
for everything Jordan's government opposes, and vice versa. But
Iran is relatively far away, on the other side of Iraq, and does
not participate in the Arab political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is much closer. Damascus would like to make Amman a
satellite similar to Lebanon. The Syrians have also sponsored
anti-Jordanian terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Coexistence is possible, but alliance is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Iraq is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is potentially Jordan's largest trading partner, and the
sanctions against Baghdad have been devastating for Jordanian
business. The pressure of Jordanian public opinion and fear of
Iraqi military aggression led King Hussein to support Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein during the 1990-1991 Kuwait crisis and
ensuing war.
</P>
<P>
   After Iraq's defeat, Jordan switched sides. The United States
forgave it, but the Saudis and Kuwaitis are still angry. King
Hussein then burnt his bridges to Baghdad by welcoming Iraqi
oppositionists and attacking Saddam Hussein's regime in very strong
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have reciprocated with even harsher words.
</P>
<P>
   There are no short-term prospects of a thaw, especially as long
as sanctions remain in place against Iraq. Still, in a
post-sanctions _ and, even more, a post-Saddam _ situation, the new
king might be eager to make up with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Jordanians would waste no time in reestablishing
maximum trade the moment there was any opening to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, LESSON ONE for Jordan's new ruler is: Be very wary
about the radical regimes, both as a foreign threat and as a source
of internal subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any unilateral Jordanian-Iraqi rapprochement would
kill the kingdom's chances of getting Saudi and Kuwaiti aid.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jordan has been pursuing the delicate task of
apologizing to the gulf monarchies for its behavior a decade ago.
In recent months, the common antipathy toward Iraq has been making
the Kuwaitis more open than ever to patching things up with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis are harder to persuade. They frequently remind
themselves that, back in 1991, a few Jordanians spoke of King
Hussein as the proper guardian of Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Saud took those cities away from King Hussein's
ancestors in the 1920s, and the current rulers of Saudi Arabia
worried that the Jordanians were dreaming of a comeback there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps they would give Abdullah the benefit of the
doubt, wanting to ensure the continuing stability of the Jordanian
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   So LESSON TWO for the new ruler is: Do everything you can to
persuade the Saudis and Kuwaitis that you won't cause them any
headaches, so they'll give you lots of aid. Remember that Jordan's
main internal problems are due to economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   The next king might be tempted to distance Jordan a bit from
Israel to reduce some Arabs' antagonism and open other's purses.
Yet the strategic relationship with Israel is one of Jordan's main
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Who else is going to back Jordan against a radical threat or
help ensure a Palestinian state doesn't become a new problem for
Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   Thus, LESSON THREE: Preserve good relations with Israel,
whatever adjustments might be made to fit the new king's style.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's relationship with the Palestinians has a long and
complex history. Abdullah's West Bank wife should be an asset in
winning support from Palestinian-Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   LESSON FOUR: Express support for the Palestinians so they make
gains. More Palestinians should not need to flee to Jordan as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But make sure they are hemmed in by commitments, so that a
Palestinian state would neither subvert nor threaten Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that Arab solidarity is a wonderful thing, but
U.S. protection _ not politically correct nationalist or Islamist
rhetoric _ is Jordan's main protection from the potentially
smothering embrace of its Arab brothers.

<P>
   AMMAN - Jordanians absorbing the shockwaves of their political
earthquake back their new young ruler, Abdullah. But some express
concern over his inexperience and worry that he will have
difficulty filling his father's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   After assuming his post as crown prince last week, Abdullah
seemed remarkably well ensconced as the man who in only days would
inherit Hussein's kingdom. By Sunday, when his father passed away,
pictures of Abdullah in his new role, reviewing elite troops and
receiving kisses from tribal Beduin leaders had for days been
dominated the state media.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers, parliament members and the rest of the political
elite went out of their way to assure Abdullah of their support and
loyalty, and convey a sense of continuity as the kingdom endured
the shock of an end to the 46-year old reign of Hussein. Even the
former crown prince, Hassan, embraced Abdullah and offered best
wishes for his success.
</P>
<P>
   Some storekeepers had already removed pictures of King Hussein
with his brother Hassan and replaced them with posters of the king
with Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Hussein refugee camp in downtown Amman, Salim
Ibrahim, an aluminum worker, was worried about the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a cafe crowded with unemployed youths playing cards
and old men smoking nargilas, Ibrahim, who traces his roots to Lod,
said: ``I am concerned at this point about Jordan's future. We know
King Hussein and he knows us. But we don't know how things will be
with another person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abdullah is a military man, and he won't be like King Hussein,
who understood politics 100 percent. Abdullah doesn't have the
understanding that Hassan does,'' referring to the foreign and
domestic policy experience Hassan garnered during his 34-year
tenure as crown prince. ``Maybe, step-by-step, he will learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The main concern in the refugee camp was economic conditions,
which residents say have been deteriorating ever since the Persian
Gulf War. Unemployment in Jordan is estimated by economists to be
at 17 percent and, by all appearances, it was very much higher than
that in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Others among the camp's 50,000 residents predicted the change in
succession would have no impact on their lives. ``It won't have any
effect, because we are talking about the same family, the Hashemite
family,'' a shopkeeper said.
</P>
<P>
   One man said he was puzzled by the letter King Hussein had sent
to Hassan that was publicized by the palace last week,
</P>
<P>
   It charged Hassan with usurping authority during the king's
six-month absence at the Mayo Clinic, and said that his associates
had waged a smear campaign against Hussein's American-born wife,
Queen Noor. ``It appears there were some family problems,'' the man
said. ``This letter was very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, on the tree-lined campus of the University of
Jordan, students said they were surprised by the rapid-fire change
in succession, but seemed to support it or accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I feel badly about Prince Hassan,'' said Rami
Samain, 22, a law student, praising his academic accomplishments,
which include writing three books. As for Abdullah, he added: ``He
has a military mentality and that is a good thing for a developing
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The king has acted in the people's interest,'' added Mahmoud
Rawajdeh, a student of Islamic law. ``Perhaps Hassan can help
Abdullah. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, who asked not to be identified, said: ``The
king started ruling when he was 18 and people accepted him as king.
Abdullah is much older than that, and his father chose him. I
expect Abdullah will be good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But another student, who asked not to be identified, said: ``I
think Abdullah has no experience with what is happening in the
region. Prince Hassan better understands relations with other
countries. There are reasons for these changes that no one knows. I
think King Hussein did this for his personal interest and not for
our benefit at all.''

   In his more than 40 years as the ruler of Jordan, King Hussein
served his country and his people well. Jordan today is in far
better shape than most Arab countries, despite the absence of oil
and other natural resources, and its prospects for the 21st century
are better than those of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and certainly Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Although he could not erase the Hashemite kingdom's deep social
and political divisions, Hussein was quite successful in managing
the internal conflicts to prevent them from exploding. Slowly and
carefully, he introduced democratic norms, encouraged pluralism and
debate, and gently nudged Jordan to the front of the Arab world in
this process.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the king's stature grew throughout the Middle
East. His judgment, straightforward style and common sense were
widely respected, and his humanity and measured leadership served
as an example for all other leaders in the region. In Israel, King

<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan, who died Sunday at 63, successfully
straddled two worlds in more than four tumultuous decades on the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   Cautious by instinct and habit, Hussein took pride in his
Western impulses and his Arab roots, though he acknowledged that
the combination sometimes produced policies that even admirers
criticized as erratic and conflicting.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Middle East's longest-reigning ruler, but took little
comfort from mere survival. Though he once said he yearned for a
``hero's death'' like that of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli enemy he ultimately embraced as his ``brother'' and
``partner in peace,'' Hussein succumbed not to the fanatic's bullet
but to cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which he had suffered from
for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   His twin legacies _ peace with his neighbors, including Israel,
and a fairly tolerant, stable society at home _ would be impressive
in any context. But they are particularly so given the often
violent politics of the Mideast and the unpromising country whose
stewardship he inherited while still a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Personally courageous, modest and unfailingly polite, Hussein
was known for his political tolerance, pardoning even those who had
tried to kill him. Though he had made war against Israel in 1967,
he was the only Arab leader secure enough to kneel before Israeli
families who had lost children in a terrorist attack on his soil in
1997, offering his condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein spent the final months of his life working relentlessly
for peace and a succession that he hoped would ensure both his
immediate family's control of the throne and political stability in
Jordan. Just days before his death, he stunned the world by
bypassing his younger brother, Prince Hassan, 51, and naming his
eldest son, 37-year-old Abdullah, as heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   In a long, bitter letter to his brother explaining his decision
and publicizing a deep family rift, Hussein assailed Hassan's
performance as regent, saying that his brother's palace supporters
_ ``climbers,'' he denounced them _ had tried to ``destroy Jordan''
by spreading vicious gossip about his wife and children and
``meddling'' in the military to ``settle scores'' and divide and
politicize the army. Hussein also revealed that Hassan, his
designated heir for 34 years, had opposed his wish that his own
sons succeed his brother as king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein said the family discord had given him ``many sleepless
nights'' and prompted him to intervene ``from my sickbed'' at the
Mayo Clinic in Minnesota to end the intrigues and political
jockeying for power in Jordan. But he complimented Hassan for his
``sincere efforts'' and his loyal acceptance of his demotion.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning decision not only took Jordan and the United States
by surprise, it demonstrated that Hussein, though ailing and in
pain, remained the undisputed ruler of his kingdom til' the last
days of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from settling the succession, Hussein's last efforts were
aimed at advancing peace between the Arabs and Israel, a goal that
had eluded two generations of Hashemites.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn and pale, and made bald by four rounds of chemotherapy, he
left the Mayo Clinic in October 1998 to attend the Wye summit talks
in Maryland and help President Clinton coax Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators into concluding the next phase of their peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had an ounce of strength, I would have done my utmost to
be there and to help in any way I can,'' he said in an emotional,
impromptu speech at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Saying there had been ``enough destruction, enough death, enough
waste'' during the five decades of Arab-Israeli conflict, he
pleaded for accommodation. ``We have no right to dictate through
irresponsible action or narrow-mindedness the future of our
children or their children's children,'' the king said.
</P>
<P>
   A short man who used his deep, mesmerizing voice to maximum
political effect, Hussein was to a large extent a reflection and
prisoner of his geography.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of a slip of land the size of South Carolina,
seven-eighths of it desert, without oil or other valuable
resources, he was surrounded by far more powerful nations, many of
them intermittently hostile. And over two-thirds of Jordan's more
than 4.5 million people are Palestinian, many of whom feel little
allegiance to him, his family or their adopted country.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Hussein's lack of options, former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger wrote in 1979, in his book ``White House
Years,'' that the king ``had the capacity neither for independent
action nor for blackmail, which are the stuff of Middle Eastern
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, by charting a mostly centrist, pragmatic course
and avoiding the radical passions and fashionable political trends
that destabilized or toppled several other hereditary leaders in
the Mideast, Hussein created a relatively peaceful, conservative,
modern country whose citizens enjoy decent government and more
political freedom than those of most other Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
   His rule was marked by both bold diplomatic strokes and
strategic blunders. Notable among the latter was his decision not
to join the American-led coalition that forced Saddam of Iraq to
end his brief occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1967 he ignored Israel's private assurances and calls for
restraint in favor of joining Egypt and Syria in their war against
Israel. This cost him half of Jerusalem and all the territory on
the western side of the Jordan River, the West Bank, which his
grandfather Abdullah had won in the 1948-1949 war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But after each setback, Hussein recovered his political
equilibrium and turned adversity to his advantage. Reputed among
Jordanians to enjoy baraka, or God's blessing, for dodging at least
12 assassination attempts and 7 plots to overthrow him, the king
ultimately accomplished what his grandfather had been unable to do:
in 1994 he secured a stunning peace with Israel, which he has
called his reign's ``crowning achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In July 1994, standing on the White House lawn beside Rabin,
Hussein initialed an accord that technically ended the state of war
between the neighboring countries. And three months later, in an
emotional ceremony in his own land, he became the third Arab leader
to sign a formal peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have at last carried out the will of King Abdullah,'' he
declared on the White House lawn, referring to his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the legacy of political pragmatism as well as the fate
of Abdullah, Jordan's founder and first king, strongly shaped his
rule. In the summer of 1951, when he was 15, Hussein saw his
grandfather gunned down at the entrance of the silver-domed Al Aqsa
Mosque in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein said another bullet had ricocheted off a medal on the
uniform he had been told to wear by his grandfather, who had become
a scapegoat for the fury of the Arabs over their humiliating defeat
by Israel in 1948-49 and for Palestinian rage over Abdullah's
secret meetings with Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In a memoir, Hussein said he had learned painful, important
lessons from witnessing the killing of his grandfather, a
``wonderful old man'' and a ``man of desert ways to whom I owe more
than I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview more than 30 years later, the king said he would
never forget how Abdullah's aides, his ``so-called friends,'' had
scattered in all directions ``like frightened women in the night''
minutes after the killing, or how they had opened political
intrigues within hours.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule he learned, the king said in his memoirs, was
``the unimportance of death: that when you have to die, you die,''
a fatalism he manifested at critical moments throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also saw that rulers cannot depend on their advisers to save
or guide them, that they must make their own decisions and go their
own way,'' he said in an interview in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   This determination to keep his own counsel, and to be prepared
to suffer the consequences of rash actions, allowed him to brush
aside the savage criticism periodically directed at him by
Westerners and Arabs alike.
</P>
<P>
   Though he shared Abdullah's commitment to the Arab cause, the
assassination reinforced his skepticism of fellow Arab rulers. And
from that day onward, he carried a gun or kept one within easy
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the assassination taught him that if he was to pursue
Jordan's strategic interest by maintaining his grandfather's
dialogue with Israel, such contacts had to remain secret. Even
toward the end of his life, Hussein refused to discuss details of
what Israelis estimate were more than 500 hours of talks with every
Israeli leader except Menachem Begin, a series of contacts that the
king initiated in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Descended from a powerful Arabian family that traced its lineage
to Mohammed, Hussein ibn Talal ibn Hussein was born in Amman,
Jordan, on Nov. 14, 1935, to Crown Prince Talal and Princess Zein.
His family, like his country, were desperately poor. His baby
sister died of pneumonia ``in the bitter cold of an Amman winter,''
he later wrote. The family house had no heat.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had been born and raised among the tribes of the
Arabian Desert, but Hussein, in contrast, was educated at Victoria
College in Alexandria, Egypt, and at Harrow and the Royal Military
Academy at Sandhurst, in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his Hashemite family owed much to Britain. To protect
against French encroachment on British interests in Palestine, and
to reward the family for leading the Great Arab Revolt against the
Ottomans, who were allied to Germany, in 1916, Winston Churchill,
then the colonial secretary, had carved Transjordan out of Syria in
1921, agreed to finance the emirate with a modest subsidy and gave
it to Abdullah to rule under British mandate. In 1946 Transjordan
became independent. Abdullah, who never abandoned the dream of
recreating and ruling a modern Arab empire, became king and renamed
his country the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Arab leaders, Abdullah _ like his grandson Hussein
_ quickly grasped that he would have to deal with the Zionists.
Contacts between them began as early as 1926, and in 1946 Abdullah
and Jewish leaders agreed informally that Jordan would not oppose
establishment of a Jewish state if the Zionists supported his rule
over the Arab parts of Palestine. But after war erupted in 1948,
Abdullah invaded the newborn state of Israel, winning control of
half of Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   After Abdullah's assassination, Prince Talal, who had been
treated at a Swiss clinic for schizophrenia, took the throne. When
his attacks worsened, the parliament removed him, on Aug. 11, 1952,
less than a month after Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt helped topple
King Farouk in a military coup. Hussein, then 16, was proclaimed
Jordan's king just as intense Arab nationalism was taking hold
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein always relished physical if not political danger. As if
the extraordinary challenge of sheer survival were not sufficient,
he parachuted, flew stunts in his jets and raced high-performance
cars and motorcycles across the desert (insisting in his later
years on being photographed with a helmet as an example of safety
to his people). Risk became second nature, he told a journalist,
``what water is to fish.'' Compounding the risk, he chain-smoked
cigarettes, a habit he tried innumerable times to break.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein himself conceded that at first he made many mistakes as
ruler. ``Those early years were hard for me,'' he said once in an
interview. ``I learned late.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, when Arab nationalist passions were running high and
conservative monarchies like his were a constant target of coups
and assault, Hussein tried to damp growing popular unrest by
dismissing Sir John Bagot Glubb, Glubb Pasha, the British general
who had trained Jordan's Arab Legion. He also abandoned liberal
measures that he and his father had adopted, declared martial law
and called out the army against his own people.
</P>
<P>
   As the immediate threat to his rule receded, Hussein gradually
replaced British protectors with Americans, whose influence was
growing in the Middle East as Britain's faded. According to senior
Jordanian and American officials, ties between the Central
Intelligence Agency and Hussein were cemented in 1957 and 1958,
when American intelligence officials learned of a coup plot
involving Jordanian diplomats and warned the king.
</P>
<P>
   Relations like those, an American airlift of oil in 1957 when
Jordan was boycotted by Egypt, Syria and Iraq, and monthly checks
from the CIA helped persuade the king that Washington was a
reliable ally. (The CIA payments reportedly ended in 1977, when
their disclosure embarrassed the king.)
</P>
<P>
   Hussein fared less well in his second crisis: the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. Although Israel had urged restraint, he flew to
Cairo shortly before the war to sign a defense treaty with
President Nasser, despite Nasser's earlier plotting against him.
Although the king later admitted that he had known he was taking a
risk by siding with Syria and Egypt, he said he had feared the fury
of his people, many of them Palestinians, more than Israel. A
senior Jordanian official said most Jordanians so strongly favored
the war that the king's choice, in fact, was between ``war and
civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a costly decision. As a result of the 1967 war, Israel
occupied all of Jerusalem and the West Bank. Thousands of
Palestinian refugees fled into arid Jordan, increasing the
population by about half. Three-quarters of the population of Amman
was now of Palestinian origin, making it the largest Palestinian
city. Unlike other Arab rulers, Hussein offered the refugees
citizenship and a passport.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which increasingly viewed Hussein as vulnerable and
an obstacle to its struggle, challenged the Hashemites' control of
Jordan. In despair over the prospect of a civil war, the king later
acknowledged, he briefly pondered abdication, as he would again
during other crises. Instead, he decided to confront Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Though Arafat subsequently maintained that the Jordanian Army
killed as many as 20,000 in putting down the unrest, conservative
estimates put Palestinian losses at 2,000. While Hussein had not
sought this test of wills, his legitimacy was never challenged
again.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn once into an Arab war with Israel, Hussein would not be
seduced a second time. Before the 1973 war, according to Israeli
diplomats, he cautioned Israel that Egypt and Syria were planning
to fight, but his warning was discounted. And while the king sent
Jordanian armored units to fight alongside Syrian forces, he
avoided fighting Israel along their common border, a decision that
precluded the loss of still more land to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his quiet contacts with Israel continued even during
the war. According to a recent book by an Israeli journalist,
Samuel Segev, the king secretly persuaded Israel's chief of staff
to divert artillery from a hill on the Golan Heights where he was
scheduled to address the armored brigade he had sent to help the
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   The king never commented publicly on accounts like these, but
friends and diplomats said such disclosures by Israeli officials
infuriated him.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein paid a high political price for his 1970 assault on the
PLO and his de facto abstention from the 1973 war.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Rabat, Morocco, in 1974, the Arab League
anointed the PLO as the ``sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people.'' Since Jordan was more than half Palestinian
and had ruled the West Bank between 1948 and 1967, the Arabs had
decided, in effect, that he could no longer protect what amounted
to his own national interests, he said in an interview a decade
later.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth major crisis, the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Hussein
in effect sided with radical Arab passions in his tilt toward
Iraq's president, Saddam. He insisted at the time _ and even later
_ that he had been seeking a peaceful solution and had been
neutral, saying, ``I took the side of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But his stance infuriated Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations,
not to mention Washington, whose gifts and foreign aid had helped
him to survive and Jordan to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   American officials understood the king's need to placate Saddam,
given Jordan's economic dependence on Iraqi trade and the
passionate pro-Iraqi stance of most Jordanians, especially
Palestinians, who saw an Iraqi victory as the first step toward
regaining a homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But American patience snapped in February 1991 when Hussein gave
an emotional speech condemning the air strikes against Iraq as ``a
war against all Arabs and Muslims'' aimed at ``destroying all the
achievements of Iraq'' and placing the entire region ``under
foreign domination.''
</P>
<P>
   The king once again paid a high price. The gulf states suspended
aid, costing Amman almost a billion dollars a year, and the influx
of some 300,000 more Palestinian refugees from Kuwait and elsewhere
in the gulf severely strained Jordan's economy. In Washington the
king, who owned a home in Potomac, Md., that he shared with his
American-born wife, became persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1992 and even more dramatically in May 1993, the
king tried to repair his relations with Washington by distancing
himself from Saddam, with whom he had once enjoyed the warmest of
ties _ frequent visits, nighttime barbecues and deep conversations
while fishing for carp.
</P>
<P>
   Saying Iraqis were suffering gravely under the American-led
boycott, he concluded that it was time for them to embrace
democratic government and end Saddam's dictatorial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually a combination of fading American memories of the gulf
war, intense lobbying in Washington on the king's behalf by Israeli
leaders and Jordan's strategic role as a buffer between Iraq, Syria
and Israel produced a rapprochement with the new Democratic
administration. On June 18, 1993, Clinton met Hussein at the White
House for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While proud of his family's and his country's Arab heritage,
Hussein always understood the need to maintain contact with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting between the king and a succession of Israeli
leaders took place in mid-1963 at the London home of his doctor
when the king was only 29 and had yet to consolidate power.
Subsequent sessions were held in Paris, in tents, in desert
trailers, aboard boats, on a Red Sea island, even in a Mossad safe
house north of Tel Aviv. Though widely rumored among politically
well connected Israelis, the meetings were almost never discussed
in public.
</P>
<P>
   For Hussein, who had few illusions about the dangerous
neighborhood in which he lived or the perfidy of many of his
neighbors, Israel was an insurance policy against Egyptian, Syrian,
Palestinian and even Iraqi ambitions. He always promised that one
day he would forge a formal peace and normal relations with the
Jewish state, a goal he doggedly and often dangerously pursued
throughout his rule.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he insisted that a peace must be
comprehensive, rejecting the notion that Arab nations could make a
separate accommodation with Israel. For this reason, he later
asserted in interviews, he opposed the Camp David peace accord
between Israel and Egypt in 1978 and their peace treaty the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his intense misgivings about Arafat's prior history and
future intentions, he was among the first Arab leaders to endorse
the Madrid peace talks sponsored by the Bush administration in
October 1991. He and Osama el-Baz, an adviser to President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt, were influential in persuading the Palestinians
to take part in the ground-breaking talks.
</P>
<P>
   And to encourage the process and keep the PLO under some check,
he agreed to include Palestinian representatives as nominal members
of the Jordanian delegation, thus defusing Israel's objections to
direct negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks between Israel and its Arab enemies, which
continued in Washington after the Madrid conference, dragged on
inconclusively month after month. Unbeknown to most of the
officials negotiating in Washington, Rabin had blessed a secret
effort by his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, to seek a
breakthrough directly with the PLO in Oslo. Hussein was not
informed.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to make peace between Jordan and Israel received an
unexpected impetus from a traumatic development in the summer of
1992: Hussein was found to have cancer. At the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota, he underwent surgery on his urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
   In September he returned to Jordan to a tumultuous welcome.
Unable to imagine their country without him, over a million
Jordanians _ then almost a third of his kingdom _ lined the roads
between the airport and the capital to welcome him home, waving
banners, pictures and placards, cheering, chanting and weeping.
</P>
<P>
   His illness and the fervor of his welcome intensified his
determination to make peace, Hussein said shortly before the treaty
with Israel was signed in 1994. While he had been ``overwhelmed by
the warmth, by the feelings of the people'' upon his return, he
said, ``I felt an element of fear _ of insecurity _ about what
might happen if I was not there, so I knew that I had to do
everything I could, in whatever time I had left, to achieve peace
and make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1992, Jordan and Israel agreed in writing for the
first time that their common goal was a formal peace treaty within
the framework of a comprehensive Arab-Israeli settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But in the summer of 1993, the PLO and Israel stunned the world
_ and Hussein _ by announcing that the Oslo talks had produced a
peace agreement between them. The king felt shunted aside and
feared that his poor country would be frozen out economically while
billions of dollars poured into the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the king ignored those concerns and welcomed the accord.
On Sept. 14, a day after the Oslo agreement was made official at
the White House, Jordan and Israel signed their own agenda
outlining the treaty they hoped to reach. In November Hussein and
Peres signed understandings on economic ties and other forms of
cooperation at a secret meeting in Amman. And in July 1994, Israel
and Jordan ended the state of war that had existed between them for
nearly half a century, signing a declaration on the White House
lawn that paved the way for a formal peace.
</P>
<P>
   This peace came on Oct. 26, 1994, in another stirring ceremony
witnessed by Clinton at Wadi Arava, a barren strip of desert
between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is without a doubt my proudest accomplishment: leaving my
people a legacy of peace,'' the king said in an interview in Nadwa
Palace in Amman shortly before the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   No Arab leader was more openly upset by the assassination of
Rabin in November 1995 than Hussein. Traveling openly to Jerusalem
for the first time since its loss to Israel in the 1967 war, he
wept openly at the funeral of his former enemy, his ``brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is peace that has been assassinated,'' Hussein said in his
tribute as Rabin's body was laid to rest under the pines and
cypresses of Mount Herzl, the cemetery of Israel's military and
spiritual heroes.
</P>
<P>
   When Benjamin Netanyahu became Israel's prime minister in 1996,
Hussein said Arab alarm over the change of government was
overwrought, and expressed confidence that the election would not
undermine the quest for peace.
</P>
<P>
   But he grew disillusioned with Netanyahu's leadership, which in
the king's view seriously eroded support for peace within Jordan.
While the king was noting that he had risked domestic discontent by
overtly pursuing peace, Netanyahu was authorizing expansion of
Jewish settlements on the West Bank and housing projects in East
Jerusalem, and taking other measures that offered a contrary,
hawkish vision.
</P>
<P>
   In a severe blow to relations in September 1997, Mossad agents
sought to kill a militant Islamic leader from Hamas on the streets
of Amman, but failed. The bungled assassination attempt threatened
Hussein's need to balance his inclinations toward peace with Israel
against his need to keep faith with his Palestinian constituents
and avoid offending Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1998, many Jordanians were openly deriding the
treaty with Israel as ``the king's peace,'' arguing that the
agreement had brought them no tangible gain. Instead of getting
better, the economy turned worse. The government became less
tolerant of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of crisis in Iraq also made many Jordanians fear that
once again they would somehow end up paying the price. But Hussein
refused to break with Netanyahu, fearing such a step would cause
greater instability, which would drive away the foreign investment
that his country so desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   The king's political troubles were overshadowed by illness once
again in mid-1998. In July, he told his brother, Crown Prince
Hassan, in a letter made public in Jordan that a new round of tests
at Mayo showed that he probably had cancer of the lymph glands,
which is usually fatal.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio broadcast from the Mayo Clinic in late July, Hussein
said he had undergone chemotherapy for the first time. ``My general
condition is excellent, my mind is clear and my morale is high,''
he said, departing from the traditional secrecy that prevails in
most Arab capitals when rulers fall ill. ``This is a new battle
among the many battles and, with God's help, we will fully overcome
this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In his years on the throne, Hussein had four wives, fathered 11
children and adopted a 12th. Besides Prince Hassan, he had another
brother, Mohammed, a sister, Basma, and 15 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his early years as king, many women were drawn to him,
and vice versa. A superb dancer who loved parties, the young king
quickly established a reputation as a playboy that he never fully
overcame.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Sherifa Dina Abdul Hamid, a Cambridge
intellectual and an older, distant cousin, ended after only 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamid, a lively, independent woman who found sleepy Amman
dull, had one child, a daughter. But she and Hussein had little
else in common. Though they parted amicably, she later married a
Palestinian commando who had taken part in the 1970 uprising
against the king.
</P>
<P>
   The king's second wife was Toni Avril Gardiner, whom the king
named Muna, Arabic for My Wish. The shy daughter of an English
colonel at the British Embassy, Muna had little interest in
politics and refused to be named queen. She and Hussein had four
children. The marriage ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The king then married Alia Baha ud-Din Toukan, the daughter of a
prominent Palestinian diplomat from Nablus, on the West Bank, who
had settled near Amman. He and the popular queen had two children
and adopted a daughter. Alia was killed in a helicopter accident in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Hussein took a fourth wife, an American, Lisa Halaby,
the daughter of Najeeb E. Halaby, a Texan who was head of Pan
American World Airways and the Federal Aviation Administration and
whose family came from Aleppo, Syria. She is known as Queen Noor,
or Light, in Arabic. She and King Hussein have two sons, Hamza and
Hashem, and two daughters, Iman and Rayah.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor and the king grew particularly close during his long
fight with cancer. According to family friends, she had urged the
king to designate her son, Hamzah, as heir in favor of Prince
Hassan. While concluding that Hamzah was still too young for the
job, Hussein did pass over his loyal, long serving brother in favor
of Abdullah, his eldest son.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Life Magazine shortly before his death,
Hussein said that his illness had been a ``bonding'' experience for
for him and Queen Noor, with whom relations had occasionally been
strained throughout their marriage. Expressing his love for her,
the king said, ``It is everything.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan, who died Sunday at 63, successfully
straddled two worlds in more than four tumultuous decades on the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Middle East's longest-reigning ruler, but took little
comfort from mere survival. Though he once said he yearned for a
``hero's death'' like that of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli enemy he ultimately embraced as his ``brother'' and
``partner in peace,'' Hussein succumbed not to the fanatic's bullet
but to cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which he had suffered from
for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   His twin legacies _ peace with his neighbors, including Israel,
and a fairly tolerant, stable society at home _ would be impressive
in any context. But they are particularly so given the often
violent politics of the Mideast and the unpromising country whose
stewardship he inherited while still a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein spent the final months of his life working relentlessly
for peace and a succession that he hoped would ensure both his
immediate family's control of the throne and political stability in
Jordan. Just days before his death, he stunned the world by
bypassing his younger brother, Prince Hassan, 51, and naming his
eldest son, 37-year-old Abdullah, as heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from settling succession, Hussein's last efforts were
aimed at advancing peace between the Arabs and Israel, a goal that
had eluded two generations of Hashemites.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn and pale, and made bald by four rounds of chemotherapy, he
left the Mayo Clinic in October 1998 to attend the Wye summit talks
in Maryland and help President Clinton coax Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators into concluding the next phase of their peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's rule was marked by both bold diplomatic strokes and
strategic blunders. Notable among the latter was his decision not
to join the American-led coalition that forced President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq to end his brief occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1967 he ignored Israel's private assurances and calls for
restraint in favor of joining Egypt and Syria in their war against
Israel. This cost him half of Jerusalem and all the territory on
the western side of the Jordan River, the West Bank, which his
grandfather had won in the 1948-1949 war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But after each setback, Hussein recovered his political
equilibrium and turned adversity to his advantage. Reputed among
Jordanians to enjoy baraka, or God's blessing, for dodging at least
12 assassination attempts and 7 plots to overthrow him, the king
ultimately accomplished what his grandfather had been unable to do:
in 1994 he secured a stunning peace with Israel, which he has
called his reign's ``crowning achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1994, standing on the White House lawn beside Rabin,
Hussein initialed an accord that technically ended the state of war
between the neighboring countries. And three months later, in an
emotional ceremony in his own land, he became the third Arab leader
to sign a formal peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Descended from a powerful Arabian family that traced its lineage
to Mohammed, Hussein ibn Talal ibn Hussein was born in Amman,
Jordan, on Nov. 14, 1935, to Crown Prince Talal and Princess Zein.
His family, like his country, were desperately poor. His baby
sister died of pneumonia ``in the bitter cold of an Amman winter,''
he later wrote. The family house had no heat.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, King Abdullah, had been born and raised among
the tribes of the Arabian Desert, but Hussein, in contrast, was
educated at Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt, and at Harrow
and the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his Hashemite family owed much to Britain. To protect
against French encroachment on British interests in Palestine, and
to reward the family for leading the Great Arab Revolt against the
Ottomans, who were allied to Germany, in 1916, Winston Churchill,
then the colonial secretary, had carved Transjordan out of Syria in
1921, agreed to finance the emirate with a modest subsidy and gave
it to Abdullah to rule under British mandate. In 1946 Transjordan
became independent. Abdullah, who never abandoned the dream of
recreating and ruling a modern Arab empire, became king and renamed
his country the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   After Abdullah's assassination outside the Al Aqsa Mosque in
Jerusalem in 1951, which Hussein witnessed, Prince Talal, who had
been treated at a Swiss clinic for schizophrenia, took the throne.
When his attacks worsened, the parliament removed him, on Aug. 11,
1952, less than a month after Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt helped
topple King Farouk in a military coup. Hussein, then 16, was
proclaimed Jordan's king just as intense Arab nationalism was
taking hold throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, when Arab nationalist passions were running high and
conservative monarchies like his were a constant target of coups
and assault, Hussein tried to damp growing popular unrest by
dismissing Sir John Bagot Glubb, Glubb Pasha, the British general
who had trained Jordan's Arab Legion. He also abandoned liberal
measures that he and his father had adopted, declared martial law
and called out the army against his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein fared less well in his second crisis: the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. Although Israel had urged restraint, he flew to
Cairo shortly before the war to sign a defense treaty with Nasser,
despite Nasser's earlier plotting against him. Although the king
later admitted that he had known he was taking a risk by siding
with Syria and Egypt, he said he had feared the fury of his people,
many of them Palestinians, more than Israel. A senior Jordanian
official said most Jordanians so strongly favored the war that the
king's choice, in fact, was between ``war and civil war.''

 UNDATED: civil war.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a costly decision. As a result of the 1967 war, Israel
occupied all of Jerusalem and the West Bank. Thousands of
Palestinian refugees fled into arid Jordan, increasing the
population by about half. Three-quarters of the population of Amman
was now of Palestinian origin, making it the largest Palestinian
city. Unlike other Arab rulers, Hussein offered the refugees
citizenship and a passport.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which increasingly viewed Hussein as vulnerable and
an obstacle to its struggle, challenged the Hashemites' control of
Jordan. In despair over the prospect of a civil war, the king later
acknowledged, he briefly pondered abdication, as he would again
during other crises. Instead, he decided to confront Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Though Arafat subsequently maintained that the Jordanian army
killed as many as 20,000 in putting down the unrest, conservative
estimates put Palestinian losses at 2,000. While Hussein had not
sought this test of wills, his legitimacy was never challenged
again.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn once into an Arab war with Israel, Hussein would not be
seduced a second time. Before the 1973 war, according to Israeli
diplomats, he cautioned Israel that Egypt and Syria were planning
to fight, but his warning was discounted. And while the king sent
Jordanian armored units to fight alongside Syrian forces, he
avoided fighting Israel along their common border, a decision that
precluded the loss of still more land to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth major crisis, the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Hussein
effectively sided with radical Arab passions in his tilt toward
Saddam. He insisted at the time _ and even later _ that he had been
seeking a peaceful solution and had been neutral, saying, ``I took
the side of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But his stance infuriated Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations,
not to mention Washington, whose gifts and foreign aid had helped
him to survive and Jordan to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   While proud of his family's and his country's Arab heritage,
Hussein always understood the need to maintain contact with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting between the king and a succession of Israeli
leaders took place in mid-1963 at the London home of his doctor
when the king was only 29 and had yet to consolidate power.
Subsequent sessions were held in Paris, in tents, in desert
trailers, aboard boats, on a Red Sea island, even in a Mossad safe
house north of Tel Aviv. Though widely rumored among politically
well connected Israelis, the meetings were almost never discussed
in public.
</P>
<P>
   For Hussein, who had few illusions about the dangerous
neighborhood in which he lived or the perfidy of many of his
neighbors, Israel was an insurance policy against Egyptian, Syrian,
Palestinian and even Iraqi ambitions. He always promised that one
day he would forge a formal peace and normal relations with the
Jewish state, a goal he doggedly and often dangerously pursued
throughout his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to make peace between Jordan and Israel received an
unexpected impetus from a traumatic development in the summer of
1992: Hussein was found to have cancer. At the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota, he underwent surgery on his urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
   In September he returned to Jordan to a tumultuous welcome.
Unable to imagine their country without him, over a million
Jordanians _ then almost a third of his kingdom _ lined the roads
between the airport and the capital to welcome him home, waving
banners, pictures and placards, cheering, chanting and weeping.
</P>
<P>
   His illness and the fervor of his welcome intensified his
determination to make peace, Hussein said shortly before the treaty
with Israel was signed in 1994. While he had been ``overwhelmed by
the warmth, by the feelings of the people'' upon his return, he
said, ``I felt an element of fear _ of insecurity _ about what
might happen if I was not there, so I knew that I had to do
everything I could, in whatever time I had left, to achieve peace
and make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1992, Jordan and Israel agreed in writing for the
first time that their common goal was a formal peace treaty within
the framework of a comprehensive Arab-Israeli settlement.
</P>
<P>
   This formal peace came on Oct. 26, 1994, in another stirring
ceremony witnessed by President Clinton at Wadi Arava, a barren
strip of desert between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is without a doubt my proudest accomplishment: leaving my
people a legacy of peace,'' the king said in an interview in Nadwa
Palace in Amman shortly before the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In his years on the throne, Hussein had 4 wives, fathered 11
children and adopted a 12th. Even in his early years as king, many
women were drawn to him, and vice versa. A superb dancer who loved
parties, the young king quickly established a reputation as a
playboy that he never fully overcame.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Sherifa Dina Abdul Hamid, a Cambridge
intellectual and an older, distant cousin, ended after only 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamid, a lively, independent woman who found sleepy Amman
dull, had one child, a daughter. But she and Hussein had little
else in common. Though they parted amicably, she later married a
Palestinian commando who had taken part in the 1970 uprising
against the king.
</P>
<P>
   The king's second wife was Toni Avril Gardiner, whom the king
named Muna, Arabic for My Wish. The shy daughter of an English
colonel at the British Embassy, Muna had little interest in
politics and refused to be named queen. She and Hussein had four
children. The marriage ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The king then married Alia Baha ud-Din Toukan, the daughter of a
prominent Palestinian diplomat from Nablus, on the West Bank, who
had settled near Amman. He and the popular queen had two children
and adopted a daughter. Alia was killed in a helicopter accident in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Hussein took a fourth wife, an American, Lisa Halaby,
the daughter of Najeeb E. Halaby, a Texan who was head of Pan
American World Airways and the Federal Aviation Administration and
whose family came from Aleppo, Syria. She is known as Queen Noor,
or Light, in Arabic. They have two sons, Hamza and Hashem, and two
daughters, Iman and Rayah.

IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, CHRISTIAN COALITION STILL ENCOURAGES IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Va.)  (Eds. see also Repubs-Politics, Impeach-Rdp, Impeach-Hitchens) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Anyone looking for evidence of a Republican
constituency that is stoking the impeachment fires in the Senate
need look no further than the Christian Coalition's state dinner
here on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best received moments of the evening came when the
state's two Republican House members, Reps. Charles Bass and John
E. Sununu, were honored with the coalition's ``pro-family awards''
for ``their very, very courageous vote'' in the House to impeach
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the award by Shelly Uscinski, the
coalition's director in this state, which traditionally holds the
first presidential primary, drew a prolonged standing ovation from
the audience of roughly 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so proud of both of them for upholding the rule of law
and showing our children there is a right and a wrong and we must
always, always, do what's right,'' Ms. Uscinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Bass and Sununu could not accept their awards personally because
they were at a congressional retreat where they were trying to
devise an issue agenda for their party. At the gathering in
Williamsburg, Va., Republican lawmakers were warned by pollsters
that the impeachment matter could damage the party next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who founded the
Christian Coalition, declared to the crowd, ``I'm glad you gave an
award tonight to two men who said we must stand up to rid ourselves
of this moral evil.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a meeting with reporters earlier, Robertson repeated his
concern that stunned many conservatives last month when he said the
Republicans had lost the public relations battle with the White
House. On Saturday, he said it was time to give up and ``turn away
from the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky axis.'' Robertson added: ``In
jury terms, they have a hung jury and the sooner they can wrap it
up the better. If you don't have the votes, what can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the dinner speakers, Alan Keyes, a former State
Department official who is running for the Republican nomination
for president, drew thunderous applause when he indirectly took
issue with Robertson and called for Clinton's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes implored the audience, ``Don't let the senators off the
hook.''
</P>
<P>
   The ovations grew louder as he declared: ``Don't conclude that
this process is anywhere near over. I think we ought to send a
message to every Senate Republican and Democrat: That the future of
this nation is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The other presidential contenders who spoke here, Steve Forbes,
the millionaire publisher; Gary Bauer, the social conservative
leader, and former Vice President Dan Quayle, in a videotape, spoke
of a moral decay in Washington but refrained from directly
addressing the Senate trial.

<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan, who died Sunday at 63, successfully
straddled two worlds in more than four tumultuous decades on the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   Cautious by instinct and habit, Hussein took pride in his
Western impulses and his Arab roots, though he acknowledged that
the combination sometimes produced policies that even admirers
criticized as erratic and conflicting.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Middle East's longest-reigning ruler, but took little
comfort from mere survival. Though he once said he yearned for a
``hero's death'' like that of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli enemy he ultimately embraced as his ``brother'' and
``partner in peace,'' Hussein succumbed not to the fanatic's bullet
but to cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which he had suffered from
for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   His twin legacies _ peace with his neighbors, including Israel,
and a fairly tolerant, stable society at home _ would be impressive
in any context. But they are particularly so given the often
violent politics of the Mideast and the unpromising country whose
stewardship he inherited while still a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Personally courageous, modest and unfailingly polite, Hussein
was known for his political tolerance, pardoning even those who had
tried to kill him. Though he had made war against Israel in 1967,
he was the only Arab leader secure enough to kneel before Israeli
families who had lost children in a terrorist attack on his soil in
1997, offering his condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein spent the final months of his life working relentlessly
for peace and a succession that he hoped would ensure both his
immediate family's control of the throne and political stability in
Jordan. Just days before his death, he stunned the world by
bypassing his younger brother, Prince Hassan, 51, and naming his
eldest son, 37-year-old Abdullah, as heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   In a long, bitter letter to his brother explaining his decision
and publicizing a deep family rift, Hussein assailed Hassan's
performance as regent, saying that his brother's palace supporters
_ ``climbers,'' he denounced them _ had tried to ``destroy Jordan''
by spreading vicious gossip about his wife and children and
``meddling'' in the military to ``settle scores'' and divide and
politicize the army. Hussein also revealed that Hassan, his
designated heir for 34 years, had opposed his wish that his own
sons succeed his brother as king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein said the family discord had given him ``many sleepless
nights'' and prompted him to intervene ``from my sickbed'' at the
Mayo Clinic in Minnesota to end the intrigues and political
jockeying for power in Jordan. But he complimented Hassan for his
``sincere efforts'' and his loyal acceptance of his demotion.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning decision not only took Jordan and the United States
by surprise, it demonstrated that Hussein, though ailing and in
pain, remained the undisputed ruler of his kingdom til' the last
days of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from settling the succession, Hussein's last efforts were
aimed at advancing peace between the Arabs and Israel, a goal that
had eluded two generations of Hashemites.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn and pale, and made bald by four rounds of chemotherapy, he
left the Mayo Clinic in October 1998 to attend the Wye summit talks
in Maryland and help President Clinton coax Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators into concluding the next phase of their peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had an ounce of strength, I would have done my utmost to
be there and to help in any way I can,'' he said in an emotional,
impromptu speech at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Saying there had been ``enough destruction, enough death, enough
waste'' during the five decades of Arab-Israeli conflict, he
pleaded for accommodation. ``We have no right to dictate through
irresponsible action or narrow-mindedness the future of our
children or their children's children,'' the king said.
</P>
<P>
   A short man who used his deep, mesmerizing voice to maximum
political effect, Hussein was to a large extent a reflection and
prisoner of his geography.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of a slip of land the size of South Carolina,
seven-eighths of it desert, without oil or other valuable
resources, he was surrounded by far more powerful nations, many of
them intermittently hostile. And over two-thirds of Jordan's more
than 4.5 million people are Palestinian, many of whom feel little
allegiance to him, his family or their adopted country.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Hussein's lack of options, former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger wrote in 1979, in his book ``White House
Years,'' that the king ``had the capacity neither for independent
action nor for blackmail, which are the stuff of Middle Eastern
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, by charting a mostly centrist, pragmatic course
and avoiding the radical passions and fashionable political trends
that destabilized or toppled several other hereditary leaders in
the Mideast, Hussein created a relatively peaceful, conservative,
modern country whose citizens enjoy decent government and more
political freedom than those of most other Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
   His rule was marked by both bold diplomatic strokes and
strategic blunders. Notable among the latter was his decision not
to join the American-led coalition that forced Saddam of Iraq to
end his brief occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1967 he ignored Israel's private assurances and calls for
restraint in favor of joining Egypt and Syria in their war against
Israel. This cost him half of Jerusalem and all the territory on
the western side of the Jordan River, the West Bank, which his
grandfather Abdullah had won in the 1948-1949 war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But after each setback, Hussein recovered his political
equilibrium and turned adversity to his advantage. Reputed among
Jordanians to enjoy baraka, or God's blessing, for dodging at least
12 assassination attempts and 7 plots to overthrow him, the king
ultimately accomplished what his grandfather had been unable to do:
in 1994 he secured a stunning peace with Israel, which he has
called his reign's ``crowning achievement.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In July 1994, standing on the White House lawn beside Rabin,
Hussein initialed an accord that technically ended the state of war
between the neighboring countries. And three months later, in an
emotional ceremony in his own land, he became the third Arab leader
to sign a formal peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have at last carried out the will of King Abdullah,'' he
declared on the White House lawn, referring to his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the legacy of political pragmatism as well as the fate
of Abdullah, Jordan's founder and first king, strongly shaped his
rule. In the summer of 1951, when he was 15, Hussein saw his
grandfather gunned down at the entrance of the silver-domed Al Aqsa
Mosque in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein said another bullet had ricocheted off a medal on the
uniform he had been told to wear by his grandfather, who had become
a scapegoat for the fury of the Arabs over their humiliating defeat
by Israel in 1948-49 and for Palestinian rage over Abdullah's
secret meetings with Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In a memoir, Hussein said he had learned painful, important
lessons from witnessing the killing of his grandfather, a
``wonderful old man'' and a ``man of desert ways to whom I owe more
than I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview more than 30 years later, the king said he would
never forget how Abdullah's aides, his ``so-called friends,'' had
scattered in all directions ``like frightened women in the night''
minutes after the killing, or how they had opened political
intrigues within hours.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule he learned, the king said in his memoirs, was
``the unimportance of death: that when you have to die, you die,''
a fatalism he manifested at critical moments throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also saw that rulers cannot depend on their advisers to save
or guide them, that they must make their own decisions and go their
own way,'' he said in an interview in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   This determination to keep his own counsel, and to be prepared
to suffer the consequences of rash actions, allowed him to brush
aside the savage criticism periodically directed at him by
Westerners and Arabs alike.
</P>
<P>
   Though he shared Abdullah's commitment to the Arab cause, the
assassination reinforced his skepticism of fellow Arab rulers. And
from that day onward, he carried a gun or kept one within easy
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the assassination taught him that if he was to pursue
Jordan's strategic interest by maintaining his grandfather's
dialogue with Israel, such contacts had to remain secret. Even
toward the end of his life, Hussein refused to discuss details of
what Israelis estimate were more than 500 hours of talks with every
Israeli leader except Menachem Begin, a series of contacts that the
king initiated in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Descended from a powerful Arabian family that traced its lineage
to Mohammed, Hussein ibn Talal ibn Hussein was born in Amman,
Jordan, on Nov. 14, 1935, to Crown Prince Talal and Princess Zein.
His family, like his country, were desperately poor. His baby
sister died of pneumonia ``in the bitter cold of an Amman winter,''
he later wrote. The family house had no heat.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had been born and raised among the tribes of the
Arabian Desert, but Hussein, in contrast, was educated at Victoria
College in Alexandria, Egypt, and at Harrow and the Royal Military
Academy at Sandhurst, in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his Hashemite family owed much to Britain. To protect
against French encroachment on British interests in Palestine, and
to reward the family for leading the Great Arab Revolt against the
Ottomans, who were allied to Germany, in 1916, Winston Churchill,
then the colonial secretary, had carved Transjordan out of Syria in
1921, agreed to finance the emirate with a modest subsidy and gave
it to Abdullah to rule under British mandate. In 1946 Transjordan
became independent. Abdullah, who never abandoned the dream of
recreating and ruling a modern Arab empire, became king and renamed
his country the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Arab leaders, Abdullah _ like his grandson Hussein
_ quickly grasped that he would have to deal with the Zionists.
Contacts between them began as early as 1926, and in 1946 Abdullah
and Jewish leaders agreed informally that Jordan would not oppose
establishment of a Jewish state if the Zionists supported his rule
over the Arab parts of Palestine. But after war erupted in 1948,
Abdullah invaded the newborn state of Israel, winning control of
half of Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   After Abdullah's assassination, Prince Talal, who had been
treated at a Swiss clinic for schizophrenia, took the throne. When
his attacks worsened, the parliament removed him, on Aug. 11, 1952,
less than a month after Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt helped topple
King Farouk in a military coup. Hussein, then 16, was proclaimed
Jordan's king just as intense Arab nationalism was taking hold
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein always relished physical if not political danger. As if
the extraordinary challenge of sheer survival were not sufficient,
he parachuted, flew stunts in his jets and raced high-performance
cars and motorcycles across the desert (insisting in his later
years on being photographed with a helmet as an example of safety
to his people). Risk became second nature, he told a journalist,
``what water is to fish.'' Compounding the risk, he chain-smoked
cigarettes, a habit he tried innumerable times to break.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein himself conceded that at first he made many mistakes as
ruler. ``Those early years were hard for me,'' he said once in an
interview. ``I learned late.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, when Arab nationalist passions were running high and
conservative monarchies like his were a constant target of coups
and assault, Hussein tried to damp growing popular unrest by
dismissing Sir John Bagot Glubb, Glubb Pasha, the British general
who had trained Jordan's Arab Legion. He also abandoned liberal
measures that he and his father had adopted, declared martial law
and called out the army against his own people.
</P>
<P>
   As the immediate threat to his rule receded, Hussein gradually
replaced British protectors with Americans, whose influence was
growing in the Middle East as Britain's faded. According to senior
Jordanian and American officials, ties between the Central
Intelligence Agency and Hussein were cemented in 1957 and 1958,
when American intelligence officials learned of a coup plot
involving Jordanian diplomats and warned the king.
</P>
<P>
   Relations like those, an American airlift of oil in 1957 when
Jordan was boycotted by Egypt, Syria and Iraq, and monthly checks
from the CIA helped persuade the king that Washington was a
reliable ally. (The CIA payments reportedly ended in 1977, when
their disclosure embarrassed the king.)
</P>
<P>
   Hussein fared less well in his second crisis: the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. Although Israel had urged restraint, he flew to
Cairo shortly before the war to sign a defense treaty with
President Nasser, despite Nasser's earlier plotting against him.
Although the king later admitted that he had known he was taking a
risk by siding with Syria and Egypt, he said he had feared the fury
of his people, many of them Palestinians, more than Israel. A
senior Jordanian official said most Jordanians so strongly favored
the war that the king's choice, in fact, was between ``war and
civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a costly decision. As a result of the 1967 war, Israel
occupied all of Jerusalem and the West Bank. Thousands of
Palestinian refugees fled into arid Jordan, increasing the
population by about half. Three-quarters of the population of Amman
was now of Palestinian origin, making it the largest Palestinian
city. Unlike other Arab rulers, Hussein offered the refugees
citizenship and a passport.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which increasingly viewed Hussein as vulnerable and
an obstacle to its struggle, challenged the Hashemites' control of
Jordan. In despair over the prospect of a civil war, the king later
acknowledged, he briefly pondered abdication, as he would again
during other crises. Instead, he decided to confront Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Though Arafat subsequently maintained that the Jordanian Army
killed as many as 20,000 in putting down the unrest, conservative
estimates put Palestinian losses at 2,000. While Hussein had not
sought this test of wills, his legitimacy was never challenged
again.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn once into an Arab war with Israel, Hussein would not be
seduced a second time. Before the 1973 war, according to Israeli
diplomats, he cautioned Israel that Egypt and Syria were planning
to fight, but his warning was discounted. And while the king sent
Jordanian armored units to fight alongside Syrian forces, he
avoided fighting Israel along their common border, a decision that
precluded the loss of still more land to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his quiet contacts with Israel continued even during
the war. According to a recent book by an Israeli journalist,
Samuel Segev, the king secretly persuaded Israel's chief of staff
to divert artillery from a hill on the Golan Heights where he was
scheduled to address the armored brigade he had sent to help the
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   The king never commented publicly on accounts like these, but
friends and diplomats said such disclosures by Israeli officials
infuriated him.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein paid a high political price for his 1970 assault on the
PLO and his de facto abstention from the 1973 war.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Rabat, Morocco, in 1974, the Arab League
anointed the PLO as the ``sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people.'' Since Jordan was more than half Palestinian
and had ruled the West Bank between 1948 and 1967, the Arabs had
decided, in effect, that he could no longer protect what amounted
to his own national interests, he said in an interview a decade
later.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth major crisis, the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Hussein
in effect sided with radical Arab passions in his tilt toward
Iraq's president, Saddam. He insisted at the time _ and even later
_ that he had been seeking a peaceful solution and had been
neutral, saying, ``I took the side of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But his stance infuriated Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations,
not to mention Washington, whose gifts and foreign aid had helped
him to survive and Jordan to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   American officials understood the king's need to placate Saddam,
given Jordan's economic dependence on Iraqi trade and the
passionate pro-Iraqi stance of most Jordanians, especially
Palestinians, who saw an Iraqi victory as the first step toward
regaining a homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But American patience snapped in February 1991 when Hussein gave
an emotional speech condemning the air strikes against Iraq as ``a
war against all Arabs and Muslims'' aimed at ``destroying all the
achievements of Iraq'' and placing the entire region ``under
foreign domination.''
</P>
<P>
   The king once again paid a high price. The gulf states suspended
aid, costing Amman almost a billion dollars a year, and the influx
of some 300,000 more Palestinian refugees from Kuwait and elsewhere
in the gulf severely strained Jordan's economy. In Washington the
king, who owned a home in Potomac, Md., that he shared with his
American-born wife, became persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1992 and even more dramatically in May 1993, the
king tried to repair his relations with Washington by distancing
himself from Saddam, with whom he had once enjoyed the warmest of
ties _ frequent visits, nighttime barbecues and deep conversations
while fishing for carp.
</P>
<P>
   Saying Iraqis were suffering gravely under the American-led
boycott, he concluded that it was time for them to embrace
democratic government and end Saddam's dictatorial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually a combination of fading American memories of the gulf
war, intense lobbying in Washington on the king's behalf by Israeli
leaders and Jordan's strategic role as a buffer between Iraq, Syria
and Israel produced a rapprochement with the new Democratic
administration. On June 18, 1993, Clinton met Hussein at the White
House for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While proud of his family's and his country's Arab heritage,
Hussein always understood the need to maintain contact with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting between the king and a succession of Israeli
leaders took place in mid-1963 at the London home of his doctor
when the king was only 29 and had yet to consolidate power.
Subsequent sessions were held in Paris, in tents, in desert
trailers, aboard boats, on a Red Sea island, even in a Mossad safe
house north of Tel Aviv. Though widely rumored among politically
well connected Israelis, the meetings were almost never discussed
in public.
</P>
<P>
   For Hussein, who had few illusions about the dangerous
neighborhood in which he lived or the perfidy of many of his
neighbors, Israel was an insurance policy against Egyptian, Syrian,
Palestinian and even Iraqi ambitions. He always promised that one
day he would forge a formal peace and normal relations with the
Jewish state, a goal he doggedly and often dangerously pursued
throughout his rule.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he insisted that a peace must be
comprehensive, rejecting the notion that Arab nations could make a
separate accommodation with Israel. For this reason, he later
asserted in interviews, he opposed the Camp David peace accord
between Israel and Egypt in 1978 and their peace treaty the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his intense misgivings about Arafat's prior history and
future intentions, he was among the first Arab leaders to endorse
the Madrid peace talks sponsored by the Bush administration in
October 1991. He and Osama el-Baz, an adviser to President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt, were influential in persuading the Palestinians
to take part in the ground-breaking talks.
</P>
<P>
   And to encourage the process and keep the PLO under some check,
he agreed to include Palestinian representatives as nominal members
of the Jordanian delegation, thus defusing Israel's objections to
direct negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks between Israel and its Arab enemies, which
continued in Washington after the Madrid conference, dragged on
inconclusively month after month. Unbeknown to most of the
officials negotiating in Washington, Rabin had blessed a secret
effort by his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, to seek a
breakthrough directly with the PLO in Oslo. Hussein was not
informed.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to make peace between Jordan and Israel received an
unexpected impetus from a traumatic development in the summer of
1992: Hussein was found to have cancer. At the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota, he underwent surgery on his urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
   In September he returned to Jordan to a tumultuous welcome.
Unable to imagine their country without him, over a million
Jordanians _ then almost a third of his kingdom _ lined the roads
between the airport and the capital to welcome him home, waving
banners, pictures and placards, cheering, chanting and weeping.
</P>
<P>
   His illness and the fervor of his welcome intensified his
determination to make peace, Hussein said shortly before the treaty
with Israel was signed in 1994. While he had been ``overwhelmed by
the warmth, by the feelings of the people'' upon his return, he
said, ``I felt an element of fear _ of insecurity _ about what
might happen if I was not there, so I knew that I had to do
everything I could, in whatever time I had left, to achieve peace
and make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1992, Jordan and Israel agreed in writing for the
first time that their common goal was a formal peace treaty within
the framework of a comprehensive Arab-Israeli settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But in the summer of 1993, the PLO and Israel stunned the world
_ and Hussein _ by announcing that the Oslo talks had produced a
peace agreement between them. The king felt shunted aside and
feared that his poor country would be frozen out economically while
billions of dollars poured into the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the king ignored those concerns and welcomed the accord.
On Sept. 14, a day after the Oslo agreement was made official at
the White House, Jordan and Israel signed their own agenda
outlining the treaty they hoped to reach. In November Hussein and
Peres signed understandings on economic ties and other forms of
cooperation at a secret meeting in Amman. And in July 1994, Israel
and Jordan ended the state of war that had existed between them for
nearly half a century, signing a declaration on the White House
lawn that paved the way for a formal peace.
</P>
<P>
   This peace came on Oct. 26, 1994, in another stirring ceremony
witnessed by Clinton at Wadi Arava, a barren strip of desert
between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is without a doubt my proudest accomplishment: leaving my
people a legacy of peace,'' the king said in an interview in Nadwa
Palace in Amman shortly before the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   No Arab leader was more openly upset by the assassination of
Rabin in November 1995 than Hussein. Traveling openly to Jerusalem
for the first time since its loss to Israel in the 1967 war, he
wept openly at the funeral of his former enemy, his ``brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is peace that has been assassinated,'' Hussein said in his
tribute as Rabin's body was laid to rest under the pines and
cypresses of Mount Herzl, the cemetery of Israel's military and
spiritual heroes.
</P>
<P>
   When Benjamin Netanyahu became Israel's prime minister in 1996,
Hussein said Arab alarm over the change of government was
overwrought, and expressed confidence that the election would not
undermine the quest for peace.
</P>
<P>
   But he grew disillusioned with Netanyahu's leadership, which in
the king's view seriously eroded support for peace within Jordan.
While the king was noting that he had risked domestic discontent by
overtly pursuing peace, Netanyahu was authorizing expansion of
Jewish settlements on the West Bank and housing projects in East
Jerusalem, and taking other measures that offered a contrary,
hawkish vision.
</P>
<P>
   In a severe blow to relations in September 1997, Mossad agents
sought to kill a militant Islamic leader from Hamas on the streets
of Amman, but failed. The bungled assassination attempt threatened
Hussein's need to balance his inclinations toward peace with Israel
against his need to keep faith with his Palestinian constituents
and avoid offending Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1998, many Jordanians were openly deriding the
treaty with Israel as ``the king's peace,'' arguing that the
agreement had brought them no tangible gain. Instead of getting
better, the economy turned worse. The government became less
tolerant of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of crisis in Iraq also made many Jordanians fear that
once again they would somehow end up paying the price. But Hussein
refused to break with Netanyahu, fearing such a step would cause
greater instability, which would drive away the foreign investment
that his country so desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   The king's political troubles were overshadowed by illness once
again in mid-1998. In July, he told his brother, Crown Prince
Hassan, in a letter made public in Jordan that a new round of tests
at Mayo showed that he probably had cancer of the lymph glands,
which is usually fatal.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio broadcast from the Mayo Clinic in late July, Hussein
said he had undergone chemotherapy for the first time. ``My general
condition is excellent, my mind is clear and my morale is high,''
he said, departing from the traditional secrecy that prevails in
most Arab capitals when rulers fall ill. ``This is a new battle
among the many battles and, with God's help, we will fully overcome
this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In his years on the throne, Hussein had four wives, fathered 11
children and adopted a 12th. Besides Prince Hassan, he had another
brother, Mohammed, a sister, Basma, and 15 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his early years as king, many women were drawn to him,
and vice versa. A superb dancer who loved parties, the young king
quickly established a reputation as a playboy that he never fully
overcame.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Sherifa Dina Abdul Hamid, a Cambridge
intellectual and an older, distant cousin, ended after only 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamid, a lively, independent woman who found sleepy Amman
dull, had one child, a daughter. But she and Hussein had little
else in common. Though they parted amicably, she later married a
Palestinian commando who had taken part in the 1970 uprising
against the king.
</P>
<P>
   The king's second wife was Toni Avril Gardiner, whom the king
named Muna, Arabic for My Wish. The shy daughter of an English
colonel at the British Embassy, Muna had little interest in
politics and refused to be named queen. She and Hussein had four
children. The marriage ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The king then married Alia Baha ud-Din Toukan, the daughter of a
prominent Palestinian diplomat from Nablus, on the West Bank, who
had settled near Amman. He and the popular queen had two children
and adopted a daughter. Alia was killed in a helicopter accident in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Hussein took a fourth wife, an American, Lisa Halaby,
the daughter of Najeeb E. Halaby, a Texan who was head of Pan
American World Airways and the Federal Aviation Administration and
whose family came from Aleppo, Syria. She is known as Queen Noor,
or Light, in Arabic. She and King Hussein have two sons, Hamza and
Hashem, and two daughters, Iman and Rayah.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor and the king grew particularly close during his long
fight with cancer. According to family friends, she had urged the
king to designate her son, Hamzah, as heir in favor of Prince
Hassan. While concluding that Hamzah was still too young for the
job, Hussein did pass over his loyal, long serving brother in favor
of Abdullah, his eldest son.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Life Magazine shortly before his death,
Hussein said that his illness had been a ``bonding'' experience for
for him and Queen Noor, with whom relations had occasionally been
strained throughout their marriage. Expressing his love for her,
the king said, ``It is everything.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan, who died Sunday at 63, successfully
straddled two worlds in more than four tumultuous decades on the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Middle East's longest-reigning ruler, but took little
comfort from mere survival. Though he once said he yearned for a
``hero's death'' like that of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli enemy he ultimately embraced as his ``brother'' and
``partner in peace,'' Hussein succumbed not to the fanatic's bullet
but to cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which he had suffered from
for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   His twin legacies _ peace with his neighbors, including Israel,
and a fairly tolerant, stable society at home _ would be impressive
in any context. But they are particularly so given the often
violent politics of the Mideast and the unpromising country whose
stewardship he inherited while still a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein spent the final months of his life working relentlessly
for peace and a succession that he hoped would ensure both his
immediate family's control of the throne and political stability in
Jordan. Just days before his death, he stunned the world by
bypassing his younger brother, Prince Hassan, 51, and naming his
eldest son, 37-year-old Abdullah, as heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from settling succession, Hussein's last efforts were
aimed at advancing peace between the Arabs and Israel, a goal that
had eluded two generations of Hashemites.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn and pale, and made bald by four rounds of chemotherapy, he
left the Mayo Clinic in October 1998 to attend the Wye summit talks
in Maryland and help President Clinton coax Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators into concluding the next phase of their peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's rule was marked by both bold diplomatic strokes and
strategic blunders. Notable among the latter was his decision not
to join the American-led coalition that forced President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq to end his brief occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1967 he ignored Israel's private assurances and calls for
restraint in favor of joining Egypt and Syria in their war against
Israel. This cost him half of Jerusalem and all the territory on
the western side of the Jordan River, the West Bank, which his
grandfather had won in the 1948-1949 war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But after each setback, Hussein recovered his political
equilibrium and turned adversity to his advantage. Reputed among
Jordanians to enjoy baraka, or God's blessing, for dodging at least
12 assassination attempts and 7 plots to overthrow him, the king
ultimately accomplished what his grandfather had been unable to do:
in 1994 he secured a stunning peace with Israel, which he has
called his reign's ``crowning achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1994, standing on the White House lawn beside Rabin,
Hussein initialed an accord that technically ended the state of war
between the neighboring countries. And three months later, in an
emotional ceremony in his own land, he became the third Arab leader
to sign a formal peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Descended from a powerful Arabian family that traced its lineage
to Mohammed, Hussein ibn Talal ibn Hussein was born in Amman,
Jordan, on Nov. 14, 1935, to Crown Prince Talal and Princess Zein.
His family, like his country, were desperately poor. His baby
sister died of pneumonia ``in the bitter cold of an Amman winter,''
he later wrote. The family house had no heat.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, King Abdullah, had been born and raised among
the tribes of the Arabian Desert, but Hussein, in contrast, was
educated at Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt, and at Harrow
and the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his Hashemite family owed much to Britain. To protect
against French encroachment on British interests in Palestine, and
to reward the family for leading the Great Arab Revolt against the
Ottomans, who were allied to Germany, in 1916, Winston Churchill,
then the colonial secretary, had carved Transjordan out of Syria in
1921, agreed to finance the emirate with a modest subsidy and gave
it to Abdullah to rule under British mandate. In 1946 Transjordan
became independent. Abdullah, who never abandoned the dream of
recreating and ruling a modern Arab empire, became king and renamed
his country the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   After Abdullah's assassination outside the Al Aqsa Mosque in
Jerusalem in 1951, which Hussein witnessed, Prince Talal, who had
been treated at a Swiss clinic for schizophrenia, took the throne.
When his attacks worsened, the parliament removed him, on Aug. 11,
1952, less than a month after Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt helped
topple King Farouk in a military coup. Hussein, then 16, was
proclaimed Jordan's king just as intense Arab nationalism was
taking hold throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, when Arab nationalist passions were running high and
conservative monarchies like his were a constant target of coups
and assault, Hussein tried to damp growing popular unrest by
dismissing Sir John Bagot Glubb, Glubb Pasha, the British general
who had trained Jordan's Arab Legion. He also abandoned liberal
measures that he and his father had adopted, declared martial law
and called out the army against his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein fared less well in his second crisis: the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. Although Israel had urged restraint, he flew to
Cairo shortly before the war to sign a defense treaty with Nasser,
despite Nasser's earlier plotting against him. Although the king
later admitted that he had known he was taking a risk by siding
with Syria and Egypt, he said he had feared the fury of his people,
many of them Palestinians, more than Israel. A senior Jordanian
official said most Jordanians so strongly favored the war that the
king's choice, in fact, was between ``war and civil war.''

   It was a costly decision. As a result of the 1967 war, Israel
occupied all of Jerusalem and the West Bank. Thousands of
Palestinian refugees fled into arid Jordan, increasing the
population by about half. Three-quarters of the population of Amman
was now of Palestinian origin, making it the largest Palestinian

trailers, aboard boats, on a Red Sea island, even in a Mossad safe
house north of Tel Aviv. Though widely rumored among politically
well connected Israelis, the meetings were almost never discussed
in public.
</P>
<P>
   For Hussein, who had few illusions about the dangerous
neighborhood in which he lived or the perfidy of many of his
neighbors, Israel was an insurance policy against Egyptian, Syrian,
Palestinian and even Iraqi ambitions. He always promised that one
day he would forge a formal peace and normal relations with the
Jewish state, a goal he doggedly and often dangerously pursued
throughout his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to make peace between Jordan and Israel received an
unexpected impetus from a traumatic development in the summer of
1992: Hussein was found to have cancer. At the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota, he underwent surgery on his urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
   In September he returned to Jordan to a tumultuous welcome.
Unable to imagine their country without him, over a million
Jordanians _ then almost a third of his kingdom _ lined the roads
between the airport and the capital to welcome him home, waving
banners, pictures and placards, cheering, chanting and weeping.
</P>
<P>
   His illness and the fervor of his welcome intensified his
determination to make peace, Hussein said shortly before the treaty
with Israel was signed in 1994. While he had been ``overwhelmed by
the warmth, by the feelings of the people'' upon his return, he
said, ``I felt an element of fear _ of insecurity _ about what
might happen if I was not there, so I knew that I had to do
everything I could, in whatever time I had left, to achieve peace
and make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1992, Jordan and Israel agreed in writing for the
first time that their common goal was a formal peace treaty within
the framework of a comprehensive Arab-Israeli settlement.
</P>
<P>
   This formal peace came on Oct. 26, 1994, in another stirring
ceremony witnessed by President Clinton at Wadi Arava, a barren
strip of desert between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is without a doubt my proudest accomplishment: leaving my
people a legacy of peace,'' the king said in an interview in Nadwa
Palace in Amman shortly before the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In his years on the throne, Hussein had 4 wives, fathered 11
children and adopted a 12th. Even in his early years as king, many
women were drawn to him, and vice versa. A superb dancer who loved
parties, the young king quickly established a reputation as a
playboy that he never fully overcame.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Sherifa Dina Abdul Hamid, a Cambridge
intellectual and an older, distant cousin, ended after only 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamid, a lively, independent woman who found sleepy Amman
dull, had one child, a daughter. But she and Hussein had little
else in common. Though they parted amicably, she later married a
Palestinian commando who had taken part in the 1970 uprising
against the king.
</P>
<P>
   The king's second wife was Toni Avril Gardiner, whom the king
named Muna, Arabic for My Wish. The shy daughter of an English
colonel at the British Embassy, Muna had little interest in
politics and refused to be named queen. She and Hussein had four
children. The marriage ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The king then married Alia Baha ud-Din Toukan, the daughter of a
prominent Palestinian diplomat from Nablus, on the West Bank, who
had settled near Amman. He and the popular queen had two children
and adopted a daughter. Alia was killed in a helicopter accident in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Hussein took a fourth wife, an American, Lisa Halaby,
the daughter of Najeeb E. Halaby, a Texan who was head of Pan
American World Airways and the Federal Aviation Administration and
whose family came from Aleppo, Syria. She is known as Queen Noor,
or Light, in Arabic. They have two sons, Hamza and Hashem, and two
daughters, Iman and Rayah.

   Shake-Up at BMW Stirs Speculation of Takeover
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of two top executives at BMW on Friday will prompt
renewed interest by other automakers in buying the German maker of
sporty coupes and sedans, but it remains unclear whether the
controlling Quandt family wants to sell, auto executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen and Ford both let BMW know last autumn that they were
interested in buying the German auto maker, executives said in
recent interviews. But BMW rejected both overtures without ever
entering into formal negotiations because the Quandt family refused
to consider a sale.

<P>
   Long Articles in Shorter Pieces
</P>
<P>
   The narrative newspaper series, with its focus on individuals,
their trials and their emotions, is gaining converts, but it
demands a large chunk of a reader's time. One solution is to make
each piece shorter and let the narrative run for weeks. A prototype
for this approach is a 29-day series at The Philadelphia Inquirer
called ``Blackhawk Down,'' which recreated a battle in Somalia
during which two Marine helicopters were shot down and 18 Americans
were killed. The Inquirer also made 3,000 copies of a CD-ROM
containing the series.

   Paying for a Place at Amazon.com
</P>
<P>
   Publishers have started to pay Amazon.com, the online bookstore,
to feature their books in its prominent book recommendations. But
there are no disclosures to readers about these paid placements.
The practice is a sign of Amazon's growing power and importance in
the book industry.

   A Theory for a Faster Internet
</P>
<P>
   A former data network designer for Bell Labs says the answer to
sorting out the welter of data that often collide at the Internet's
bottlenecks is not bigger and more expensive traffic routers but an
esoteric branch of mathematics known as group theory.

   Tough Week in Court for Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   A low point for Microsoft in its antitrust trial came last week
when the government repeatedly pointed out inconsistencies that
seemed misleading in a videotape Microsoft had presented as
important evidence. The foul-up becomes more damaging than
embarrassing, antitrust experts say, if it undermines the
credibility of Microsoft's evidence in general in the eyes of Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will deliver a verdict in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is set to introduce a Web site for women on Monday,
hoping to capture what many think is the largest and

   Even Unseen, Fashion Show Was a Hit
</P>

 UNDATED: it clean.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thus far, Amazon's advertising opportunity has been limited to
about 20 to 50 publishers, many of them large companies like Random
House, Simon &AMP; Schuster, Penguin Putnam, HarperCollins, IDG and
Warner Books. But Amazon has plans to expand its offerings to the
next tier of 500 publishers with efforts planned to promote the
program at the book industry's annual trade convention in April.
</P>
<P>
   The program is as much of an experiment for publishers, who are
also trying to determine the effectiveness of this approach.
</P>
<P>
   IDG Books Worldwide, in Foster City, Calif., is so pleased with
the results of its participation that it is increasing its online
marketing. For $2,500, it placed its ``Tax Guides for Dummies'' on
a special seasonal tax center Web page and watched its sales
increase 56 percent after it was posted Jan. 15 and highlighted in
the ``Amazon.com Recommends'' feature, which lauded the title as
one of a handful of ``bellwether'' guides. The Dummies tax guide
also appeared in the ``New and Notable'' category of Amazon's
business and investing Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a virtual world, placement is critical,'' said Steven
Berkowitz, president of IDG, who said the company had paid to
feature at least 20 titles and would continue to do so. The program
works well, he said, because customers feel ``the titles are
recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Books and its sister company, Little, Brown &AMP; Co., are
still evaluating the best strategies for advertising online after
promoting more than 15 books through the program, according to
Sarah Ford, who manages online accounts for Warner.
</P>
<P>
   They paid to feature Roy Blount Jr.'s book of puppy poetry
(``What does that mean `expensive shoe?' I ate it because it
smelled like you.'' ) in Amazon's gift center during the holiday
season and saw sales soar to 1,000 copies a week from about 100.
Amazon's reviewer had advised readers, ``You'll never be able to
resist this entertaining and affectionate look at our canine
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ford said results were also significant for an online
promotion of ``Spyder Web,'' a techno-thriller from Warner Books
that appeared in the ``What We're Reading'' and ``New and Notable''
slots of Amazon's mystery and thriller home page.
</P>
<P>
   In its review, Amazon lauded ``Spyder Web,'' for its ``cool,
careful structure'' and the promise of its first-time author, Tom
Grace, who may represent ``the next generation of Tom Clancys.''
Other critics were more reserved; Kirkus Reviews, which also
appeared on an Amazon listing, labeled the book ``a spirited if
clunky techno-thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's reviewers also praised other books placed by Warner and
Little, Brown. They called Michael Connelly's ``Angels Flight''
``another masterwork'' and featured it on its mystery and thriller
page under the heading ``Amazon.com Recommends.'' They also
commended ``Toyer,'' a featured title placed by Little, Brown, as a
``driving (sometimes melodramatic) suspense novel.'' The New York
Times Book Review panned the same title, about a lunatic who
disabled a series of female victims with a gruesome surgical
procedure, as a ``macabre first novel'' that was ``stunning at
first glance, but hollow at the core.''
</P>
<P>
   The merchandising of featured books can come at a cost, but
Amazon stresses that there are still books worthy of highlighting
without charge. For example, it gave prominent placement free to
``Careless Love,'' the second volume of Peter Guralnick's biography
of Elvis Presley, and the novel ``Amy and Isabelle'' by Elizabeth
Strout.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our home page, the overwhelming majority of featured
books in a given month do not have co-op dollars behind them,''
said Bill Curry, a spokesman for Amazon, who noted that Amazon's
list of top 20 titles last Friday contained at least nine that were
featured without advertising support.
</P>
<P>
   That assurance, though, is not entirely comforting to smaller
publishers who lack large advertising budgets to back their books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible, because I've been in love with Amazon,'' said
John Oakes, the publisher of Four Walls Eight Windows in New York.
``They're very efficient. They really do a good job. You can't tell
me that they would pick the same books. If they went to people and
said, `We've chosen these books,' there's obviously no independent
publisher who's going to pay 12 grand.''

 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I'm scared!'' said Uma Thurman. Ms. Thurman, all 5
feet 11{ pale gold inches of her, was about to perform live for
almost the first time in her life, in an update of Moliere's
``Misanthrope'' at the Classic Stage Company, a 180-seat theater in
the East Village. On screen, Ms. Thurman is known for lowering her
forehead, looking up at men from under her brow and talking to them
in a husky come-hither voice.
</P>
<P>
   In films, there are retakes and camera tricks, and you need only
learn a few lines of the script at a time. When acting for film,
Ms. Thurman said, ``you can fantasize about the good moments in
each take and how it will be put all together, and leave it in
trustworthy hands'' of the editors. But in the theater, she said,
``you're the final word.'' The production with Ms. Thurman, now in
previews, opens on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Why would she want to do it, risk making a fool of herself in a
role that must be recited almost entirely in rhymed couplets? Is
Ms. Thurman trying to ``stretch''? That is a word bandied about a
lot as film stars take to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   She is in line with a string of movie stars who have been trying
theater lately, including Nicole Kidman in David Hare's ``Blue
Room,'' based on the Arthur Schnitzler play ``La Ronde,'' and John
Turturro at the Classic Stage last December in ``Waiting for
Godot.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, Alec Baldwin and
Angela Bassett did ``Macbeth.'' Kevin Spacey is about to perform in
``The Iceman Cometh.'' Ms. Thurman's husband, Ethan Hawke, still
does a little theater.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Misanthrope'' is the story of Alceste, a man of
letters and a moral snob who inveighs against the sycophancy and
hypocrisy of the court of Louis XIV. He is in love with a much
younger woman, Celimene, whom he suspects of having affairs with
everyone around her.
</P>
<P>
   In the new version of the play by Martin Crimp, Roger Rees, who
won a Tony award for best actor for his role in ``The Life and
Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby,'' has the role of Alceste, who is
now a playwright. In Crimp's play, Celimene becomes Jennifer, an
American movie star in London. Michael Emerson plays Alceste's
friend John. And Nick Wyman is Covington, a talentless critic who
insists on reading his play to Alceste.
</P>
<P>
   Celimene, the leading lady in the original ``Misanthrope,'' is
one of the theater's more difficult roles. Is she simply a
coquette? Or does she possibly love Alceste, who is driving her
away with his hectoring?
</P>
<P>
   It is ``a very hard part,'' said Ms. Thurman. ``I'm still really
searching, working.''
</P>
<P>
   She must also hold her own against Rees, a veteran of the Royal
Shakespeare Company, who is a strong and self-confident stage
presence. Like a chamber music piece, the play requires precise
timing and delicate interplay between the principals.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Misanthrope'' is a challenge for not only Ms. Thurman
but just about everybody connected with the production.
</P>
<P>
   It is being directed by Barry Edelstein, who is in his first
season as artistic director of the Classic Stage Company. And
Crimp, instead of relying on the 1954 Richard Wilbur translation as
many contemporary productions do, has retranslated the play. Crimp,
who also translated Ionesco's ``Chairs'' for Broadway, has now
tampered with a play revered in the canon and filled it with hip
references.
</P>
<P>
   The new version closely follows the form of the original and
maintains the tradition of mocking real people, as Moliere did
three centuries ago. Crimp refers to David Hare unflatteringly and
parodies his play ``Skylight'' in the critic Covington's dreadful
play.
</P>
<P>
   Crimp's Jennifer also makes fun of a certain magazine editor:
``Now there's an editor with no imagination/who's managed to carve
out a reputation/ for being at the cutting edge/by draining meaning
out of life and language.'' Edelstein said the character ``is
modeled on Tina Brown,'' a former editor of The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a movie director who, Jennifer says, ``imagines
he's the height of moral bravery/for writing scripts that deal with
genocide and slavery./Believes he's wise, but what he's done is
crossed/the feel-good factor with the Holocaust.'' The lines are an
allusion to Steven Spielberg, said Edelstein. ``She's sending up
famous people in order to show off how witty and clever she is,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Further insults include references to an Andrew Lloyd Webber
musical as ``a natural disaster'' and an Alan Ayckbourn work as
``one more mediocre British play/hailed as an artistic triumph in
the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   But most interesting for audiences in London, where the play
opened at the Young Vic, has been Covington, who is a mixture of
two powerful British theater critics, Michael Coveney and Michael
Billington.
</P>
<P>
   The critics took revenge in their mixed reviews of the London
production. ``A middle-aged, menopausal white male specimen named
Michael Covington,'' Coveney wrote in The Observer. ``Not an
amalgam, surely, of myself and Michael Billington? Pretentious,
badly dressed _ nous?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Coveney called the production lively. And Billington,
reviewing it for The Guardian, said it was ``agile, topical and
cheeky.'' But, he wrote, the ``vain and posturing theater critic
called Covington _ can't be one of us, surely?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thurman said before a rehearsal, ``I don't agree with that
name-using.''
</P>
<P>
   But Crimp, in a telephone interview from London, defended the
allusions. Speaking of his references to the critics, he said, ``I
would say it's a compliment to both of them.'' The play, he said,
is meant to be ``an attack on the theatrical establishment,
highbrow theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein said the references were in keeping with the Classic
Stage Company's mandate ``to produce the classics from a
contemporary point of view, rather than just reviving'' them. With
an updated play ``an audience in New York has the same sensation
the audience had in 1666 in the court of Louis XIV,'' he said.
``The audience is sitting there: `Omigod! I can't believe he just
said that.'''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding who should play Jennifer, Edelstein said he thought
``it would be a charge to have a movie star playing off this great
English classical actor,'' Rees. He chose Ms. Thurman, he said,
because ``I knew her to be an actress of style.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thurman, whose films include ``Pulp Fiction,'' ``Gattaca''
and ``Henry and June,'' said that when Edelstein first approached
her, she almost turned him down. ``I thought he just wanted me for
hype,'' she said. But ``he was so passionate about the piece.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going through an interesting time in my life,'' said Ms.
Thurman, who is 28 and had a baby daughter nearly seven months ago.
``I'm willing to begin again.'' Ms. Thurman, who comes from an
intellectual family, said she needed the challenge. Her father is
the Columbia University professor Robert Thurman, an expert on
Buddhism. ``I felt compelled to do something in which I would be
forced with pain or pleasure to grow.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Maya, Ms. Thurman's daughter. Movies seem out of
the question right now. ``Does a child want to hang out in a
trailer?'' Ms. Thurman asked.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, who has published one novel and is working on
another, has taken over caring for the baby. And during her long
break, Ms. Thurman can bike home to their loft to feed Maya. ``It's
a miracle to memorize an entire text and be a mother,'' Ms. Thurman
said, because of ``the presence of progesterone in your brain.''
</P>
<P>
   In late January Ms. Thurman and the company rehearsed in a
borrowed space at the Atlantic Theater Company on West 16th Street
in Manhattan. In some ways, rehearsing a play can be like making a
movie in fragmentary takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, I'm sure the moral values we apply/undergo subtle
changes as the years roll by,'' Ms. Thurman, as Jennifer, said in
an arch voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful, Uma,'' Edelstein later said of her reading. ``The
more it drips, the funnier it is.''
</P>
<P>
   During a rehearsal of a costume-party scene, Ms. Thurman recited
Jennifer's lines: ``Play us some music. And nothing too arty./I'm
sick of this. I want to party.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thurman began to dance, gliding swanlike about the room to
the music of the Pet Shop Boys, singing ``Always on My Mind.'' ``If
that's the life you want to lead,'' Rees, as Alceste, said to her,
``so be it. Just don't come to me when you need/help, because I
shan't be there./You may not believe in despair/but I do.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Ms. Thurman interrupted a dance rehearsal to say
she didn't think she should move around too much in the baroque
dress. She had tried on the costume and the bodice was very tight.
``It'll look silly,'' she said. ``You'll have to get someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein rushed to placate his star. ``No, never anyone else,''
he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one by one, Ms. Thurman lured the members of the company
into her dance, stopping in front of each one, looking up under her
lowered brow and extending a long arm as Edelstein watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's adoring her,'' he said of Ms. Thurman's Jennifer.
``Bathing in the light of her triumph. She wins.''

AILING YELTSIN MAY GO TO JORDAN
</HEADLINE>
   (See also JORDAN-RDP, JORDAN-ABDULLAH, JORDAN-ISRAEL, JORDAN-NOOR,
OBIT-HUSSEIN) 
(DW) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris N. Yeltsin appeared Sunday night to be
issuing a strong signal that although ailing, he is still in
command and an important factor in Russian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Russian news agencies reported that the 67-year-old president,
who has scheduled trips to Paris and Vienna in recent months only
to cancel at the last minute, would lead the Russian delegation to
the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin spokesman, Dimitri Yakushkin, declined to discuss
the reports. This reluctance suggested that Yeltsin wanted to go
but that some members of his inner circle, and perhaps his doctors,
might have reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin is reminding everyone that it is too early to write
him off,'' Yevgeny Kiselyov, the anchorman of a Sunday interview
program on the NTV television network.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Yeltsin has been derided as a mere figurehead,
incapable of effectively governing his unruly nation. He has been
reported in his Kremlin office only three times this year.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding his problems, Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov has
also been strengthening his position, seemingly at the expense of
the president.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Primakov recently sent a letter to Parliament
outlining his ideas for a political truce without checking with
Yeltsin, according to Kremlin officials. The Kremlin made its
displeasure known the next day. But that only fortified the
impression that the president was not fully in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov, who is a presidential aspirant,
has has repeatedly argued that Russia needs a more active leader _
like himself _ who might come to power in early elections.
</P>
<P>
   The precise nature of Yeltsin's ailments is not known. He never
fully recovered his strength after a quintuple heart bypass
operation in 1996. He has suffered from pneumonia and bronchitis
and most recently was hospitalized for a bleeding ulcer, according
to the Kremlin. He left a hospital last weekend for a government
sanatorium.
</P>
<P>
   His last foreign trip took place in October, when he traveled to
Central Asia. It was a public relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, Yeltsin lost his footing at a ceremony in
Uzbekistan and later gave a confused rendering of a speech. He had
trouble signing an official document in Kazakhstan. Finally, the
trip was cut short for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's funeral would be less demanding than a diplomatic
mission since Yeltsin would not be expected to carry out talks with
foreign leaders or give a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   It would also give Yeltsin, who enjoys summitry, an opportunity
to be seen with world leaders and to upstage Primakov, who
considers himself a specialist on the Middle East.
</P>

<P>
   But a flight to Jordan could still be stressful for the frail
president.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Yeltsin paid a surprise visit to the Kremlin, where
he met with Primakov and reportedly got a briefing on the efforts
to reach a compromise with the Communist-dominated Parliament,
which is trying to impeach Yeltsin.

OUTPOURING OF ISRAELI GRIEF, AND WARINESS FOR THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With an outpouring of great feeling, Israelis on
Sunday mourned King Hussein of Jordan, whom they regarded as a
mensch in a kaffiyeh, a larger-than-life figure who rose above the
enmities of the region to forge with them a genuine peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a model for the entire leadership of the Middle East,
for how an enemy can become a friend,'' President Ezer Weizman said
at a televised news conference within minutes of the announcement
of the king's death.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some Israelis looked ahead warily to an
altered regional dynamic in which Jordan, Israel's strategic ally
in the Mideast, would no longer have a leader with the charisma,
experience and clout of Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The new king, Hussein's oldest son, Abdullah, 37, has pledged to
reaffirm his father's commitment to the peace effort. But he is
young and unknown and faces a series of difficult choices in
building diplomatic relationships throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Hussein is irreplaceable,'' said Joseph Alpher, director
of the American Jewish Committee in Israel. ``Since Sadat, there
hasn't been an Arab leader with his kind of dedication to the peace
process. With all due respect to his successor, it will take him a
lot of time to develop as a leader and come anywhere near
projecting the kind of authority and international influence of his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ruled Jordan for more than 46 years, from the time
50-year-old Israel was a toddler nation. Israelis grew up with him,
watching his evolution from opponent of the Jewish homeland to its
only real friend in the Arab world. After years of discreet
cooperation with Israeli leaders _ involving many secret
negotiations, but never a full state visit to Israel _ Hussein
signed a peace treaty with the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   What Israelis came to see as Hussein's genuine good will toward
them was crystalized by a single moment in 1997: when he paid a
condolence call to the families of Israeli victims of a Jordanian
gunman, kneeling to hug them as they wailed, tears in his eyes. The
scene played repeatedly on Israeli television on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The king said one sentence I'll never forget: `I promise you
peace,' '' Miriam Meiri, whose daughter was killed in the attack,
said in a phone interview. ``It gave me the strength to get up the
next morning with a smile and tell Yaela, my daughter in heaven:
`There will be peace.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had a rocky relationship
with the king that oscillated between businesslike and chilly,
delivered remarks of bountiful praise Sunday, lauding Hussein as
``a historic figure'' and ``a great man, a man who knew war and
grew to hate it.'' He said he felt confident that the king's heir
would ``follow in his father's footsteps and strengthen the peace
between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the transition of power in Jordan raises concerns here,
Israeli analysts said they believed there would be more continuity
than change because of the parallel strategic interests of Israel
and Jordan, who share a long border, quiet since 1967, when Israel
captured the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem from Jordan in the Six
Day War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contacts with Israel have been developed and maintained by
a wide variety of people and institutions in Jordan,'' said Asher
Susser, an expert on Jordan at the Dayan Center at Tel Aviv
University. ``That remains in place, and is not solely dependent on
the personality of King Hussein.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Israel and Jordan need each other, as they have historically,
since the days of quiet alliance between David Ben Gurion and the
Hashemite monarchy. For Israel, Jordan, as a moderate country in a
strategic location, serves as a buffer state to absorb and deflect
regional threats from countries like Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   And for Jordan, Israel is the key to negotiating its interests
when the final status talks between the Israelis and the
Palestinians tackle such thorny issues as borders, the status of
the holy places in Jerusalem, and the return of Palestinian
refugees, most of them from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are topics of contention with Arafat,'' Alpher said,
referring to Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. ``King Hussein
would have been hard put to stand up for Jordan, and, now that
Arafat will be the senior partner in the Jordanian-Palestinian
relationship, his successor will be at a real disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein threw the full weight of his family's prestige behind
the peace treaty with Israel, curbing opposition in Jordan to
normal ties with Israel. ``I'm sure the Jordanian elite will
continue to play this role, but it will be more difficult without
the king's personal charisma,'' said Shimon Shamir, who served as
Israel's first ambassador to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinian Authority declared
three days of mourning for Hussein, and some Palestinians tied
Jordanian flags to their car antennas or taped pictures of the king
to their shop windows.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, radio stations played mournful music on Sunday, as
they do on days when Israeli leaders die or ordinary Israelis are
killed in terrorist attacks. The Israeli flag at the Allenby Bridge
crossing into Jordan was lowered to half-staff. The Cabinet,
meeting in special session after Hussein's death, held a moment of
silence. And Israelis gathered to express their sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, we got the feeling that he's our partner,''
said Alon David, 41, who owns a toy store on the Ben Yehuda
pedestrian mall, where a terrorist attack killed one of his
employees in 1997. ``He became a part of us. He connected with us.
He had a Western orientation, like ours, which is lacking in other
Arab leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Beit Shemesh, which Hussein visited to apologize
for the acts of the Jordanian gunmen, Shimon and Ruhama Cohen
remembered his apology for their daughter's killing in a way that
will endure. They gave birth to another daughter Sunday, and, as a
gesture to the king, named her Jordan.

<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ He is the other president with a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that he was one of the first presidents,'' Lon Beard,
10, said of George Washington during a visit to his 18th-century
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Lon's sister, Coral Krebs, 28, added, ``He's on the dollar
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Posterity is a rough game. After more than 200 years in the
public eye, George Washington has been boiled down to a fact and
some change.
</P>
<P>
   But the first president has his first-ever media and marketing
team. And 1999 is a campaign year: the year Washington goes for the
hearts of his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by stagnating attendance and a rocky recognition
factor, especially among schoolchildren, the directors of Mount
Vernon, the capital of George Washington's legacy, have inaugurated
a $3 million public relations campaign to reposition him as a
national figure with what the spinmasters might call ``heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Leonardo DiCaprio, Diana and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for something with a lot of sizzle,'' said
Michael Quinn, one of Washington's campaign men. ``He had great
name recognition, but not a real high quotient of excitement. Dull,
boring. He was the first president. Of course. So what?''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is ``Only in 1999,'' the name for a year of
celebration tagged to the bicentennial of Washington's death on
Dec. 14, 1799.
</P>
<P>
   In what scholars are afraid is a crowd-pleasing shift from
education to entertainment at historic sites, Mount Vernon's
advance guard has sent out 2,000 press kits and contacted 50,000
communities to encourage festivities that range from planting trees
to tolling bells.
</P>
<P>
   Two new Web sites and three new books, including his diaries,
will also help to establish Washington as First Guy: architect,
environmentalist, entrepreneur, fashion plate, both flawed and
fascinating. Robert Redford wants to make the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is already on the road with a blockbuster show,
``Treasures From Mount Vernon,'' parked at the New York Historical
Society until Feb. 22. His ivory teeth, if not his smile, have been
a great photo op.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, Presidents' Day, the day he must share with Lincoln,
he will be reintroduced at his home by the Potomac River. Mount
Vernon has added a new museum and refurnished the mansion with 100
objects owned by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A new ``Death and Funeral Procession Tour'' will provide black
armbands for visitors. The master bedroom will be set up as the
death scene, complete with blood-letting equipment used by
physicians who tried to save him from his sudden cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly a third of his blood was drained,'' said Sally
McDonough, manager of media relations at Mount Vernon. ``That took
us two days to figure out.'' There was discussion of piping in bad
smells, but consideration of the idea was put on hold because staff
historians could not agree on what would be authentic to the
period.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration will be capped by a televised 18th-century state
funeral on Dec. 18. ``We're going to try to make it feel like the
Diana funeral,'' said Melissa Groppel, manager of special events,
who is handling the hand-crafted coffin and costumed cortege.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's makeover comes not a sound bite too soon. Annual
attendance at Mount Vernon is far below its peak of 1.3 million
visitors, which was reached more than three decades ago. In a 1991
Gallup Poll, the last one that asked people whom they considered
the three greatest presidents, Washington's name came up in only 21
percent of the responses, lagging far behind Abraham Lincoln, John
F. Kennedy and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly every indication is that he's on a downward slide,''
said James Rees, the resident director of Mount Vernon. Even
Washington's appearance on the dollar bill, Rees said, is a mixed
blessing. ``It's the wrong image,'' he said. ``The family never
liked that Gilbert Stuart portrait. It shows him as a grubby old
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, which for
141 years has owned and operated Mount Vernon as a nonprofit
historic site, decided that they had to dust off the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've got a great product,'' said Claire Edwards, an
association member from Connecticut. ``This is somebody more than
the guy who sells cars on Presidents' Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The current image campaign, including a nose job to the famous
Jean Antoine Houdon bust, refining its profile, is a war George
Washington cannot afford to lose: Mount Vernon needs to boost its
attendance by 10 percent to cover its bicentennial costs.
</P>
<P>
   Behind its security gates, the neoclassical mansion, in stark
fields that overlook the river, is like a White House in exile.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, a squadron of geese threaded the sky above it.
Wild turkeys crossed the driveway of the brick colonial-style
administrative buildings. It was a brilliant blue day to meet the
president's generals.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, in what used to be the Ladies' Association's dormered
bedrooms, is the war office for Washington's campaign team. In a
nearby $1 million, 23,000-square-foot center, 375 volunteers will
be manning toll-free telephone lines to answer requests for
bicentennial materials.
</P>
<P>
   In his office, Rees recalls the results of focus groups
commissioned by Mount Vernon in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``They often floated back to Jefferson, as being so creative,
interesting,'' he said. Referring to the 1995 movie ``Jefferson in
Paris,'' and a 1997 television biography produced by Ken Burns,
Rees said, ``I think he's got better PR.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's people are sensitive about Jefferson and his
winning edge in the public's imagination. ``While Jefferson and
others were yip-yapping back and forth about the Declaration of
Independence, quite frankly, Washington's out there winning the
war,'' Rees said heatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, the director of programs, said: ``He's actually led one
of the more exciting lives you can imagine. And he's absolutely the
embodiment of a rags-to-riches story.'' Washington, a self-taught
surveyor with a modest income, rose to command the Continental Army
at 43 and was unanimously elected to be the first president at age
57. ``He's a victim of his own success,'' Quinn said. ``He made it
look too easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brookhiser, the author of ``Founding Father:
Rediscovering George Washington'' (The Free Press, 1996) said
Washington's achievements were beyond dispute. ``Washington was one
of the main reasons that the country succeeded,'' he said. ``It's a
success story that we take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookhiser explained: ``He knew what he was doing and he had the
strength of character to do it. We tend to remember the bright boys
_ Jefferson and Madison.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the tabloid taste for scandals, scholars agree there were
none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faults are attractive in today's world,'' said Rees, who would
be happy to deal with the kind of publicity that Sally Hemings, the
slave who may have borne Jefferson's child, brought to Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   With controversy and the Burns documentary providing extra draw,
Monticello received 560,000 visitors in 1997, an increase of 30,000
from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon also takes cues from Graceland, the Elvis Presley
mansion. It received 700,000 visitors last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep a close eye on Graceland,'' Rees said. ``We get some
people coming not because they're history buffs but because
Americans like to see where famous people live and eat.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The high interest in museum-going has not been shared by
historic homes, according to Museum News, an industry publication.
An estimated 117 million people visited history museums and
historical sites in 1997, but more than twice that number visited
art museums in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Washington, Jefferson and Madison were Monet, Picasso and
van Gogh, our attendance would skyrocket,'' said Rees.
</P>
<P>
   Who is today's improved, more competitive Washington?
</P>
<P>
   He is intelligent and inventive _ an architect. ``We're talking
Frank Lloyd Wright,'' said Dennis Pogue, who reconstructed
Washington's innovative design for a 16-sided barn at Mount Vernon
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He is an environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never chopped down the cherry tree,'' said Rees, ``though
frankly, I'd be happy with the myths now, if people could remember
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He has investment savvy _ he owned 70,000 acres of shrewdly
acquired land.
</P>
<P>
   He is human _ thin-skinned, quick-tempered. As an eligible
bachelor he had a crush on a married neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   John Riley, who is director of education and scholarship at the
White House Historical Association, and was previously Mount
Vernon's historian, cautioned about making Washington contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sea change for historic homes like Mount Vernon,''
Riley said. ``It's getting into character development, which can be
a tricky thing. Washington wouldn't have wanted to be thought like
everyone else, believe me. He was the leader of the nation. You did
not pat him on the back when you met him on the street. He was not
one of the guys.''

Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has made clear his game is far

<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. is set to introduce a new Web site for women
on Monday, hoping to capture what many feel is the largest and
fastest-growing market on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Called Women Central, the site will feature content from
Women.com, the largest online publisher of women's material, as
well as original material, including Microsoft's own Underwire
online magazine. The company has signed the Unilever Corp. as the
site's primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The new site will be a channel on Microsoft's revamped MSN
network, the fledgling Web site that started out as its own online
service three years ago and has since undergone several
transformations. Microsoft would not disclose how much it was
spending on the new site.
</P>
<P>
   With Women Central, Microsoft is hoping to tap into what Jupiter
Communications, a new-media research company, calls the
fastest-growing audience on the Web, a market expected to grow to
65 million in 2002 from 45 million today. Last year, according to
Jupiter, 55 percent of newcomers to the Internet were women, up
from 50 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the new site, Microsoft hopes to help women do what
they do best on line: stay put, said Michael Goff, MSN's director
of programming. Men tend to surf the Web and jump from site to
site, Goff said, but women are more likely to visit fewer sites to
complete specific tasks, such as join online discussion groups,
find specific information or buy something.
</P>
<P>
   Like most content sites these days, Microsoft is hoping Women
Central will become a so-called portal site for women, where they
can find most of what they want on the Web, including shopping and
online discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But while women may represent the fastest-growing segment on the
Web, the market already is crowded, and whether the company will
find the right formula is anybody's guess. In November, NBC bought
a stake in iVillage, another site aimed at women. Two weeks ago,
the Hearst Corp. announced a joint venture with Women.com to create
a mega-site for women. Through the deal, Women.com gained
distribution rights for Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping and
Hearst's other women's magazines.

</P>
<P>
   Of course, they will first have to develop their skills in the

</P>
<P>
   The food servers at Teatro Zinzanni have all mastered this art.
They can also run the 50-yard dash in under six seconds while

</P>
<P>
   They'd better run fast. The maitre d' is an ogre, capable of

   Sometimes it is difficult to separate the authentic food servers

</P>
<P>
   The prospect of fine dining in a tent during the damp darkness
of a Seattle winter did not appeal to me when it was first

   Actually, he didn't sit in the soup the night my wife and I
attended Teatro Zinzanni with tickets we received as Christmas
gifts. What the circus performers, singers, dancers and waiters
delivered instead was a terrific evening of entertainment and an
enjoyable meal in a Moulin Rouge setting.
</P>
<P>
   One note of warning. Bald-headed dinner patrons sitting in the
front row will find themselves at the epicenter of the hilarity
more often than Juliette the Dishwasher, stage name for French
circus clown Nathalie Tarlet.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the food service seminar comes too late to help
the careers of a few clowns you and I have encountered over the
years in Seattle restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   There was one gentleman employed in a New Orleans-style
restaurant that operated briefly in Pioneer Square. One night the
waiter delivered a dessert portion of Bananas Foster. He poured
banana liqueur over the top, touched it with a match and then raced
across the room to perform service at another table. By the time he
returned the dessert looked like a nuclear meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   He removed the puddle of ashes, apologized and delivered another
portion of Bananas Foster, only to repeat his earlier error. By
this time diners witnessing the twin disasters were falling out of
their chairs laughing.
</P>
<P>
   If he had waited a few years, the waiter might have been able to
earn a living torching a couple of hundred bananas a night at
Teatro Zinzanni.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of recipes that could be included if you
decide to stage a Zinzanni dinner party in your own home.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer Street Salmon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey
</P>
<P>
   2 salmon fillet portions
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons capers
</P>
<P>
   Mix the mustard and honey and divide over the tops of the
fillets. Cover an oven dish with a thin layer of water. Carefully
lay out the fish and bake, uncovered, in a 400-degree oven for
about 15 minutes. Remove to two plates, top with capers and this
serves two.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could let the salmon cool, divide it into four portion
and serve as a salad over dressed spinach leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a suitable soup course that used to be featured at a
wonderful French restaurant in Edmonds, Wash., where the food
servers rarely burst out of the kitchen at a full sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Chez Claude Soup
</P>
<P>
   2 large potatoes, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 leeks
</P>
<P>
   2 stalks celery
</P>
<P>
   1 onion
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot
</P>
<P>
   1 green pepper
</P>
<P>
   8 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup cream
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Fresh parsley, minced
</P>
<P>
   Chop the potatoes, leeks, celery, onion, carrot and green
pepper, then dump in a heavy saucepan. Cover with waxed paper and
``sweat'' the veggies for 8 minutes over medium-low heat.
</P>
<P>
   Throw away the waxed paper, add 8 cups of chicken stock to the
pan and simmer the soup until the vegetables are tender, about 35
minutes. Puree in a blender in batches, return to the pot and add
cream, plus salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls (it serves
eight) and sprinkle with parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to throw your own dinner party, all you have to do is find
four, six or eight clowns to invite. I know what you are going to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem.''

   AMMAN _ Through the fog, you could hear the voices from half a
mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our blood, with our soul, we sacrifice ourselves for
you.'' And as the mist swept around me _ such wind, such very thick
fog _ I could see tiny squares above the thousands of shrouded
figures outside the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Their posters portrayed the dead king who lay only a few hundred
meters from us; fighter pilot Hussein, Bedouin warrior Hussein,
Field Marshal Hussein. But not a single photograph of the king and
his son together.
</P>
<P>
   The new King Abdullah _ how strange that name sounds _ was not
in the thoughts of the screaming men or of the old woman who
prostrated herself in the torrent of freezing water streaming down
the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he was part of the protocol. He wore his father's red
``kuffiah'' headdress to the assembly building to be sworn in by
its obedient parliamentarians, saluting for the last time before
his father's portrait.
</P>
<P>
   And the kings and presidents are preparing to fly into Amman for
a state funeral that will be replete with the kind of rhetoric King
Hussein loathed. And we shall all watch his son.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah. It has a strange resonance; of another king
almost half a century ago at the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem,
Abdullah's great grandfather, with a bullet in his head and his
turban rolling away from him, while a teenage boy _ now the bald
corpse inside the hospital behind us _ collapses in horror.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem still lay only sixty miles away through the
suffocating, frozen fog, as lost to the Jordanians today as it was
when King Hussein's army retreated almost three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   So now this odd, fragile, brave, often infuriating little land
has another British military graduate to run its affairs.
Sandhurst, Oxford, Georgetown, tank commander and general with his
very own Praetorian Guard.
</P>
<P>
   His special forces _ one of those supposedly ``crack'' units
which breed all over the Middle East _ have put down a riot or two
over the past few years, and you couldn't help wondering how
Abdullah would have dealt with the crowds outside the King Hussein
Medical Center Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They pushed at the police lines, they sobbed into their hands,
they collapsed feinting onto the mud outside the gates. I thought
one of the policemen was just mouthing something he'd heard on the
television when he told me that King Hussein had been a father to
him. And then I realized that behind his thin-framed spectacles he
was crying.
</P>
<P>
   You only had to watch these people _ and the uncontrollable
nature of their grief _ to understand how heavy will be the burden
for King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   To a westerner, to a tourist, Jordan is a friendly little
sandpit of Roman ruins, rock palaces, camels and an old railway
blown up by another English officer, Colonel Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   But these are also a wounded people, 65 percent of whom can
count their Palestinian dispossession in their family tree.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah has inherited from his father a Jordanian-Israeli peace
treaty which many of his people _ and a good few in the fog outside
the hospital, I dare say _ would like to tear to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the new king is receiving the dangerous praises of
Jordan's friends _ from Iraq, from Syria, from Israel, from
President Clinton. How they love the new young king, how they honor
him and wish him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life and soul of any party,'' a friend of the family put
it to me last week, ``Abdullah's a great man for jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   True, Abdullah will need a sense of humor. But he will also have
to learn to be hated and despised. Like King Hussein. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   His dead father, after all, was repudiated for his disastrous
participation in the 1967 Six-Day war and for his support for
Saddam Hussein after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   How we hated him then. Then the king made peace with Israel and
incurred the wrath of many of his own people. How we loved him
then.
</P>
<P>
   What did Abdullah think when he heard those easy television
cliches about his brave but often misunderstood (and oft-betrayed)
father Sunday, words _ these are authentic quotations _ that in
some cases came from the very reporters who cheerfully predicted
his demise in 1991?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unassailable moral authority,'' ``a visionary for peace,'' ``a
man of great charisma'' with an ``unquestioned'' legacy, a man who
``always wanted to give his people the rights that they deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   What was that legacy again? Unquestioned? And what political
rights did his people receive, save for a vote in a rubber-stamp
parliament and the knowledge that the secret police would not call
at 3:00 in the morning?
</P>
<P>
   Yet if any of the Jordanian ``men-in-the-street'' talking to the
news networks about King Abdullah here Sunday had strayed from the
permitted path _ just like his father, a soldier-king, a chip off
the old block in fact _ then they would have been taken off to His
Majesty's constabulary for a thumping.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the king's death, Abdullah had invited Washington
and New York journalists to meet him for an off-the-record chat
about the future, an amiable occasion since American journalists
tend to write and talk like State Department spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Faith in the ``peace process,'' trust in the West, anxious for
good relations with all his neighbors, sympathy for the Iraqi
people but no love for Saddam; it was predictable stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But the real world is not that simple. Jordanians don't hate
Saddam and many of them have regained their old hostility and
distrust of an Israel that goes on building West Bank Jewish
settlements on land which many Jordanians own. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I didn't like that fog outside the hospital Sunday evening and I
walked back through the sleet to find a car that would take me to
Amman. It was a Palestinian in a rusty Peugeot who stopped for me.
</P>
<P>
   A Jordanian radio news broadcast was blasting from his
transistor. ``They say Abdullah is just like his father,'' Nidal
shouted above the radio. ``They say the country is unified, that
everything will go on as before.'' Then he gave his right hand a
little twist, the way Arabs do when they want to indicate an open
question. ``Maybe,'' he said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The funeral of King Hussein of Jordan will be the largest
gathering of heads of state at a funeral since the assassination of
the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 world leaders are expected to attend the funeral,
including the Prince of Wales and Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Security in the Middle Eastern state is already being tightened
as the funeral comes amid continuing tension between the Western
powers and Iraq and a call from the exiled Saudi dissident, Osama
bin Laden, for Muslims to attack American and British citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the king's death Sunday morning a huge security
operation was already discreetly under way, with the Jordanian
intelligence services taking control of anti-terror arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the assassination of Rabin _ where accusations were made
that the highly visible security was in reality quite lax _ the
protracted death of King Hussein has given security forces in Amman
and those of visiting heads of state valuable time in which to
liaise.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and MI6 are among those forces which are thought to have
been in touch with their Jordanian colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally a Muslim funeral takes place as soon as possible
after the person's death, but in the case of King Hussein the
enormous security arrangements and complicated logistics of
bringing so many heads of state together is expected to delay the
burial.
</P>
<P>
   World leaders attending will almost certainly include Bill
Clinton, the U.S. President, Lionel Jospin, the French Prime
Minister, Gerhard Schroder, the German Chancellor, and the Spanish
Prime Minister, Jose Maria Aznar, along with Nelson Mandela, the
South African President.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is expected to attend, as he
did the funeral of Rabin, and Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime
Minister, has reportedly said he wishes to attend. Kofi Annan, the
U.N. Secretary-General, will travel to Amman via London.
</P>
<P>
   It is thought unlikely that either President Hafez Assad of
Syria or Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, will attend, though
British Labour MP Tam Dalyell said the funeral would present the
``ideal opportunity'' to start a dialogue with any Iraqi officials
who did go to the funeral. &QL;

<P>
   The funeral of King Hussein of Jordan will be the largest
gathering of heads of state at a funeral since the assassination of
the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 world leaders are expected to attend the funeral,
including the Prince of Wales and Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Security in the Middle Eastern state is already being tightened
as the funeral comes amid continuing tension between the Western
powers and Iraq and a call from the exiled Saudi dissident, Osama
bin Laden, for Muslims to attack American and British citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the king's death Sunday morning a huge security
operation was already discreetly under way, with the Jordanian
intelligence services taking control of anti-terror arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the assassination of Rabin _ where accusations were made
that the highly visible security was in reality quite lax _ the
protracted death of King Hussein has given security forces in Amman
and those of visiting heads of state valuable time in which to
liaise.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and MI6 are among those forces which are thought to have
been in touch with their Jordanian colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally a Muslim funeral takes place as soon as possible
after the person's death, but in the case of King Hussein the
enormous security arrangements and complicated logistics of
bringing so many heads of state together is expected to delay the
burial.
</P>
<P>
   World leaders attending will almost certainly include Bill
Clinton, the U.S. President, Lionel Jospin, the French Prime
Minister, Gerhard Schroder, the German Chancellor, and the Spanish
Prime Minister, Jose Maria Aznar, along with Nelson Mandela, the
South African President.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is expected to attend, as he
did the funeral of Rabin, and Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime
Minister, has reportedly said he wishes to attend. Kofi Annan, the
U.N. Secretary-General, will travel to Amman via London.
</P>
<P>
   It is thought unlikely that either President Hafez Assad of
Syria or Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, will attend, though
British Labour MP Tam Dalyell said the funeral would present the
``ideal opportunity'' to start a dialogue with any Iraqi officials
who did go to the funeral. &QL;

   AMMAN _ The look is solemn rather than tearful. As shops closed
in Amman Sunday on news of King Hussein's death, knots of young men
formed under the awnings of the small shops around the Al- Hussein
mosque talking softly and anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of outward grief. Outside the Al-Hussein Medical
Center where the king had just died women braved the driving rain
to sob and some fell fainting to the ground as they waited for the
king's body to leave the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But this visibly emotional mourning is almost an Arab ritual.
More impressive than the tears was the way in which Jordanians, who
are not used to cold, groped their way forward in the white banks
of mist _ police kept cars coming close to the hospital _ to
express sorrow for the king.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Amman people looked worried rather than
grief-stricken. This may be because the king's death was expected.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed many Jordanians believed he died several days ago. This
is because the Jordanian media, in a deeply counter-effective move,
has had less coverage of the king's illness than many foreign
newspapers. When he returned unconscious from the U.S., local
newspapers, radio and television said he was seriously ill but gave
no details.
</P>
<P>
   If the government hoped to allay public alarm its censorship had
exactly the opposite effect. Starved of information about the one
topic in which they were interested, street rumor ran ahead of the
fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure he is already dead and the government is keeping
quiet about it,'' said one woman twenty-four hours before the
king's death was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians are shaken not only by the news of the king's death,
but by a series of shocks over the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the king's triumphant return from hospital in
the U.S. He looked pale and walked as if each movement was an
effort but he stood to greet hundreds of officials and leaders at
the airport. Then he drove through the streets of Amman, as
rain-soaked as they were Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the king summarily fired his brother Crown Prince
Hassan, his effective deputy for 34 years and the heir to the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   His 14-page handwritten letter doing so looked like the work of
a sick man. It wandered from topic to topic. It was full of
allegations against his brother: he had smeared the king's wife and
tried to make changes at the top of the army. But it also expressed
anxiety about the ozone layer and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   If Crown Prince Hassan had succeeded to the throne then
Jordanians would be getting a known, though not very popular,
quantity as their next monarch. Instead they watched Crown Prince
Abdullah proclaimed king Sunday, a man whom they know nothing about
and about whom there may be little to be known.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordanians did feel that, whether they liked the king's
policies or not, that he did protect them from dark forces around
Jordan and wonder what they will do now that he is dead. &QL;

SONICS A TOUGH READ AMID NBA'S `MIDSEASON' PARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As is customary at this early February juncture of the
NBA season, it's time for the midseason report card.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the season so far is the
parity. Who could have imagined last summer that by the All-Star
Game break every team in the league would be either tied for the
divisional lead or no more than one game back?
</P>
<P>
   For years, the NFL has worked actively toward this kind of
balance. But as the sports fan has come to learn this decade, the
NBA always seems to be a step quicker than every other sport.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA puts to shame major league baseball, where more than
half the teams will enter spring training with no hope of a
championship, thanks to huge, unchecked revenue disparities between
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here is pro hoops, almost at Valentine's Day, and no team,
thanks to the NBA's enlightened, creative labor policies, is
anywhere close to elimination (with the possible exception of the
Clippers, who have an automatic entry into the NIT).
</P>
<P>
   And since every game at KeyArena has gone into overtime,
including Friday night's 92-86 win over the Dallas Mavericks, the
promise of excitement is almost unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   There is a problem, however. Such evenness makes it difficult to
distinguish the trends that will be difference-makers in the
season's second half. Other than the dominance of the Mavericks,
who have never beaten the Sonics this year, it is hard to make
sweeping assessments about the Seattle club.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some Sonic and league developments are clear at
the mid-winter break:
</P>
<P>
   --Despite a change in management, Gary Payton still owns this
team. His season averages of 28 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists
are testaments to the best guard in the game, now that
what's-his-name is back to selling phone service.
</P>
<P>
   --Soon-to-be-Thin Vin Baker is almost playing as well as he did
during the last regular season. But his season doesn't start until
he makes everyone forget last year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   --Given George Karl's magnificent regular-season record, Sonic
fans were naturally concerned that the transition to new coach Paul
Westphal would be filled with problems. While Westphal is indeed a
thousand words behind Karl in the quote standings, the undefeated
record speaks eloquently to his basketball genius. Club president
Wally Walker has never made a more inspired coaching hire.
</P>
<P>
   --The shift of Hersey Hawkins from starting guard to reserve, to
accommodate the main offseason acquisition, Belly, er, Billy Owens,
is a bust. The controversial move so far has Owens averaging just 5
points in 22 minutes, while Hawkins, who gets the, ahem, bulk of
the minutes, has scored just two points all season.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope, however, as soon as the Sonics figure whether
Owens on defense has his feet nailed to the floor or merely glued.
</P>
<P>
   --The many scattered patches of empty seats at Key Arena,
particularly in the rich-people regions, is an ominous sign.
Although the building is said to be sold out regularly, it's plain
at least some fans this season prefer to stay at home with Jerry
Springer's TV show if they need to see chunky people pointing and
pushing.
</P>
<P>
   --The league's newest feature, a requirement that each player
shoot at least one airball a game, is taken far too seriously by
the Sonics. Just Friday night the Sonics shot 40 percent, and the
Mavericks missed 10 of 11 field goal attempts in overtime.
Nevertheless, fans of tradition can savor the 5-foot jump-hook
airball from Olden Polynice, who despite his seven-year absence
from Seattle is still packing his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   --Averaging a double-double (11 points, 13 rebounds), Polynice
should be considered just behind Shaquille O'Neal and David
Robinson in the voting for Western Conference All-Star center,
presuming voters in KeyArena are not injured by shrapnel from his
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   --Despite his 36 years, Detlef Schrempf hasn't lost so much as a
single adjective when it comes to complaining to the officials. The
ravages of age often cause many players to moderate, but Schrempf
has shown no loss of victimhood.
</P>
<P>
   --The Mavericks' Cedric Ceballos might be the greatest fat
player since Billy ``The Whopper'' Paultz. In the most recent game
Friday, the semi-cherubic forward had 16 points, including multiple
drives past Sonic defenders, who reinforced the long-ago conclusion
of third-grade spelling class that there is no D in Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   --In the Mavericks' starting frontline tandem of 7-foot-6 center
Shawn Bradley and 7-0 rookie forward Dirk Nowitzki, Northwest
residents have not seen so much slow whiteness since the Nisqually
Glacier.
</P>
<P>
   --In Moochie Norris, the Sonics have the greatest first name in
NBA back-up point guard history. But you knew that right from the
beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So for the second half of the NBA season, the Sonics find
themselves well positioned _ closing in on the lead, backing away
from the buffet table and owning the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   How could Jordan walk away from this?

   AMMAN _ As news of the death of King Hussein spread through
Amman, the Jordanian capital, just before noon Sunday thousands of
Jordanians, many carrying black flags of mourning, drove in cars
and trucks through the driving rain and thick mist to wait for his
body to be removed from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the markets in the heart of the city shopkeepers pulled down
the metal shutters of their shops, as they closed as a sign of
respect for the king who had ruled Jordan for 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very special man,'' said one Jordanian as he waited
to pick up his children from their school which had just closed.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein died, aged 63, at 11:43 a.m. Sunday after lying
unconscious for more than two days in a hospital on the outskirts
of his capital. He flew back from the U.S. to die in Jordan last
week when a final bone marrow transplant failed to stem his cancer
which developed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah, the 37-year-old eldest son of King
Hussein, was immediately proclaimed the new king by the cabinet. He
later went to swear to respect the constitution before the
Jordanian parliament, where deputies wrapped their red and white
keffiyehs (head dresses) across their faces in a traditional sign
of sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Tony Blair and Prince Charles will be among
the many world leaders attending the funeral Monday in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   ``No words can convey what King Hussein meant to the people he
led for nearly half a century,'' President Clinton said. ``No words
can convey to what he meant to me as a friend and an inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said the king was ``a remarkable man, a man of rare
vision, integrity and courage.''
</P>
<P>
   All work in the Jordanian capital will stop as King Hussein is
buried Monday. Despite the continuing rain most of the population
of Amman is expected to attend. One Jordanian official said: ``We
face a logistics problem not a security problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral cortege will wind through the streets of Amman
according to a schedule which Jordanian officials have preparing
ever since it was announced that the operation on the king's cancer
had failed and he was close to death.
</P>
<P>
   The only question mark in the minds of Jordanians has been how
they will deal with the expected presence of Benjamin Netanyahu,
the Israeli prime minister, amid so many Arab leaders who detest
him.
</P>
<P>
   The grief shown by Jordanians, with women sobbing and fainting
outside the gates of his hospital, is a sign of King Hussein's real
popularity mixed with apprehension over the future.
</P>
<P>
   For almost half a century he maneuvered his small country, often
changing alliances, to protect it from more powerful neighbors,
notably Israel and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks before his death the king surprised Jordanians by
making Abdullah, a career army officer, his heir, in place of his
brother Hassan who was crown prince for 34 years. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Born in 1935, the king belonged to the Hashemite dynasty, which
originally ruled Mecca and was installed in Jordan by Britain at
the end of the First World War.
</P>
<P>
   He experienced the dangers facing his family at an early age.
When only sixteen he saw his grandfather, King Abdullah, shot in
the head in a mosque in Jerusalem by a Palestinian gunman. A bullet
grazed Hussein's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   He became king of Jordan two years later after his father, a
schizophrenic, was removed by parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He relied on British and later American support, but tried to
avoid being seen as a pawn of foreign powers by Arab nationalists.
He fired his British military adviser, Glubb Pasha, and had him
driven to the airport in Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   His reign was shaped by Jordan's relations with Israel and the
Palestinians, who make up a majority of the Jordanian population.
He lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank, half his kingdom, when he
joined Egypt and Syria in fighting Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He tried always to keep the U.S. on his side and maintain
friendly relations with Israel without alienating other Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
   The king's balancing act in Middle East came under increasing
strain after the Gulf War when he maintained a friendly neutrality
towards Iraq. This was highly popular at home but alienated
Washington and most of the Arab oil states.
</P>
<P>
   The king fought with success to escape isolation by signing a
peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and breaking with Iraq the
following year. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _Three schools in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the way Dan Phillips pictured his college baseball
career. But everything is working out fine, for Phillips and Cal
State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Sunday's doubleheader against Southern Utah, Phillips,
a junior outfielder, had a team-leading six home runs. He's a
bright spot in CSUN's fast start.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's just warming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in that zone where everything is going right,'' he
said. ``I think I can maintain this (start) and hopefully improve
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, a center fielder who has also played shortstop in
college, transferred to CSUN from Pierce, where he was an
all-Western State Conference outfielder last year. Before playing
at Pierce, Phillips was at Cal State Fullerton for his freshman
season.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips figured he was entrenched at Fullerton until his left
hand was broken on a pitch in a summer-league game in 1997. By the
time his hand had healed, he was a castoff; the Titans had brought
in another outfielder who would take most of his playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips left Fullerton, enrolled at Pierce and was on the
practice field the next day. Since Phillips was known to scouts
around the San Fernando Valley _ he was an All-City third baseman
at Chatsworth in '96 _ he figured he would put together one solid
season and bolt for the pros.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how to describe (the feeling),'' he said
about being snubbed. ``It sure looks like it will turn out all
right, though.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Mike Batesole said Phillips has the tools to play on
the next level, but he needed more discipline at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Phillips) needed to get some things straightened out,''
Batesole said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sorely missed: It was obvious what the men's volleyball team
lacked in its three-game loss to third-ranked BYU at home Friday
night _ experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors started two freshmen, a junior with only one year
of CSUN experience and a sophomore against the Cougars. Head coach
Jeff Campbell wasn't upset with the loss, but he isn't happy with
the lapses and lack of teamwork the Matadors have shown in their
1-4 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot better team than we were last year, talent-wise,''
Campbell said. ``Team-wise, we're not as good. Last year, we had
Chad Strickland out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland, who graduated, was a second-team All-Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation pick in '98 and a third-team selection
twice, in '96 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   __ Family affair: The brothers Atkins will be reunited on the
football team in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Atkins, a former quarterback at San Fernando High, is
expected to transfer from Sacramento State after being sparingly
used at running back last season. His younger brother Bryson, an
All-Mission League defensive back at Alemany last year, signed with
CSUN last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sean (5-7, 165) and Bryson (5-9, 175) were teammates at San
Fernando in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   __ Road warriors: The baseball team, which is a combined
131-57-1 in Batesole's first three seasons, received a low ranking
from Baseball America in its preseason edition _ 89th in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is an independent, CSUN faces another uphill battle
for an NCAA playoff spot, even though the field expands to 64 teams
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Getting swept in a double-header at home by Southern Utah didn't
help.
</P>
<P>
   Batesole points to the Matadors' tough road schedule, with games
at USC, UCLA, Washington and a trip to Texas A&AMP;M's Aggie
Continental Airline Classic in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win on the road,'' Batesole said. &QL;

   AMMAN _ As news of the death of King Hussein spread through
Amman, the Jordanian capital, just before noon Sunday thousands of
Jordanians, many carrying black flags of mourning, drove in cars
and trucks through the driving rain and thick mist to wait for his
body to be removed from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the markets in the heart of the city shopkeepers pulled down
the metal shutters of their shops, as they closed as a sign of
respect for the king who had ruled Jordan for 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very special man,'' said one Jordanian as he waited
to pick up his children from their school which had just closed.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein died, aged 63, at 11:43 a.m. Sunday after lying
unconscious for more than two days in a hospital on the outskirts
of his capital. He flew back from the U.S. to die in Jordan last
week when a final bone marrow transplant failed to stem his cancer
which developed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah, the 37-year-old eldest son of King
Hussein, was immediately proclaimed the new king by the cabinet. He
later went to swear to respect the constitution before the
Jordanian parliament, where deputies wrapped their red and white
keffiyehs (head dresses) across their faces in a traditional sign
of sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Tony Blair and Prince Charles will be among
the many world leaders attending the funeral Monday in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   ``No words can convey what King Hussein meant to the people he
led for nearly half a century,'' President Clinton said. ``No words
can convey to what he meant to me as a friend and an inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said the king was ``a remarkable man, a man of rare
vision, integrity and courage.''
</P>
<P>
   All work in the Jordanian capital will stop as King Hussein is
buried Monday. Despite the continuing rain most of the population
of Amman is expected to attend. One Jordanian official said: ``We
face a logistics problem not a security problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral cortege will wind through the streets of Amman
according to a schedule which Jordanian officials have preparing
ever since it was announced that the operation on the king's cancer
had failed and he was close to death.
</P>
<P>
   The only question mark in the minds of Jordanians has been how
they will deal with the expected presence of Benjamin Netanyahu,
the Israeli prime minister, amid so many Arab leaders who detest
him.
</P>
<P>
   The grief shown by Jordanians, with women sobbing and fainting
outside the gates of his hospital, is a sign of King Hussein's real
popularity mixed with apprehension over the future.
</P>
<P>
   For almost half a century he maneuvered his small country, often
changing alliances, to protect it from more powerful neighbors,
notably Israel and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks before his death the king surprised Jordanians by
making Abdullah, a career army officer, his heir, in place of his
brother Hassan who was crown prince for 34 years. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Born in 1935, the king belonged to the Hashemite dynasty, which
originally ruled Mecca and was installed in Jordan by Britain at
the end of the First World War.
</P>
<P>
   He experienced the dangers facing his family at an early age.
When only sixteen he saw his grandfather, King Abdullah, shot in
the head in a mosque in Jerusalem by a Palestinian gunman. A bullet
grazed Hussein's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   He became king of Jordan two years later after his father, a
schizophrenic, was removed by parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He relied on British and later American support, but tried to
avoid being seen as a pawn of foreign powers by Arab nationalists.
He fired his British military adviser, Glubb Pasha, and had him
driven to the airport in Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   His reign was shaped by Jordan's relations with Israel and the
Palestinians, who make up a majority of the Jordanian population.
He lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank, half his kingdom, when he
joined Egypt and Syria in fighting Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He tried always to keep the U.S. on his side and maintain
friendly relations with Israel without alienating other Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
   The king's balancing act in Middle East came under increasing
strain after the Gulf War when he maintained a friendly neutrality
towards Iraq. This was highly popular at home but alienated
Washington and most of the Arab oil states.
</P>
<P>
   The king fought with success to scape isolation by signing a
peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and breaking with Iraq the
following year. &QL;

   In Jordan King Hussein was a benevolent autocrat, ultimately
controlling everything but avoiding extreme repression. One member

LEADING RACE HE HASN'T ENTERED, BUSH PLAYS IT CLOSE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ariz., Ind., Iowa, N.H.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forget about the Senate trial. The favorite pastime
in Republican circles here is trying to decipher the intentions of
a politician who is comfortably cloistered in a far-off capital:
Gov. George Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While Republican presidential wannabes are crisscrossing the
country, hoping they will make a dent in the polls by declaring
their intentions over and over again, Bush insists that he has not
made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   But because Bush has a commanding lead in the early polls, his
noncandidacy is dominating the race. Rivals are already ridiculing
his ``compassionate conservative'' slogan. And many campaign
strategists are frozen in place, refusing to be wooed by other
contenders until they get a nod from the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that Bush will indeed run. But his
mixed signals have left some Republicans speculating that he really
does not want to be president, or drag his family through the
ordeal, and may skip the race. Still others speculate that Bush
decided long ago and is simply orchestrating a tantalizing waiting
game to keep up the suspense and to put off answering hard
questions about issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking through it all,'' Bush said in a telephone
interview from Austin, where he practically boasted that he had not
been keeping up with the Senate impeachment trial. ``I'm going to
make a very informed decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush sounded a bit surprised when a reporter told him that he
had at first expected him definitely to run but now would be
surprised, but not stunned, if he did not. ``It sounds like you're
kind of like me. You've gone from absolutely _ '' he said, stopping
himself in midsentence. ``You feel one way one day and one way the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   The speculation has stirred anew now that Bush has begun
summoning experts to Austin to brief him on the issues, as well as
political operatives to talk about assembling a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only preparation, it's a matter of being informed,''
Bush explained. ``My foreign affairs experience is Mexico. I want
people who know a lot about foreign affairs to come down and brief
me.'' This week, he met with many of his father's economic
advisers, including Michael Boskin, who was chairman of the Council
of Economic Advisers under his father, former President George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor sounded even more like a candidate when he spoke of
how Wayne Berman, a Republican fund-raiser and veteran of the Bush
administration, had traveled to Austin to talk about raising money
for a campaign. Would Berman be his chief money man?
</P>
<P>
   ``My definition of raising money is, I want a lot of main money
people,'' Bush said. ``This is going to require a big team with a
lot of people. Wayne's a friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also spoke highly of Mel Sembler, the finance
chairman of the Republican Party. ``Would he help?'' Bush asked.
``I hope so at the right time. He's a close personal friend. I've
seen him socially; he's also been down to talk about 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not rule out the possibility that he could amass so
much in donations that he could forgo federal subsidies and spend
as much as he likes. ``It's a big decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When some close advisers of Bush came to Washington after
Christmas to feel out fund-raising consultants, some Republicans
speculated that they were not sanctioned by the governor but by
eager loyalists who were prodding him to run. But Bush scotched
that notion. ``Of course,'' he said when asked if he had dispatched
the advisers to Washington. ``It's a way to let people know I'm
interested. Keep your powder dry.''
</P>
<P>
   All this Bush talk is unimaginably frustrating to those who
already have been trudging to chicken dinners in Iowa and New
Hampshire, only to see themselves dwarfed by a noncandidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a big buildup when you're outside the arena,'' said
former Vice President Dan Quayle, who is decidedly in the arena for
2000. ``If you stay out, you're not going to have the media
scrutiny and tough questions. On the other hand, in Iowa and New
Hampshire, people want you to come in early and often.''
</P>
<P>
   With a hint of exasperation, Quayle said of the governor:
``Sooner or later he's going to have to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush knows the waiting game cannot continue forever. ``I think
about the year 2000, obviously, a lot,'' he said. ``Time is moving.
There's a certain sense of anxiety among the people who hope I will
run. I'm beginning to think through a timetable. I understand
there's a deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the deadline, the elusive Bush emerges. ``I guess
it's a matter of feel.'' Then again, the governor said, ``I need to
send a signal.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now at least, it seems like Bush would like to keep
everything the way it is now: He does not have to campaign. He does
not have to do anything but be governor. And the polls,
consistently, predict that he will be the next president of the
United States.

 (ATTN: Calif.) INTERNET AUCTION SYSTEM SET FOR PRICING STOCKBy SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William R. Hambrecht, the longtime Silicon Valley investment
banker, plans to introduce a system for underwriting initial public
stock offerings through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While other firms have given online investors an opportunity to
get in on the ground floor of new stock offerings, Hambrecht's
approach would have a new wrinkle: through an online auction.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach is to be announced Monday by W.R. Hambrecht &AMP;
Co., the investment banking boutique he started last year after
leaving Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, which he co-founded in 1968. His new
firm intends to cater to the current fashion among small technology
companies of selling stock to the public on line.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade, the online broker, recently took a partial interest in a
new online investment bank, EOffering, that is backed by another
Silicon Valley banker, Sanford Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Wit Capital, currently the leader in offering new shares via the
Internet, has participated in several dozen initial stock offerings
by big Wall Street houses, making a portion of the shares available
to investors on line before public trading begins. Wit has
attracted competition from a number of other firms including
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   But Hambrecht wants his system to be more than an adjunct to
traditional new offerings, in which the initial price is set by a
big brokerage firm and most shares are allocated to its favorite
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht intends for the price and allocation of shares to be
set completely on line through what is called a Dutch auction.
</P>
<P>
   Potential investors in a planned stock would log into the firm's
system and indicate the highest price they would be willing to pay
for a given number of shares. The offering is set at the highest
price at which there is enough demand to sell all the shares.
Anyone who bid at that price or higher is allocated shares at that
price. Everyone else is out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   The first market test of the system would be with an offering
for Ravenswood Winery, the Sonoma County, Calif., maker of a
well-regarded zinfandel. Ravenswood, which filed its offering with
the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday, hopes to raise
about $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with a traditional offering, this approach would
probably mean higher prices when going public and, therefore, more
money for the company issuing the shares. Hambrecht also contends
that the approach will mean less frenzied trading by investors in
search of a quick buck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put the issuer together with the people who want to
own the stock for the long term,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht plans to charge the companies issuing stock a fee of 4
percent of the capital raised, compared with 7 percent charged by a
typical Wall Street underwriter.

IN ISLAMIC WORLD, BID LADEN'S ESTEEM RISES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six months after the deadly bombings of two American embassies
in Africa, the counterattack against the man suspected of being the
mastermind, Osama bin Laden, has failed to weaken his ability to
strike again but succeeded in making him a hero in the Islamic
world, senior U.S. and foreign officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's most potent political weapon, his violent oratory
condemning the American presence in the Persian Gulf, is winning
sympathy and support from North Africa to South Asia, U.S.
officials say. That poses a growing threat to American personnel
and policies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political movement,'' said a top American
counterterrorism official. ``We have to have a political and
diplomatic strategy to attack him without aggrandizing him.'' But
Washington lacks one, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has aimed cruise missiles, covert operations
and criminal investigations against bin Laden. It has arrested men
believed to be his political associates. It has thwarted two of his
plans to attack more American embassies, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But American stratagems to block his access to bank accounts,
cut his connections to terrorist cells and sever his links to
political supporters have not succeeded. Secure in his redoubts in
Afghanistan, bin Laden could strike ``at any time'' against symbols
of American power, CIA Director George Tenet told Congress last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's isolated, incommunicado or out of money,''
another senior counterterrorism official said. ``And I don't think
anything we've done has changed the minds of his true believers.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense that bin Laden has strong political support even among
American allies abroad is shared within the State Department, the
CIA and the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials there say their boldest counterattack on bin
Laden _ firing cruise missiles at his guerrilla bases in
Afghanistan and what they suspected was a chemical weapons factory
in Sudan _ may have backfired.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles inflicted little lasting damage but helped to make
bin Laden ``a revered figure'' in the Islamic world, a third senior
counterterrorism official said.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden receives money and political support from princes of
the Saudi royal family, whose king he has vowed to depose, and from
powerful people and financial institutions in Kuwait and Qatar,
where there is a strong American military presence, U.S. officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they are continuing to press
foreign governments to arrest suspected supporters and associates
of his. Secret arrests and unpublicized detentions of several
suspects took place three weeks ago, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrests do not always stick. Seven people detained in
England and Albania at the behest of the United States have been
quietly released for lack of evidence in recent weeks, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American officials have argued fiercely about strategies
against bin Laden. ``Wanted'' posters went out last month, with
blood-red type reading: ``This is not politics. This is MURDER.''
</P>
<P>
   But now a different picture is gaining force in the Islamic
world.
</P>
<P>
   A poster of bin Laden hangs in Pakistan's oldest and largest
religious school, on the old silk route to Afghanistan. He is
smiling, holding an automatic rifle. The poster calls him a holy
warrior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osama is a hero,'' Sami ul-Haq, a leading Islamic politician,
who runs the religious school, said in an interview. ``Every young
man here wants to be like him.'' He said he was sending hundreds of
his graduates to support bin Laden's allies in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   This glorified image is spreading in Pakistan, the country the
United States is relying on the most to help bring bin Laden to
justice. ``When bin Laden speaks, he is reflecting the aspirations
of the people,'' said Naseerullah Babar, a retired general who
recently served as Pakistan's interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, ``the principal reasons for bin Laden's having
popular appeal are growing,'' said Robert Oakley, a former American
ambassador in Pakistan and a former State Department
counterterrorism coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel they have no voice,'' he said. ``They look at a
people with great wealth while they live in deep poverty. They
resent the personal corruption of the Saudis'' and the power of the
United States.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   American counterterrorism officials ruefully agree that bin
Laden's oratory also rings true in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   His attacks on the Saudi royal family's repression and
corruption are factually similar to State Department human rights
reports and CIA economic analyses. But they differ sharply in
blaming the United States for shoring up the House of Saud by
stationing troops in the Arabian Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's popular support swelled after the cruise missile
attacks, American officials and allies in the region agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was served by the cruise missile attacks?'' said Mohammad
Siddique Kanju, the deputy foreign minister of Pakistan. ``You've
inflated one individual to an enormous extent. Why would you want
to create more like him? Such acts only help him proliferate.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacking bin Laden with missiles gave him the status of a state
_ a nation unto himself, as an intelligence official said _ in a
war with America.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we make it into a war, we lose,'' said Oakley, the
former ambassador. ``We'll swell their numbers enormously.'' That
further increases the political threat that bin Laden presents,
American officials concede.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say the United States does not yet know its enemy
well enough to defeat him. The picture of bin Laden presented by
the United States has been blurred by conflicting public statements
at the highest levels of the government.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, when the United States destroyed a pharmaceutical
plant in Sudan with cruise missiles, President Clinton's most
senior national security aides said it was a secret chemical
weapons factory financed by bin Laden. Those same officials later
conceded that they had no definitive evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, Clinton gave a speech tying bin Laden to plots to
kill the pope and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. But those plots
were carried out by people to whom bin Laden may have peripheral
connections, if any, according to available evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been blown beyond all proportion,'' said Ghazi Salah
el-Din, the information minister of Sudan, where bin Laden lived
from 1992 to 1996. ``I know the guy, having met him. And he's not
that mighty. He's being pumped up. I can understand that in the
context of trying to personify terrorism. But the United States has
created a hero out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   American law enforcement, intelligence and national security
officials are divided on some fundamental issues. For example, they
disagree whether, as a federal indictment charges, bin Laden and
his adherents helped train and arm the men who killed 18 American
soldiers in Somalia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said, ``We are
confident in the allegation.'' But senior officials, including some
who served in Somalia, say they doubt the charge, which Clinton
made hours after the cruise missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, the U.S. envoy to Somalia at the time of the attack, is
among the skeptics. ``Nobody I've talked to, most of whom were in a
good position to know, knows anything about that,'' he said. ``We
never heard anything about bin Laden.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Howe, the retired Navy admiral who was the top U.N.
official in Somalia in 1993 and is a former deputy national
security adviser, shares those doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a president makes a statement like that, there's got to
be something to it,'' he said. ``But I have no idea what it was.''

HYBRID BUS IS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY 
</HEADLINE>

346-9867.) 
(lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN, R.I. _ When most buses accelerate, they labor, lumber
and roar, spewing clouds of choking exhaust as their heavy diesel
engines struggle to drag along 24 tons or so. But a new bus rolling
out of a sailboat factory here hums at a constant tone, never emits
visible exhaust and runs on about half the horsepower a compact car
needs.
</P>
<P>
   It may look like a bus, but it is also a performance vehicle.
Floor it, said Stephen Misencik, the chief designer, and ``we can
almost smoke the tires.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus, a 30-foot model that will enter service soon as a
shuttle between terminals at Logan Airport in Boston, is powered by
two electric motors, one for each rear wheel, and a natural-gas
engine. More fiberglass than steel, it is two-thirds the weight of
a regular bus.
</P>
<P>
   The innovative prototype cost about $1 million. A conventional
full-size bus costs $225,000 to $275,000. With other designers
pushing in the same direction, and with mass production, the cost
of the hybrid bus is expected to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most creative work in reducing air pollution is
being seen in the design of buses, which are big enough to
accommodate bulky new components and whose buyers are often
governments eager to buy anti-pollution technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transit agencies are under more and more pressure to get off
diesel,'' said Sheila Lynch, the executive director of the
Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, a nonprofit agency that
helped finance the design and assembly of the new bus with money
from the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government agencies are reviewing all their options,'' said
Ms. Lynch, who pointed out that Boston has decided not to buy any
new diesel buses, and that in New York City, the Natural Resources
Defense Council is on a campaign to win the same promise from local
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The new bus here is the brainchild of Everett Pearson, who
looked at the standard 30-foot bus, which weighs about 23,500
pounds without passengers, and decided it needed to go on a diet.
He kept the metal in the axles and the wheels, but hardly anywhere
else. It weighs 16,200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the manufacturing world may not be ready for such a
weight drop. Misencik, a mechanical engineer, said that finding
lightweight, mass-produced axles, hinges and other parts was
sometimes impossible: The door weighs only 28 pounds but the
lightest hinge available is too heavy, because it is designed for a
98-pound door.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson founded Pearson Yachts with a cousin in 1957 but later
sold the company. John Walton, of the Wal-Mart fortune, owns part
of his current company, TPI Composites. Among TPI products are
modular bathrooms for passenger trains and hot tubs.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson spent about $500,000 of the company's money on the bus
that will go to Boston. The Northeast Alternative Vehicle
Consortium, a nonprofit agency that distributes grants, also
invested $500,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Building a large fiberglass chassis involved several
innovations. Local air-pollution officials in Rhode Island insisted
on a change, Pearson said, that led to one of them. The traditional
method of making fiberglass is to lay out fabric woven from glass
fibers and slather it with resins _ but the resins give off gases
during manufacturing that help cause smog.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Rhode Island, Pearson invested in a patented
system of pumping the resin into the material while it is in a
vacuum. The result: a stronger finished product with more glass,
less resin and no air bubbles, which are a source of structural
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   He said that TPI had also improved a method for increasing the
ability of fiberglass to withstand compression, so bolts could be
inserted without weakening the structure.
</P>
<P>
   The weight reduction achieved by using fiberglass is only half
of the innovation. The other half is the hybrid
electric/natural-gas drive system. Hybrid systems use less fuel and
produce fewer emissions than diesel engines. Both Toyota and Honda
plan to introduce cars with hybrid systems soon.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has been using five hybrid buses with conventional
steel bodies since September, and plans to buy 10 more. Most riders
notice the low floors because they do not have to climb steps into
the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction of our bus drivers has been overwhelmingly
positive,'' said Al O'Leary, a spokesman for New York City Transit.
Maintenance is easier, too, he said, because drivers of New York's
hybrid buses do not make much use of the brakes. To stop, they
press the brake pedal, turning their drive motors into generators,
which slow the bus and convert that energy into electricity that
flows back into the battery.
</P>
<P>
   A conventional bus the size of the hybrid bus would need a
190-horsepower diesel engine. The hybrid bus, with 68 horsepower,
has two large electric motors, powered by batteries charged
continuously by a generator, which in turn is powered by the small
natural-gas engine. Natural gas is far cleaner than diesel. And
this engine, fueled by natural gas, runs at a constant speed, which
is the engine's ``sweet spot,'' at which it returns the most energy
from fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a huge reduction in energy use. And the TPI bus
produces 58 percent less carbon dioxide as a diesel model than do
conventional buses with diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
   But changing the bus industry is not easy, and the first big
contract, from North American Bus Industries, of Anniston, Ala., a
major manufacturer, will be for bus bodies that will accept
conventional diesel drivetrains.
</P>
<P>
   NABI signed a $6 million contract to buy several bodies, plus
tooling and technical information so it can build more. Some will
be 40 feet long, like a standard city bus, and others 45 feet, like
a Greyhound coach. Once NABI is comfortable with the fiberglass
bodies, Misencik hopes to persuade the company to try one with a
hybrid engine.

AFTER WAIT, JOCKEY GETS 6,000TH WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK GIRARDOT  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Fortunately for Hall of Fame jockey Eddie
Delahoussaye, win 6K came before Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Delahoussaye became just the 14th North American
jockey to record 6,000 career wins. He did it aboard
Sweetcakesanshakes in the third race at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I never dreamed of,'' the 47-year-old
Delahoussaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Win 5,999 came Friday, but Delahoussaye had been winless in his
last six mounts and had won just 11 races since opening day Dec.
26.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Chris) McCarron was getting ready to throw me out of the
(jockey's room),'' Delahoussaye said. ``He said, `I'm getting tired
of this stuff.' I said, `Me, too.' I'm trying to get it over
with.'' Although he's not saying what his future plans are, it is
rumored that Delahoussaye will retire by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'll just take it one day at a time,'' Delahoussaye
said. ``I'll know when its time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm riding good, then I'll ride again next year. If not,
maybe I'll retire. Who knows? I might ride one horse in the year
2000. Then I can say I rode in the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, fans from throughout the park gathered around the
winner's circle after Sunday's second race. And when Delahoussaye
rode in aboard the brown filly, he received a hearty round of
applause and cheers. He was then presented with a crystal horse's
head and lauded in a brief ceremony by Cliff Goodrich, Santa
Anita's executive vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie Delahoussaye is a great ride and an even better
person,'' Goodrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetcakesanshakes trainer Leonard Dorfman agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the riders I've known through the years, I don't think
I've liked anybody better than Eddie,'' he said. `He's a hell of a
guy besides being a hell of a rider. I've always tried to get Eddie
when I've got a good horse for him to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Delahoussaye joined active riders Laffit Pincay, Pat
Day, David Gall, Chris McCarron, Russell Baze and Earlie Fires as
members of the 6,000 win club.
</P>
<P>
   __ Free ride: After a three-month layoff, Free House ran true to
form, capturing the $300,000 Grade II San Antonio Handicap on
Sunday in spite of a late outside challenge.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, Free House, the favorite, paid $3.40 and $2.20.
Second-place finisher Malek paid $2.40. Dramatic Gold finished
third. Lord Grillo was fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the short field there was no show wagering.

SPREWELL MISSES A SHOT AT ERASING HIS DIFFICULT DAY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Latrell Sprewell glanced up to see the common sight
of a score and a game clock working against him, and greeted the
familiar burden with an instinctive response.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't see options. He saw the 3-point arc on the floor. With
the Knicks down by 3 points and less than two minutes remaining, he
shrugged off the looming presence of the Miami Heat's Jamal
Mashburn and frantically jumped behind the arc. At that moment, he
stepped back into his past.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, as the Golden State Warriors' lonely star,
when Sprewell was forced to slip into a sorcerer's cape and conjure
up a miracle each night. As a Knick, he doesn't have to be the
savior by attrition anymore. And yet, Sprewell fell into an old
habit Sunday in his new home of Madison Square Garden by forcing
and missing two 3-pointers in the last 1 minute 41 seconds. In the
end, he became an accessory to the Knicks' 83-79 loss in a
civilized and calm meeting with the Heat. There were a couple of
hugs, and little hate, as the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pretty clean,'' said Larry Johnson, whose
hard foul on Alonzo Mourning, the man he traded uppercuts with in
last season's playoff series, came and went without an uprising.
``But again, this is not the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this game did not lack tension as a tight fourth quarter
unfolded. For one harried snapshot of the finish, Sprewell operated
in a vacuum and failed to see the talented players around him.
There was Patrick Ewing (24 points, 17 rebounds), jarring the
crowd's memory with a vintage performance. There was the
soft-shooting Allan Houston (21 points), displaying his aggressive
side. And there was Johnson (15 rebounds), popping up between
bigger bodies with the spring of a jack-in-the-box. Sprewell merely
saw the score and reacted like someone who had to carry a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just accustomed to doing that,'' said Sprewell, who had a
difficult day defending the bigger Mashburn (23 points) and a
horrific day shooting (2 of 12, 5 points). ``To not have to do that
now, it's an adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a team filled with a cast trying to find each other. In
the frantic final two minutes, the Knicks searched the floor to no
avail. Who was the go-to man, Houston, Ewing or Sprewell? The
moment of truth came with 20.4 seconds left and the Knicks down,
82-79. With Houston sealed off, the ball found Sprewell and he
double-clutched a 3-pointer that missed badly with 9 seconds left.
Chris Childs came up with the rebound and delivered it to Ewing,
who missed a layup with 3.9 seconds left. That quickly, the Knicks
are 0-2 in this abbreviated season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very cut and dried,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``Either
you're winning or you're losing. And we're losing. I don't want
this team to have this idea put out there for them that it's going
to take time.''
</P>
<P>
   Time is fleeting in a 50-game season. So far, the Knicks have
not been close to unveiling the smooth and sleek style predicted
when they made the trade for Sprewell. In both losses, they spotted
their opponents double-digit leads in the third quarter and failed
in valiant but unfulfilling comeback efforts. Each time, there has
been a different culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, it came down to free throws,'' Childs said. ``We
out-worked them and out-rebounded them, and then we miss the
gimme.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' inexplicable lapse from the free-throw line, where
they ended the game 10 of 22, wasted the effort the team gave. At
one point, Johnson gritted his teeth and sprung into the air five
times before scoring on a tip-in that snapped a lethargic crowd out
of its daze. At other times, Kurt Thomas was doing his best Charles
Oakley impersonation by diving on the floor for loose balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled from the line, too,'' said Thomas, who was 3 of 8
on free throws. ``I am a lot better free-throw shooter than what I
showed.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a team teetering on potential. The Knicks revealed the
possibilities as they whittled down a 15-point lead by the Heat
with a 21-7 run that began midway through the third quarter and
ended two minutes into the fourth. Suddenly, the 36-year-old Ewing
was defying his age, heft and predictions that his role would
disappear by tip-toeing through the paint for layups and rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the 35-year-old Terry Porter, a last-minute free-agent find
for the Heat, dusted off his experience and launched two
desperation jumpers in the face of Childs. Each time, the shot
clock was down to two seconds. Pulling the kind of stunt shots
usually reserved for Tim Hardaway against the Knicks, Porter hit a
long jumper and a 3-pointer. The latter broke a 73-73 tie with six
minutes left. The Knicks, who hit only 2 of their last 13 shots,
scored only one field goal after that. Houston missed one
3-pointer, Sprewell missed two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to hit home runs instead of getting the quick 2
points and playing,'' Van Gundy said. ``If they had been open
three's, fine. But I didn't think any of them were open.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell isn't used to good looks at the basket. And as a former
Warrior, he isn't used being able to lean on the talent around him,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to come here and feel like he has to carry the
load,'' Childs said. ``He shouldn't feel like he has to dominate
the game. I'd just tell him to relax and play his game. This whole
season is an adjustment, but I guess it's more so for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having the ball in his hands on every possession,
Sprewell may go five minutes without touching it. Instead of being
the only scorer on the floor, he had Houston and Ewing and Johnson
whirling around him like satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process, but I'm adjusting,'' Sprewell said. ``I don't
have to carry things anymore.'' &QL;

SONICS A TOUGH READ AMID NBA'S `MIDSEASON' PARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As is customary at this early February juncture of the
NBA season, it's time for the midseason report card.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the season so far is the
parity. Who could have imagined last summer that by the All-Star
Game break every team in the league would be either tied for the
divisional lead or no more than one game back?
</P>
<P>
   For years, the NFL has worked actively toward this kind of
balance. But as the sports fan has come to learn this decade, the
NBA always seems to be a step quicker than every other sport.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA puts to shame major league baseball, where more than
half the teams will enter spring training with no hope of a
championship, thanks to huge, unchecked revenue disparities between
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here is pro hoops, almost at Valentine's Day, and no team,
thanks to the NBA's enlightened, creative labor policies, is
anywhere close to elimination (with the possible exception of the
Clippers, who have an automatic entry into the NIT).
</P>
<P>
   And since every game at KeyArena has gone into overtime,
including Friday night's 92-86 win over the Dallas Mavericks, the
promise of excitement is almost unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   There is a problem, however. Such evenness makes it difficult to
distinguish the trends that will be difference-makers in the
season's second half. Other than the dominance of the Mavericks,
who have never beaten the Sonics this year, it is hard to make
sweeping assessments about the Seattle club.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some Sonic and league developments are clear at
the mid-winter break:
</P>
<P>
   --Despite a change in management, Gary Payton still owns this
team. His season averages of 28 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists
are testaments to the best guard in the game, now that
what's-his-name is back to selling phone service.
</P>
<P>
   --Soon-to-be-Thin Vin Baker is almost playing as well as he did
during the last regular season. But his season doesn't start until
he makes everyone forget last year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   --Given George Karl's magnificent regular-season record, Sonic
fans were naturally concerned that the transition to new coach Paul
Westphal would be filled with problems. While Westphal is indeed a
thousand words behind Karl in the quote standings, the undefeated
record speaks eloquently to his basketball genius. Club president
Wally Walker has never made a more inspired coaching hire.
</P>
<P>
   --The shift of Hersey Hawkins from starting guard to reserve, to
accommodate the main offseason acquisition, Belly, er, Billy Owens,
is a bust. The controversial move so far has Owens averaging just 5
points in 22 minutes, while Hawkins, who gets the, ahem, bulk of
the minutes, has scored just two points all season.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope, however, as soon as the Sonics figure whether
Owens on defense has his feet nailed to the floor or merely glued.
</P>
<P>
   --The many scattered patches of empty seats at Key Arena,
particularly in the rich-people regions, is an ominous sign.
Although the building is said to be sold out regularly, it's plain
at least some fans this season prefer to stay at home with Jerry
Springer's TV show if they need to see chunky people pointing and
pushing.
</P>
<P>
   --The league's newest feature, a requirement that each player
shoot at least one airball a game, is taken far too seriously by
the Sonics. Just Friday night the Sonics shot 40 percent, and the
Mavericks missed 10 of 11 field goal attempts in overtime.
Nevertheless, fans of tradition can savor the 5-foot jump-hook
airball from Olden Polynice, who despite his seven-year absence
from Seattle is still packing his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   --Averaging a double-double (11 points, 13 rebounds), Polynice
should be considered just behind Shaquille O'Neal and David
Robinson in the voting for Western Conference All-Star center,
presuming voters in KeyArena are not injured by shrapnel from his
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   --Despite his 36 years, Detlef Schrempf hasn't lost so much as a
single adjective when it comes to complaining to the officials. The
ravages of age often cause many players to moderate, but Schrempf
has shown no loss of victimhood.
</P>
<P>
   --The Mavericks' Cedric Ceballos might be the greatest fat
player since Billy ``The Whopper'' Paultz. In the most recent game
Friday, the semi-cherubic forward had 16 points, including multiple
drives past Sonic defenders, who reinforced the long-ago conclusion
of third-grade spelling class that there is no D in Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   --In the Mavericks' starting frontline tandem of 7-foot-6 center
Shawn Bradley and 7-0 rookie forward Dirk Nowitzki, Northwest
residents have not seen so much slow whiteness since the Nisqually
Glacier.
</P>
<P>
   --In Moochie Norris, the Sonics have the greatest first name in
NBA back-up point guard history. But you knew that right from the
beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So for the second half of the NBA season, the Sonics find
themselves well positioned _ closing in on the lead, backing away
from the buffet table and owning the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   How could Jordan walk away from this?

SPORTS COLUMN: HEAT-KNICKS A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY REUNION
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BKN-KNICKS-HEAT) 
(ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tim Hardaway greeted Latrell Sprewell in his first
Eastern Conference grudge match with a hug. This, he was showing,
is how the Knicks and the Heat play defense against each other. And
welcome, he was saying, to another one of our dysfunctional family
reunions.
</P>
<P>
   Always interesting, never pretty, Miami-New York has become a
rugby scrum of a basketball series, leading neither side very far
from the other. In any game, in the playoffs, it is the waltz of
the flawed, the clashing of persistent championship dreams that are
typically half-baked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just two teams coming out to play and win,'' Hardaway
argued Sunday after Pat Riley's weekend was made with an 83-79
Miami victory in the post-lockout Madison Square Garden opener.
``The media makes it more than it really is. We're tired of that
rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell it to the coaches, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning, the
fans, the network and Sprewell, whose fully guaranteed offensive
game was quickly squashed and assimilated into the Knicks-Miami
mush. ``It's very different,'' Sprewell had to admit after scoring
an eye-opening 5 points, after the Knicks out-rebounded the Heat by
20 and still managed to lose. ``Especially when you don't do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Join the club, Club Knickerbricker, which shot 37.1 percent from
the floor, and a Chris Dudley-like 45.5 percent from the line. The
Knicks, ever imaginative in giving the ball away, were on the verge
of being blown out in the third quarter for the second straight
game. But the Heat predictably went Antarctic-cold, Mourning put
himself on the bench with a senseless fourth foul and the game
pretty much came down to two perimeter prayers by Terry Porter, 36
years old come April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wily,' is what Hardaway said of the veteran backup guard,
unless he was just giving credit to the man who fills the dual role
of Heat president and coach. The man who assembled a collection of
talent that is, much like the Knicks, perfectly acceptable for any
aspiring playoff team, except one with a self-imposed mandate to
win it all.
</P>
<P>
   Wily Riley left New York in 1995, for his fortune and the
accompanying power to build a champion without corporate
interference. So petty and bitter was that last season and his
back-door departure that you wonder sometimes if both parties have
been sentenced by an authority higher than David Stern to never
escape each other's shadow, to pursue the same players (Mourning,
Chris Childs, Sprewell), to be no more prominent than vengeful and
wary rivals, the Iran and Iraq of the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with Riley and Jeff Van Gundy, their rosters are
littered with corresponding halves of broken marriages, productive
relationships turned sour. Once mentor and pupil, Riley and Van
Gundy barely speak, even though the latter's brother, Stan, remains
Riley's assistant. Mourning and Larry Johnson, former bookend
franchise players in Charlotte, disgraced themselves in a playoff
fist fight last spring. Chris Childs and P.J. Brown, overachieving
buddies a while back in New Jersey, are now respectively known for
a playoff throat-slashing gesture and body slam.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hardaway and Sprewell, once upon a time the high-octane
backcourt at Golden State, split up a few years ago in the wake of
celebrated ball-sharing deficiencies. They have apparently made
their peace, at least until the next Knicks-Heat brawl breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spree knows how to play,'' Hardaway said. ``You've just got to
give him more time. When he gets adjusted, watch out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell never figured out Miami's swarming interior defense,
the kind the Knicks don't play with the same urgency now that
Charles Oakley, among others, is gone. By the fourth quarter,
Sprewell was content to shoot jumpers, missing two 3-pointers,
classic chucks late in the game, the first with an astonished Ewing
wide open on the right baseline.
</P>
<P>
   The best news for the Knicks was the re-emerging hop in Ewing's
gait, his 24 points (albeit on 25 shots) and 17 boards. The good
news was the productive work of Larry Johnson, although the basket
sometimes looks 12 feet high when the Knicks' undersized power
forward tries to score inside. Sprewell will not often shoot 2 of
12. He will become more comfortable with Allan Houston, with Ewing.
The Knicks, despite obvious flaws, will soon begin to win more than
they lose.
</P>
<P>
   When Riley comes in, though, it is impossible not to wonder what
might have been. His signature acquisition in Miami was Mourning,
who is no championship center, but might have been the perfect
power forward complement to Ewing, his aging pal from the
close-knit clan of Georgetown centers.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Knicks and Heat seem to belong to an extended family
_ never getting along, never too far apart, in any game, in any
season, in any Eastern Conference scheme. Their games are a holiday
dinner, an uproar about to happen, neither side moving on without a
piece of itself left behind. Neither side complete enough to live
happily ever after.

JOINT VENTURE   AIMS TO CREATE INTERNET WORLD WITHOUT WIRES 
(DW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In what is being billed as the next giant step in the
Internet revolution, the Motorola &UR;  &LR; Corp., the maker of wireless
communications products, and Cisco Systems &UR;  &LR; Inc., which provides
Internet equipment, plan to form an alliance that would build the
world's largest wireless Internet system.
</P>
<P>
   The project is the most ambitious effort yet to build a global
network that would enable businesses and consumers to have
high-speed Internet access to e-mail and faxes without the burden
of wires, cables or even walls.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is expected to be announced Monday at a cellular
telephone conference in New Orleans, makes Motorola and Cisco
Systems the latest communications and networking giants to join
forces in an attempt to capitalize on the increasing popularity of
the Internet and the rapid growth of wireless communications
products.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four or five years, Motorola and Cisco say they
plan to invest more than $1 billion to create a system capable of
transmitting voice, data and video over existing cellular telephone
stations directly to wireless telephones, laptop computers and
other devices.
</P>
<P>
   The system would create a new line of products for Motorola, a
new generation of wireless networking gear for Cisco and perhaps
even signal the convergence of several existing communications
products, like pagers, cellular telephones, televisions, radios and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies also plan to open four joint research and
development centers, two in the United States and two abroad.
</P>
<P>
   A critical piece of the puzzle, Motorola and Cisco say, is that
the wireless transmissions would be delivered using an Internet
Protocol platform that is compatible with all wireless formats.
Unlike analog or digital platforms, the companies say that the
Internet Protocol, or IP platform, will be able to deliver and
bundle voice, data and video feeds through cellular stations.

   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. _ At the same time that Rep. Asa Hutchinson
was in Washington, deposing Vernon Jordan and otherwise helping his
fellow House impeachment managers further the case against
President Clinton, Vicki Young was nursing a bitter cup of coffee
at the Grapevine Restaurant, plotting her congressman's political
demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's completely clear that what the Republicans and
Asa Hutchinson want is vengeance, not justice,'' said the
45-year-old former auditor for a local automotive supplier who has
become a fledgling anti-impeachment activist in recent weeks.
``They are very wrong in thinking people will forget what they've
done. I honestly think it's going to go against them in the next
election.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, in the face of poll after poll showing overwhelming
sentiment for a rapid end to the impeachment process, Hutchinson
and the other House managers have insisted that they felt
duty-bound to pursue impeachment to its fullest conclusion. If
there is a political price to be paid for this, they said, they
will just have to pay it.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson's supporters say they are confident that the popular
congressman, who has played a high-profile role in the proceedings
_ both on the Senate floor and before the television cameras
outside the Senate _ will safely overcome any lingering discontent
over impeachment before re-election time in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But many Arkansas Democrats are not so sure. They smell blood in
the water.
</P>
<P>
   And they point to such things as the emergence of Vicki Young, a
political novice who was so incensed by Hutchinson's role in the
impeachment that she has taken it upon herself to organize meetings
to build a grass-roots movement to do something about it, as an
indication that the final bill presented to the House managers in
2000 may just prove higher than some of them can pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's hard to say if his role in the impeachment will
hurt him,'' said Ann Harbison, the Democratic Party chairwoman for
Washington County, the second most populous in the district.
``Hutchinson is enormously popular. But I think it's safe to say
that we will field a strong, well-financed candidate against him in
2000. There is a feeling that he may be vulnerable now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, a former federal prosecutor and Arkansas Republican
Party leader, is in his second term representing the state's 3rd
Congressional District, which encompasses the northwest corner of
Arkansas. Whites make up 96 percent of the district's population,
and it is the fastest growing and the most Republican part of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton narrowly carried the district in 1992, winning 43
percent to 42 percent for President George Bush, and narrowly lost
it in 1996, when it went 45 percent to 44 percent for former Sen.
Bob Dole. Indeed, Republicans have represented the district since
1966, usually with little significant opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Hutchinson won the seat to succeed his brother, Tim,
who was elected to the U.S. Senate that year. Asa Hutchinson won 56
percent of the vote in the 1996 general election. The Democrats did
not run anyone against him in 1998 and he was easily re-elected,
winning 80.8 percent of the vote to a reform candidate's 19.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks local Democratic leaders, spurred by state party
officials, began reaching out to several potential candidates, and
said they hoped to announce something solid soon.
</P>
<P>
   But even those most eager to capitalize on the congressman's
potential vulnerability acknowledge that it will be an uphill
battle for the Democrats to recapture the district. And many
independent observers agree.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Moseley, the editorial page editor of The Southwest Times
Record in Fort Smith, the district's largest city, said that almost
every letter the paper received from readers before Hutchinson's
appearance in the Senate in January as one of 13 House managers in
the impeachment trial had praised him.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, letters criticizing the congressman's
impeachment role began to arrive in increasing numbers, Moseley
said, and the sentiment now seems to be running about 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost no one criticized him before this, so there's no doubt
that it's hurt him,'' Moseley said. ``But this is a very
conservative Republican district, so I expect he'll continue to
represent it in Congress despite all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Art English, a political-science professor at the University of
Arkansas, said that while he suspects that impeachment sentiments
in the district are pretty much in line with the rest of the
country, he does not think this means that Republicans will turn
against their congressman. ``I'd be very surprised if that turns
out to be the case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clyde Hawkins, the Democratic Party's chairman in Scott
County, in the southern part of the district, says he does not
believe the party has a chance of unseating Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I think he's getting high praise for the way he's
done his job during this, at least that's what I'm hearing in this
part of the district,'' Hawkins said. ``Frankly, I don't think we
can touch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have responded to Hutchinson's critics with a series
of radio advertisements saying that ``some people still believe in
truth and justice,'' and ending with a simple, ``Thank you, Asa.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gray, who runs the congressman's district office in
Fayetteville, says he has been amazed by the wave of calls the
office has received during the impeachment proceedings, especially
last fall, when the House was considering the impeachment issue,
and in January, when it came before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had something like 1,100 calls in October about impeachment
in this one office alone,'' he said. ``And they were pretty well
split on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young finished her coffee and looked around the otherwise
empty back room at the Grapevine Restaurant in Paris, Ark., a small
town in Logan County, at the southern edge of the 3rd District.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got so angry about this impeachment dragging on and on
that I called the state party officials and asked, `What can I
do?''' she said. She was advised to call friends, organize meetings
and build an organization.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen people attended the first meeting at the Grapevine
a few weeks ago. A second gathering is scheduled for next Monday
night. State party officials will drive over from Little Rock to
speak to them, Ms. Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking this one step at a time,'' she said. ``But we're
not giving up. They have been unfair to the president and they're
going to pay for it.''

HUSSEIN, A   CHAMPION OF PEACE, DIES AT 63 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ King Hussein bin Talal survived a half century
of war, attempted assassinations, failed coups, and the risks that
come to those courageous enough to make peace, but Sunday he lost a
final battle with a relentless enemy _ cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He was 63. One of the world's longest serving heads of state,
the monarch transformed his nation from a desert expanse with few
resources into one of the Mideast's more modern, industrious, and
stable countries. His most enduring mark on history will probably
be the 1994 peace agreement he signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A man described by friends as both gutsy and forgiving, he had
suffered through seven months of invasive treatment _ chemotherapy
and bone marrow transplants _ for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After a
final and futile treatment at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic, he was
rushed home on Friday to fulfill his wish that he die in his
homeland. After having been on life support at a military hospital,
he died at 11:43 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
   The throne of Jordan's Hashemite kingdom passes now to Hussein's
oldest son, Abdullah bin al-Hussein. The late king's dramatic
choice of the 37-year-old Abdullah _ and the dismissal of Hussein's
brother, Prince Hassan, the likely heir for more than three decades
_ came in January amid weeks of palace intrigue. The succession
announcement reverberated throughout Jordan and the region, where
this strategic nation is caught between Iraq's unpredictability and
Israel's military might.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah remains an untested inheritor of a kingdom that faces
daunting geopolitical and economic challenges. However, Abdullah
has shown he carries some of his father's best traits, the common
touch and the respectful nature that endeared Hussein to Arab
leaders and Western powers alike.
</P>
<P>
   Treading a careful path
</P>
<P>
   Still, the void left by Hussein's passing is enormous. Critics
claim his rule was authoritarian, too slow to enact democratic
reform. But none dispute that he became a consummate statesman,
treading a line that favored the West during the Cold War but later
embracing nationalist sentiments from the streets of the Arab
world. No other monarch so personified the country he ruled. And in
this volatile region, none worked harder for peace.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Hussein played a gallant role when President Clinton
sought to rekindle the dying Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Clinton brought both sides together at the Wye River Plantation in
Maryland for nine days of dogged diplomacy, and Hussein left his
hospital bed to nudge the negotiations along.
</P>
<P>
   In a White House ceremony, Hussein won the hearts of the crowd
by joking about his baldness and the loss of his beard and mustache
from radiation treatments. His eyes were rimmed with dark circles.
A short but eloquent speech underscored a philosophy of peace
tempered through years of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no right to dictate through irresponsible action or
narrow-mindedness the future of our children and their children's
children,'' he said. ``There has been enough destruction. Enough
death. Enough waste. And it's time that, together, we occupy a
place beyond ourselves, our peoples, that is worthy of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was born to inherit the crown, but history was thrust
upon him at age 16.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, 1951, he stood alongside his grandfather King
Abdullah when the monarch was gunned down by a young Palestinian on
the steps of Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque during Friday prayers.
Hussein, who was dressed in military uniform, later said that a
bronze medal his grandfather had pinned to his tunic deflected a
bullet that was intended for him.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah's oldest son, Talal, took the throne. Suffering
from schizophrenia, he was forced to abdicate within a year in
favor of a regency for his oldest son, Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1953, Hussein returned from Britain's Sandhurst military
academy and was crowned as the boy king.
</P>
<P>
   Before his coronation, he had an adventurous youth, riding
motorcycles and hunting in the untamed desert that then surrounded
Amman, recalls Marwan Qassam, a boyhood friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the prince, but he was also one of us,'' said Qassam,
who served Hussein for decades in several top posts, including
foreign minister and chief of the royal court. ``He was mischievous
and daring and loved the outdoors. We used to hunt where the
Intercontinental Hotel now is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legacy he will leave is that he made Jordan out of
nothing,'' said Qassam. ``When we were growing up, Amman had only
one asphalt road.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Amman is a clean and efficient capital that boasts wide
boulevards lined with clothing boutiques and American fast-food
chains. It has been built with a bounty of foreign aid, from the
United States, Europe, and the oil-rich Gulf states. This has been
the genius of the Hashem clan, figuring out how to bring money into
a country that lacks basic resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The king did this through his own personal contacts with world
leaders,'' said Fahed Fanek, an economist and one of Jordan's
leading columnists. ``They were direct and very human contacts. The
world trusted him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites trace their lineage to the Prophet Mohammed in
what is now Saudi Arabia. Their claim to Jordan has relatively
shallow roots, and it is one of the King's enduring achievements
that through a 46-year reign he transformed what some consider a
questionable right to the land into a sustaining image of royal
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   During World War I, Hussein's great-grandfather, also named
Hussein, used the Hashem clan's religious legitimacy to stir up the
``Arab Revolt'' against the Ottoman Empire, with the backing of
Lawrence of Arabia, the British adventurer.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the Hashemite patriarch and his two sons were
rewarded with the governorship of two states. Faisal wound up as
king of Iraq and Abdullah was handed the newly formed Kingdom of
Transjordan. After Faisal's death, his son, Faisal II, was executed
in a revolt and Iraq became a republic. Since Abdullah's
assassination, King Hussein struggled to preserve the last
Hashemite dynasty and hold together a diverse people.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of Jordan's more than 4 million people come
from Palestinian families dispossessed after the creation of the
state of Israel in 1948. A second wave came in the aftermath of the
1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's decision to attack Israel in 1967 was his worst
miscalculation as leader. Israel easily captured the West Bank of
the Jordan River and East Jerusalem, which had been under the rule
of the kingdom. Seven hundred Jordanian soldiers were killed and
6,000 injured, more than a quarter century before the two countries
would make peace.
</P>
<P>
   As Fanek put it, ``If history is kind, he will be remembered as
the man who made peace with Israel. If history is unkind, he will
be remembered as the man who lost Jerusalem to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1967 war, some 100,000 West Bank Palestinians ended up
in squalid refugee camps, where they nurtured their hatred not only
for Israel but for their host, the king. At first Hussein permitted
the Palestinian ``fedayeen,'' or guerrillas, to stage attacks on
Israel from Jordan. But soon Hussein found himself in a struggle
against Palestinian factions. The month in 1970 when Hussein
finally and mercilessly attacked this growing Palestinian state
within his kingdom would never be forgotten. Palestinians called it
Black September.
</P>
<P>
   At this time Hussein also began cultivating secret contacts with
Israel and the CIA, which were recently outlined in the book
``Collusion Across the Jordan,'' by Israeli historian Avi Shlaim.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University professor and Palestinian commentator Edward
Said wrote in Newsweek: ``What motivated Hussein has less to do
with intellect or ideology than a desire to amass and hold onto
power . . . Jordan is really just a quasi-police state presided
over by a seemingly benevolent despot.''

   Throughout the decades of turmoil in the Middle East, Hussein
came of age alongside his kingdom. He was known as a wild man who
loved soccer, night life, race car driving and flying. Through four
marriages and 12 children, the palace was always buzzing with
children and family gossip. He gained a higher profile in the
United States with his fourth marriage, in 1978, to Lisa Halaby of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein kept a tight hold on power. Throughout the Cold War,
Hussein remained firmly in the Western camp despite the Soviet ties
developed by Arab neighbors Egypt, Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Persian Gulf War suddenly tipped the king's diplomatic
balance. Officially, his position was neutral. But his rhetoric
supported Iraq's Saddam Hussein. As Washington built an alliance
with Arab states, then-President Bush was furious that Hussein had
opted out.
</P>
<P>
   Adnan Abu Odeh, a senior palace official at the time and later
chief justice of the Royal Court, said, ``We were in a very weak
point after the Gulf War because we had lost our regional role. The
king was very worried about the fate of the dynasty. But he had the
foresight and the courage to see a clear way into the future, and
that was through peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Odeh added, ``was his crowning achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after the historic Oslo accords were signed by the
Israelis and Palestinians, Jordan quickly made its own peace.
Hussein reached out across decades of hostility to shake hands on
the White House lawn with Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin and Hussein grew close, and during a visit by Hussein to
Israel, the prime minister said to him: ``You led your country and
your people under difficult times. It is a day when we celebrate
together.''

 WASHINGTON: in it.''

<P>
   &LR; Mrs. Feinstein and Sen. Robert F. Bennett of Utah, the chief
Republican sponsor of a censure resolution, are trying to find a
formula that is tough enough to attract people like McConnell, but
not so harsh as to drive away Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One late draft criticized Clinton's misconduct as ``shameless,
reckless and indefensible,'' and concluded that the president
``gave false and misleading testimony and impeded the discovery of
evidence in judicial proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we can craft a statement that can come together in any
kind of cohesive numbers is still very much up in the air,''
Bennett said on ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The censure wording, which is still being revised, is not the
only hurdle. Any resolution would need a simple majority, 51 votes,
to pass. But in reality, censure supporters need at least 60 votes
to break a filibuster that Gramm has vowed to wage.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats warned they will make Republicans pay a steep
political price _ on top of the beating Republicans have taken in
the polls for their handling of impeachment _ if Gramm carries out
his threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a Republican continuation of this agony that
prevents me from getting at 10,000 laid-off steelworkers in West
Virginia,'' Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, said on
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Censure proponents want a vote on their resolution this week,
after the impeachment articles. Any censure would likely lose
support on both sides if they wait until after the Senate's
one-week break, which starts next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Even as senators argued over censure, they also faced a
difficult decision on whether to open their final deliberations.
Supporters say such a debate is too important to conduct behind
closed doors, but opponents say senators should deliberate in
private, like any other American jury.
</P>
<P>
   Suspending the rules to allow the open debate requires 67 votes,
and a leading Republican vote counter, and critic of the idea, Judd
Gregg of New Hampshire, said supporters were still about four votes
short. Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said that
unless Senate Majority Leader Trent Lottbacks the proposal, it will
likely lose. Lott is undecided.

AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHTS CANCELED IN DISPUTE WITH PILOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines was forced to cancel more than 300 flights
over the weekend after scores of its pilots, who are upset about
American's recent acquisition of a small West Coast carrier, called
in sick.
</P>
<P>
   American, which is the United States' second-largest airline,
said that it had canceled 240, or 11 percent, of its scheduled
2,250 flights Sunday and 90 flights on Saturday. Chris Chiames, a
spokesman for the airline, said that he would not know until Monday
how many passengers were stranded by the cancellations but that
most of the affected passengers were being put on later flights or
on other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   At O'Hare International Airport near Chicago, which is a big hub
for the airline, the disruption appeared minimal on Sunday. ``We
have good weather conditions and it wasn't a tremendously busy
day,'' said Dennis Culloton, a spokesman for the Chicago Airport
System, which operates the airport. ``That being said, obviously,
there are some passengers being inconvenienced by this, and that is
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   But at Miami International Airport, there were long lines to
check in for American domestic flights. ``I feel livid,'' said
Melissa Blankenstine, a high school principal from Los Angeles. ``I
don't think it's fair to hold up people's personal lives like
this.'' She said American announced that the flight was canceled
but officials would not say why.
</P>
<P>
   The disruptions will likely continue until the airline's
management and the Allied Pilots Association, or APA, the
independent union that represents American's 9,200 pilots, agree on
how American will merge its operations with Reno Air, the small
budget airline that AMR Corp., American's parent company, bought in
December for $124 million.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have been negotiating intensely for two weeks over
how Reno's 300 pilots and 25 jets will be integrated into
American's much larger network. Talks ended on Friday without an
agreement. The union said Sunday that it was ready to meet with the
company at any time, but no new negotiations have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the talks said that American had told the
union that it would not return to the bargaining table until the
pilots stopped hampering the airline's operations.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear Sunday whether the union's leadership had
called for the job action. Rich LaVoy, the union's president, did
not explicitly ask pilots to call in sick in a recorded message to
union members Sunday. However, he did urge pilots not to fly if
they did not feel physically fit.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that the dispute's effect on morale would discourage
pilots from volunteering for extra hours in the cockpit. Union
officials did not return several calls on Sunday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the result of any national action from
leadership,'' said Bradley Bartholomew, who publishes a newsletter
about labor issues in the airline industry and said he spoke to
some American pilots on Sunday. ``It is a ground swell of concern
from membership.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Resentment has been growing among some American pilots for
months because of what they see as an attempt by the airline to
chip away at their contract. ``This may be some of the effect of a
backlash due to a continued course of ill-advised and dishonorable
conduct,'' one pilot who insisted on anonymity said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots say that the acquisition of Reno Air, which was made
official on Dec. 23, violated one of the core protections in their
contract, which states that any flying done at American or its
subsidiaries will be done by members of their union. Reno's pilots
are represented by another union, the Air Line Pilots Association,
and earn roughly half the average $150,000 annual salary received
by pilots at American.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said that it has every intention of merging the
two airlines but that it will take a year to 18 months, because
Reno Air's airplanes need to be refitted and pilots at both
carriers need to be retrained.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilots are concerned that American's real aim is to use
Reno Air to start a low-cost ``airline within an airline'' similar
to those that exist at United Airlines, U S Airways and others.
American could then transfer flying from mainline pilots to
lower-paid pilots at the low-cost operation.
</P>
<P>
   American has said unequivocally that it is not planning such a
move. ``They are talking emotions and sound bites and we are
talking logic,'' said Chiames, the American spokesman.
``Unfortunately, logic is not prevailing.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots are also eager to set a precedent. ``With the
possibility of other acquisitions looming on the horizon,'' LaVoy,
the president, told members on Sunday, ``APA simply cannot afford
to agree to something that will come back to haunt all of us if AMR
buys other airlines larger and more senior than Reno Air.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots said their proposal would allow American to pay Reno
less for 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   American said it had proposed speeding up training to make the
integration of Reno go faster. It also said the merger would
benefit American pilots by speeding up promotion to captain.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER AND PROVIDER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The skinny 16-year-old lad, who lived in a one-room
apartment in San Pedro de Macoris, a small town in the Dominican
Republic, with his widowed mother and four brothers and two sisters
who were so poor that they ate just one meal a day, was in the
airport in Santo Domingo and about to board a plane for America.
</P>
<P>
   His mother was in tears. ``Don't go,'' the boy's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go we'll all die here,'' she said. The lad, after all,
had shined shoes and washed cars to help earn enough money to put
the rice and beans on the table for the family's meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go, Mama,'' he said, ``but I'll be back. And I
will help us all.''
</P>
<P>
   And so in the summer of 1986, with a bonus of $3,500 to play
baseball in the Texas Rangers organization, he flew off to seek his
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   And true to his promise, Sammy Sosa did come back. Most
dramatically, perhaps, was last October, after he, along with Mark
McGwire, had hit so many home runs during the baseball season, 136
between them, that they became two of the most famous people in not
just America, but also many parts of the world. He was, among other
notable moments, invited to attend President Clinton's State of the
Union address last month, and Pope John Paul II praised him and
McGwire for their accomplishments in his recent visit to America.
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa returned to the Dominican Republic in October it was a
short time after Hurricane Georges had virtually leveled the
island. Thousands were homeless, more than 200 had been killed. He
had personally sought and received a donation from Major League
Baseball to help in relief _ baseball gave $1 million. Sosa also
had given a large sum of his own money as well as directing parts
of his endorsement money and money from the Sammy Sosa Charity
Foundation for Dominican aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got off the plane at Las Americas airport,'' Sosa said,
seated in a suite in a Manhattan hotel on Sunday, ``there was
something like a half million people there to greet me. It was one
of the most thrilling moments of my life. The president of my
country, Leonel Fernandez, had declared a national holiday on the
day of my return. Then the people cheered when I drove through the
streets, where the wood from the torn-down houses was still
scattered all around. For just a moment, anyway, everybody forgot
about the hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was in town Sunday to receive his National League most
valuable player award for 1998 at the annual dinner of the New York
chapter of the Baseball Writers Association. He had one of the
greatest years in baseball history, hitting 66 homers _ just four
short of McGwire's record _ batting in 158 runs, scoring 134 runs
and hitting .308, and playing right field for the playoff-bound
Chicago Cubs about as well as he produced at the plate. In his
spare time, the slugger stole 18 bases.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Sosa's mother, Lucrecia, had little to worry
about when her fifth of seven children departed for the United
States. He recently bought a comfortable house for her, and when
she gets restless she may sleep in one of the eight bedrooms in the
house Sosa is building for himself in Santo Domingo. He has been
able to do this on a four-year contract he signed two years ago
with the Cubs for $42.5 million. And the endorsements and other
business opportunities he has capitalized on recently will earn him
an estimated $10 million more a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa left school in the seventh grade because his mother, after
his father's death, needed him to help support the family. It's a
well-known story now how Sosa would shine the shoes and wash the
cars of baseball stars from the Dominican Republic like George Bell
and Pedro Guerrero and Joaquin Andujar. He dreamed of having what
they had. And he has seen some of them fall on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mirror for me,'' he said. ``I am careful with what I
have. When you've been as poor as I have, you never forget it. You
know you can lose what you have. I try not to be foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was anything foolish about his post-1998 season, it was
telling Mayor Giuliani in a City Hall ceremony honoring Sosa that
the bat he was giving him was the one he had hit his 66th homer
with. It turned out not to be so. ``I got a little nervous,'' Sosa
said. ``The mayor was so nice to me, and I didn't want to
disappoint him.''
</P>
<P>
   A tempest with the Congress of Racial Equality followed, in
which Sosa was supposed to have made demands regarding a private
plane and other accommodations to come to New York for its awards
dinner. ``When I give my word that I will be someplace,'' Sosa
said, ``I will be there. It was a misunderstanding, but I never
gave my word to CORE.''
</P>
<P>
   As to next season, will he feel pressure to equal or surpass
last season? ``Baseball is not pressure,'' he said. ``Pressure is
when you're 7 years old and you don't have food to eat. I used to
cry a lot, inside. So when you've come from nowhere and have all
that I have now, I sleep like a baby every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even after all that's gone on this off season, I feel
mentally and physically ready to play this season. Even if I hit 10
homers next season _ yes, 10 homers! _ it will be a success because
I'll be trying my best. But I am confident. So I say, `Let the show
begin.''' &QL;

JORDAN MOURNS, THE CROWN IS PASSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Rain and sorrow fell hard over this nation
Sunday as it said goodbye to its beloved King Hussein, and tried to
adjust to the new words ``His Majesty King Abdullah.''
</P>
<P>
   On a raw winter day of swirling emotions on the streets and in
the palace, the monarch's oldest son, Abdullah, 37, was sworn in
and given full powers as the new king of the Hashemite dynasty.
Hussein's 18-year-old son Hamzah, the oldest from his marriage to
Queen Noor, was named crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and the world reflected on Hussein's indelible legacy as
a man of peace and compassion who ruled through 46 turbulent years
in the Middle East. With the crown passing to a new generation,
questions remain over Jordan's stability, the future of the peace
process, and the nation's profound economic challenges.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, it was hard enough for Jordanians to deal with the
sense of loss and the burial that lay ahead Monday. More than 40
heads of state, including President Clinton, arrived in Jordan for
the funeral. Enemies and allies, leaders of Western powers and
small Persian Gulf nations were coming together to mourn Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has welcomed home a good and faithful servant,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   At Al Hussein Medical Center, where he had been on life support
for three days, Hussein's blood pressure began dropping rapidly
Sunday morning, causing cardiac arrest, palace officials said. He
was pronouced dead at 11:43 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, sitting in his father's chair and behind his palace
desk, announced the news in Arabic to his nation. On a day in which
symbols carried great weight, this image was intended to convey
continuity and stability. Flanking him were portraits of his father
and of Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soul of King Hussein will always be with us,'' he told the
nation. ``It won't disappear from our hearts and our souls.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was carried without analysis or commentary on
government-controlled radio and television. The telecast was
followed by the image of an Islamic cleric in the soft light of a
mosque who began a melodic and mournful chanting of passages from
the Muslim holy book, the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who claimed direct descent from the prophet Mohammed,
was known for his deep faith.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians sat stunned by the news, even though many had
resigned themselves to his imminent death. More than 80 percent of
Jordanians had known no other ruler.
</P>
<P>
   With the rain lashing the streets of Amman, government offices,
banks, industries, and small shops began closing as people rushed
home to their families. Black banners flew from car antennas, and
people pinned black strips of cloth to their chests.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the weather, people flocked to the Al Hussein Medical
Center by the hundreds. By 1 p.m. more than 2,000 had gathered.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was a montage of pain. Men and women reached their
hands to the sky and chanted in unison, ``There is only one God.''
Young men in red-and-white checkered kaffiyeh headdresses shouted,
``With our hearts, our blood, and our souls, we sacrifice for
you.'' They lifted framed portraits of the king high over their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   Overcome by emotions, dozens of mourners fainted, and were
carried on the shoulders of others into the hospital. At the front
gate, a palace guard clad in military fatigues and a red beret
remained straight at attention as his face broke into
uncontrollable sobbing. A man in a business suit and tie balanced
an umbrella and fingered prayer beads while silently mouthing the
words of a Muslim prayer. A mother and her teenage daughter in
traditional Islamic ``hijab,'' or robe and scarf, hugged and
consoled each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the faces, they say everything,'' said Suliman Hijat,
45, a mechanic who rushed from his job to the hospital when he
heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our father. He was our teacher. Today we are not
Palestinian, or Bedouin, or anything but Jordanian,'' said Hijat,
referring to the nation's ethnic mosaic. ``All of us are one in our
tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing off to one side was Samer Hadadi, 27, a reporter at
Jordan's Sheehan Weekly. She was supposed to be at her desk writing
a remembrance of the king, but simply could not do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I express what he meant to us, what he meant to the
world? It just seems too big. It is my job, but I cannot touch the
pen. I just had to come here and be as close to him as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The king's body was taken to the Bab al Salam (Gate of Peace)
Palace. Jordan began six days of official mourning, the first part
of a 40-day Muslim period of respect for the deceased. A funeral
procession will wind through Amman's streets Monday before the
burial in the royal cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Hashemite dynasty gathered in the palace to
mourn and to prepare for the Abdullah's coronation. On Sunday, he
had been handed responsibilities to rule as a regent, or acting
king, but not given the full title.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m., Abdullah arrived at Parliament in the same car as his
uncle, Prince Hassan, who for 34 years was the heir to the throne
until Hussein stripped him of the role last month. The dramatic
shift had reverberated through the family and the region, but
Sunday the new king and his uncle made a display of unity.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah put his hand on the Koran and took the oath of office,
and then sat in a red velvet throne with a golden crown, again
framed by a portrait of his father. Dressed in a business suit and
a kaffiyeh, he greeted members of the government's Cabinet and
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside him was Hassan. His uncle has a deep understanding of
Jordan's most crucial issues _ the economy, water resources, and
the peace process. Although some palace watchers say the tensions
that emerged between Hassan and Abdullah over succession may
resurface, most agree the young and untested king will need his
uncle's help to address these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan suffers 50 percent unemployment for those under age 41.
Its economy has not expanded in two years. The economic promises of
peace with Israel have not been realized. Its currency dipped as
investors reacted to the king's death.
</P>
<P>
   After Hussein's death, the government posted armored troop
transports with machine-gun mounts along a central boulevard.
Increased police and military presence was noticeable throughout
Amman, and sharpshooters perched on the roof of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   By naming his half-brother and Queen Noor's son, Hamzah, as the
new crown prince, Abdullah was fufilling the dying wish of his late
father, palace sources said. Hamzah is a handsome and gifted
sibling who, at 18, attends Britain's Sandhurst military academy,
as did his father and half-brother. From Sandhurst, Hamzah will
have to complete his college education before playing an active
role in governing.
</P>
<P>
   Hamzah's appointment secures Queen Noor's future role in the
palace. She will keep her title even though Abdullah's wife, the
striking and intelligent Palestinian Princess Rania, will also
carry the title.
</P>
<P>
   Palace watchers say Rania will emerge as a new face for
Palestinians, who represent more than 60 percent of Jordan's
population. And the Washington-born and Princeton-educated Queen
Noor will remain in the global limelight and continue her work on
social issues, such as banning landmines.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, a thick fog blanketed Amman. Silhouettes of figures
trudging through the rain stood out against the white fog, as
mourners such Shaban Samak, 31, kept flocking to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Samak vowed to maintain his vigil through the gathering darkness
and the relentless rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky,'' he said, ``is crying for you, King Hussein.''

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Joan Carroll, a retired schoolteacher in
Arlington, Texas, says she had to wait more than three months last
year before she could be treated for acute stomach pain and
dangerously high blood sugar levels.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? The medical specialists she needed would not take
her as a patient because, she said, they were embroiled in a
business dispute with her insurer, Aetna U.S. Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carroll, 57, was eventually told by doctors that she had
pancreatic cancer; she started chemotherapy last April. When a
surgeon finally examined her, he said the tumor was so large that
it could not be operated on.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much tumor growth did we get in January, February, March
and until late April?'' she asks now.
</P>
<P>
   About the time that Ms. Carroll was seeking treatment, 400
doctors in Tarrant County, which includes Arlington and Fort Worth,
had left Aetna, said Dr. Bohn D. Allen, her surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly all the specialists had dropped out of the Aetna plan
and were in the process of renegotiating'' contract terms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An Aetna spokeswoman said it was ``a tragedy'' if Ms. Carroll
had not been able to find a doctor ``because the physicians claimed
they were in a dispute with Aetna.'' Plan members should tell Aetna
if they feel that ``anyone has prevented them from accessing
care,'' said the spokeswoman, Jill Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had known,'' she said, ``we would have done whatever was
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carroll said she had followed the instructions in her Aetna
handbook and relied on her primary doctor, who referred her to the
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Carroll's case may be an extreme one, the dispute that
was its backdrop may become increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas doctors had pulled out of Aetna after objecting to a
number of demands by the company, including one that would force
them to participate in Aetna's lowest-paying health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies across the country, including a number of
Blue Cross managed care plans, are increasingly pressing doctors to
accept such ``all-or-nothing'' contracts. In California, where
managed care is particularly prevalent, these arrangements are
common.
</P>
<P>
   Under these contracts, doctors who participate in any type of an
insurer's health plan must agree to accept all other plans that the
insurer may then sell, regardless of the arrangements and payments
for doctors. Doctors in Texas said Aetna was the only company in
the state that was aggressively pressing this demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy in essence drives a market to all-HMO care,'' said
Dr. Howard Weiner, who heads a unit of the Genesis Physicians
Practice Association of 1,200 Dallas doctors. About half had
contracts with an Aetna health maintenance organization until
Genesis and Aetna began a standoff last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Genesis doctors also objected to provisions that they said
would let Aetna change the contracts at will, limit a doctor's
ability to sue the company and allow Aetna to determine medical
solutions in part based on what the contracts called ``the least
costly of alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, however, says the ``all-or-nothing'' provision benefits
consumers who can easily move from one Aetna health plan to another
without changing doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, chief medical officer of Aetna, said that
policy was ``a consumer-friendly approach,'' even if it was ``a
doctor-unfriendly approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors' worries are intensifying as Aetna Inc., which is
already one of the nation's biggest health insurers, attempts to
become even bigger by buying Prudential Health Care for $1 billion.
With Prudential, Aetna would be the dominant insurer in Texas and
New Jersey and one of the biggest in seven other states including
New York, Pennsylvania and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association and a number of state and local
physicians' groups are raising objections to the deal. They say
that with the takeover of Prudential Health Care, Aetna could use
its increased weight to force doctors to accept arrangements that
they contend would harm patient care.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief delivered last month to the Justice Department, which
is reviewing the merger, the medical association described concerns
about the Aetna-Prudential deal.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors argued that the acquisition, which would give Aetna
39 percent of the managed care plan members in Dallas-Fort Worth,
for example, and 40 percent in New Jersey, would enable the company
to impose ``onerous terms'' on physicians and allow it to take
``increasing control over how medical care is provided.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tarrant County, Texas, the company later agreed to somewhat
higher payments ``after long and vigorous negotiations,'' said
Allen, Ms. Carroll's surgeon. But Aetna refused to drop the
``all-or-nothing'' clause.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Aetna accused the Genesis doctors of ``antitrust law
violations'' in a letter last November. The letter said the Genesis
organization had successfully persuaded doctors not to return to
Aetna, causing the company ``significant harm.'' More than 400
doctors were still holding out last week, Aetna said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Aetna took out advertisements in The Dallas Morning
News in which it said it had added more than 1,000 doctors in the
last year and that it would ``continue to vigorously recruit the
best physicians and hospitals'' in the area.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this merger as potentially very troublesome,'' Allen
said. ``The health plan will be in a position to basically dictate
to the doctors on policies, payments and the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna officials have been meeting with doctors across the
country to try to calm their concerns.
 &UR;  &LR;  Some doctors in California are also at odds with Aetna over
payments.
</P>
<P>
   In San Mateo County, near San Francisco, where HMOs have a big
share of the market, the ``effective income of groups of doctors
has decreased almost 60 percent in the last five years,'' argued
Dr. Richard J. Levy, president of the San Mateo Independent
Practice Association. His group of 600 physicians ``terminated''
its association with Aetna last month.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said actual payments to doctor groups had shrunk by 24
percent since 1994, while the cost of medical services in the
high-cost Bay Area rose 23 percent, for ``an effective decrease in
reimbursement of 47 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't provide quality care with that kind of decrease,''
Levy said. ``We have a Prudential contract. We're very happy with
Prudential.'' But, he said, the practice association will lose
those patients if it does not have a contract with Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   Leibowitz said that more than 80 percent of the San Mateo
group's doctors still had individual contracts with Aetna. He
welcomed the steep decline in medical reimbursement in California,
which he called ``a great example of how the marketplace exerts
competitive pressure'' to bring down costs.

JET NOISE SOUNDS DIFFERENT UPSTATE, THREE AMBITIOUS POLITICIANS
FIND
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many politicians have long believed that the label
``too New York'' _ as in City _ is the scarlet letter of state
elections, suggesting all manner of evil to upstate New York
voters, from ultra-liberalism to ultra-pushiness.
</P>
<P>
   And though Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn,
overcame the tag last year in unseating Alfonse D'Amato,
politicians with statewide ambitions recognize that their handling
of upstate-downstate conflicts can still make or break their
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, concerns about alienating upstate voters may help
explain the responses of three New York politicians _ Schumer,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Rep. Nita Lowey _ last week to news that
the Clinton administration wants to allow more planes to take off
and land at the city's two major airports, La Guardia and Kennedy
International, by ending the system of ``slots,'' which limit how
many planes can land in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Giuliani, Schumer and Ms. Lowey have
strongly opposed efforts to increase the number of takeoff and
landing slots at La Guardia and Kennedy. But the response by the
three to the administration's proposal was muted.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? The pressures of statewide politics, for one
thing. Two years ago, all three were local officials with mainly
local concerns. Now Schumer represents the entire state in the
Senate, while Giuliani and Ms. Lowey are thinking of running for
New York's other Senate seat in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the polarizing issue of airline traffic. Few things are
more emotional for thousands of people who live near Kennedy and La
Guardia and believe that aircraft noise is already intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue generates almost equal passions in places like
Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany. It can cost more to fly
from New York City to these cities than to London, airline service
in the region can be spotty at best and many upstate companies say
the high cost of air travel threatens jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, many upstate officials contend, is to allow more
flights into important hubs like La Guardia and Kennedy, a change
that could help regional and start-up carriers that want to serve
upstate cities to compete with the big airlines that control that
market.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Giuliani joined Claire Shulman, the Queens borough
president, in suing the U.S. Department of Transportation to
prevent the addition of 21 new flights a day at La Guardia. Mrs.
Shulman was one of the mayor's most prominent Democratic supporters
in his 1997 re-election campaign, and the suit, which ultimately
failed, certainly was well received in Queens, Brooklyn and Staten
Island.
</P>
<P>
   But after Mrs. Shulman predicted on Friday that the mayor would
join her in opposing the Clinton administration's latest plan, the
mayor's aides demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to review this,'' said Deputy Mayor Randy Levine.
``The safety of the skies is paramount and we'll look at it in that
context. But we also believe we have to grow the airports.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine declined to elaborate on why the mayor was not prepared
to denounce a plan similar to one he had opposed a year before.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani knows a thing or two about upstate-downstate
conflicts from first-hand experience. In 1994, he broke Republican
Party ranks to endorse Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat. But when
Giuliani campaigned upstate for the governor, he seemed to
infuriate voters who did not want a city official, even a
Republican one, telling them whom to support.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also no doubt understands that Democrats, stealing a
page from the Republican playbook, are already saying that a
moderate-to-liberal Republican from New York City like Giuliani
will never excite the Republicans' conservative base upstate.
</P>
<P>
   But across the partisan divide, Ms. Lowey faces a similar
conundrum. A Democrat from Westchester, she has been an ardent
opponent of adding flights to La Guardia and Kennedy. When asked
about the Clinton administration plan on Friday, she said she did
not like it, but carefully framed her response to emphasize first
her concern about the upstate economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the upstate cities suffer the consequences of
expensive and inadequate air service,'' she said. ``And downstate
communities suffer from excessive air noise and pollution. We need
a solution that addresses both problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowey said she would prefer requiring large airlines, which
control most of the takeoff and landing slots at La Guardia and
Kennedy, to give some of their slots to regional carriers serving
upstate New York. That would help competition without necessarily
increasing air traffic, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that idea, which Schumer endorsed during last year's Senate
campaign, faces fierce opposition from the major carriers, which
can sell or lease those slots for up to $3 million each.
</P>
<P>
   In post-election travels upstate, Schumer has emphasized that
improving air service is one of his priorities in the Senate.
Though he did well for a Brooklyn Democrat among upstate voters
last year _ winning about 45 percent of the vote _ Schumer
recognizes that his re-election will be imperiled if he does not
expand his support north of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview last Monday how he would justify adding
new flights at La Guardia and Kennedy to his Brooklyn constituents,
Schumer recalled a floor speech by an upstate Republican in the
House supporting gun control. While hunters might be inconvenienced
by gun laws, the Republican had argued, they had an obligation to
accept those laws to help reduce gun violence in the cities.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Schumer said, city residents have an obligation to
help their brethren upstate improve their sputtering economy.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Schumer came close to supporting the Clinton
administration proposal, calling it ``an opportunity to bring
competition to upstate and under-served areas that desperately need
it for economic development.'' But he added that before he endorsed
the proposal, he wanted the federal Department of Transportation to
come up with a plan to minimize noise around the city's airports.

 WASHINGTON: in it.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Mrs. Feinstein and Sen. Robert F. Bennett of Utah, the chief
Republican sponsor of a censure resolution, are trying to find a
formula that is tough enough to attract people like McConnell, but
not so harsh as to drive away Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One late draft criticized Clinton's misconduct as ``shameless,
reckless and indefensible,'' and concluded that the president
``gave false and misleading testimony and impeded the discovery of
evidence in judicial proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we can craft a statement that can come together in any
kind of cohesive numbers is still very much up in the air,''
Bennett said on ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The censure wording, which is still being revised, is not the
only hurdle. Any resolution would need a simple majority, 51 votes,
to pass. But in reality, censure supporters need at least 60 votes
to break a filibuster that Gramm has vowed to wage.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats warned they will make Republicans pay a steep
political price _ on top of the beating Republicans have taken in
the polls for their handling of impeachment _ if Gramm carries out
his threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a Republican continuation of this agony that
prevents me from getting at 10,000 laid-off steelworkers in West
Virginia,'' Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, said on
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Censure proponents want a vote on their resolution this week,
after the impeachment articles. Any censure would likely lose
support on both sides if they wait until after the Senate's
one-week break, which starts next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Even as senators argued over censure, they also faced a
difficult decision on whether to open their final deliberations.
Supporters say such a debate is too important to conduct behind
closed doors, but opponents say senators should deliberate in
private, like any other American jury.
</P>
<P>
   Suspending the rules to allow the open debate requires 67 votes,
and a leading Republican vote counter, and critic of the idea, Judd
Gregg of New Hampshire, said supporters were still about four votes
short. Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said that
unless Senate Majority Leader Trent Lottbacks the proposal, it will
likely lose. Lott is undecided.

 NEW REGIONAL ISSUES CONFRONT U.S.
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The death of King Hussein has presented the United
States with a number of concerns, including Jordan's crucial role
in the Israeli peace process, the intentions of Iraq, and the
influence of the large Palestinian population in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, underscoring the importance of the US
relationship with the country of 4.6 million people, left
Washington Sunday to attend Hussein's funeral, even as members of
the US Senate prepared to argue on whether to convict him in the
impeachment trial. Clinton took with him a pledge to give Jordan
$300 million in aid to ensure the country's stability during the
transition to the new king Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who met recently
with Abdullah, said the new king had assured her of continuity: `I
am going to carry my father's flag.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The United States plans to use its influence and its financial
strength to help the tiny, poor, and mostly arid nation survive. In
addition to the aid announced Saturday, Albright said Sunday on
ABC-TV's ``This Week'' that the United States would give Jordan
numerous other economic benefits as well.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, US officials say Hussein's death also might clear the
way for nations such as Saudi Arabia to provide aid to Jordan.
Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf states had been angered by the way
Hussein condemned the US effort to oust Iraq from Kuwait in the
Persian Gulf War. Now, Jordan might receive assistance from the
Gulf states, said Roscoe Suddarth, who was US ambassador to Jordan
from 1987 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will stimulate the Gulf Arabs,'' Suddarth said in a
telephone interview. ``The aid is very significant; the Jordanian
economy is ailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who called Abdullah to express his condolences before
leaving the White House Sunday, said in a statement that he was
``deeply saddened by the news that King Hussein of Jordan has
passed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had prayed this day would not come soon. But God has called
King Hussein to his reward. The prayers of all Americans go out to
the royal family and Jordanian people. . . When peace finally comes
to the Middle East, his name will be inscribed upon it. That day,
King Hussein will smile on us one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Sunday aboard Air Force One with a delegation that
included Jimmy Carter, Gerald R. Ford, and George Bush. The four
men each have their own window onto Hussein, who has ruled for 46
years. Carter brokered the Camp David peace accord between Israel
and Egypt, which Hussein opposed; Ford provided Jordan with an air
defense system; Bush oversaw the Madrid peace talks in 1991, which
were endorsed by Hussein; and Clinton stood by Hussein as the king
signed a peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's relationship with the United States has had many ups
and downs over the years, but the two nations have been close for
much of the Clinton presidency, especially since Jordan signed a
peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is the role of the Palestinians, who account for
more than half of Jordan's population, Suddarth said. Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat is trying to establish a Palestinian state. It
remains unclear what Jordan's Palestinians would do if such a state
is established or if the effort fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main concern is if there is no treaty between Israel and
the Palestinians, there will be continuing unrest on the West Bank,
and how will Jordan's Palestinian population react?'' Suddarth
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the
expectation in Jordan was that it would pave the way for Israel to
conclude a treaty with Arafat. Hussein left his cancer treatments
to come to peace talks in Maryland to help push such an accord. But
the Israel-Palestinian deal is faltering, and US officials are
concerned about the reaction in Jordan if the process fails or if
Arafat declares a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Iraq in Jordan is also unclear. During the US war
with Iraq, Hussein initially condemned the US air raids as a ``war
against all Arabs and Muslims.'' Relations with the United States
turned cold, and remained that way until Hussein suggested that
Iraq would be better off with the democratic government.

AS PRICES GO UP, HARD-CORE SMOKERS FIND WAYS TO COPE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donald Pye's ocher-tipped fingers stubbed an
unfiltered Pall Mall into the ashtray he kept clipped to his
wheelchair at the Cobble Hill Health Center, a nursing home in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president says he wants to raise the price of cigarettes
another 55 cents,'' said Pye, who had already seen the price for a
pack of Pall Malls jump to $3.60 from $2.80 in recent weeks. ``He
does that, I'm going to make a gang, a wheelchair gang, and we're
going to go out and steal money for cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was probably an idle threat _ though one suspects that the
84-year-old Pye, a retired Army sergeant, and the fellow smoker he
calls his ``gun moll,'' Bernice Fuller, could pull off the job if
they had to. But the sentiment, echoed at homeless shelters, group
homes and street corners throughout the city, is genuine.
</P>
<P>
   For most smokers, the recent 45-cent-a-pack increase in the
wholesale price of cigarettes was an annoyance. (It was announced
in November, but its full effect was not felt in retail stores
until mid-January.) But for those with little money, for whom an
extra $5 or $10 a week is not a trivial sum, the sudden 20-percent
jump has changed the fabric of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody is forced to buy cigarettes. Smokers could
always quit, and many have. One of the goals of the 55-cent federal
tax President Clinton proposed last week _ aside from raising
billions of dollars in revenue _ is to cut the smoking rate by
pricing many smokers out of the market. Officials in 46 states who
reached a $206 billion settlement with cigarette makers in November
to compensate for the cost of treating tobacco-related illnesses
also saw the 45-cent increase, which is paying for the settlement,
as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   But in places where cigarettes often serve as nerve tonic,
time-killer and food substitute rolled into one, researchers have
found that the habit is painfully tough to break. Elderly people,
many of whom have been smoking for 50 years or more, and the
mentally ill, on whom nicotine has been demonstrated to have a
particularly soothing effect, are among the most stubborn smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of these people, the only joy they have is smoking,''
said Geoff Lieberman, executive director of the Coalition of
Institutionalized Aged and Disabled, an advocacy group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of quitting, many are finding ways to adapt. Several
people in homeless shelters and teen-agers in high school said more
smokers are selling loose cigarettes to others _ in effect, dealing
to support their habits. At Cobble Hill, Ms. Fuller has given up
pineapple soda, one of her few pleasures, to keep herself in Kool
100's. And, some heavy smokers are even negotiating discounts with
local shopkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But, smokers and officials agree, the arithmetic of the price
increase has been particularly unforgiving on those with fixed
incomes and, often, the disabled, the very old and the very young.

 NEW YORK: very young.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the start of the year, Jill F., 49, who lives at Ivan Shapiro
House, a supervised residence for mentally ill adults on West 46th
Street, got a $6 increase in her monthly Supplemental Security
Income benefits, to $935 from $929. The cost of maintaining her
two-pack-a-day habit, however, has gone up about $30 a month since
January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to seem ungrateful,'' she said, ``but inflation
for the poor is about 100 million times what it is for the classes
above it. If you live on coffee and doughnuts and cigarettes, the
ratio of the price increase to what you're going to spend and eat
is enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Pye and some of his neighbors at the Cobble Hill Health Center
would be needs allowance for nursing home and adult home residents
on Medicaid has been $50 a month since 1987, when cigarettes cost
about $1.50 a pack. The same $50 that once lasted a pack-a-day
smoker all month now runs out after about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Pye, who has been smoking for 72 years and says only
cigarettes allow him a night's sleep since he broke a hip, has no
plans to quit.
</P>
<P>
   He has relatives who slip him extra money, but another resident,
Barbara Dorsut, 49, often finds herself sitting on the wall outside
the entrance and begging for change for cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be discreet,'' she said. ``I don't do anything in the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, whose group has been fighting to increase the
personal needs allowance, said that for many elderly and,
especially, mentally ill people, cigarettes are ``a really
critically important issue in terms of their personal needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But state Sen. Joseph Holland, the chairman of the Senate's
Social Services Committee, said that higher cigarette prices did
not make a compelling argument to increase the allowance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To raise it to $75 would cost the state more than $30 million
a year,'' said Holland, a Republican from Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has predicted that higher cigarette
prices will put a particularly big dent in teen-age smoking. But
Gary Black, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, an investment
company, said such projections were too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are very insensitive to price increases,'' he
said. ``The brand image is the most important to them, and they
smoke the least number of cigarettes per week. The people who quit
when the price goes up are older people.''
</P>
<P>
   As school let out one day late last month Alejandro Soto, a
ninth-grader at Park West High School in Hell's Kitchen and a
smoker for four of his 17 years, stood in front of a deli on 10th
Avenue smoking a Newport and discussing economics. Higher prices
mean fewer young people can afford a whole pack, which has made his
friend Mike B., who sells loose cigarettes, an increasingly big man
on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a couple of classes with him, and people come looking
for him,'' Alejandro said. ``They knock on the window and show him
the money and he goes to the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike, a husky, taciturn 15-year-old with stylish gold-rimmed
glasses and a hardened stare, confirmed that business was good. His
regular price for a single cigarette went up to 30 cents, from 25,
when the pack price went up, but he said he often demanded more,
and got it.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Atlantic Avenue Armory, a homeless shelter in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, several of the men waiting for
contractors in vans to stop and offer a few hours of minimum-wage
demolition or moving work reflected on the effects of the price
increase.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Richie Jones, a 32-year-old pack-a-day smoker who
lives part-time in the shelter, said he was not quite ready to
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price has definitely put more pressure on me to stop,'' he
said, ``but I haven't done anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He would wait, he said, until the price hit $5 a pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be the best thing that ever happened to
America,'' he said. ``You'll have to be crazy to smoke then.''

 NEW REGIONAL ISSUES CONFRONT U.S.

   WASHINGTON _ The death of King Hussein has presented the United
States with a number of concerns, including Jordan's crucial role
in the Israeli peace process, the intentions of Iraq, and the
influence of the large Palestinian population in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, underscoring the importance of the US
relationship with the country of 4.6 million people, left
Washington Sunday to attend Hussein's funeral, even as members of
the US Senate prepared to argue on whether to convict him in the
impeachment trial. Clinton took with him a pledge to give Jordan

 CHRON - TELCO  
 Cheaper Phone Bills Still On Hold  &HT;     BY DEBORAH SOLOMON 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumers who have been waiting for cheaper phone bills may want
to stop holding their breath.
</P>
<P>
   Today, exactly three years since President Clinton signed a law
to overhaul the nation's telecommunications industry, consumers are
seeing few benefits. The law was supposed to spark competition
among telephone and cable companies by allowing them to fight on
one another's turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was supposed to come out of the (1996 Telecommunications)
Act was more choice and lower prices. We haven't seen any of
that,'' said Mark Phigler, president of Americans for Competitive
Telecommunications, a consumer group in Walnut Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a really slow implementation of the act, and
for the everyday consumer and small-business person out there, we
really don't have access to choice yet,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of more choices for telephone service, consumers
actually have fewer companies to choose from. More than 98 percent
of Californians still get a dial tone from Pacific Bell, and
customers are facing higher costs and fees for local phone service
versus three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The seven regional Baby Bells soon will be four, as companies
like SBC Communications have gobbled up local carriers such as Pac
Bell and Ameritech. And would-be competitors such as MCI WorldCom
and AT&AMP;T Corp. have stopped marketing local phone service in
California, citing high costs and cumbersome bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single Baby Bell has been allowed into the $80 billion
long-distance market, and long-distance rates have stayed flat
instead of decreasing.
</P>
<P>
   The situation on the cable front is no better. Prices have
continued to soar, rising more than 15 percent locally, and no
viable competitor has emerged to challenge Tele-Communications
Inc.'s grip on the Bay Area. Pac Bell, which at one point began
installing fiber optic cable to provide cable TV and other video
services in California, has since ripped out the fiber and canceled
its plans.
</P>
<P>
   When the act was signed, politicians and regulators hailed it,
saying the relaxed regulations would incite a free-for-all with
cable, telephone and other companies vying to get into each other's
business. That unfettered competition was supposed to drive down
prices, as companies like AT&AMP;T and MCI battled with Pac Bell for
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of fighting it out in the marketplace, the major
telecommunications companies have spent the past three years
battling in court over key portions of the Telecom Act. In the
meantime, consumers have sat patiently on the sidelines, waiting
for the revolutionary changes the act was supposed to bring.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a very long wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to stop kidding themselves that competition is
right around the corner,'' said Mark Cooper, president of the
Consumers Union, a group that protested the 1996 law. ``That's no
longer a guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, whose group conducted a study on the effects of the law,
said most customers won't see real competition for at least another
two years. That's because so far, it hasn't paid for companies to
go after residential customers, the majority of whom spend about
$60 a month on local and long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, phone companies are focused on business customers, who
buy in bulk and spend millions on telecommunications services.
Until it's more economical for these companies to crack the local
market, Cooper said, customers won't be getting dinnertime phone
calls to switch their local carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 150 companies are licensed to provide
competitive local phone service in California, most are either
concentrating on business customers or wrangling with Pac Bell over
access to its phone network.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecom Act mandated that incumbent local phone companies
lease their telephone wires and other parts of their network to
competitors so that those companies could resell local service to
customers. But that model proved prohibitively expensive and
somewhat ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T was one of the first companies to try reselling service,
but it ended its plans in March 1997 after losing $4 billion
nationwide. MCI WorldCom, which resold service to Californians at
an amazing flat rate of $25 for all local calls in the fall of
1997, retreated a few months later after it proved too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and MCI basically have abandoned their intention to resell
service. They now are looking for other ways to get into the local
market.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, customers continue to watch their phone bills
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Since the act was signed, in-state long-distance rates have
risen about 10 percent nationwide, according to consumer groups.
Pac Bell has asked for at least three price increases since 1996
but has been rebuffed by regulators. The company did get approval
to implement a surcharge of $351 million, or 2.9 percent, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell also has made it difficult for customers to use
alternate carriers for local toll calls. Right now, customers who
call Oakland from San Francisco, for example, and dial 1 plus the
phone number automatically use Pac Bell. If a customer wants to use
MCI or Sprint, which may offer lower rates, they must dial a
special access code before punching in the number.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors argue that this puts them at a disadvantage, and
state regulators seem to agree. The CPUC has ordered Pac Bell to
tell state regulators today(monday) &LR;  about the firm's plans for
allowing customers to use alternate carriers for local toll calls.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pac Bell and other regional phone companies have
tacked on federally mandated fees that are supposed to help the
companies pay for the transition to a competitive marketplace. Just
this month, Pac Bell said it would begin charging an additional 50
cents a month per phone line so that customers who want to leave
Pac Bell can take their phone number with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are paying for the costs of competition that will
never develop,` said Regina Costa, telecommunications analyst with
The Utilities Reform Network. ``Pac Bell hasn't been allowed to
raise its basic rate, but they certainly can and are putting more
charges on our bills.`
</P>
<P>
   The company currently is asking for permission to raise the
price of several services, such as directory assistance, emergency
interrupts and busy-line verification.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell argues that in a competitive marketplace, it should be
allowed to charge the same rates as other carriers in order to stay
profitable. Consumer advocates and others say that argument is
flawed because most Californians can't go to anyone else for local
phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell disagrees and insists that the market is open. Pac Bell
officials say competitors won't jump into the local market until
Pac Bell is allowed into long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only when the long-distance market is opened up to Pacific
Bell do I think you will see customers benefiting from lower prices
and more services,'' said Bill Blase, vice president of regulatory
affairs for Pac Bell. ``If there was large incentive to provide
residential service, you would have seen a rush to the marketplace
in March 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the wrangling over the Telecom Act soon may end. A
ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court late last month that validated the
act as sound public policy should end the legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Potential competitors tired of dealing with the Baby Bells are
now looking to cable, the Internet and wireless systems as
alternative ways to bypass the regional phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to square one,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, a
telecommunications analyst in Atlanta. ``Year One was blind
euphoria, Year Two was the year of challenges, and now Year Three
is the year of settling the issues and challenges and clearing the
decks so companies can start moving into each other's businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   That already seems to be happening, as companies like AT&AMP;T align
with TCI and Time Warner Cable to bring local telephone service to
customers via cable TV lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T currently is testing its cable telephony service in Fremont
and plans to roll it out &UR;  &LR; on a limited basis elsewhere in
California and the nation later this year. Since AT&AMP;T's cable phone
service would be the first real alternative to Pac Bell, it could
start a pricing war. Other cable companies, such as Cox
Communications, currently offer cheaper telephone rates than Pac
Bell in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Some major companies like Qwest Communications, are offering
telephone service over the Internet at prices lower than
traditional service. And some providers are testing fixed wireless
systems _ antennas that attach to the side of a customer's house
and provide wireless phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan said although the original intent of the law had not yet
been realized, there has been an effect as companies are forced to
find innovative ways to get to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baby Bells are offering a wide variety of services that
they never did before, such as high-speed Internet service.
Customers can get buckets of long-distance minutes for a low cost,
wireless has exploded and companies like MCI and Sprint are
developing new, faster networks,'' Kagan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wouldn't have happened without telecom deregulation or
without advances in technology,'' he said. ``This is a very special
time; it's just that we're impatient and have a preconceived notion
of what should happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less optimistic, saying the Telecom Act has created
more regulations instead of eliminating obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of disappointment. People are both frustrated
and bitter,'' said Roger Wery, vice president at Renaissance
Worldwide. ``But it's a naive perception that the Telecom Act is a
blueprint and road map for competition. It's even more complex
rules, and not less, but more regulation. It probably didn't
achieve what people expected.''

 CHRON - Y2KWATCH  
 Sweepstakes Prepares You For Y2K Chaos  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A six-month supply of Spam doesn't seem appetizing now, but it
could if the Year 2000 problem causes a big worldwide meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the premise behind the ``Be Prepared
Sweepstakes,'' a publicity stunt dreamed up by EarthWeb Inc. to
promote its new Year 2000 information site, &LR;  www.y2kinfo.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You have until March 18 to enter the Web site's sweepstakes,
which offers tongue-in-cheek prizes to help you weather a Y2K
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   First prize is $10,000 worth of gold coins in case the world
monetary system collapses, though the coins would be useful no
matter what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Second prize is that stockpile of Spam canned luncheon meat,
which would make you the ``king of the mountain'' if the
supermarkets are looted, deadpanned Riva Syrop, marketing director
for the New York Internet site geared toward computer techs,
managers and developers.
</P>
<P>
   Third prize includes a kerosene lamp and a battery-operated
radio to help when fleeing into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not poking fun at survivalists, we respect all the work
they're doing to prepare for a possible meltdown,'' Syrop said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Syrop wanted to inject humor into the ``doom
and gloom'' surrounding Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN NUKES: &QL; 
Back on the doom-and-gloom front, the debt-plagued Russian
government said last week that it needed $3 billion _ six times the
original estimate _ to tackle Y2K problems in computers that
control the country's nuclear weapons arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the nukes will start flying at the stroke of
midnight on January 1. A report by the British American Security
Information Council said researchers believe that the risk of an
accidental firing of nuclear weapons then is ``more or less zero.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Y2K problem could interfere later with communication
systems and early warning radar devices. Back in 1980, a faulty
50-cent chip in a U.S. system caused computers to detect what
turned out to be phantom Russian missiles headed for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K and 401(K): &QL; 
American stockholders are worried, but not panicky, about what Y2K
will do to their investments.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study commissioned by investment brokerage Piper
Jaffray Inc. found that 37.7 percent of investors were either very
concerned or somewhat concerned about how computer problems will
affect their stocks' performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey also showed that only 12.6 percent have changed
or plan to change their investment strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Piper Jaffray did the survey to promote its new report,
``Prepare for the New Millennium,'' which gives Y2K investment
tips. The free report is available by calling (800) 333-6000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank officials say preparing finances
for Y2K is like getting ready for a vacation: Make sure you have
enough cash and all important documents to last the trip but don't
go overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be prepared, not panicky and doing things that you
later regret,'' says Paul M. Connolly, chief operating officer at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ``You would not take all of
your money out of the bank to take it on vacation with you _ even
if you could not access it all for the time you were away _ and you
shouldn't be pulling everything out now to get ready for the Year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COMPUTER STOCKPILE: &QL; 
Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates told a gathering of world
business leaders that he expects only modest disruptions due to
Y2K. Still, Sun Microsystems chief executive Scott McNealy said
problems in the Asian supply chain could favor those who have
stockpiled computers before 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking about stockpiling cash, water and canned
goods. Given what I and everybody else in the computer industry
knows about Asia, it might not be a bad idea to stockpile some
computers for the next millennium,'' McNealy said.

COMMENTARY: ENTER `MOTHER WIT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two shrewdly folksy political lawyers, each a
master of Southern down-homeyness, came to grips last week on the
core issue of the Clinton impeachment. First Friend Vernon Jordan,
as witness, used the rich dialect phrase ``mother wit,'' defining
it as ``common sense, judgment,'' and House Manager Asa Hutchinson,
as prosecutor, picked it up to help make his case of obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is the linchpin who connects Clinton's successful
cover-up of Whitewater to his unsuccessful cover-up of the Lewinsky
affair.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jordan who sent the potential witness, Webster Hubbell,
to Revlon in New York to get him a $100,000 retainer, widely
described as ``hush money.'' It was Jordan who took another
potential witness, Monica, to Revlon to get her a job as she was
preparing a false affidavit to protect Clinton in his Paula Jones
lawsuit. Indeed, that previous Jordan succor induced Janet Reno to
let Independent Counsel Ken Starr investigate Clinton's
witness-tampering with Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody disputes (1) that Clinton enlisted Jordan's aid in
finding a lucrative job away from Washington for a woman whose
truthful testimony in the Paula Jones case surely would have been
embarrassing and might have cost him a million dollars, (2) that
Jordan took her to a lawyer who would help prepare the affidavit to
avoid testifying, and when Jordan informed the president the sworn
denial of an affair was signed, Clinton said ``Thank you very
much,'' and (3) that Jordan called the top man at Revlon to make
sure she got the job offer, and reported to Clinton ``Mission
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction charge is plain: to impede justice in a federal
civil rights suit, Clinton used Jordan as his agent to make it
worth Monica's while to lie under oath, and thereby support his own
false testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The defense boils down to this: the events are unrelated. Jordan
helps a lot of young people and has introduced other White House
aides to lawyers. Though he admits talking about the affidavit and
the job in the same conversation, ``The affidavit was over here.
The job was over here.'' Monica agrees, even though she says Jordan
told her to destroy subpoenaed evidence.
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime acquaintance of Jordan, I consult my mother wit to
conclude (1) that because Vernon is, as he likes to say, ``no
fool,'' he gave no direction to Monica to break the law, (2) that
he knew the legal importance of separating himself and the
president from her affidavit, which is why he drove her over to
another lawyer's office, and (3) that his assertion that he asked
Clinton if he was having sexual relations with this young woman,
and was assured he was not, is fishy.
</P>
<P>
   These guys tell each other everything about women. When asked
what he talks to the president about, Vernon has replied frequently
and famously with a single feline noun. Why, then, was he eager to
testify that he sought out Clinton to ask about sexual relations
with Monica, and was told no?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Because he needed not to know specifically about their
affair. In order to act as Clinton's agent in getting Lewinsky to
retain a lawyer-friend for the affidavit, and to allow himself to
arrange for something of value to her in the form of a job, Jordan
needed not to be privy to the lying that was being sought and
rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he likely said he assumed no hanky-panky was going
on, and the president took his cue to say of course not. Jordan was
then free to act unburdened by guilty knowledge of the president's
intent to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   That is the logical explanation for Clinton not boasting as
usual about his latest conquest when alone late at night with his
best male friend. These two attorneys, having practiced with taking
care of Hubbell, know how to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   Asa Hutchinson is also no fool. When ``mother wit'' is applied
to the testimony he elicited from Jordan, what emerges is the clear
intent of the person who masterminded and benefited from the acts
of his agents _ Obstructer-in-Chief Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This speedy trial is serving its limited but historic purpose of
making public what the public wants to ignore. The president will
stay in, but the truth will out. And as the Book used for oath
taking says, the truth shall make us free.

 CHRON - PLASMA  
 Welcome to the Net's Little Shop of Horrors  &HT;     By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most online shoppers don't have a pressing need for green
fluorescent protein, nucleic acid or moose intestine.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case, there's Chemdex. The Palo Alto startup has
opened an online store where scientists can buy these and thousands
of other biochemical substances from dozens of different
manufacturers. Although small, this nascent Web marketplace is one
sign of a dramatic shift in how businesses purchase goods.
</P>
<P>
   While Amazon.com, eBay and other online retailers that sell to
consumers have grabbed all the attention, Internet buying by
businesses has been growing _ fast. Last year, business-to-business
e-commerce reached $43 billion, nearly 10 times consumer online
spending, according to Forrester Research. The Cambridge, Mass.,
research firm expects that to soar to $1.3 trillion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that commerce comes from companies such as networking
firm 3Com or PC supplier Dell. But a whole new breed of online
merchant is opening up shop, representing not just one manufacturer
but dozens in one industry, selling plastic or metal or fabric or
even intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``These middlemen help buyers do comparison shopping,'' said
Chuck Shih, research director for Electronic Commerce at Gartner
Group. ``They're just exploding now. It's a model of commerce that
lends itself to the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Chemdex, most researchers purchased materials for their
experiments from catalogs. These catalogs are a far cry from Land's
End or J. Crew. They're dense volumes of mostly text and as thick
as telephone books. Although a few manufacturers had their own Web
sites, there was no Chemdex-style supermarket for researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers include cancer researchers, cell biologists,
neuroscientists and biochemists _ both individual researchers and
those who work at large companies. They're ordering biochemicals
used in scientific research such as antibodies, proteins and
enzymes.
</P>
<P>
   On average, a research scientist might spend five hours a week
flipping through 40 or 50 catalogs, scribbling product numbers and
prices on scraps of paper. The scientist or an administrator would
then transfer that information to a purchase order form _ one form
for each manufacturer. Orders may then have to be approved by
several people before they get sent to the supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enormously inefficient,'' said David Perry, co-founder of
Chemdex ( &LR; www.chemdex.com &LR; ). While a student at Harvard Business
School, Perry helped start a small biotech company and saw
firsthand how much effort researchers put into simply ordering
materials. ``I figured there had to be a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry and Jeffrey Leane, Chemdex's chief technology officer
founded the company 15 months ago. It now offers more than 150,000
products from 60 manufacturers. The online ordering system works
this way: buyers who sign up for the service search the database
for the products they need. Each search returns a list of suppliers
and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Say, you need some DMEM, which is a sort of food for cells. A
search turns up 13 items _ different types of DMEM, different
quantities and prices and, in this case, one supplier. The
researcher clicks on the desired items. The information's entered
onto an order form comparable to the online shopping baskets
e-retail sites use. When the order is complete, the researcher
clicks to purchase. If the order requires spending approvals, it
will go to the appropriate corporate officials, then to the
supplier.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Chemdex's biggest customer is Genentech, the South San
Francisco biotech giant. Most of its other customers are smaller
companies like Eos Biotechnology, a South San Francisco startup
doing DNA research. Privately held Chemdex doesn't disclose
revenues but says between 50 and 100 researchers sign up every day.
</P>
<P>
   Before signing up for Chemdex, scientist Kim Ha of Eos was
trying to juggle two jobs: handling purchasing for her lab while
still carving out time to conduct genetic research. &UR;  &LR; `I'd spend an
hour or two every day taking care of purchasing. So then I'd be
working 10 to 12 hours a day just so I'd have time for my
research,'' she said. Now, the lab's scientists can place most of
their own orders. Not only does it make Ha's job easier, but
there's less chance of error and researchers are able to track
their own orders directly. Accounting is happy, too, Ha said, it is
easier to track of what is ordered and how much is spent.
</P>
<P>
   Perry and Leane weren't the only ones to spot opportunity in
providing online ordering for the $10 billion scientific materials
marketplace. SciQuest, a North Carolina startup, began offering an
online database of scientific materials in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   SciQuest is aiming at a slightly broader market. In addition to
the substances Chemdex offers, the company &UR;  &LR; sells testing materials
for industrial markets and scientific equipment. It also offers
 &LR; www.labdeal.com &LR; , an online clearance center for surplus lab
supplies. The main site,  &LR; www.sciquest.com,  &LR; will be capable of
handling transactions by April, but a beta version is being used by
a few customers now. Last year, SciQuest had $1.5 million cq  &LR; in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Campbell, electronic commerce project manager for
pharmaceutical giant Hoffman-La Roche, said her company is moving
to online ordering _ and it's already made the process more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first big difference is the online catalog is more current
than the paper one,'' Campbell said. ``If you use a paper catalog,
sometimes you have an old part number, sometimes a page is ripped
out. It doesn't show prices your company may have negotiated with
the supplier. I have to search one (paper) catalog at a time, and
I'll have catalogs open all over my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning. Online ordering cuts out some
stops along the ordering process where things can go wrong. An
administrator may enter the wrong product number. The order could
get lost on the way to the vendor. The vendor may not have all of
the materials and hold the order for full shipment. Or the vendor
could send the order and it gets lost in shipping. And lots, lots
more.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman La Roche's electronic ordering system includes data on
what each scientist can spend and it automatically routes orders to
the right person for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Varda Lief, an analyst at Forrester Research, said she doesn't
expect SciQuest and Chemdex to face many competitors because the
cost and complexity of setting up a site that is so technical is
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a niche market, but one where there will be
considerable growth,'' she said. She estimates the overall market
for online pharmaceutical and medical supplies will be $1.4 billion
this year and $44 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about efficiency,'' said Martha Greer, vice president
of marketing at Chemdex. ``If scientists save time (ordering) they
have more time at the research bench to discover something of use
to the world.''

ISLANDERS ACCENTUATE POSITIVE AFTER 2-GOAL LEAD ENDS IN TIE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Things have gotten so bad on Long Island that
players and coaches don't even get mad anymore when the New York
Islanders blow a two-goal lead in the third period. Not even when a
questionable penalty and poor goaltending are key factors. Not even
when the guys who come back are the struggling Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders played a ho-hum 3-3 tie with the Canucks before
13,534 fans at Nassau Coliseum on Sunday afternoon, and afterward
there wasn't much dismay in the Islander locker room over the
team's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deserved a better fate for the effort we put forth,'' said
coach Bill Stewart. ``I don't want to dwell on the negatives today,
I want to talk about the positives.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being disappointed with allowing the Canucks back
into the game, the Islander players talked about ``competing hard''
and ``playing with good structure.''
</P>
<P>
   But that certainly was not the case, not Sunday, against the
Canucks, who were coming off last Thursday's embarrassing 8-4 loss
to the Rangers at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should have been a way,'' said Bryan Smolinski. ``But
hey, 3-3 is not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we competed on every shift,'' said defenseman Rich
Pilon. ``That's something we haven't done in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders (16-31-4) grabbed the lead when Zigmund Palffy
skated around a Canuck, broke in front of Vancouver goalie Corey
Hirsch and beat him at 14 minutes 33 seconds of the second period.
Robert Reichel made it 2-0, scoring on a slap shot from the slot
early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Islanders should have put the Canucks (16-28-6)
away. Instead, that's when the Islanders gave one point away.
</P>
<P>
   Brad May began the Canucks' comeback at 7:55, poking the puck in
from underneath Felix Potvin's leg pad. The scoring chance was
created by Smolinski, whose clearing pass landed squarely on the
stick of Donald Brashear, who shot the puck into Potvin's pads.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lapointe extended the Islanders' lead to 3-1 at 9:35,
beating Hirsch between the pads.
</P>
<P>
   His goal wasn't enough, although the Islanders played as if it
was.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Jovanovski cut the Islanders' lead to 3-2 at 11:02, scoring
with a shot from the point. Potvin, who has been anything but
spectacular in seven games since arriving from Toronto last month,
allowed another weak goal to give Vancouver the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have stopped all three,'' said Potvin, who
faced 37 shots. ``But that's not possible. The puck sneaked under
my pad.''
</P>
<P>
   The tying goal was delivered by the Canucks' Markus Naslund as
two Islanders sat in the penalty box. Naslund tapped in his own
rebound to send the game to overtime at 15:42. Pilon had been
called for tripping and Dean Malkoc joined him for high sticking
Alexander Mogilny, giving Vancouver a 5-on-3 for 57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Stewart called referee Paul Stewart's high-sticking
penalty against Malkoc ``a cheap call.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ``on the helmet,'' and ``that's why you wear it,'' said
the Islander coach.

BRUINS GET LAVIN'S MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Matt Barnes was in the starting lineup. Dan
Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso were out. Ray Young came off the bench
but played like a starter. JaRon Rush never left the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Just another spin of UCLA coach Steve Lavin's player roulette
wheel, or moves with a message?
</P>
<P>
   Definitely the latter, according to the Bruins, who defeated
Oregon State 85-67 Sunday afternoon before 9,472 in Pauley
Pavilion, in an otherwise forgettable game.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, they say, check the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Immersed in the stretch run, with NCAA Tournament momentum and
placement looming over each February game, Lavin tried to send his
talented but enigmatic freshmen a warning flare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 10 games are what (the NCAA Selection Committee)
really looks at, and the freshmen are going to have to do a lot of
work down the road for us to make a run,'' Barnes said. ``Coach
Lavin let us know it's time to go. He instilled that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it sticks or not is another matter. Lavin has used 15
starting lineups in 22 games, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The latest situation began Saturday afternoon when Rush, fresh
off his best game of the season (17 points against Oregon) arrived
at practice laughing and cracking jokes. He was warned, but when
the giggles continued, Lavin kicked him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deserved it,'' Rush said. ``He was probably in a mean mood
and I was kind of out of line, clowning around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, ABC and Dick Vitale gave Lavin an ideal forum to make
his point: Rush not only didn't start, he didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime Vitale is here, to the kids that means it's big
time,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rush's benching seemingly had the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the second half of the season, and (Lavin) is expecting
us to step up our games,'' Young said. ``He expects more out of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice performance also landed Moiso and Gadzuric on the
bench. Moiso has developed foot problems and could not practice at
a satisfactory level. He entered the game early in the first half
but only played 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I land, it's painful,'' said Moiso, who has scored nine
points in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   If Lavin intended to send Gadzuric a message, it apparently did
not arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, UCLA officials said Gadzuric would not start
because his tendinitis-plagued knees had limited his practice time.
After the game, Lavin said Gadzuric did not start because of poor
practice effort: ``The same reason, but Dan practiced better than
JaRon.''
</P>
<P>
   When approached, Gadzuric knew nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of message?'' he asked. ``If (Lavin) says that, I
guess that's it, but he never told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin gave Barnes plenty of warning. In fact, he stated several
times this week that he planned to get Barnes more time as a reward
for solid practices. Barnes played two minutes Thursday against
Oregon but started Saturday and produced nine points, six rebounds
and four assists in 26 minutes _ more playing time than the
previous three games combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really frustrating,'' Barnes said. ``Now I'm getting
a chance and I made something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, however, did not _ at least not in the opening
minutes. For the fourth consecutive half, they played lethargic
defense, as Oregon State center Jason Heidi looked like Michael
Olowokandi, and the Beavers jumped to a 13-7 lead. Although UCLA
tightened its defense, it never did stop the Beavers, who shot 52.3
percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (17-5, 8-3) found their rhythm in the second half.
They were poised and patient on offense, using crisp ball movement
to counteract Oregon State's zone. They did everything they didn't
do last month in Corvallis and built an 18-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Davis secured the victory with 5:21 left when he grabbed a loose
ball in the backcourt, dodged a defender by dribbling behind his
back, then whipped a perfect bounce pass to Earl Watson for a layup
and a 67-55 lead. It was one of his best moves of the season, an
NBA move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forced to tempo today,'' said Davis, who led the Bruins
with 20 points. ``When we force it, we score easy baskets.''

LUNCH TIDBIT LEADS TO HINTS OF PERJURY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As far as Christopher Hitchens is concerned, Sidney Blumenthal
was doing what came naturally at lunch at a Washington restaurant
last March when he described Monica Lewinsky as a ``stalker.'' But
Hitchens, a journalist, now says he was offended by the idea that
Blumenthal, a presidential adviser, was spreading gossip about the
former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Blumenthal's lawyer, William McDaniel Jr., is
concerned, Hitchens, by filing an affidavit reporting that
conversation, is ``inserting himself in this situation to satisfy
an outsized ego.'' The idea that Hitchens was the recipient of a
leak of damaging information is ludicrous, McDaniel said on Sunday.
``In Baltimore-ese: That just ain't so.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a prepared statement, the only thing Blumenthal would
say on the record was, ``This is off the record.''
</P>
<P>
   This back-and-forth, which took place over telephones and on
television news programs Sunday, focused on what appeared to be
contradictions between Blumenthal's testimony last week in the
Senate impeachment trial and Hitchens' recollections of the lunch
he and his wife had with Blumenthal and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hitchens' affidavit was made public on Saturday, some
senators in both parties have been demanding that the Justice
Department investigate whether Blumenthal committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's lawyer said there were no contradictions.
Blumenthal's statement said, in part: ``I was never a source for
any story about Monica Lewinsky's personal life. I did not reveal
what the president told me to any reporter. As I testified to the
Senate, I talked every day about the news stories about Monica
Lewinsky to friends and family, just like everyone else in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel added that by the time of the lunch, hundreds of news
reports had made reference to Ms. Lewinsky as a ``stalker.''
Hitchens replied: ``We don't meet Sidney to find out what other
people have said in the papers.'' He added, ``There was no room in
my mind for any doubt that he wanted to leave us with the
impression that the president had told him this story.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest episode in the impeachment crisis offered another
look at the taboos of Washington journalism. Journalists often
attack one another's ideas in print, but still have brunch
together. And those social gatherings are considered off the
record.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchens, 49, qualifies as a Washington insider. His stock in
trade has been flouting conventional wisdom in his articles for
Vanity Fair and The Nation. Mother Teresa and the Princess of Wales
were singled out for his scorn when other journalists were being
worshipful. Hitchens said he met Blumenthal at a seminar for
political writers in the mid-1980s. Though he believes that
Blumenthal is excessive in calling him ``rabidly anti-Clinton,''
Hitchens does say he feels obliged ``to point out to people that
there's something extremely dangerous about William Jefferson
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchens said that he did not approach House lawyers but that
they had heard his story from a third party and approached him. He
added that he would not testify against Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   He also says that Blumenthal came to the lunch with a batch of
documents and newspapers clippings _ not the usual offering for a
friend at a social occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But Blumenthal finished his prepared statement by saying: ``The
notion that I was trying to plant a story with this rabidly
anti-Clinton friend is absurd.''

RANGERS RAPIDLY LOSING THEIR MARGIN FOR ERROR
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Five days between games will give these veteran New
York Rangers time to rest and recover and prepare for the final 31
matches of the regular season. It also will give them too much time
to fret about Sunday's aggravating defeat, a 3-2 loss to the Boston
Bruins in Fleet Center. With 24 games in the ``L'' column of the
standing, it is difficult to determine which setback hurts the
Rangers the most. But this one certainly merits a nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ They came from behind, erasing a 2-0 deficit in the third
period, tying the score on a shot from the slot by Brian Leetch and
a short-handed breakaway by Adam Graves.
</P>
<P>
   _ They lost to a Boston team that had not won in its eight
previous games.
</P>
<P>
   _ They almost tied it again, in the final minute, on the power
play, when Mathieu Schneider's shot got past goalie Byron Dafoe but
hit the goal post.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Rangers victory would have lifted them into a ninth-place
tie with Boston, only 2 points behind the Florida Panthers, who
hold the eighth and final playoff berth in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Bruins are tied with Florida with 51 points, and
the Rangers remain 4 points back of both and 1 behind the
10th-place Montreal Canadiens. The Rangers have lost seven of their
last 10 games. When they resume Friday night, they will play seven
games in 11 nights, a stretch that may determine their playoff
fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play against a team you're chasing, you know it's an
enormous game,'' said goalie Mike Richter. ``It's a tough step
backward, but it's something we can overcome and we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter gave up the winning goal at 16 minutes 33 seconds of the
third after a big fake and a backhanded shot by Joe Thornton, the
second-year forward who is bigger, smarter and more confident than
he was as a rookie. Thornton raced in after Ranger defenseman Jeff
Beukeboom got caught flat-footed near his own blue line while the
puck slipped past him. Four minutes earlier, Beukeboom got an
assist on Graves' goal by clearing the puck to the blue line, where
it bounced off the glove of Ray Bourque, the veteran Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beuk got beat at center ice,'' coach John Muckler said of
Boston's winning goal. ``It's just a shame when you lose a game
like this. We had everything going for us. It looked like the
Bruins were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming alive, with his second goal in two games, was Leetch, the
Rangers captain, who went 23 games without one. Approaching
unrestricted free agency, Leetch is a critical performer at this
point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   During a television interview in the second intermission, Leetch
talked candidly with the Fox network about the possibility that he
would be traded by the Rangers around the March 23 deadline, almost
a month before the end of the regular schedule. He said it in a
matter-of-fact way, acknowledging that such moves are part of the
business. Trading Leetch at that point to a Stanley Cup contender
would be logical only if the Rangers are out of the playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Leetch spoke about his recent goal scoring.
``Yeah, it's nice to help the team,'' he said. ``It's more
important for us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston took a 1-0 lead at 15:01 of the first period on a
power-play goal by Sergei Samsonov, his 18th of the season. The
Bruins made the score 2-0 at 16:27 of the second period on Dmitri
Khristich's 21st of the season, at even strength. Leetch got his at
9:36 of the third period, set up by Brent Fedyk, who has added some
offensive spark in recent games. Graves got his 24th of the season,
the most on the team, at 12:21, to tie the score at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Nedved's line, with Mike Knuble on right wing and Niklas
Sundstrom on the other, had six shots on goal. They usually play
against the top line of the opposition, in part because the Rangers
have no clearly defined checking line. Nedved has two goals in his
last 16 games. Knuble has one in his last 14. Sundstrom has two in
his last 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to see them produce more,'' Muckler said. ``It's
not happening. Petr is not contributing offensively the way you'd
like him to; I don't know what are our alternatives are.'' Muckler
said he will have another option when Todd Harvey returns from a
knee injury in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, I'm not shooting the way I want to,'' Nedved said.
He put three on goal and had another shot early, on the fly, that
whistled wide of the post. Perhaps he would benefit from a change
of linemates, a few power-play shifts at forward instead of on the
point and matchups against an opposing team's weaker lines, instead
of their best. &QL;

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusually messy day, with piles of ice, slush and
pools of water. I got to a street corner where an elderly blind
woman with a white cane waited uncertainly. I described the
situation to her and offered my arm to guide her around the most
dangerous spots. She accepted and we navigated slowly and
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   When we were less than halfway across, the traffic light
changed. Before panic could begin to set in, a long stretch
limousine moved into the intersection and simply stopped, thereby
blocking the two lanes of cars and preventing them from bearing
down on us. Not one car honked its horn!
</P>
<P>
   When we reached the safety of the far curb, I turned and waved
vigorously, trying to thank all those courteous drivers, especially
the one in the limo. The blind woman never knew what happened, but
I was very proud of New York City that day.

</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I love to meditate, and do so as often as I can during the
workday _ before work, at lunchtime and in the evening. Last year I
discovered the quiet but musty solitude of St. Bartholomew's
Church. Not only was the place deserted _ there was rarely anyone
else around _ but the church actually encouraged meditation and had
a sign outside inviting people to feel free to use the space for
``quiet reflection and meditation.'' I thought this was amazing!
</P>
<P>
   As I walked in, I saw beds stretched out along the corridor, and
I thought, ``How incredible, how Zen-like!'' Not only do they
encourage meditation but they also have beds in which to do it.
``I've discovered an oasis,'' I thought.
</P>
<P>
   One lunch hour, I lay down, closed my eyes and tried to drift
off out of Manhattan. I was quickly jolted back to reality by two
very unhappy homeless men who were shaking me: ``Yo, Goldie, wake
up ... and who's been sleeping in my bed?'' They both began to
laugh as the second man added: ``Hey, Jack, make sure she didn't
eat the porridge, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The beds have since moved to a less public location, but the
church is still an oasis for meditation.

   The worst time in Manhattan is a rainy cold winter day at rush
hour in midtown trying to get home. But last week, because of a bus
driver, I felt like a tourist just enjoying the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   The crosstown M42 bus was packed with tired commuters. People
were growing irritated at the slow traffic and being squeezed into
inches of space. The bus driver picked up the microphone to
announce what we thought would be the next stop.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his announcement went something like this: ``Fifth
Avenue is the next stop. Look out the window. It's the magnificent
Fifth Avenue with everything your heart desires. Go up to see the
one and only Central Park and enjoy Museum Mile with the best
museums in New York and in this world, from the Metropolitan Museum
to MOMA, from ancient Egyptian arts to contemporary paintings. Now
turn to your left and you will find the beautiful New York Public
Library. Farther down is the famous Empire State Building and the
World Trade Center. Now you are here _ Fifth Avenue, Fifth Avenue,

the theater district, awaiting the arrival of his lunch date. A
deliveryman walked in, carrying two bags of Chinese food. The
maitre d'hotel shook her head, suggested that the food must be for

</P>
<P>
   After the deliveryman insisted that he had the right address,
the maitre d' checked with the kitchen. A minute later, the cook
emerged, took possession of the food and disappeared back into the
kitchen.

<P>
   Antonoff couldn't help but exclaim, ``It's a bad omen.''

ENVOYS SAY BOTH SIDES IN BACK LIMITED AUTONOMY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ In negotiations, the devil is in the
details.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly true here, where the warring factions in Kosovo
have been sequestered in a 14th-century castle, and ordered to
compromise within two weeks or face the wrath of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   And yet unlike most other diplomatically brokered attempts to
end armed conflicts, officials here say that about 75 percent of a
proposed settlement for Kosovo is a non-negotiable, done deal.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hill, the US special envoy to Kosovo, acknowledged
as much moments before he went behind the wrought-iron gates to
mediate the negotiations. And Sunday, diplomats said that both
sides had accepted the underlying principles of a proposed
settlement: that the southern province of Kosovo would remain part
of Yugoslavia but would be given back a degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said there would be no surprises for the ethnic Albanians,
who make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people, or for
the Serbs, who govern Kosovo but command no loyalty from nearly all
of its inhabitants. After all, the framework for a settlement, Hill
said, was based on their input.
</P>
<P>
   As Hill and his European and Russian counterparts shuttled
between the ethnic Albanians on the second floor of the chateau,
and the Serbs on first floor, their entreaties will be delivered
against a loudly ticking clock.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is ready to act, either by sending in 30,000 troops to
police a settlement, or war planes to bomb those who would defy the
western demand for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of the talks is that Kosovo would be given back its
autonomy, which Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ended in
1989. The ethnic Albanians would be given the right to police
themselves and run the local government in return for agreeing to
remain part of Serbia, which with Montenegro forms what is left of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as a second day of negotiations ended, diplomats
reported that both sides had accepted 10 points that would keep
Kosovo part of Yugoslavia for at least three years while returning
limited autonomy to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ratko Markovic, the deputy prime minister of Serbia who is
leading the Serb delegation, went into negotiations saying he would
not talk face to face with the Kosovo Liberation Army members of
the ethnic Albanian delegation. He said the Kosovo army is made up
of of terrorists. But there were suggestions Sunday that a
delegation, including a Kosovo Liberation Army representative will
meet with Serbs this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, for its part, has never been better
armed, and many in its ranks think anything less than indepedence
is a sellout. Hundreds of the group's supporters have gathered in
this town 35 miles southwest of Paris, testimony to the group's
tentacles throughout Europe and its ability to raise funds and
supply weaponry to the burgeoning separatist group.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking privately, western diplomats acknowledged that the key
to resolving Europe's most worrisome conflict is appealing to the
middle ground. Pinpointing that ground in a conflict as polarized
as Kosovo, however, is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the warring factions issued their first joint statement,
deploring the bombing of an ethnic Albanian shop in Pristina that
killed three people. Western diplomats, who read the statement in
several languages, took heart from it.
</P>
<P>
   Getting people to say that the slaughter of innocents is wrong
may seem like stating the obvious. But as one American diplomat put
it, getting the ethnic Albanians and Serbs to agree on anything is
progress.
</P>
<P>
   The British foreign minister, Robin Cook, who is co-chairing the
talks suggested that the two sides had to show real signs of
progress by Friday when he briefs the Contact Group, the six-nation
coalition overseeing the Balkans.

BEN MARGOLIS, 88, A LAWYER IN HOLLYWOOD BLACKLIST CASE
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   Ben Margolis, a California lawyer known for his spirited
counseling and defense of movie-industry figures who had been
blacklisted, died on Jan. 27 in Portland, Ore. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, after Margolis was subpoenaed to appear
before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, he said,
``I'll fry in hell before they get any information out of me about
my clients.''
</P>
<P>
   He also advised clients facing similar interrogations to reply,
when they were asked whether they had ever been members of the
Communist Party, ``None of your business.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Jarrico, a screenwriter who was blacklisted for two
decades, has recounted that when he appeared before the House
committee, he was flanked by two lawyers: Margolis, on his right,
and Robert W. Kenny, on his left. ``I was getting a little heated
in my answers,'' he recalled, ``and Kenny was whispering into my
left ear, `Take it easy, take it easy,' and Margolis was whispering
into my right ear, `Give it to 'em! Give it to 'em!'''
</P>
<P>
   Margolis and Kenny went before the United States Supreme Court
in 1958 representing 23 former Hollywood actors and writers who
contended in a lawsuit that they had been unconstitutionally
blacklisted by the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   The 23 included the actress Gale Sondergaard, who had won the
first Academy Award ever given to a supporting actress for her work
in the 1936 movie ``Anthony Adverse.'' The group also included
Howard da Silva, who had, in the words of the film historian
Ephraim Katz, ``pursued a successful career as a character actor in
films, specializing in mean heavy roles.''
</P>
<P>
   The 23 had been accused of having Communist affiliations. They
refused to answer questions from the House committee, claiming the
Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   They contended that because they had refused to answer, they
were unable to find work in movies. They sued the studios for $56
million, but their suit was rejected in California.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed to review the case, and in 1958
Margolis and Kenny argued before the court that their clients'
right to due process of law and to the equal protection of the laws
under the 14th Amendment had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   That amendment prohibits only discriminatory action by the
states, not discrimination by individuals. But Margolis contended
that the California courts' dismissal of the suit constituted
``state action'' and therefore violated the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that the state courts had granted relief in
similar cases and were discriminating against the 23 plaintiffs. In
addition, he presented an alternative argument: that the movie
industry, which the plaintiffs' suit characterized as a ``huge
monopolistic combination,'' was really a ``super-government'' whose
actions were equivalent to those of a state.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his efforts, the Supreme Court decided that it should
not have agreed to review the case because it rested on an
``adequate state ground,'' and it dismissed the suit. Justice
William O. Douglas dissented, saying the California courts were
guilty of unconstitutional discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis fared better when he represented Oleta O'Connor Yates,
a leader of the Communist Party in California, before the Supreme
Court. She had been sentenced to a year in jail for contempt of
court after refusing to testify at a 1952 trial of West Coast
Communists charged with advocating the violent overthrow of the
government. The Supreme Court set aside her sentence in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   When Margolis went before the House Committee on Un-American
Activities in 1952, he refused to answer questions about Communist
affiliations or organizations. He became the fifth Los Angeles
lawyer to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While he was being questioned, the committee's chairman,
Representative John S. Wood, a Georgia Democrat, said he was
getting tired of Margolis' ``contemptuous attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Margolis shot back: ``I feel nothing but contempt for
this committee and I'm proud of it. This committee has no right to
tell people how to think.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, the committee asserted that an ``elite corps'' of
Communist lawyers was promoting the party's cause in the courts, in
Congress and at certain government agencies. A report from the
panel identified 39 lawyers, including Margolis, who it alleged
were among more than 100 who had been identified as Communists
before the committee in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Margolis was raised partly in Santa
Barbara, Calif., and went on to study at Hastings Law School in San
Francisco. He practiced law in San Francisco before moving to Los
Angeles. Over the years his practice included labor, civil rights,
real estate and other kinds of law, and he was known as an advocate
for underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Valerie; three sons, Ken, Roger and
Gregory, and five grandchildren.

INDRANI, PERFORMER OF CLASSICAL INDIAN DANCE, DIES AT 68
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Indrani, a distinguished dancer who familiarized
Americans with several styles of India's classical dance as a
performer and teacher, died Feb. 5 in Beekman Downtown Hospital in
Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Sukanya Wicks, said.
</P>
<P>
   Indrani was an artist of international repute and often appeared
before heads of state in her native India and abroad. But she also
became a highly respected figure in the dance world of New York
after her debut there in 1960. The hallmark of her dancing, a blend
of dramatic vibrancy and technical refinement, carried over to her
teaching at American colleges and festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Although she had a home in New Delhi until recently, she spent
most of the last two decades in the United States, where she toured
extensively. In 1961, Indrani was the first dancer presented on a
national tour by the Asia Society. She had been on the faculty of
the Juilliard School since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indrani was an exquisite dancer, a great teacher and a true
rasika, in the largest spirit of that word, meaning a lover of the
arts,'' Rachel Cooper of the Asia Society said Sunday. Ms. Cooper,
associate director of the society's performing arts and public
programs, also praised Indrani's role as a producer of concerts in
New York by younger Indian dancers. She said the society had
planned to give Indrani a lifetime achievement award. ``The event
will now be a memorial as well,'' Ms. Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many Indian dancers of her generation, Indrani did not
specialize in a single school of classical dance but studied with
leading gurus in India to master the contrasting styles of Bharata
Natyam, Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam and Orissi.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Indrani was the first professional dancer to
perform Orissi onstage; Orissi, then a neglected dance form, was
inspired by temple sculpture in the state of Orissa, in eastern
India. Indrani was instrumental in the revival of Orissi,
introducing it to audiences in India by touring widely there and
doing the same abroad when she performed as a soloist or with her
ensemble of musicians and dancers.
</P>
<P>
   In championing rarely seen or forgotten classical dance forms,
Indrani followed naturally in the footsteps of her mother, Ragini
Devi, an American-born dancer who was internationally known for her
leading role in the revival of classical dance in India in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   As Esther Sherman in Petoskey, Mich., the future Ragini Devi was
already in love with Indian dance when she met Ramlal Bajpai in
Minneapolis. After she married Bajpai, an Indian scientist and
activist for Indian independence, she traveled to India to study
dance in 1930. Their daughter, Indrani, was born that year in
Madras. In her book ``Dance Dialects of India,'' Ragini Devi
described how she would take the infant Indrani on her own visits
to gurus. As a dancer, Indrani was her ``alter ego,'' Ragini Devi
wrote. ``Her dance career is a continuation of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragini Devi, who died in 1982, made her last stage appearance at
a memorable concert in 1979 at New York University. She was joined
by Sukanya, Indrani's daughter and also a dancer, as well as
Indrani. The vivacity of all three generations came into play.
</P>
<P>
   Indrani's playfulness and gaiety at that performance were
typical of her vivid personality. In the dramatic Kuchipudi solos,
Indrani's quick shifts in characterization were always subtle and
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Having started at age 5 in her mother's company, she was steeped
in the content of classical dance. As a professional, she began
with Bharata Natyam, where she could display the rhythmic
complexity of her footwork. But mime within this style and in
others allowed her to exhibit her brilliant dramatic gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government sponsored Indrani's tours. Her warmth and
artistry, as well as the beauty of her costumes and presentations,
made her a perfect choice. In 1961 she performed for President John
F. Kennedy and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during Nehru's
official visit to Washington. Indrani received the Indian
government's national award, Padma Shri, and the Sangeet Natak
Akadami Award in the performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   Indrani married Habib Rahman, who was named India's chief
architect and who died in 1995. In addition to her daughter, of
Orr's Island, Me., she is survived by her son, Ram Rahman, of New
Delhi, and two grandsons, Wardreath Wicks of Orr's Island, and
Habib Wicks of New York City.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE SMALLEST OF THE NETS USES HIS BIG CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ We're going down like flies,'' said
Jayson Williams, his nose more or less restored to the normal spot
on his face after having been mashed by Dikembe Mutombo's flying
elbow last Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   At least Williams was able to play. Four of his teammates were
unavailable Sunday night, including the first and second point
guards. It could have been a disaster for the Nets' home opener,
but the smallest man came off the bench and helped New Jersey hold
off the Hawks, 79-69.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Boykins is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 145 pounds and still
looks like a junior high school student _ a serious, polite,
intelligent one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Boykins was a star at Eastern Michigan University, but was not
drafted last spring, and while the big men with the big contracts
sat out the lockout, Boykins went off to Rockford of the
Continental Basketball Association and played 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets called him into camp, and he survived the cuts, mainly
because the rosters are allowed to remain at 14 for the first two
weeks of this season of attrition. The teams may need all 14
players all season, given the stress of playing 50 games in 90
days, with some of the players physically unprepared. They are in
uncharted waters.
</P>
<P>
   Boykins might never have got into a pro game but for the
sprained ankle suffered by Sam Cassell, the starting point guard,
on Saturday night. You could see Cassell falling apart before your
very eyes, like one of those cartoon automobiles that start
sputtering and wheezing, with the hub caps and wipers flying off,
followed by the doors and the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell was in pain, hobbling and grimacing _ but then again,
that's the way he always looks, so how could you tell if he really
was breaking down? John Calipari might have taken mercy on the
hobbling guard, but ultimately Cassell went down in the closing
seconds, 36 points into the season, and now he's out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen Sam strapped into the wheelchair after
the game,'' Williams reported. ``He had one eye open, looked like
he was dying. They wheeled him into the locker room and he was
moaning, `Oooh, watch my feet, oooh, don't put me there.' Then they
put him on the bus and he tried to walk to the bathroom and he
cramped up halfway back. Guys had to massage his legs just so he
could get to the bathroom. Not me, though. Have you ever seen Sam's
feet? It will be a cold day in hell before I rub Sam's feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical report was worse than that because Eric Murdock went
down with a sprained groin in that same first game. When Kendall
Gill got into foul trouble early Sunday night, Calipari had to open
up his rotation more than he might have liked, sending Boykins into
the game with 1 minute 25 seconds left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Don't be tentative or I'll take you right out,'''
Calipari said. ``I told him, `Have fun.'''
</P>
<P>
   The small man had more fun than even he might have expected. He
stayed with the larger guards, who tried to pick him off, but to no
avail. He ran his offensive routes, penetrating, moving the ball,
and if he seemed to be in midseason form, well, the 24 games at
Rockford had prepared him.
</P>
<P>
   Boykins also scored _ first on a steal and a breakaway layup,
then another breakaway layup.
</P>
<P>
   Why did he not dunk? ``I'm not showing everything all at once,''
he said with a smile later.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the first quarter, he dribbled against Mookie Blaylock,
8 inches taller, and lofted a high-arching jumper that went in.
Boykins had 6 points in 13 minutes at the half, and made a cameo
appearance in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered every move he made, but Boykins did not
respond. He is a serious player, far too young to want to be
anybody's good-luck charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy, but I'm not satisfied,'' he said later. ``I know I
can play better. I knew somebody would play more when Sam got hurt,
and I'm glad Cal gave me a chance. It shows he has confidence in
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been playing the game since his father, a police officer
in Cleveland, used to take him to adult games, with the youngster
bouncing a tennis ball at first, but graduating to a real ball. Now
he has dribbled a basketball in the biggest league of all.
</P>
<P>
   On hand to watch these reacquainted legions was David Stern, the
commissioner of the National Basketball Association, who earlier in
the day had watched the Knicks stumble to defeat across the river.
Stern said he was impressed by the intensity in the first three
days of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? A short and intense season just might have a future.
Plus, the large early roster has given Earl Boykins a chance to
show his game when it counts. There are things to be said in favor
of this short, strange season. &QL;

N.H. HOPES FOR PRESIDENTIAL HINT FROM DOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Will she or won't she?
</P>
<P>
   It's the question bringing 1,200 curious folks _ a sellout
crowd, the largest ever _ to the annual Chamber of Commerce dinner
in Manchester, N.H., Monday night, when Republican Elizabeth Dole
gives the keynote speech and, maybe, a signal that she is going to
run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Her aides are trying to sustain the suspense, saying Dole has
selected Manchester for her ``first major political speech'' since
leaving the American Red Cross last month, and she will meet with
potential Granite State political and financial supporters before
deciding whether to form a presidential exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision will come very soon,'' a Dole spokeswoman said.
``This is the last major hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't take an Olympian effort to clear it. Politicians
and polls in this, the first primary state, say Elizabeth Hanford
Dole, a two-time Cabinet secretary, the wife of 1996 GOP
presidential candidate Bob Dole, and the undeclared female
contender in 2000, is already at the head of what is shaping up as
a crowded Republican field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the primary were held Monday, there is no question
Elizabeth Dole would win,'' said Earl Cox, head of a ``Draft Dole''
committee who has crisscrossed the state several times on her
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who ran a ``Draft Colin Powell'' effort in 1996, said he is
stunned by the outpouring of support for Dole in New Hampshire.
``I've never seen anything like it,'' said Cox, who expects Dole to
declare her candidacy this month.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, 62, certainly the most visible and probably the most
highly regarded woman in the Republican Party, said Jan. 4 she was
giving ``serious consideration'' to a presidential run. She has
since left the American Red Cross, opened a small office at the
Watergate complex, worked the phones, wooed campaign consultants,
and tantalized the party with the prospect of seizing the first or
second spot on the ticket in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Wendelboe, a Republican state legislator from New Hampton,
says she senses ``genuine enthusiasm'' for Dole among never easily
persuaded New Hampshire voters. Former Senator Warren Rudman, who
is backing GOP Senator John McCain of Arizona, concedes Dole is a
``formidable, top-tier candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential primary fields, of course, are littered with
cast-off candidates who once led the pack and were deemed sure to
prevail. Indeed, Dole hasn't banked the first penny of the $20
million she probably will need to compete. She has a paid,
full-time staff of only two. And perhaps most significant, she has
not laid out a single piece of public policy or articulated a
position on any issue.
</P>
<P>
   But first impressions are important in politics, and Dole seems
to make a stellar one in her party. According to a poll conducted
in December by the American Research Group in Manchester, Dole has
97 percent name recognition among Republican voters in the state
and a lofty favorability rating of 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is in great shape,'' said Dick Bennett, who directed the
poll. ``People have no clue where Elizabeth Dole stands on
anything, but they think they know a lot about her. And most
important, people don't seem to dislike her.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP state committeewoman Ruth Griffin of Portsmouth said that
while the smart money in the state may eventually be on Texas
Governor George W. Bush, another undeclared candidate, ``I haven't
met anyone who says, `Oh, God, I just can't stand Elizabeth Dole.'
'' Griffin said she is also struck by how many of Dole's New
Hampshire backers are women.
</P>
<P>
   The female factor could resonate in the upcoming campaign, and
not just because family issues where women tend to be strong _
education, health care, and income security _ are in vogue. Linda
Liswood of Boston, co-founder of the White House Project, a group
pressing for a woman president, said the perception that women are
less power-hungry and more ethical and trustworthy than men could
serve Dole well in the wake of the long-running White House sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is often made through a combination of luck and
guile,'' Liswood said. ``Things have happened that make this a
particularly fertile point in time for a woman presidential
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Keans, a Republican state legislator from Rochester, said
Dole's gender is important to her _ ``When 51 percent of the
electorate is female, why shouldn't we have a woman president?'' _
and she highlighted Dole qualities she likes: ``She's very
credible, very bright, experienced, articulate, and pragmatic, and
she is tremendous, wonderful when she works a room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so what? Liberace could work a room, and that didn't make
him qualified to be president,'' said Danielle Crittenden, editor
of the conservative Women's Quarterly, who calls Dole ``a country
club feminist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just stunned at how many people love Elizabeth Dole
without asking what she has done or what does she think. It's as if
Bob Dole had his turn, and now it's a woman's turn, so it should be
Mrs. Dole's turn. Well, that's not good enough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman said Dole will outline ``important themes and
policy issues'' in her remarks Monday night. Dole refused to be
interviewed for this article, but her office did provide a copy of
a letter from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
congratulating Dole on her ``dynamic leadership at the American Red
Cross'' and her success in improving the relief agency's response
to emergencies and natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, it doesn't hurt Dole to be a little vague about
her ideology. A Los Angeles Times poll last week showed that both
Dole and George W. Bush could defeat Vice President Al Gore Monday,
and Dole showed considerable strength drawing independents (53
percent) and Democrats (20 percent) in the matchup with Gore.
Political analysts say they expect Dole could pull moderate
Republican women back to the party and appeal to Democrat women,
too.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Hampshire legislature, Representative Keans is a
proponent of abortion rights. Representative Wendelboe is an
abortion foe. Both are backing Dole, though neither knows exactly,
or cares tremendously, where she stands on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she is pro-life, but look, no politician can afford to
say it's my way or no way on abortion,'' Wendelboe said. ``It's my
view that a woman candidate can straddle the issue more easily than
a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Keans said the trouble with politics is that people have gotten
too distracted by social issues. As long as Dole does not promote
policies restricting a woman's access to abortions, she can support
her, no matter what her position.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Keans admits, she is slightly less interested in what
Dole says than how she says it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but I just love that syrupy accent of
hers,'' Keans said of Dole, who grew up in North Carolina. ``It
really sucks me in.''

UTAH COMMITTEE'S BILL FOR WOOING IOC ESTIMATED AT $3 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The amount local Olympic officials spent on
travel, accommodations, meals, cash payments, tuition aid, medical
treatment and extravagant gifts for members of the International
Olympic Committee and their relatives during the effort to secure
the 2002 Winter Games may have reached $3 million, an investigator
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, who has reviewed documents and received
briefings about the Salt Lake City bid, said the $3 million figure
included legitimate costs for travel and accommodation in addition
to the payments and gifts at the center of the Olympic bribery
scandal. But it was sometimes difficult to separate legitimate air
fares from suspiciously high fares, said the investigator, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Air fare for trips to Salt Lake City sometimes doubled or
tripled in price from one trip to the next from similar places, and
a round-trip ticket exceeded $10,000 in at least one instance, the
investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members are entitled to first-class tickets for themselves
and a guest while visiting bid cities. Investigators have been
examining whether members benefited financially from airline
tickets through several methods, such as flying coach and pocketing
the difference between first class and economy class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to establish what is legitimate reimbursement for
air fare and what is not,'' the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   An internal ethics panel of the Salt Lake City Olympic
Organizing Committee is scheduled to make public its report on the
bidding for the 2002 Winter Games on Tuesday. The Salt Lake
committee has also turned over approximately 200 boxes of documents
to the U.S. Justice Department, which is conducting a separate
investigation of the bribery scandal, the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, the Montreal attorney who headed the IOC's
investigation of Salt Lake City's bid, has said that $800,000 was
spent on cash payments and other lavish favors for IOC members. In
an interview Sunday, Pound said $3 million may be accurate if
legitimate travel and accommodation costs are included.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the lavish gift-giving, the investigator said,
were jewelry and other baubles from local stores that ranged in
value from $1,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oddest budget items of the bid committee, the
investigator said, was for rabbits sent to Pound. A notation showed
that the rabbits had been returned, the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said Tom Welch, the president of the Salt Lake City bid
committee, had sent him a rabbit as a joke in late 1994. The rabbit
arrived after Pound said Quebec was gaining in the race for the
2002 Winter Games and that Salt Lake City might not have any more
rabbits to pull out of its hat after failing to secure the 1998
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guy showed up at the door with a rabbit and I said, `Very
funny, take it away,''' Pound recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Games are scheduled to begin three years from
Monday, on Feb. 8, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Sunday, officials of the U.S. Olympic
Committee said they expected the Salt Lake City report would detail
the business arrangement between Welch and Alfredo La Mont, who
resigned last month as the U.S. Olympic Committee's director of
international relations.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Salt Lake City bid committee, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said Welch had paid La Mont approximately
$30,000, including a $10,000 bonus, for information on IOC members
from South America, through a company of La Mont's called Citius.
La Mont has declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Yushiro Yagi, head of a Japanese Olympic Committee
investigation into Nagano's bid for the 1998 Winter Games, said as
many as eight IOC members may have violated restrictions on the
frequency and duration of trips to Nagano before it was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from Los Angeles,
said she had telephoned the former athletic director at the
University of Southern California in the early 1990s, while Salt
Lake City was bidding on the 2002 Winter Games, and asked him to
consider a position on the tennis team for the daughter of a fellow
IOC member from Hungary named Pal Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   Both DeFrantz and Schmitt are members of the IOC's 11-member
executive board. Petra Schmitt attended Southern California from
1992 to 1995 and twice was an all-American.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McGee, the former athletic director at USC who is now at
South Carolina, said it was possible that DeFrantz called him, but
that his recollection was unclear. If she had made a request, McGee
said, he would have referred it to the tennis coach. The Schmitts
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz, who has close contacts with USC from the 1984 Los
Angeles Summer Olympics and as president of the Amateur Athletic
Foundation of Los Angeles, which gives grants for youth-related
sports activities, said that the recommendation had nothing to do
with swaying the elder Schmitt's vote toward Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying, `Here's somebody interesting to look at,' is OK,''
DeFrantz said. ``Paying for them is not OK. She had to get into
school on her own, like every other kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Intervening on behalf of a foreign student at an American school
during Salt Lake City's bid is one of the reasons why Kim Un-yong,
a powerful IOC member from South Korea, remains under investigation
by a commission headed by Pound. On Sunday, however, Pound said he
did not find anything troubling about DeFrantz's recommendation. He
writes about 30 letters of recommendation a year himself, Pound
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of your functions in life as you get older is to be a
referee,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz said she made perhaps a dozen visits to Salt Lake City
while other IOC members visited, or spoke to them by telephone, as
part of her job to support the bid. But DeFrantz said she never
knew that the bid committee was paying for such thing as
scholarships and medical treatment for IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, investigators and Salt Lake City Olympic officials
have wondered how DeFrantz could have been in such frequent contact
with fellow IOC members and not been aware of improper payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known, I would have reported it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she met the sons of IOC members while they were
traveling with their fathers, but could not recall whether she knew
that several of them were attending American schools on
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never told to me that the organizing committee or bid
committee was funding their education,'' DeFrantz said.
</P>
<P>
   During the bid process, DeFrantz said, she made periodic calls
to Dave Johnson, who headed international relations for Salt Lake
City's bid, asking whether her fellow IOC members had made any
requests for improper favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about that,'' DeFrantz said. ``There had been
rumors from other bids.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Johnson told her of any improprieties, DeFrantz said:
``Not that comes to mind. Certainly nothing of the sort that has
come out.'' She added, ``They wouldn't be going through this if
they were candid with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who resigned from the Salt Lake City organizing
committee last month, has declined to speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz said she knew that Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC member
from Congo Republic, had received medical treatment but assumed he
had paid for it with his IOC insurance. Ganga was expelled from the
IOC last month after Pound's commission determined that he had
received $216,000 in illicit payments from the Salt Lake City bid
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, DeFrantz said, she declined a request from an IOC
member from the West African nation of Mali who had been seeking a
graduate school scholarship for his son. She said she told the IOC
member, Lamine Keita, that she could not help him, and said that
she may have sent a letter of alert to La Mont in case the request
was later deemed improper. Keita has been expelled for receiving
$97,000 from the Salt Lake City bid committee for his son to attend
Howard University. Keita said he asked DeFrantz only for general
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pride myself on my integrity,'' said DeFrantz, who won a
bronze medal in rowing at the 1976 Summer Olympics. ``It's just not
my nature to step across ethical lines.''

 EDITORIAL: WRONG TIME FOR BIPARTISANSHIP  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Feb. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana's Democratic and Republican state officials met at the
governor's mansion late last month and signed a nonaggression pact,
promising not to campaign against one another in this year's
elections. There is a fine line between principled bipartisanship
and collusion between politicians who want to avoid the trouble of
running for re-election. This particular case looks more like an
incumbent protection plan.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years of brawling in Congress have given party
loyalty a bad name, and the Louisiana officials said that by
agreeing not to give one another any problems in the fall
elections, they were showing how well they had learned to work
together. A Times report by Kevin Sack indicated there were
practical considerations as well. The Republican governor, Mike
Foster, is popular. The six Democrats and one Republican who hold
other elective state offices are also likely to be re-elected. All
of them would prefer to avoid the expense and unpleasantness of a
hard-fought campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Top state officials should be helping their parties to run
competitive campaigns, not announcing nine months in advance that
they intend to stay on the sidelines. If Foster, the best-known
Republican in Louisiana, makes it clear he will not say anything
bad about Democrats like the state attorney general or treasurer,
it is going to be much harder for his party to recruit good
candidates to run against them.
</P>
<P>
   Americans admire independent politicians who refuse to be
chained to a party line. But they also like having a choice about
whom to vote for, something they seldom get these days. In Florida,
18 of the 23 members of Congress faced no major party opposition
last November, and 14 did not have to campaign at all, since not
even a rogue Libertarian or Socialist Worker managed to get on the
ballot to challenge them. Around the country, nearly 100 members of
Congress were unopposed last year, and only a few dozen races
involved serious contests.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that politicians can agree about the desirability of
avoiding real elections does not guarantee they will be able to
work together on anything else. Safe seats have not made the
members of Congress more collegial. In New York, the Republican
state Senate and Democratic Assembly seem incapable of reaching
consensus on anything except the desirability of maintaining the
status quo when it comes to party control.
</P>
<P>
   We hope the surprise announcement by Rep. William Jefferson,
D-New Orleans, that he intends to run for governor may cause some
of the pact signers in Louisiana to rethink their promises.
Ideally, politicians should regard election season as the time to
fight and the legislative season as the time to make common cause
when working on issues. These days, too many American politicians
have it backward.

EDITORIAL: MR. DOMBECK'S VISION
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Feb. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of his State of the Union address, President
Clinton outlined a politically ambitious plan to protect America's
natural treasures _ its parks, wilderness areas and national
forests. Skeptics wondered how much of this grandly named ``Lands
Legacy Initiative'' was real and how much was rhetoric, and whether
Clinton had the will to steer his ideas through a Congress that has
often been hostile to environmental initiatives. Then, last week,
came a reassuring down payment on the president's pledge. In a
speech in Missoula, Mont., Mike Dombeck, the head of the Forest
Service, announced a ban on mining activities along the 100-mile
Rocky Mountain Front, one of the richest wilderness areas in the
lower 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was important apart from its value as an
indication of Clinton's seriousness. To begin with, it will protect
one of the jewels of America's natural landscape, a rugged cascade
of limestone and shale extending 100 miles south of the Canadian
border and tilting eastward to the plains. The front shelters a
spectacular array of wildlife _ elk, mountain goats and grizzlies _
and is interlaced with famous trout streams. It also offers a
tempting target for companies seeking minerals like gold, silver
and copper.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was also a clear signal that the administration
intends to use its administrative powers to cushion the impact of
the 1872 Mining Law, an environmentally destructive relic that
Congress has repeatedly refused to change. The law allows companies
to stake claims to unprotected federal lands and, if minerals are
found, to take title for a few dollars an acre. The law does not
require companies to show that the mining operation will not cause
unacceptable damage to the environment, nor does it require them to
clean up afterward. The net result is a legacy of abandoned mines,
mountains of poisonous wastes and thousands of miles of dead
streams.
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck's announced ban will stop the mining companies before
they can get started. Technically, this will require Bruce Babbitt,
whose interior department oversees mining, to impose a moratorium
on new claims. Babbitt will happily do so. He detests the mining
law, and has already imposed a hard-rock mining ban on thousands of
acres north of Arizona's Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Dombeck's announcement is further evidence that he
means to transform the culture of the Forest Service and make it an
ally rather than an enemy of environmental values. For years, the
service has been a willing captive of the logging industry it is
meant to regulate and an eager servant of Western congressmen who
are far more interested in harvesting trees than in saving them. An
internal audit released last Friday revealed that the service had
done a generally poor job of monitoring private logging operations
on federal lands and preventing damage to watersheds and wildlife
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   In his two years on the job, Dombeck has made several important
if modest changes. But his speech promises much more, including a
moratorium on new roads in the roadless portions of the national
forests, new rules against clear-cutting and a far more disciplined
approach to forest management. Much of this will not sit well with
mining and logging interests and their friends on the Congressional
committees that underwrite Dombeck's agency. The mining ban, for
example, is effective immediately, but there will be at least a
year of comment and hearings before it becomes final. That leaves
plenty of time for congressional mischief, and it would not be
surprising to see some outraged congressman offer a bill to
override Dombeck's and Babbitt's administrative authority.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Dombeck will need White House support, and if the
president is as interested in creating an environmental legacy as
he says he is, he will give his forest chief all the help he needs.

NETS SHRUG OFF THEIR INJURIES AND THE HAWKS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ With 40 seconds remaining in Sunday
night's rematch between the New Jersey Nets and the Atlanta Hawks,
every fan in Continental Arena was standing and cheering. Jayson
Williams, the sturdy, injury-ignoring center, had just rejected an
attempted dunk by Steve Smith to guarantee the Nets' victory in
Part II of this suddenly rugged rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that Williams, the charismatic team leader and
community favorite, brought the crowd of 18,545 to an ovation and a
roar. Playing with a broken nose and no face mask, Williams
embodied the battered, warriorlike quality that the Nets have
exhibited in their first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Down to eight active players after the point guards Sam Cassell
and Eric Murdock were injured in last Saturday's physical loss in
Atlanta, the Nets defeated the Hawks by 79-69 to even their record
at 1-1. Neither Cassell (sprained right ankle) nor Murdock (pulled
left groin) played Sunday night, leaving the point position to the
small forward Kendall Gill, the shooting guard Lucious Harris and
the 5-foot-5-inch rookie Earl Boykins.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting Boykins to make his first start in the National
Basketball Association against the veteran Mookie Blaylock, coach
John Calipari's starting lineup had Gill at the point, Harris,
Chris Gatling, Keith Van Horn and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets snagged the victory by scoring 13 of the final 15
points to overcome a 67-66 deficit. Gill, who scored 15 points and
grabbed 11 rebounds, scored 6 points on free throws down the
stretch, and Chris Gatling sealed the victory with a 21-footer from
the right corner that made the score 74-67 with a minute remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn led the Nets with 24 points, tying Smith for game
honors. Alan Henderson (10 points) was the only other Hawk to score
in double figures, as Atlanta (2-1), playing its third straight
game, shot 29.5 percent from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had something to do with it,'' Calipari said, referring
to the Hawks' schedule. ``Let's not act like we're world-beaters.
But our thing was to stay on them and hope that they let go of the
rope because it was their third game in three nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, whose court personality belies his public persona as a
funnyman, proved again how much of a warrior he is. The man who has
played through broken thumbs and torn abdominal muscles gave the
Nets 40 minutes and 13 rebounds while playing without a mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only can play one way,'' Williams said. ``If I play 80
percent, I'm terrible. I have to play 110 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who scored 29 points in Saturday's loss, put the Nets
on his back for the first five minutes of the third quarter Sunday
night, scoring 12 straight points to help the Nets go ahead by
47-40. Scott Burrell took over from there, scoring 8 of his 16
points as the Nets grabbed a 62-53 lead heading into the final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who trailed early, got going in the second quarter
behind Burrell and Boykins. Boykins was the surprising spark off
the bench for the Nets. The only healthy point guard on Calipari's
roster, he was a bit miffed that the coach did not start him. But
after entering toward the end of the first quarter to boisterous
cheers, Boykins showed he could contribute at the NBA level.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, with Gill and Harris playing out of position, had
sputtered in their halfcourt game before Calipari went to Boykins.
With poor spacing and 30 percent shooting, the Nets had scored only
15 points. But Atlanta's shooters were also having a bad night, and
the Hawks led by only 19-15.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks went at Boykins immediately, posting up Blaylock and
drawing a foul moments after the Nets' point guard checked in.
After Blaylock hit the two free throws, Atlanta took a 21-15 lead
into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But with Boykins playing the next 12 minutes _ and recording 6
points and an assist _ the Nets outscored the Hawks by 20-8. He
scored consecutive fast-break layups to tie the game at 23-23, then
took Blaylock around a Williams pick to sink a 17-footer that gave
the Nets a 35-27 lead 1:24 before the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was terrific,'' Calipari said of Boykins. ``He did a nice
job.''

O'NEAL'S GAB SPURS RESPONSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Shaquille O'Neal dissed the San Antonio
Spurs. The Spurs dissed back. Now O'Neal's answering with threats
of broken noses and more off-the-wall insults as the Lakers prepare
to play the Spurs tonight.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, miffed when the Spurs were picked to win the West by one
publication last month, said Spurs center David Robinson wasn't his
equal and said Tim Duncan is ``too light for me down there. . . .
They're a pretty dominant big-man tandem, but ain't none of them
can do nothing with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Duncan didn't respond, but teammates Mario Elie and
Sean Elliot did. Said Elie, ``Let's see what Mr. Big Mouth is going
to do once he gets here. Let your game do the talking. Don't be
yapping your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   And Elliot: ``It kind of makes me miss Michael Jordan. They say
they want to pass the torch, but some of these guys don't know how
to handle superstardom.''
</P>
<P>
   To which O'Neal responded Sunday, ``If I catch Sean Elliot or
Mario Elie on a rebound, and they get their nose broken, it's
nothing personal. Period. Sean Elliot's always been a bum.''
</P>
<P>
   He's reconsidered his position on Duncan, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duncan's the man now, but nobody else can do anything,''
O'Neal said. ``Sean Elliot is a bum and I'm gonna punch Mario Elie
in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Disappearing Eddie: Of all the statistical oddities Sunday _
four Lakers fouling out, three Lakers posting double-doubles _ the
most startling was Eddie Jones' line: 10 shots, one field goal,
three points.
</P>
<P>
   The point production was his lowest since a two-point game
against Seattle on Feb. 13, 1998. And his two-game totals for this
season are brutal: 3 for 22 (.136) from the field, 1 for 8 on
3-pointers, 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't really think I'm in a slump,'' said Jones,
a career 48 percent shooter. ``The shots are gonna fall for me,
it's just a matter of keeping my confidence up and making shots.
It's not like me, but like I said, I'm gonna come out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Del Harris also dismissed any concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played two games,'' Harris said. ``He played a pretty
good game one (Friday), tonight he didn't get his shots down, but
he could break out (tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other rare stats, the double-double trifecta was
accomplished by O'Neal (37 points, 14 rebounds), Kobe Bryant (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Elden Campbell (14 points, 12 rebounds).
All three of them, and Robert Horry, fouled out in the final 1:29.
</P>
<P>
   __ Derek and Derek: Derek Fisher is the starting point guard,
Derek Harper is the cagy veteran backing him up _ that's the
official description. But in two games, the trends say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has played 40 minutes, Harper 66, and in the fourth
quarter this season Fisher has played precisely 16.3 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the explanation is found in the production: Fisher has
eight points and four assists, Harper 27 points and 13 assists.
</P>
<P>
   But for Fisher _ who finished last season as the starter but
played fewer minutes than Nick Van Exel _ it's a disturbing
pattern. But he won't second-guess the playing-time decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not gonna even really comment,'' he said. ``I don't want
to get into situations where you say things that come up and hurt
you. This is something that I just have to chalk up to experience.
As a player and as a human being, there's no way to be happy (about
it), but I don't want to get into what I think because the ultimate
goal is to win basketball games, and I don't want to step away from
that.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   By Robert Fisk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To the end, he was a king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal had spoken of his own mortality many times,
and his last journey Friday _ six thousand miles from an American
deathbed to the land he ruled for 46 years _ became him. Soldiers
prefer to die at home.
</P>
<P>
   He was an honorable man. He believed that if he trusted enough
in another person, his good faith would be returned; he was cruelly
rewarded...
</P>
<P>
   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to
drive his most vociferous political prisoner home?
</P>
<P>
   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man
easily riled _ and was imprisoned for asking why the queen wept at
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. When the king arrived at the prison,
Shubeilath delayed him ten minutes while he said goodbye to his
fellow inmates. Hussein waited patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done
that? Would King Fahd? Would President Mubarak? Would Benjamin
Netanyahu?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the
monsters of the Middle East, he appeared such a reasonable man.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Arabs and Israelis fear for the future. What are they
going to do now that there is no one to defuse the bombs? &QL;

<P>
   AMMAN _ Signs of outward grief are everywhere in the Jordanian
capital. Outside the Al-Hussein Medical Center where King Hussein
had just died women braved the driving rain to sob; some fell
fainting to the ground as they waited for the king's body to leave
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Even more moving than the tears, though, was the way in which
Jordanians, who are not used to cold, groped their way forward in
the white banks of mist to express sorrow for their beloved king.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Amman, people looked worried more than
grief-striken. King Hussein had always protected them from the dark
forces around Jordan; what will happen to their tiny, vulnerable
kingdom now that he is gone? &QL;

<P>
   AMMAN _ As news of the death of King Hussein spread through
Amman, the Jordanian capital, just before noon Sunday thousands of
Jordanians, many carrying black flags of mourning, drove in cars
and trucks through the driving rain and thick, ominous mist to
tearfully wait for his body to be removed from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers pulled down the metal shutters of their shops,
closing up as a sign of respect for the beloved king _ and father
figure _ who had ruled Jordan for a staggering 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan King Hussein was a benevolent autocrat, ultimately
controlling everything but avoiding extreme repression. As one
member of the opposition said: ``You could try to overthrow him but
he would still forgive you in the end.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   As the West pays its respects to the memory of King Hussein of
Jordan, it should pause to acknowledge a conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   The King has been a good leader, of his own people and of wider
Arab interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be hoped that the rather Shakespearian deathbed
maneuvers, dashing at the 11th hour his brother's 34-year
expectation of inheriting the crown in favor of his eldest son,
Abdullah, will come to good... &QL;

<P>
   AMMAN _ It was always a balancing act. Jordan is a buffer state
between more powerful countries, notably Israel and Iraq. King
Hussein's political career was spent playing off his enemies
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   He played both ends against the middle because he believed
(correctly) that Jordan's weakness _ 4.4 million people and no
natural resources or defenses _ left him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   His death, comes at a bad moment for Jordan. His neighbors _
indeed, the world _ awaits to see if the house King Hussein built
will hold together. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   By Robert Fisk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah... &QL;

</P>
<P>
   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Hussein is dead, having succumbed to his toughest
enemy, cancer. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd can barely stand, and
stumbles on the simplest sentences. Yasser Arafat suffers ever more
from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal air crash.
Syria's Hafez Assad suffers from a heart condition, and has lost
his heir-apparent son, Basil, in a road accident. Egypt's Hosni
Mubarak has never appointed a vice-president, let alone a
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Succession'': it's the Middle East's unspoken crisis. The
great unmentionable. But it is real.
</P>
<P>
   We in the West, of course, accept the Arab world's odd,
dangerous system of inheritance. Why? Because we like
dictatorships. We know how to do business with the kings and
generals _ how to sell them our arms, fighter-bombers and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families... &QL;

</P>
<P>
   AMMAN _ Signs of outward grief are everywhere in the Jordanian
capital. Outside the Al-Hussein Medical Center where King Hussein
had just died women braved the driving rain to sob; some fell
fainting to the ground as they waited for the king's body to leave
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Even more moving than the tears, though, was the way in which
Jordanians, who are not used to cold, groped their way forward in
the white banks of mist to express sorrow for their beloved king.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Amman, people looked worried more than
grief-striken. King Hussein had always protected them from the dark
forces around Jordan; what will happen to their tiny, vulnerable
kingdom now that he is gone? &QL;

<P>
   AMMAN _ As news of the death of King Hussein spread through
Amman, the Jordanian capital, just before noon Sunday thousands of
Jordanians, many carrying black flags of mourning, drove in cars
and trucks through the driving rain and thick, ominous mist to
tearfully wait for his body to be removed from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers pulled down the metal shutters of their shops,
closing up as a sign of respect for the beloved king _ and father
figure _ who had ruled Jordan for a staggering 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan King Hussein was a benevolent autocrat, ultimately
controlling everything but avoiding extreme repression. As one
member of the opposition said: ``You could try to overthrow him but
he would still forgive you in the end.'' &QL;

   As the West pays its respects to the memory of King Hussein of
Jordan, it should pause to acknowledge a conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   The King has been a good leader, of his own people and of wider
Arab interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be hoped that the rather Shakespearian deathbed
maneuvers, dashing at the 11th hour his brother's 34-year
expectation of inheriting the crown in favor of his eldest son,
Abdullah, will come to good... &QL;

between more powerful countries, notably Israel and Iraq. King
Hussein's political career was spent playing off his enemies
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   He played both ends against the middle because he believed
(correctly) that Jordan's weakness _ 4.4 million people and no
natural resources or defenses _ left him no choice.

<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah... &QL;

PRIMPED DOGS TAKE TO STREETS FOR A MARDI GRAS CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Despite her ignoble origins (the rumor is that her
father was also her brother), the queen of the Mystic Krewe of
Barkus Mardi Gras parade seemed utterly at ease in the role of
royalty on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived fashionably late in the back seat of a shiny green
BMW convertible that rolled into Louis Armstrong Park behind a
roaring escort of police motorcycles. She looked positively elegant
in a black velvet cape and a gold lame Norma Desmond top knot with
her title, ``Queen,'' spelled out in shimmering stones. (``Those
are Austrian crystals, by the way,'' sniffed her attendant, Alison
G. Cook. ``They're not rhinestones.'')
</P>
<P>
   As she began her procession down St. Ann Street, with a shopping
cart as her rolling throne, she was hailed throughout the French
Quarter by tens of thousands of loyal subjects. All in all, it was
not a bad way to spend an afternoon for a 2{-year-old whippet who
was badly abused as a puppy and who narrowly avoided the
euthanist's needle.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the common sentiment among the 1,500 costumed
dogs, and at least as many dog owners, who marched Sunday in the
7th annual Krewe of Barkus parade. Even Ben LaMont, a 26-year-old
New Orleans man who had to carry his weary 65-pound bulldog, Duke,
after the first few blocks, seemed to be enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a lot of fun,'' he panted. ``It's not the typical
Mardi Gras parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Barkus will never be seriously confused with Bacchus,
the exclusive club of New Orleans bluebloods who parade in ornate
costumes each Mardi Gras. It is, rather, the logical extension of
Carnival in New Orleans, a season and a city where weirdness
becomes so mundane that its boundaries must be constantly expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Because the theme was ``007: From Barkus With Love,'' this
year's parade featured bulldogs in black tie, schnauzers with
silver trays of martini glasses strapped to their backs and Great
Danes with handguns holstered to their collars.
</P>
<P>
   Kim M. Eiswirth, 34, a New Orleans hairstylist, dressed her
dalmatian, Maggie May, in a taut pink body suit and a fur muff hat.
Her back paws were fitted with white leather go-go boots, while her
front paws glimmered with hot pink nail polish. ``Octopuppy,'' Ms.
Eiswirth explained.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that Barkus was born in a bar.
Seven years ago, a group of friends in a French Quarter tavern
lamented the fact that the traditional Mardi Gras parades did not
accommodate dogs particularly well. Among other hazards, they
tended to get run over by motorized floats.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the first procession of about 500 primped pooches
was winding through the narrow streets of the Vieux Carre.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers now struggle to limit the krewe to 1,500 members.
Each pet owner pays an entry fee and the proceeds are divided among
animal welfare groups. Last year's event raised nearly $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Barkus is now a mainstay of the alternative Mardi Gras movement,
a series of Carnival events that gently mock the old-money
exclusivity of many of the traditional parades staged in the New
Orleans area in the two weeks before Fat Tuesday (Feb. 16, this
year).
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike many Mardi Gras krewes, your past is irrelevant in this
parade,'' explained Catherine Olivier, director of community
affairs for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
``We accept you no matter what. Junkyard dogs to uptown
sweethearts, we take them all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like Bacchus and Rex and Zulu and the other Mardi Gras parades,
Barkus has its own royalty, and an annual theme, often purloined
from Hollywood. In 1994, it was ``Jurassic Bark.'' The next year it
was ``Lifestyles of the Bitch and Famous,'' followed by ``Tails
from the Crypt.'' The parade is now complemented by its own
black-tie ball (for owners, not dogs) and is promoted with the sale
of T-shirts, posters and cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   The king traditionally is a purebred, with papers to prove it.
This year's monarch was a 10-month-old silver gray Weimaraner named
Madison Goulue Wilbar (American Kennel Club (NU)SN534852/04), who
divides his time between the French Quarter, a home in Kiln, Miss.,
and a Florida beach house.
</P>
<P>
   Also by tradition, the queen must be a tramp, usually rescued by
an SPCA volunteer. This year's Cinderella, Hero, was described in
her official press release as having ``a nose any anteater would be
proud of, ears that would shame a carriage mule and protruding eyes
that bring Bette Davis to mind.'' She arrived at the SPCA with such
a severe case of the shakes that her adoptive mother, Ms. Cook,
eventually consulted a pet psychic for help. ``She really is like
royalty,'' Ms. Cook explained. ``Inbred and high strung.''
</P>
<P>
   A continuous throng of tourists and locals lined the streets of
the French Quarter on Sunday afternoon to watch the procession and
to grab the coveted beads, Milk Bones and dog toys tossed by the
marchers. There were dachshunds in dreadlocks, Great Danes in
French cuffs and beagles in top hats on feather boa leashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tulle is always attractive on a dog,'' observed Lili M.
Hambrick, a New Orleans guidance counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Gerri L. Hoover, a lighting designer from Kissimmee, Fla.,
watched the parade with a camera in one hand and a pina colada in
the other, and said she was having so much fun that she probably
would miss her flight home Sunday afternoon. ``It will be well
worth it,'' Ms. Hoover said. ``I'm a dog lover and this is just one
of the best things I've ever seen.''

HUSSEIN'S SON ABDULLAH SWORN IN AS JORDAN``S NEW LEADER
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By DEBORAH HORAN &QL; 
 &QL; 
c.1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Special to the Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ King Hussein of Jordan, a risk-taker who for 47
years steered his tiny desert kingdom through the Middle East's
tumultuous currents and capped his reign as a peacemaker, died on
Sunday of complications from lymphatic cancer. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors turned off a respirator after his heart stopped pumping
and his brain stopped functioning, palace sources said. Hussein had
been connected to the life-supporting machine since Friday, when
his internal organs failed following an unsuccessful bone marrow
transplant performed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His 37-year-old son, Abdullah, was sworn in as the kingdom's
fourth monarch and addressed his 4.3 million subjects. ``King
Hussein was a father to every one of you, as he was my father,'' he
said. ``Today you are my brothers and sisters and you are dear to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton remembered Hussein as a
peacemaker. ``When peace finally comes to the Middle East,''
Clinton said, ``his name will be inscribed upon it. That day, King
Hussein will smile on us one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew off to Jordan for the state funeral today. He took
a delegation that included former Presidents Bush, Carter and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians realized their king had died when regular television
and radio shows were interrupted at noon Sunday with melodic versus
from the Koran, Islam's holy book, promising everlasting life to an
upright soul. Immediately, men and women in the streets began to
weep.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein artfully ruled his country by blending influences
from the West, where he was educated, with his own Arabic
traditions. His perseverance earned him the nickname ``the plucky
little king.'' His pragmatism eventually led him to make peace with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   His death ended the reign of a leader whose larger-than-life
image and adroit political skills in a region of shifting alliances
defined a nation and an era. Nearly 80 percent of his 4.3 million
subjects have never known another king.
</P>
<P>
   His death leaves Prince Abdullah, an intelligent but politically
untested 37-year-old military man who until two weeks ago was in
charge of Jordan's special forces, to navigate his country amid the
often competing interests of powerful neighbors _ Israel, Iraq,
Syria and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians old enough to remember say Prince Abdullah reminds
them of King Hussein when he was in his prime. Analysts and Western
diplomats say Abdullah is likely to follow in his father's
footsteps and maintain Jordan's moderate foreign policy. But the
new king faces uncertainty in a country held together largely by
the force of Hussein's personality.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein bin Talal, a descendant of the royal Hashemite family
that draws its lineage back to the Prophet Mohammed, was born Nov.
14, 1935. The young prince's mentor was his grandfather, King
Abdullah, whom the British had installed in 1923 as the ruler of a
desert territory called Transjordan. The British granted the land
its independence in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was he who taught me to understand the minds of my people
and the intricacies of the Arab,'' Hussein wrote in his 1962
autobiography titled Uneasy Lies the Head. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; At home, Hussein kept a common touch with his people. Abroad,
he owned homes in London, suburban Washington, Vienna and Palm
Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Something of a daredevil who loved to pilot jet planes and
helicopters, as well as to water-ski, sky-dive, and drive fast
cars, Hussein earned a reputation for bravado. Former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger wrote that Hussein exhibited it in the 1970s
when he took Kissinger and his wife, Nancy, on a hair-raising
helicopter ride at tree-top level.
</P>
<P>
   During his near-half century reign, that spirit would help
Hussein survive. In his first two decades of rule, he withstood an
armed invasion by the Syrians, won a bloody civil war against the
Palestinians and survived numerous assassination attempts, only to
be struck with cancer at the age of 57.
</P>
<P>
   He became king in 1952 after his father, King Talal, abdicated
due to mental illness, leaving him, not quite 17, to rule under the
guidance of a British general, Sir John Bagot Glubb.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Hussein had survived his first assassination attempt. A
Palestinian, angered at Jordan's annexation of the West Bank, shot
and killed his grandfather, King Abdullah, while he stood next to
Hussein outside Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque. A bullet intended for
Hussein ricocheted off a metal pinned to the teen-ager's chest.
</P>
<P>
   The early brush with death would not be his last. As king, he
survived an attempted poisoning, an ambush, an air raid, and even
an attempt by the Syrians to force the plane in which he was flying
out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The initial escape from death would form a lasting impression
that would guide his politics for decades to come and transform him
``from a boy into a man,'' he wrote in the 1962 autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   He learned to trust no one and to use force at home when
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with threats from other Arab countries, Hussein turned for
help to the United States, Britain _ and even Israel, though the
two nations were formally at war for most of his reign. The West
came to his aid more than once, most notably when the assassination
of Iraq's King Faisal in 1958 sparked an attempt by Syria and Egypt
to try to eliminate King Hussein, who was then just 23 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Those alliances earned him respect in Washington and London. But
they also made him a target of suspicion among nationalists in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian press derided him as an ``imperialist lackey'' and
a ``treacherous dwarf,'' particularly after the 1973 Mideast war
when word leaked that the king had tipped off the Israelis that
Arab countries were about to attack.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor proved true. Hussein, who hadn't forgotten the favors
the Americans and Israelis had made to help prop up his threatened
government, told the Nixon administration that Syria and Egypt were
preparing for war, according to Kissinger's memoirs. But he would
have to wait more than 20 years to make his de facto peace with
Israel formal.
</P>
<P>
   By 1967, the pan-Arabism that had threatened his kingdom had
died down when Hussein made the fateful mistake of joining Egypt
and Syria in the Six Day War against Israel. By the time the war
ended, the king had lost the West Bank, and its population of
Palestinians, and east Jerusalem, home to Islam's third-holiest
shrine, the Al-Aqsa mosque.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, when Palestinians lead by Yasser Arafat
challenged his rule, civil war broke out between Arafat's feyedeen
and the king's Bedouin forces. Hussein's troops won by killing some
4,000 Palestinian fighters in a bloody month that Palestinians
named Black September.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Hussein used guns against would-be Palestinian
usurpers, he also ruled with a benevolence toward Palestinian
refugees unique in the Arab world. Jordan's 3 million Palestinians
were granted citizenship, the right to vote and a stake in the
country's political and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, faced with angry public sentiment, and a relatively
large community of Iraqi exiles, Hussein chose to support Saddam
Hussein in the Persian Gulf War, angering President Bush and Arab
leaders. That decision and a later acquiescence to the economic
demands of the International Monetary Fund, which resulted in bread
riots, were two of his biggest mistakes, analysts here say.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1994 that Hussein would undertake what he called
the ``fulfillment of a dream,`` and, perhaps his biggest risk _
making peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At the signing ceremony at the Arava Desert, he gave an
emotional address. ``God willing,'' he said, ``there will be no
more death, no more misery, no more suspicion, no more fear, no
more uncertainty of what each day might bring.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Clinton administration responded by declaring
Jordan a major non-NATO ally, a designation that helped solidify an
annual aid package of $225 million. On Saturday, the administration
asked Congress to free up $300 million in aid to Jordan over the
next three years, to help Abdullah deal with a struggling economy. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; At home, Hussein kept a tight reign on his subjects. Though
Jordan enjoys more freedoms than other Arab nations, political
dissent has not been allowed. Political parties must pledge
allegiance to the monarchy, and the act of ``insulting'' the king
or the royal family is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The mukhabarat, Jordan's internal intelligence agency, is
all-powerful. And political prisoners, mostly belonging to
Al-Tahrir, a group that advocates the overthrow of the monarchy,
languish in jails.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jordanians have been asking for a variety of
political reforms. Instead, Hussein pushed through Parliament a
draconian press law that severely curbs freedom of speech. Some
Jordanians say they hope they can repeal that law now that Abdullah
has become king. But most say they expect a full democracy to be
years in coming.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein married four times, fathered 11 children and adopted a
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   He could be abrupt in his personal relationships. Eighteen
months after he married his first wife, Deena Abdul Hamid, an
Egyptian, he divorced her. She was sitting on a beach in Alexandria
when she learned that she was no longer a king's wife. They had one
daughter, Alia.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he met Toni Gardiner at a dance. The daughter
of a British army officer, a non-Arab and a Christian, she was a
scandalous choice to his conservative Muslim subjects. The king
gave her a Muslim name, Muna al-Hussein _ Hussein's wish _ and she
converted to Islam. The had two sons, Abdullah, now king, and
Faisal, and two daughters, Zein and Aisha. Their marriage ended in
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Next he wed Alia Toukan, a Palestinian from a prominent West
Bank family. They had one son, Ali, a daughter Haya and adopted a
second daughter, Abir. Alia Toukan was killed in a helicopter crash
in 1977, sending the king into deep mourning.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he met and married American-born Lisa Halaby, the
Princeton-educated daughter of Najib Halaby, a Syrian immigrant who
rose to become chief executive of Pan American Airlines. Her
American background and lack of Arabic made her unpopular in
Jordan. Undaunted, the king named her Noor al-Hussein _ Hussein's
light.
</P>
<P>
   They had four children, sons Hamzeh and Hashem and daughters
Iman and Raiyah.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before his death, Hussein seemed to have an acute
sense that his time was limited. His last major action sent a jolt
through Jordan. Returning from cancer treatment in the United
States, he appointed his eldest son, Abdullah, as heir to the
throne and removed his brother, Prince Hassan, who had been regent
for 34 years and was running the country in the king's absence.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the king's Cabinet gave Abdullah all powers of the
monarchy. He took the oath as king on Sunday, about four hours
after Hussein was pronounced dead. One of his first actions was to
name 19-year-old Prince Hamzeh as crown prince, making him next in
line of succession. He also said Prince Hassan would act as a
senior adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians and Western observers predicted that the transition
from Hussein to Abdullah would be smooth but agreed that the new
king can soon expect challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Abdullah) will immediately be put to the test in this
larger geopolitical context,'' former Secretary of State James
Baker said in a New York Times opinion piece Sunday. But Baker
added: ``I believe the transition from father to son will
succeed.''

NAACP LEADER PRESSES FOR JUSTICE IN FATAL SHOOTING BY COPS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The outcry over the killing of an unarmed West
African immigrant in a fusillade of 41 police bullets spread to the
national stage Sunday, as the president of the NAACP condemned the
shooting as ``excessive force at its worst'' and urged the U. S.
attorney general, Janet Reno, to reassure Americans that such
incidents will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   The president, Kweisi Mfume, said he would ask Reno Monday to
make a public statement that ``the Justice Department will use
every possible vehicle to get to the facts involved in the case and
make sure that justice is fair and swift.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume's comments were the first indication that national
attention is beginning to focus on the death last Thursday of
Amadou Diallo. Diallo, a 22-year-old street peddler with no
criminal record, was hit by 19 of the bullets fired by four police
officers in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said he did not think it necessary for the Justice
Department in Washington to take over the criminal investigation,
which is being directed by the Bronx district attorney's office and
being monitored by the U. S. attorney's office in Manhattan. But he
said federal officials need to do more now than just review the
incident in anticipation of a possible civil rights case down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying you are monitoring it does not assure Americans enough
that there is going to be a quick attempt to get to the facts of
the case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Reno, Myron Marlin, said, ``The civil rights
division in Washington is already working together with the local
U.S. attorney's office, but we will consider any request by Mfume
and will determine what additional action will be needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have been unable to explain why the four
officers, all members of an aggressive street crimes unit with
between five and seven years' experience on the force, thought
their lives had been in jeopardy, or why they had fired so many
times.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who were searching for a rape suspect when they
encountered Diallo, have yet to speak to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But their lawyer, Stephen Worth, has said the officers had
believed Diallo had a gun. According to a person close to the
officers, the four said Diallo did not respond to their spoken
commands and made motions with his hands and arms that the officers
interpreted as threatening.
</P>
<P>
   When the barrage of bullets had ceased, however, only a wallet
and a pager were found lying next to Diallo's body in the doorway
of 1157 Wheeler Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   A state grand jury is scheduled to begin hearing testimony this
week as it evaluates whether the officers should be charged
criminally. Worth has said he will probably allow the officers to
testify at that proceeding without immunity as long as he is
assured that federal authorities will not intervene in the criminal
case until the state grand jury has completed its deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Sunday, the office of the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan, Mary Jo White, hinted strongly that it intends to let
the state case go forward before deciding whether to proceed with a
federal civil rights case of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have complete confidence in the ability of the Bronx
district attorney to determine whether the shooting violated any
state laws,'' Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the office, said in a
prepared statement. ``We will coordinate closely with Johnson's
office as his investigation proceeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the testimony of officers in shooting incidents is
always important, the accounts of the officers in the Diallo case _
Sean Carroll, 35, Edward McMellon, 26, Kenneth Boss, 27, and
Richard Murphy, 26 _ are particularly so because there were
apparently no other witnesses. Detectives have been scouring for
witnesses in Diallo's neighborhood, the Soundview section of the
Bronx, without success.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to clarify whether federal prosecutors are committed to
letting the state case proceed first, Smilon said he could not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   But he did offer a more detailed explanation of why federal
prosecutors decided to enter the case so early, saying it was based
not on a particular request from anyone, but on ``the public
importance of the matter and the possibility that federal civil
rights laws might be implicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth said he would call prosecutors Monday in hopes of settling
terms under which his clients would testify. But he said federal
authorities so far have made no promises to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to hear from the horse's mouth before making a
decision as to whether they will testify,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers have been removed from patrol and given
administrative assignments pending the investigation, which is
routine.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo shooting is the latest in a series of police
incidents that have led some New Yorkers to complain that the same
aggressive police work credited for the decline in crime has also
led to an increase in police brutality, particularly against
members of minority groups. Diallo was black; the officers are
white.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume alluded to that context while announcing the decision by
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to
join a chorus of voices in New York expressing outrage at the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP will be joining with other concerned citizens in an
attempt to underscore the absolute foolishness of excessive police
brutality that has reared its ugly head again in New York, and
again involving a person of color,'' he said. ``The NAACP simply
does not believe there is any legitimate excuse or explanation for
what took place.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Worth said Mfume was too quick to judge the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``How anyone on the outside can know that this was an
unjustifiable shooting mystifies me,'' he said. ``Both the police
commissioner and the mayor recognized that the mere number of shots
alone does not make this a crime on the part of the police
officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume, who spent 10 years in Congress as a democratic
representative from Maryland, said he also plans to ask Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani to quickly and forcefully criticize the police
behavior as he did in the case of Abner Louima, the Haitian
immigrant who was tortured in a station house bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quick to denounce it, and I would like him to use his
bully pulpit to let New Yorkers know he denounces this as well,''
Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Giuliani, said the mayor had
already expressed his support for federal involvement in the
investigation and his sympathy about the death of Diallo, who
immigrated from Guinea two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he concerned about the fact that 41 shots were fired?
Absolutely,'' Ms. Roche said. ``But he would like to wait until all
the facts are in before making that kind of judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor spent part of Sunday afternoon in a 45-minute meeting
at City Hall, where he briefed the Guinean ambassador to the United
Nations, Mahawa Bangoura Kamara, and the Guinean ambassador to the
United States and Brazil, Mohammad Thiam, on developments in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked about keeping lines of communication open and told
them we would apprise them of new facts as they develop,'' Ms.
Roche said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ms. Roche said, the mayor spoke by telephone with
Diallo's father, who is in transit to New York from Vietnam, where
he was on business. But Ms. Roche said she could not discuss what
the two men had said, calling it ``a private conversation.''

5 STATES TEAM UP TO FIGHT NEW YORK'S TRASH PROPOSAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Va., Pa., Md., W.Va., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city administration's garbage troubles continued
over the weekend after the environmental commissioners of five
states sent Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a letter calling his plans to
dispose of the city's trash ``an unacceptable policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, signed by the top environmental officials of New
Jersey, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia, urges
the mayor to change the plan in order to ``bring balance to the
waste marketplace.'' Under the plan, much of the city's garbage
would go out of state after the Fresh Kills landfill closes in
2001. The letter was sent on Friday and reported in The Washington
Post on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The letter has no binding impact, and, as the mayor has often
pointed out, curbing interstate commerce is sharply limited by
federal law. ``As the mayor has said so frequently,'' Deputy Mayor
Joseph Lhota said Sunday: ``The politics of garbage is very much
different than the business of garbage. When done in an
environmentally sound way, garbage can be very good business.''
</P>
<P>
   But the letter underscores the increasing resistance the mayor
is facing from politicians, if not landfill operators, in many of
the states where he is counting on being able to ship the city's
trash.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has already drawn an angry letter from Virginia's
governor as well as the threat of legislative action in response to
a plan to ship thousands of additional tons of garbage a day to
Virginia on barges. And the plan to have two huge transfer stations
constructed in New Jersey has already drawn a polite ``drop dead''
from Gov. Christie Whitman. Giuliani was also met in Harrisburg,
Pa., last week by protesters opposed to the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Although states may not be able to outlaw commerce in garbage,
Virginia, at least, could take legal steps that would make it more
difficult to bring garbage in by barge.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also reminded Giuliani of his commitment to send
garbage only to communities that agreed to accept it, and officials
in Newark and Carteret, N.J., where there are plans to build new
transfer stations, have promised to block them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what this letter is doing is once again, as other
people have done already, kind of drawing into question the
viability of the present long-term plan,'' said Thomas Outerbridge,
an environmental consultant who is co-chairman of the Citywide
Recycling Advisory Group, an unpaid consulting panel.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sondermeyer, the assistant commissioner in charge of
regulation in New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection,
said that the letter was meant to show a unified front.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota said he planned to offer to meet with officials from other
states to discuss the city's plans with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I meet with these various different environmental
protection secretaries,'' he said, ``I'm not sure exactly what is
motivating this letter.''

SEATTLE TIMES DECIDES TO PUBLISH IN MORNING 
CNN'S IDEA TO TEAM UP WITH NETWORKS STALLS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seattle, a city where business warfare tends to be in the
high-technology sector, is girding itself this time for a newspaper
war, one that could make economic winners out of both the winner
and the loser. In an agreement announced last week, The Seattle
Times, an afternoon paper, said it expects to switch to morning
publication, going head-to-head with The Seattle
Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon Times already outpaces The Post-Intelligencer in
daily circulation, 228,000 to 196,000 _ no mean feat, given that
the rise of television news adversely affected evening papers more
than morning ones.
</P>
<P>
   The two newsrooms are competitive on beats from crime to
aviation. The Times' reporters have gotten more national
recognition, winning three Pulitzer Prizes since 1990. David
Brewster, who founded The Seattle Weekly, the city's alternative
weekly newspaper, said that The Post-Intelligencer boasts Seattle's
leading sports columnist and ``has done better at breaking news'' _
a contention that Frank A. Blethen, The Times' publisher, said is
``a totally bad rap.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, the newspapers have been part of a joint operating
agreement _ an arrangement common in the industry, in which
separate papers in a city collaborate on many business and
production operations to save money. The family of Alden Blethen,
who bought The Times in 1896, owns 51 percent of that newspaper;
Knight Ridder owns 49 percent. The Times runs the joint business
operation and gets 68 percent of the profits. Hearst Corp., owner
of The Post-Intelligencer, gets the remaining 32 percent. (They
publish jointly on Sundays.)
</P>
<P>
   A major expense was looming, however. Traffic congestion was
making it harder for The Times, printed north of the city, to reach
subscribers in the south. New presses south of Seattle would cost
$150 million, Blethen said, and would cut into everyone's profits.
</P>
<P>
   With careful scheduling, the four presses in the plant to the
north could print both newspapers overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Blethen also noted that the newspapers face competition from The
Everett Herald (owned by The Washington Post Co.) in the north and
The Tacoma News-Tribune (owned by McClatchy Newspapers Inc.) in the
south, and that the Seattle newspapers can better compete if both
are published in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   So the parent companies have asked the justice department to
allow morning publication of The Times within two years. Hearst's
share of the profits would increase to 40 percent and it would have
the first right to buy The Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being characterized as a good old-fashioned newspaper
war,'' said Brewster. ``But the P-I goes to battle with civil war
rifles.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also permits The Post-Intelligencer to set up an
Internet site to compete with The Times' site. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CNN'S IDEA TO TEAM UP WITH NETWORKS STALLS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year CNN talked with the major networks about combining
news operations, the idea being that the news channel's
news-gathering infrastructure would help the ailing networks to
save costs.
</P>
<P>
   Has there been any progress? At a news briefing last week,
Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner, indicated that nothing is
imminent. In general, he said, a deal like this, is ``very hard to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Little psychodramas take place,'' he said. He added, ``I can't
give you any optimism that it will occur.''

SHIFT BY PATAKI ON BUDGET FORM SETS OFF ANGER IN LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALBANY _ Seeking to trump the Legislature in the constant
struggle over control of the budget, Gov. George E. Pataki has
significantly altered the way his proposed budget is drafted. The
new approach would make it far more difficult for the legislature
to make changes, and lawmakers, who were already distrustful of the
governor, are furious.
</P>
<P>
   Many legislators, Republican and Democratic, say what the
Republican governor did is illegal, and there is talk among the
Democrats of court action. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a
Manhattan Democrat, termed it ``an unconstitutional power grab.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators are in a quandary over how to proceed. They are in a
sort of legal Bermuda Triangle, their every option lying in
uncharted and dangerous waters. They say it will take months, if
not years, to sort out the legalities, guaranteeing another late
budget.
</P>
<P>
   And another outcome is all but guaranteed: that New York's
chronically slow, bitter and arcane budget process will become even
slower, more bitter and more arcane.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanically, all Pataki did was submit one budget bill instead
of eight, combining spending line items with language explaining in
detail how the money is to be used. At a news conference last week,
he said he made the change because ``we want to have the entire
budget in context so that we're not presented with pieces of the
budget.'' If it created a problem for the legislature, he said, he
would consider making changes, but his aides said he did not mean
he would retreat on the issue that was at the core of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Those aides, speaking on the condition of anonymity, describe
the packaging of the budget as a masterstroke that hobbles the
legislature and greatly increases the governor's power.
</P>
<P>
   A year after lawmakers congratulated themselves for making the
budget process faster and friendlier, it seems to some that a new
way has been found to muck it up. Pataki's actions, legislators
say, have thrown sand into the already rough gears of his
relationship with the legislature. Even his Republican allies have
been open in their displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   The State Senate majority leader. Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican
from Rensselaer County, would go no further in public than to say
that what the governor did was ``problematic.'' But aides say that
privately, he is livid.
</P>
<P>
   Other Senate Republicans have been less restrained. ``I think it
threatens to undermine the entire process,'' said Sen. Nicholas A.
Spano of Yonkers. ``I just hope the governor will recognize how
insidious this is and address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the tension is the belief, held by many legislators
in both parties, that Pataki, who spent 10 years as a disgruntled
member of the legislature, holds the institution in contempt. That
sense was reinforced when the governor released a proposed budget
on Jan. 27 that reneged on a 1997 deal to provide money for
prekindergarten classes and other school programs for very young
children.
</P>
<P>
   And the wounds from last year's budget battle are still fresh.
After decades of budgets being negotiated in private by the
governor and the two legislative leaders, the legislature met
publicly last year in conference committees, with dozens of
legislators working out a budget, largely independent of Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The new process was hailed as more open and democratic, and
produced a budget just nine days late, the closest to being on time
in five years. But it also freed the governor from any obligation
to the result, and he vetoed 1,300 spending items totaling more
than $1 billion, angering many legislators.
</P>
<P>
   As if more fuel were needed for this fire, this year, for the
first time, legislators will go unpaid if the budget is late. The
law that gave them a 38 percent pay raise last month provided that
if there was no budget by the April 1 start of the state's fiscal
year, legislators would not be paid until a budget was passed, at
which point the withheld salaries would be paid in a lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to legislators' bank accounts is quite real. The
state has not had an on-time budget in 15 years, and several recent
budgets have been two to four months overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on what have traditionally been two types of
budget bills. The appropriations bills contain all the spending
items and some related text. The ``language bills'' set out, in
detail, how the money will be spent in each program. New York's
budget, far more than other states', is freighted with such policy
language, one reason its budget negotiations are so difficult and
protracted.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an appropriations bill sets state spending on aid
to schools, or on Medicaid payments to hospitals. But a language
bill contains the all-important formulas for determining how much
each school district and each hospital receive. Tradition also
dictated that the budget was broken down into four broad areas,
with two bills in each category, for a total of eight bills.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pataki submitted a single bill this year, weaving all
the policy language and all the subject areas into a 596-page
appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   State courts have ruled that the legislature cannot alter the
language in an appropriations bill, it can only change the numbers.
That means that if the legislature accepts the governor's bills as
presented, it would be barred from changing the formulas for school
aid or hospital payments, and myriad other areas it has always had
a hand in.
</P>
<P>
   In the not-too-distant past, it would not have mattered. The
governor would have negotiated both the numbers and the policies
with legislative leaders, then submitted a new set of bills to
reflect their compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Democrats contend that stuffing all the text into an
appropriations bill violates the state constitution, and some
Senate Republicans agree. Bruno, the Senate leader, said his
lawyers were examining that question, and he asked the governor to
submit a new set of bills along the old lines.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders say they are not sure whether the
constitution allows them to substitute their own budget bills for
the governor's _ something that has never been tried before _ or
whether they must work from his bills.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the legislature can act on its own budget bills, that
presents two problems.
</P>
<P>
   First, the constitution appears to require that the legislature
vote to reject Pataki's budget before moving on to its own, an act
of defiance for which the Senate Republican may not be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the legislature is ill equipped to draft a budget from
scratch. The governor's Division of the Budget has 350 people who
spend months drawing up the annual spending plan. With a much
smaller budget staff and a late start, it would be all but
impossible for the legislature to come anywhere near meeting the
April 1 deadline.

`TURBO-CAPITALISM': SIDE EFFECTS OF THE GROWTH OF WEALTH
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the term ``turbo-capitalism,'' Edward Luttwak means
turbocharged capitalism, or the state of today's American economy,
which has been ``unleashed by the abolition of anti-competition
laws and regulations left over from the 1930s, by the technological
innovations thus allowed, by the privatization of whatever could be
privatized, and by the removal of most import barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Turbo-capitalism has been sweeping the world since the 1970s,
Luttwak says, when, first in the United States and then in Britain,
it replaced the controlled capitalism that had been in place since
the Great Depression of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   It has resulted from spectacular gains in productivity brought
on by the computer revolution, and it has made many people very
rich. But has it been a good thing for society as a whole? This is
the question debated engagingly in ``Turbo-Capitalism'' by Luttwak,
a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington and the author of numerous books on military
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Turbo-capitalism has worked thus far in the United States for
two reasons, Luttwak argues somewhat mordantly. The first reason is
the American legal system, which protects turbo-capitalism from the
kind of corruption it suffered last year in Indonesia, South Korea,
Malaysia and Thailand. The second reason is the invisible but
lingering influence of Calvinism.
</P>
<P>
   In what is perhaps the liveliest section of his book, Luttwak
explains that three Calvinist rules shape ``both everyday choices
and fundamental attitudes'' in American life.
</P>
<P>
   Rule One is for the winners and dictates that wealth is not only
praiseworthy but a sign of moral achievement as well. The only
catches are that you aren't allowed to enjoy it (witness the boring
food in most Caribbean resorts) and that you have to give it away.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Two is for the losers and, conversely to Rule One, holds
that ``failure is the result not of misfortune or injustice, but of
divine disfavor.'' Rule Two ``explains why the United States has
never had a significant socialist party: Losers blame themselves
rather than the system, they hate themselves instead of resenting
the winners.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Rule Three, it is for the non-Calvinists who reject Rule
Two, ``who are not paralyzed by guilt and who are too uneducated to
express their resentment legally.'' For them ``there is only one
possible form of expression: to break the law, by engaging in
criminal activities such as murder, armed robbery, violent assault,
rape and the smoking of marijuana in pipes or home-made
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Followers of Rule Three end up in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere in the world advanced turbo-capitalism won't work
so well, Luttwak predicts. That's why France and Japan have
rejected it in favor of controlled capitalism. For them, he adds,
economies exist to serve the needs of societies, not the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States the contradictions of turbo-capitalism are
increasingly evident. Using Microsoft Corp. as his benchmark,
Luttwak says that the new high-tech titans produce much capital but
relatively few new jobs. The rich get richer, but those driven out
of work by the computer revolution are forced to take lower-paying
service jobs. The unskilled they displace turn rationally to
criminal activity like drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting strains on society include the breakdown of
community, the return of poverty, an addiction to consumption, the
rise of debt and a ``destruction of authenticity'' that is evident
everywhere from medicine to sports to book publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turbo-capitalism'' is one of those books that offer the reader
perspectives on practically everything, often enough an unexpected
one. For instance, Luttwak argues that Russia successfully has made
the transition to a market economy, that ``the fat cows that yield
their abundant milk in advanced economies'' all began as ``lean and
hungry wolves ... seizing profitable market opportunities in any
way they could.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``the original entrepreneurs and investors become rich, the
wolf loses its fangs, gains weight and size, grows udders.''
</P>
<P>
   True, some of the book's arguments are a little pat. While
Luttwak's linking of unemployment and crime makes some sense, he
doesn't really prove the connection. It seems a shade far-fetched
to blame the insecurities produced by American turbo-capitalism for
the return of the death penalty, the movement against smoking, the
disapproval of topless bathing, the prohibition of pornography and
all forms of political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Still, much of what Luttwak writes makes sense, particularly his
discussions of industrial policy, or government assistance of
select industries (``The strongest argument for industrial policy
... is that the government of almost every advanced country already
has one''); of free trade as an ideology (``The god of the
market-worshippers that celebrate the glories of turbo-capitalism
is Adam Smith, but theirs is a devotion that crucially depends on
not reading him''), and of the prevalence these days of central
bankers who shun whatever is inflationary and worry not in the
least about its opposite, ``deflationary'' (which ``is heard as a
merely technical expression, not as a powerful condemnation of
over-restrictive fiscal and monetary policies that strangle growth,
and which in the 1930s brought about the Great Depression,
political chaos, dictatorships and war'').
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he offers no prescription for turbo-capitalism,
merely predicts that ``the wave of the future could be populism,''
the essence of which is always ``a revolt of the less educated
against elite rule, elite opinions, elite values and the elite's
consensus on how government and the economy should be run.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes: ``As compared to the slavery of the defunct
communist economies, dispiriting bureaucratic socialism and the
grotesque failures of nationalist economics, turbo-capitalism is
materially altogether superior, and morally at least not inferior,
in spite of all its corrosive effects on society, families and
culture itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet to accept its empire over every aspect of life, from art
to sport in addition to all forms of business, cannot be the
culminating achievement of human existence. Turbo-capitalism, too,
shall pass.''

EXPERIENCE AND DEFENSE LIFT JAZZ OVER YOUNGER LAKERS 
</HEADLINE>

   INGLEWOOD, CALIF. _ The Los Angeles Lakers remain prettier with
a springy Kobe Bryant drop-stepping for reverse layups and
Shaquille O'Neal bulling through the lane like a mountain on
wheels. But with a 100-91 victory Sunday, the Utah Jazz once more
showed that a plain team that plays tenacious defense with such
highlight unfriendly tactics as the pick-and-roll, still has the
best claim on the National Basketball Association's Western
Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   For three quarters, the Jazz showed its age and let the young
Lakers have their way. Bryant had popped for 12 mostly spectacular
points from all over the floor and O'Neal had rammed in 30 as he
knocked Greg Ostertag, Todd Fuller or whichever Jazz player got in
his way.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz also was showing the age and the miles of a
13-year-veteran, Karl Malone, and a 14-year veteran, John Stockton,
who had been forced back to work unprepared in this shortened
season. Malone, 35, took a wicked belly flop trying to handle one
pass and staggered down the floor trying to chase down another on a
fast break. The 36-year-old Stockton, meanwhile, was tentative
running the usually precise Utah offense and the Lakers had ridden
eight Jazz turnovers to a lead as big as 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still a four-quarter game, and when the horn sounded
for the final period, the duo showed emphatically that veteran also
means experienced, and plain may not be pretty but it is effective.
The two scored 26 of the Jazz's 30 points to continue Utah's
dominance over the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz did it the same way it swept the Lakers in the playoffs
last season, the same way that has kept the Jazz knocking at the
door of the NBA title _ by Malone placing his ample body in front
of Stockton's defender. By Stockton throwing a pass back to the
rolling Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We executed fairly well,'' said Utah Coach Jerry Sloan. ``We
ran the pick and roll and got fairly decent shots. John is the best
in the business at doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, further illustrating his team's lack, or outright
avoidance, of flair, Sloan explained the Jazz's philosophy behind
the fast break, which is the furthest thing from the youthful
Lakers' penchant for showmanship. ``We want to get layups when we
can,'' he said. ``When we run the floor we want the ball to be shot
as a layup.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone and Stockton began that clinic with 7 minutes 39 seconds
left in the game when the Jazz were down by 76-75. First Stockton
went the length of the court for a basic, banked layup. Then he
found Malone underneath, and again the forward used the glass. For
the rest of the period, no other Utah player would score as the
pair picked and rolled, hitting jumpers and layups as Stockton
finished with 26 points and Malone 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just played smarter than we did,'' said O'Neal, who
finished with 37 points and 14 rebounds but was just 2 of 6 in the
final period. ``They were more efficient with the ball than we
were. They were better than us.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bryant, who finished with 16-points and 12 rebounds,
seemed befuddled by Utah's approach to the game of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play us differently than any other team in the league,''
he said. ``They won't double us immediately. They dig in and play
old-style defense with their tough guys like Stockton and Malone.
They just hang around and hang around and then they go get you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Jazz locker room after the game, it was apparent why
there are questions about how long a team led by Malone and
Stockton can remain near the top of the league. Stockton sat as his
locker with bags of ice on his knees. Four feet away, Malone had
both of his feet planted in a cooler full of ice. ``We've been
hearing about how we're too old and too slow for years now,''
Malone said with a smile. ``But you still got to suit them up and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sloan is getting tired of the questions. Outside the locker
room, he lectured about how he played for eight years with the
Chicago Bulls on a team without a single Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no talent, and won 50 games a year,'' he said. ``We
played together in a system a long time. I've been answering the
too old question for six years now. What people don't understand is
that these guys have played a long time together. We as a team have
tried to put some fun back in the game of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned fun executed by old-fashioned players. Just ask
the Lakers. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S TIME TO PRAISE EWING, NOT BURY HIM
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the final, post-lockout dispatches were in,
Patrick Ewing was said to be 30 pounds overweight and his knees
were supposedly shot. Perceived to be out of shape and forever out
of touch with where the New York Knicks are headed, Ewing kept
getting the same inquiry over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   However it was couched, people wanted to know whether the
stubborn pride of the old warrior would get in the way of the
Knicks' hopes for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing as how they're off to an 0-2 start after Sunday's loss to
Miami at Madison Square Garden, title aspirations are off limits
Monday. But at least Cablevision's franchise center does not have
to be fitted for an artificial joint any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one person says something, then everyone else says
something,'' said Herb Williams, the 40-year-old reserve center and
Ewing's workout partner during the lockout. ``How many people were
actually up there in Westchester when he was working out? Now, when
people find out the facts, they say, `Well, maybe he's in better
shape than we thought he was.'''
</P>
<P>
   The guy who scored 24 points, grabbed 17 rebounds and outplayed
Alonzo Mourning was the same person who was believed to be extinct
the first day of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking was that a 36-year-old, 7-foot center calling for
the ball in the post was too old school for this sleek, new outfit.
He would have to wise up and take his pterodactyl wingspan back to
a bygone era, finally giving offensive freedom to Allan Houston,
Latrell Sprewell and whoever else wanted to take an occasional bad
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy tried to tell everyone that Ewing was still the
focal point of the offense, that some things would remain as they
have since 1985: the Knicks would go only as far as the most
proficient jump-shooting center in National Basketball Association
history could take them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now we will listen.
</P>
<P>
   He has still not completely recaptured his form, and there is a
huge question as to whether his old, tired bones can hold up on
consecutive nights. But after rehabilitating his broken shooting
wrist for much of the last year _ after playing Sunday in only his
fifth regular-season game in the past 10 months _ Ewing did not
look atrocious or particularly winded. He looked good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in shape,'' he said Sunday as he sat with ice packs
bandaged around his knees. ``I don't know where all that stuff came
from that I wasn't working out or doing the things I was supposed
to do to be in decent shape to start camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm in shape _ maybe not in shape to play 40-plus
minutes. But I feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sprewell continues to adjust and Houston asserts himself as
an All-Star, Ewing will have to share the scoring load. But the
Knicks will still often need to rely on him for no other reason
than there are simply too few quality centers in the Eastern
Conference for Ewing not to still have huge nights against teams
like Washington, Boston and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He is still much more skilled offensively than his Georgetown
brethren, Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, and only Rik Smits presents
real problems for him on defense.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, you wonder how much pounding he can take.
Charles Oakley's impact on Ewing's game is something the Knicks are
already feeling. Oakley was the enforcer who planted his forearm
into Mourning's back, thereby making it easy for Ewing to rotate on
defense and be more of a double-teaming, shot-blocking threat.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was so exhausted from banging bodies with his protege
Sunday that he missed a gimme layup with three seconds left. (He
didn't blow the game; the Knicks were down by 3 points at the
time.)
</P>
<P>
   The more Ewing has to match up with physical and active
7-footers, the less energy he has to knock down that patented
baseline fallaway. You wonder how long the Knicks can trot out an
itty-bitty frontline of Larry Johnson at power forward and Sprewell
at small forward before it will prove detrimental not only to
Ewing's game, but to the Knicks as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, one of the many things they were missing against
the Heat was that crazed dynamo off the bench who could score
points and wreak havoc moments after entering the game. Sad but
true: John Starks' No. 3 jersey was being sold for half price at
the team store on the Garden's second level.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Dennis Scott, who now wears the number, can shed a few
more pounds and become that player. Maybe the Knicks have to make
more radical adjustments. Either way, the problem is not a
ball-hogging center. Believe it or not, it never was.
</P>
<P>
   ``My timing is definitely coming,'' Ewing said. ``I had a couple
shots that I missed that I usually hit, but I'll make them next
time. I think my game is coming. I've been working extremely hard.
Not only last year, but this year. I feel fine right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of my wrist, I don't know if it will ever feel like
it did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Through two games, Ewing is averaging 20.5 points and 13.0
rebounds. That is not bad for an NBA player, much less one thought
to be a relic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He missed some shots today, and he should have had
30-something points,'' Williams said. ``But when he was going well,
they couldn't contain him. Let's face it: the Big Fella's still got
some skills.'' &QL;

TRIBUTE TO HAROLD ARLEN, ARCHITECT OF BLUE-EYED SOUL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In inaugurating its highly anticipated American
Songbook series, Lincoln Center couldn't have chosen more astutely
than to devote its first program to the music of Harold Arlen.
Within the pantheon of pre-rock songwriters the series was created
to celebrate, Arlen, who died in 1986, is probably the most
underappreciated composer as well the one most deeply connected to
contemporary pop.
</P>
<P>
   George Gershwin, with his famous blue notes is widely given the
lion's share of credit for fusing white and black strains of
American music into a transcendent urban sound. But Arlen, who
idolized Gershwin, carried the process much further with lusty
laments like ``I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues,'' ``Stormy
Weather'' and ``Blues in the Night,'' the forerunners of today's
arena-sized pop-soul showstoppers.
</P>
<P>
   An argument could be made that Arlen was the primary architect
of a hybrid style that, handed down through rock 'n' roll, earned
the nickname ``blue-eyed soul'' in the 1970s. His influence extends
all the way to Billy Joel whose swaggering ``New York State of
Mind'' is cut from the same melodic cloth as Arlen's ``Come Rain or
Come Shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's opening-night program at Alice Tully Hall brought a
formidable lineup of singers to the stage along with an orchestra
of some two dozen players. The sopranos Barbara Cook and Audra
McDonald, and the baritone Richard Muenz, who combine technical
mastery with enormous heart, are as good as it gets nowadays in the
realm of theatrical pop singing.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by the brassier belters Ken Page and Debbie
Gravitte (substituting for the ailing Maureen McGovern), and the
jazz bassist and singer Jay Leonhart. Late in the show, Diana Krall
more or less stole the evening with its only real jazz performance,
a stomping knockout rendition of ``I've Got the World on a String''
that had the impact of a lightning bolt.
</P>
<P>
   The format of American Songbook, which combines performances,
slides and narration (by the series' artistic director, Jonathan
Schwartz), is similar to that of the 92nd Street Y's long-running
Lyrics and Lyricists series. The main difference is the presence at
Alice Tully of a medium-size orchestra (conducted by Tony Monte).
</P>
<P>
   Except for Ms. Krall's riveting turn, Friday's concert was a
curiously staid affair marred by subtle but persistent acoustical
difficulties. Ms. McDonald's richly textured, dynamic mezzo-soprano
is one of the world's most thrilling voices. While her versions of
``It Was Written in the Stars,'' ``I Never Has Seen Snow'' and
``The Man That Got Away'' had passion and dramatic sweep, the weak,
trebly amplification diffused her singing, draining it of much of
its color and weight.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the brass-heavy orchestra (with an
anemic-sounding string section) continually threatened to drown her
out. Muenz's virile, courtly performances of ``It's a New World''
and ``Don't Like Goodbyes'' were similarly compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was the coarse, overly aggressive conducting
of Monte, who often seemed oblivious of the singer standing several
feet away. Things improved noticeably when Ms. Cook's musical
director, Wally Harper, took the podium to conduct her numbers,
including gorgeous, heart-rending versions of ``I Wonder What
Became of Me'' and ``I Had Myself a True Love.''
</P>
<P>
   But even then, the level of playing and conducting and
orchestral acoustics fell far below the standards set by Rob Fisher
and the Coffee Club Orchestra at City Center's Encores series.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz made an affably chatty host, but in sticking to insider
personal anecdotes and trivia about Arlen and avoiding any serious
discussion of his career, style and influence, he missed an
opportunity to say something meaningful and to give the evening a
firmer sense of direction. For the series to live up to its
potential (it continues next month with a Richard Rodgers program),
some fine-tuning is definitely in order.

COMMENTARY: TIME TO ATTACK THE RISE OF PHONY CORPORATE TAX
SHELTERS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FRED NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   Hey buddy, is your company tired of paying taxes? If so, I've
got a deal for you.
</P>
<P>
   With my tricks and strategies, we can slash your tax bill, no
matter how much money you're really making. Best of all, it won't
cost you a dime if I can't save you big bucks. It'll just cost you
30 percent of the amount you save.
</P>
<P>
   If you suspect somebody offering a deal like that just might be
abusing the tax laws, you are not alone. So does the Clinton
administration, which last week proposed doing something about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton proposal, buried deep in the budget sent to Congress
and not highlighted in the president's public statements, deals
with the very hot area of corporate tax shelters. Shelter
promoters, including the big accounting firms, are making lots of
money selling them to companies on the contingency basis described
above, and it appears that companies are saving lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   For most individuals, tax shelters vanished years ago, the
victims of tax reform and aggressive enforcement by the Internal
Revenue Service. But corporate shelters have been growing, and seem
to have been expanding at a rate far faster than the IRS can deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   At issue here are not the breaks Congress has intentionally put
into the law for certain companies and industries. Instead, these
tactics rely on interpretations of tax laws that range from dubious
to outrageous. One bit of paper shuffling lets companies buy assets
for, say, $10 million and then treat them as if they cost $50
million and take depreciation deductions for that amount. Such
transactions are used not to create real income for the company,
but to create phony tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters crave secrecy, relying on the fact that the IRS
does not audit most corporate returns, and may not notice some
maneuvers even if a return is audited. There are insurance
companies willing to guarantee the tax benefits, betting that an
effective audit is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   To keep things quiet, some promoters insist that companies get
legal opinions only from a law firm chosen by the promoter, not
from some other lawyer. They have good reason for the precautions:
one such gambit drew IRS fire last year when an outraged tax lawyer
blew the whistle in a letter to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the secrecy, enterprising journalists like Janet Novack
and Laura Saunders of Forbes have been able to report on some of
the strategies. But there no doubt are others that remain
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the government has fought such abuses one by one,
going to court to fight things it catches and asking Congress to
change or clarify the law if it appears the shelter promoter might
have a case. By the time one gambit is finished, however, ten more
seem to pop up. That is truer now than ever as derivative
securities are used by promoters.
</P>
<P>
   The actual strategies vary, but they often involve bringing in
foreign companies or tax-exempt organizations to conduct paper
transactions with the corporation saving on taxes. The entity that
does not pay taxes winds up with reported income _ but little cash
_ that would otherwise be taxable. The corporation gets a lot of
paper losses that can be deducted from real income.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the new government strategy: the penalties for taking
part in abusive shelters are increased, to as much as 40 percent of
the tax savings. In addition, anyone who is paid to give advice on
such a phony shelter is hit with an excise tax on that fee. And
counter-parties, such as foreign companies, will owe taxes if they
are found to have taken part in such deals. The idea is to make
penalties big enough that those contemplating getting involved in
abusive shelters think twice.
</P>
<P>
   This proposal should be included in any tax bill Congress
passes. It is needed not just for the money it might bring in, but
because the current situation leaves honest companies _ and honest
tax advisers _ at a competitive disadvantage. Those of us who must
pay taxes should be outraged if Congress fails to act.

`PAYBACK' PAYS OFF AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Moviegoers pulled out their wallets for
``Payback'' as Mel Gibson's action romp dominated at the nation's
multiplexes with an estimated $21.4 million at 2,720 theaters
during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The better-than-expected performance from Paramount's remake of
1967's ``Point Blank'' set a record for best opening on the first
weekend of February, easily topping the $18.6 million debut of
``Dante's Peak'' in 1997. Analysts said the results underscored the
drawing power of Gibson, who plays a double-crossed thief seeking
to get his $70,000 back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gibson's clout with audiences is unbelievable,'' said film
analyst Arthur Rockwell. ``There was some question whether this
movie would work because he's not playing a hero. But he's very
smart at choosing projects that are suited for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
noted that his firm's survey showed 85 percent of those attending
``Payback'' were drawn by Gibson. ``This proves some stars really
are worth what they're paid,'' said the analyst, who predicted
``Payback's'' final gross will be $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum also credited Paramount's promotional campaign with
effectively targeting moviegoers' strong interest in comedies.
``They made a very dark film seem light-hearted and did an
incredible job of getting people into theaters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' outgrossed the combined total of the next three
movies, led by previous winner ``She's All That'' with $11.8
million at 2,620 theaters. The romantic comedy, with a reported $11
million budget, has proven to be a potent profit-maker for Miramax
with $30.8 million in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's seventh weekend of ``Patch Adams'' finished a
distant third with $4.6 million at 2,725 sites to push its overall
total to $122.6 million, making it the 106th-highest domestic
grosser of all time. Paramount's fourth weekend of ``Varsity
Blues'' followed with $4 million at 2,364 screens to go past $44
million.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' reissue of ``Saving Private Ryan'' came in fifth
with $3.6 million at 1,027 theaters to push its cumulative take to
$194.6 million. The epic is already the 27th-highest domestic
grosser of all time and should receive a boost from expected
multiple Academy Award nominations, due out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's ninth weekend of ``Shakespeare in Love,'' also
expected to pick up multiple Oscar nominations, finished a close
sixth with $3.5 million at 833 theaters to go past $36 million.
Disney's seventh weekend of ``A Civil Action'' followed with $3.2
million at 2,031 screens and stands to see its grosses, now at
$51.8 million, climb significantly if it scores Oscar nominations
in key categories.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday holdovers took the next two slots with Sony's seventh
weekend of ``Stepmom'' taking $2.8 million at 2,358 theaters and
Warner Bros.' eighth weekend of ``You've Got Mail'' with $2.6
million at 2,016 screens to top the $111 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's only other major opening, 20th Century Fox's
romantic comedy ``Simply Irresistible,'' failed to live up to its
title with a disappointing $2.3 million at 1,359 theaters as
moviegoers mostly ignored the presence of ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' star Sarah Michelle Gellar in the lead role as a waitress
with magical powers.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said teen-agers did not respond to Gellar appearing in
a project in which she portrays a grown-up character. ``The poor
performance does not mean that teen films are on the decline,'' he
added, noting that Gellar's next film, ``Cruel Intentions,'' is
expected to generate solid business when Fox releases it in early
March.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Oscar hopeful ``The Thin Red Line'' came in 11th with $2
million at 1,643 theaters as the much-acclaimed war drama fell out
of the top 10 in its fourth weekend of wide release.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's prep school comedy ``Rushmore'' posted strong numbers
in 12th place with $1.8 million at only 103 theaters with more
theaters to be added this Friday. DreamWorks' eighth weekend of
``The Prince of Egypt'' also took in $1.8 million while playing in
1,663 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Overall grosses amounted to about $80 million, down slightly
from the same weekend a year ago when the eighth weekend of
``Titanic'' took in more than $23 million. ``The overall
performance this year continues to be pretty solid with good word
of mouth on most movies and something in almost every genre,''
Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Three potentially strong entries open Friday as studios try to
take advantage of a weekend including Valentine's Day on Sunday and
Presidents Day on Monday. The trio includes New Line's romantic
comedy ``Blast From the Past'' with Brendan Fraser falling in love
after being raised in a fallout shelter; Warner's romance ``Message
in a Bottle'' with Kevin Costner; and Disney's ``My Favorite
Martian'' with Christopher Lloyd.

1,000 RALLY TO CONDEMN SHOOTING BY POLICE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: With BC-NY-SUSPECT-SHOT) 
(jw) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chanting ``no justice, no peace'' and saying the time
may have come to ``fight back,'' almost 1,000 people staged an
angry rally Sunday on a snowy street in front of the Bronx home of
a 22-year-old merchant gunned down in a storm of 41 bullets by four
New York City police officers.
</P>
<P>
   While community leaders and politicians spoke to the crowd
through a microphone muffled by static, the voices and the outrage
of the demonstrators _ some of whom had traveled from Connecticut
and New Jersey _ came through loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Soaked and shivering, they said they had been moved to action by
the brutality of the incident last Thursday. The victim, Amadou
Diallo, who came to America more than two years ago from Guinea,
West Africa, was unarmed when he died and had never been in trouble
with the law. Like an echo, almost everyone interviewed said the
words, ``41 bullets,'' ``four officers,'' and ``one man dead.'' The
number of shots, as much as the shots themselves, defied
understanding, they said.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a sign that the incident could inflame racial tension in
the city, most of those interviewed said they believed that the
police officers had judged Diallo as a criminal because of the
color of his skin. The only white speaker, Kyle Waters, the lawyer
for Diallo's relatives, was shouted off the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd stood shoulder to shoulder and nearly filled the block
around 1157 Wheeler Ave., where Diallo lived and died as police
followed him through his front door. It is a worn, but well-kept
block of houses and low-rise apartment buildings that neighbors had
bragged about as a quiet, peaceful place _ until the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   At least two dozen police officers patrolled the area, posted at
the corners of the block and on the subway bridge overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions were high, and most people's voices were filled with
contempt. But the rally remained largely peaceful _ with several
dozen Muslims offering prayers to Allah and a group of Guineans
dancing around a drummer _ except for a flash of tension when half
a dozen police officers gathered around the perimeter of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the demonstrators rushed over and shouted at the
officers. A wall of protesters with calmer heads formed between the
angry mob and the police.

REVISIONS COLUMN: THE PRESENCE OF RACE IN POLITICALLY CORRECT
AMBIGUITY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I used to go out of my way not to write about race during Black
History Month. I suspect that lots of people treat it the way
football's nonfans treat the Super Bowl: They find all kinds of
ways to pay as little attention as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But here we are in 1999 with books about race, talk shows about
race, what is supposed to be a national dialogue on race and more
local rants and monologues than we know what to do with. Why does
so much of it come across as sleight-of-hand double talk?
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could pinpoint the moment when race rhetoricians
managed to merge the terms ``diversity'' and ``integration'' with
the idea of political correctness, which is usually defined as a
manipulative and hypocritical practice inimical to free expression
and deeply harmful to the health of a meritocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Take the debate about cross-racial or nontraditional casting in
the theater, in film and television or in public life. (Cheryl
Mills, the black lawyer who appeared before the Senate as a member
of President Clinton's legal team, is an example of this last.)
</P>
<P>
   When realism is the issue, the burden of proof tends to be
placed on the black character. I constantly read pieces or hear
conversations about nontraditional casting in which the typical
questions go: Would a black character really say that? Is it
realistic to see a mixed couple not talking about race? Isn't it a
little PC to make a black the head of the department? And sometimes
they are statements, not questions.
</P>
<P>
   We are inclined to measure ``realism'' by the limits of our own
experience. And if a person has had little or no experience with
blacks in these settings, then nearly everything is going to look
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard people comment wryly that much as they enjoy that
clever new television comedy ``Sports Night,'' it seems kind of PC
that the sports station's top producer, played by Robert Guillaume,
is black. (Did anyone say it was PC when he played a governor's
butler in ``Benson''? Just asking.)
</P>
<P>
   But all that has happened is that a figure who exists behind the
camera in real life, the figure of the black television producer,
has moved on screen and into the culture's sight lines. And it's
all too realistic that he is alone among his kind in the newsroom.
I doubt that there is a black journalist above the age of 40 who
hasn't been alone on the job, at least for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Guillaume's presence points up the peculiar absence of blacks
and other minority groups from workplaces in most major network
television comedies. The dramas can be so much better at
recognizing that blacks and whites do often work together and form
all sorts of relationships. Maybe most comedy writers aren't
comfortable with the notion that they could actually create
nonracial jokes and situations for nonwhite characters.
</P>
<P>
   What is even more puzzling is the absence of black culture on
mainstream shows (unless some otherwise masterful character
lip-syncs a few lines from a soul song to show off a funky inner
child). This is truly odd when it comes to shows for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   I like ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Dawson's Creek,'' with
their high school angst, wit and hormone-driven mood swings. But
given that even Time magazine recently proclaimed the United States
a hip-hop nation, is it possible to believe that someone in those
high schools isn't at least a gawking rap tourist?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the sign that our national conversation about political
correctness was getting pretty debased came in 1992 when Madonna's
controversial coffee-table book, ``Sex,'' was published, and some
reviewers wrote that all those photos of near-naked blacks,
Hispanics and Asians were PC.
</P>
<P>
   The earth moved. Where had I been, where had any of us been when
miscegenation and cross-racial _ call it erotica, call it
pornography _ became an emblem of social and political
priggishness? But all Madonna had done was mass market once-illicit
sexual fantasies and practices. That is not political correctness;
that's entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And since we're talking about mass-market sexual fantasies, let
us talk briefly about the Senate impeachment hearings. More than
one commentator accused President Clinton of cynically playing the
diversity card when he presented the Senate with a legal team that
included a white woman and a black woman in addition to the usual
white men.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to see cynical diversity ploys, what about that
band of Southern Republican congressmen, men like Bob Barr, Ed
Bryant, Asa Hutchinson and Lindsey Graham, running the gamut from
white supremacist connections worthy of the old-guard Dixiecrats to
vague but tender allusions to civil rights and the birth of a new
South?
</P>
<P>
   There has been so much calculation on all sides. Why did
Clinton's seem more noteworthy, even unnatural to some? Isn't it
that far too many of us _ and by ``us'' I mean Americans in a
heterogeneous society _ are still most at ease when work that we
consider important is done well by people exactly, or almost
exactly, like ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   This impulse to be happiest when our own kind excel is clearly
at the heart of all the culture wars going on now. There are the
literary canon quarrels. (Remember the furor over the Modern
Library list of the century's 100 best novels?) There are the
continuing debates over which group or sex has contributed what to
art or music.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz race wars are heating up. A typical battle erupted
recently in an article in The New York Times. The issue in dispute
was this: Is it fair to say that jazz was created largely by blacks
and based largely on black musical forms and techniques? Such a
claim, the writer argued, unjustly overlooked white musicians and
played down or simply ignored white musical influences.
</P>
<P>
   As long as we're stuck fighting these wars, let's try for a
clear sense of history, a clean use of language and as honest a
sense of our own biases and grievances as possible.
</P>
<P>
   If you study the history of jazz, several things are quite
clear. It is made up of multiple forms and influences; not only the
blues but ragtime and the 32-bar popular song. And it is filled
with paradoxes, from the voice that turns into a percussion
instrument to the drum that finds its own kind of bel canto line.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, its principal creators and innovators were black men
and women. (Don't forget, reader! Women's History Month begins on
March 1.) This does not mean that there weren't major white
creators as well as fine minor players. Some worked on their own,
some worked alongside black musicians, and they should all be
studied and enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   The American literary tradition can be seen as a kind of obverse
reflection of this jazz tradition. Most of its major artists and
innovators have been white men and women. And few would argue
anymore that there are not major black artists and compelling minor
ones who belong to this tradition and need to be studied and
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   None of us gets to be at the center of every story every time.
Coming to terms with this can go against one's deepest instincts
and traditions. It can take a lifetime. But it's the way we have to
live now.

STEWART DECLARED WINNER WHEN RAINS CANCEL FINAL ROUND
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH _ Payne Stewart won a golf tournament Sunday
without teeing off.
</P>
<P>
   Ending another bizarre year at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am, Stewart was declared the winner after rain forced
cancellation of the final round. It was the third time in four
years that the event has either been canceled or rain-shortened.
But instead of waiting until Monday, when more rain is expected,
PGA Tour officials ended the tournament, and Stewart's one-stroke
lead after three rounds became a one-stroke victory.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart finished at 10 under par for the 54-hole tournament
(206), one stroke ahead of Frank Lickliter and three strokes ahead
of Craig Stadler, who finished third. It was the first tour victory
for Stewart since 1995, and only his second victory since winning
the 1991 United States Open. So despite the circumstances, it was a
sunny day for Stewart, and he will have no mixed emotions about
cashing the $504,000 first-place check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie to you, it feels pretty good,'' said
Stewart. ``I wanted the opportunity to go out and prove to myself
that I could win in 72 holes. That's still a void I have to fill
this year. But I'm going to take this and run. It's not a tainted
victory. You come here knowing that the weather is liable to be
bad. And I was fortunate enough to be ahead after 54 holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lickliter was not as happy, but the second-place finish
represented the best of his career, and the $302,400 check will
help ease his disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to seeing what I could do out there,''
said Lickliter. ``I feel like I'm kind of a mudder, and I think the
rain and wind would have been to my advantage. I had no expectation
of this. I knew it might rain, but I wasn't expecting the
tournament to be called.''
</P>
<P>
   However, tournament officials felt they had no other choice,
considering the weather forecast and the condition of the
rain-soaked course. Final-round play began this morning, but it was
already raining, and standing water on the course forced play to be
suspended at 9:30 a.m., local time. Playing in the day's final
group, Stewart and Lickliter had yet to tee off.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain continued to fall, and as the course became even more
saturated, the decision became more obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a golf course that was unplayable,'' said Arvin Ginn,
the tour's tournament director. ``After studying all the forecasts,
we had the same scenario taking place again tomorrow. For the
tournament's sake, for the players, for everybody involved, it
would be useless to try for 72 holes. It seemed impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will fuel even more talk that the tournament should
be moved to later on the tour's West coast schedule, or to the
summer or fall. In 1996, the tournament was canceled by rain, and
last year, the final round of another abbreviated 54-hole
tournament was postponed until August.
</P>
<P>
   However, next year's tournament date is virtually locked in, and
2001 is probably the earliest that the date could be moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many factors to consider, like hotel accommodations,
and how it would impact businesses in the community,'' said R. J.
Harper, director of golf for Pebble Beach Company. ``Yes, there
have been discussions about moving the date. But we've had a
beautiful string of days here for about a month before now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while others discussed alternatives, Stewart discussed the
feeling of winning for the 10th time in his career. At age 42,
Stewart believes he can once again rise to the tour's highest
level, and his determination was clear when someone mentioned David
Duval, who has won nine times since October 1997. Duval finished
tied for 15th, but he made an eagle at No. 1 before play was
halted, and at that point, Duval was just five strokes behind
Stewart. Asked if seeing Duval's name on the leaderboard was scary,
Stewart did not flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was afraid of not being able to beat David Duval, then I
shouldn't tee it up,'' said Stewart, who clinched his victory
Saturday by making a birdie on his final hole, hitting a beautiful
5-iron approach shot from 185 yards to within 2 feet of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is the hottest player on tour, he is a world beater, a
nice guy, a friend of mine. But if I don't believe in my heart that
I can beat him, I need to look for another job, or retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be in position to win again, because I'm playing
good. I want to make the Ryder Cup team. I'm tired of getting beat.
That's why I have to do something to get Payne Stewart on the team.
And today was a stepping stone.''

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ If there's anything you hate worse than a
smart-aleck kid, it's a smart aleck pushing 40.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Jazz: Won't these guys ever go away?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not, but they're happy you asked, because if there's
anything they love more than defying the actuarial tables, it's
reminding the world how wrong it has been all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys have (called) us `old' for a long time,'' Karl Malone
teased reporters after the Jazz handled the the young Lakers 100-91
Sunday at the Forum in the second game of a season in which Los
Angeles is favored to take the NBA western crown from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way I'm aging,'' Malone said. ``Nice and slow.''
</P>
<P>
   He sat with both feet in a bucket of ice as he said that, so the
age thing isn't exactly a crock. But 28 points from the 35-year-old
Malone, 26 and 11 assists from the 36-year-old Stockton and another
steady afternoon's work by 35-year-old Jeff Hornacek were strong
arguments for eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
   Or cryogenics.
</P>
<P>
   After back-to-back losing trips to the NBA finals, with playoff
victories over the Lakers en route, this was going to be the year
the Jazz lost its edge.
</P>
<P>
   Its roster and the Lakers' were basically unchanged during the
long offseason, which is supposed to be good for the Lakers (older
and wiser, ho ho) and bad for the Jazz (older, period).
</P>
<P>
   Utah's lone nonrookie addition, Thurl Bailey, 37, served only to
add a wrinkle, pun intended.
</P>
<P>
   It was an offseason of un-Jazz-like angst all around.
</P>
<P>
   Malone took part-time work as an L.A. sports-talk radio host
during the lockout and, in one weird rant, vowed never to play for
the Jazz again because ``the pebble have been snatched from my
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a show (TV's old `Kung Fu'),'' Malone said Sunday
when somebody asked for a translation. Then he good-naturedly poked
the interrogator in the belly.
</P>
<P>
   Malone even mused during the lockout about playing for the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton got calls from friends wondering what's up with Karl.
Stockton said he left his teammate a phone message: ``I'm hearing
stuff and I want you to know I'm still with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton said he didn't worry _ either that Malone would play
for Utah or that he'd be the same Karl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he'd be ready to play,'' Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
   That took a leap of faith. Malone lifts weights in the offseason
but adheres to a no-basketball diet. He shoots squirrels but not
hoops. He believes it refreshes him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play basketball in the summer at all. Ever,'' he said
in the locker room Sunday, explaining his absence from informal
workouts with teammates.
</P>
<P>
   A few of those teammates were eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have joined us in the fall,'' Stockton cracked.
(They all laughed.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was a lapse of sanity that prompted his threat to leave
Utah, with which he's under contract through this season. Malone
said he wished he could have taken it all back immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers wish he never had.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz stood between them and the Chicago Bulls in '98 and it
could be the same in '99. The Lakers are 1-6 against Utah since
last March, and Malone was the leading Jazz scorer in all six
Lakers' losses.
</P>
<P>
   Forum fans were laying for the Jazz Sunday and the game started
promisingly. The Lakers built a 10-point second-quarter lead. Kobe
Bryant hit a long jumper and froze in his follow-through the way
Michael Jordan did when he beat the Jazz out of the title.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was in first-half foul trouble, so a Lakers fan held up a
sign: ``The Mailman Doesn't Deliver on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   This Mailman must have joined the private sector. He
pick-and-rolled to 19 points in the second half as the Jazz came
from behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Jazz meet three more times in the regular season.
And you just know they'll meet in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Jazz will break up? Don't count on it. Hornacek,
who had hinted about retirement, said Sunday he'll ``probably'' be
back after the short season. Hornacek expects Stockton will be back
and said Malone ``obviously'' will. And then the Jazz will be _
finally _ too old? Don't hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been answering that question for six years,'' coach Jerry
Sloan said of the age question. ``Karl and John (supposedly) `lost
a step' six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you see anything different?''
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything you hate worse than a wise guy, it's a wise
guy who's right.

SALT LAKE CITY RELATIONSHIPS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT OBJECTIVITY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ K. McCoy Livingston, a bookish flower seller
here who reveres history and loves to quote John Locke, the English
philosopher, on the burdens of liberty, bumped up against the
Olympics a few years back. It nearly broke him.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, known to all as Mac, discovered that one of the
small chain of florist shops he manages, called the Flower Patch,
was on a downtown block that had been selected as the site for a
$184 million, five-star hotel that was being built by a member of
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, Earl Holding, in anticipation
of a flood of visitors during the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while fighting in court to save his shop, Livingston found
in 1996 that the three local politicians who were being asked by
Holding to declare the area blighted _ and thus eligible for
tax-assisted redevelopment _ all had financial relationships with
Holding, who is one of Utah's wealthiest men. One had borrowed
money from a company controlled by Holding, and another's family
had recently sold a piece of land to Holding for the hotel project,
according to court documents. The third, Salt Lake's mayor, Deedee
Corradini, received more money from Holding for her 1995 mayoral
campaign ($12,000) than from any other donor, court documents
showed. Ms. Corradini was also a member of the organizing
committee. ``It was little old Flower Patch against the world _
that's what it amounted to,'' said Livingston's attorney, James R.
Boud.
</P>
<P>
   The Flower Patch had encountered what many people here call the
Web _ a seamless, often invisible network of economic and personal
relationships among Utah's leaders in business and politics that
quietly influences, if it doesn't quite control, much of the
state's economy and civic life. Experts in local history say the
roots of the Web probably go back to the Mormon pioneer days of the
1800s, when the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was
isolated, persecuted and driven west looking for refuge. For
generations, a distinctive economic and political culture evolved
that valued cohesiveness, cooperation and an internal focus on
using resources that were at hand.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, many residents, including some members of
the organizing committee, say those old patterns of
self-sufficiency just look like conflicts of interest. They say
that while the world's attention is directed at how Salt Lake City
got the Olympics, especially the payments and tuition programs for
International Olympic Committee members, it is how the Olympic
machine has worked on the local level _ how the money is spent, who
profits, and who decides _ that concerns people here as much or
more than the question of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corradini and the other officials involved in the hotel suit
all said that their dealings with Holding had not affected their
judgment on the hotel project, and a judge later ruled that no
state laws were violated. But the pattern _ relationships that
raise questions about objectivity _ is repeated on multiple levels
on the organizing committee's 33-member board, according to court
records, annual reports and federal Securities and Exchange
Commission filings. There are board members who have bid upon and
received multimillion-dollar contracts from the organizing
committee, notably Holding, who also owns the Snowbasin ski area,
the site of the men's and women's Olympic downhill events. There
are multiple layers beyond that of meshed financial interests _
businessmen who have sat on the organizing committee while at the
same time sitting on each other's corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a white male patriarchal system of authority,'' said Tim
Funk, a spokesman for the Salt Lake Impact 2002 and Beyond
Coalition, a group of religious and civic groups that has fought
for greater public and community representation on the organizing
committee. ``That system carries over into business culture and
into political culture. What it does is vest power and trust in a
very few people.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah has changed dramatically in recent years, especially with
the explosion of economic growth over the last decade that has
brought in many newcomers and outside businesses, especially in
computer technology. But dozens of people in business and politics
here say that the $1.45 billion effort to build the facilities for
the 2002 Winter Games has proven all over again how much the
clubby, insular world of the state's past endures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It left me very cynical,'' said Livingston, who ultimately
kept his flower shop, after Holding grew impatient with the
prolonged delays caused by the court fight and scaled back his
hotel project. The area was declared blighted by the city's
Redevelopment Authority, as Holding had requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal strategy succeeded, but it created a great void in
me as to my trust in government,'' Livingston said. The hotel,
which will be one of Salt Lake City's most expensive, is now under
construction and is expected to be the host hotel for the members
of the IOC during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the scandal over payments to IOC members,
however, even the Web may change. An internal Salt Lake City ethics
panel report scheduled for release here on Tuesday, about how the
city won its Olympic bid, is also expected to address issues about
the organizing committee's structure and local contracting since
then. Utah Gov. Michael O. Leavitt said last week at a news
conference that the questions about bribery have created a need and
an opportunity to ``rethink the whole process'' of how the
committee works.  &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Holding declined repeated requests for an interview. A
spokesman, Clint W. Ensign, said that all of the organizing
committee's ethics guidelines had been followed, and that Holding
had recused himself from voting on any matter that affected him. A
spokesman for the organizing committee, Frank Zang, also said that
any contract affecting a committee member was routinely monitored
and assessed for ethical violations or conflicts of interest during
the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   But the interrelated economic interests of the committee
members, whether or not they affected the work of the committee in
awarding its contracts, are unquestionably real, and unquestionably
complicated. Figuring out who is linked to whom is like looking at
a diagram of a complex football play in which everyone is in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of the period in which the major contracts were
signed by the committee, G. Frank Joklik, the committee's acting
president, was also chairman of a gold exploration company partly
owned by Ian M. Cumming, who owns the Park City ski resort, where
about 40 percent of the 2002 Winter Games will be held, according
to the most recent SEC filings through late last year. Two other
committee members are also linked to Cumming through their
employment or membership on the board of the company that owns Park
City.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik and another organizing committee board member, James C.
Beardall, in turn were sitting on the board of directors of the
First Security Corp., whose chairman and chief executive officer,
Spencer F. Eccles, is also on the organizing committee board. First
Security, one of the state's largest banks, has done extensive
business with the organizing committee. Eccles and Robert H. Garff,
the organizing committee's chairman, in turn have both had seats on
the board of Intermountain Health Care, a large not-for-profit
medical provider, according to the SEC filings. The president of
IHC, as it is known, also sits on the board of First Security. Last
October, IHC was awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to provide
health and medical care for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the organizing committee's board, Alan Layton,
who is president of Layton Construction Co., received a contract to
oversee construction of a $24 million roof over the arena where the
Olympic speed skating is to take place. Layton said in an interview
that he had followed all the required ethics procedures, and that
he also rejects the idea that the Olympic effort is compromised by
relationships between the strongest businesses in a community, as
long as a policy is followed. ``The board met, and I read a
statement that I have not spoken to any member about the contract,
and I will respect your decision,'' Layton said.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest controversy over the contracts and local
projects has involved Holding's Snowbasin ski resort. In 1996,
federal legislation was passed _ led by Utah's Congressional
delegation _ giving Holding private title to about 1,300 acres of
undeveloped public forest land near his resort, in exchange for
land he owns elsewhere in the state that will be transferred to
public ownership. Holding also got the federal government to agree
to build a road at taxpayer expense, with an estimated cost of $12
million to $15 million, across the newly private land. And he
received a contract from the organizing committee that will pay him
upwards of $13 million in compensation for using his resort during
the Winter Games. Holding in turn will invest about $73 million of
his money for improvements like new ski lifts to the resort's
summit for the men's downhill course. He also plans to build
condominiums on the newly private land after the Olympics are over.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbasin's general manager, Gray Reynolds, said he believed the
Olympics, and the pressure to get competition sites prepared in
time, acted as a catalyst in moving ahead discussions for the land
exchange that Holding and the Forest Service had been conducting
for years. Reynolds, who was the No. 2 official at the Forest
Service until his retirement in 1996, testified in Congress on
behalf of the land exchange. He said that the offer to come to work
for Holding came only after his retirement, after more than 30
years at the agency, and that he had checked with government ethics
officials before accepting.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the organizing committee said that the
Snowbasin contracts troubled them not so much because improprieties
or illegalities have been exposed, but because the various
agreements have created the appearance _ and, indeed, the reality _
that the Olympics will stand to make one resort vastly more
valuable than it was before, in part because the new road will
shorten the trip to Salt Lake City's airport, and will make one
already wealthy member of the local organizing committee much
richer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to do business with the organizing committee,
then they ought to get off it,'' said Kenneth Bullock, the
executive director of the Utah League of Cities and Towns and a
member of the organizing committee's board of trustees. ``It's as
simple as that.''  &QL;

LAKERS STYMIED ONCE AGAIN BY UTAH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Now we know for sure: If the Western
Conference finals last May had been a best-of-eight series, the
Lakers would have been swept in five.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Lakers failed to learn in their 0-4 collapse to
Utah in the 1998 playoffs, they still haven't learned, despite
having the longest offseason in NBA history to ponder their
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   So the Jazz, whose stars are as old as Yoda, and certainly as
wise in their on-court execution, once again shoved their
experience down the Lakers' youthful windpipes in a 100-91 victory
Sunday at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we finally think that we learned our lesson, there's
always something else that you gotta learn. There's always
something they hit you in the chin with,'' said Lakers swingman
Kobe Bryant. ``And it's bad, but it's a good thing, because we have
such a talented team that the more you learn, the better it's gonna
make you.''
</P>
<P>
   So there's the positive spin, but the rest was hard for the
Lakers to digest. They've been fed this stale meal too many times
before, in two straight postseason exits, and far too many times
since last spring. Going back to early March and counting the
playoffs, the Lakers are 1-6 against the Jazz, 29-4 against
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   And if you weren't paying attention and didn't realize the
lockout was over, you might have mistaken Sunday's NBC-televised
game for a rerun used to fill air time.
</P>
<P>
   There, again, was Karl Malone, abusing the Lakers for 11 points
in the pivotal fourth quarter, and running mate John Stockton,
scoreless in the third, putting up 16 points in the final 7:39 of
the game. There too were the Lakers, relying too much on Shaquille
O'Neal, whose 37 points and 14 rebounds were insufficient, just as
his gaudy statistics were so many months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I was sitting over there (on the bench) with the same
feeling, like, here we go again,'' said guard Derek Fisher. ``It
seems like they dominate us, but. . . the game is always up in the
air with four minutes to go. And because of their experience and
how smart they play the game, they utilize that four minutes better
than any team in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for the better part of the first half, the Lakers were
in command of this game, with as much as a 13-point lead late in
the second quarter. But the Jazz, down 47-42 at halftime, turned
the game around in the third quarter on the strength of Bryon
Russell's 12 points and another eight from Malone, who finished
with 28.
</P>
<P>
   It was a one-point game in favor of Utah to open the fourth, but
the Lakers seemed to have nothing left. They took their last lead,
76-75, on a free throw by O'Neal with 7:20 left, then were
outscored 12-1 over the next three minutes to go down by 10. All 12
points in the run were from Stockton and Malone.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers never got closer than seven points the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if, once again, the Jazz knew exactly what to do, how
to do it and precisely at what moment they would rip the Lakers'
hearts out and toss them into the loge section. As if the Jazz can
put the Lakers back in their place at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not gonna say that,'' Malone said, ``but we like our
chances down the stretch as a veteran team. . . . We realize down
the stretch we have the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, who shot 38.8 percent, it's back to pondering
what went wrong _ again _ with an opportunity to reverse the trend
a few weeks hence, March 7 at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   But if this was the Lakers' fifth straight confounding loss to
the Jazz, it was just game two of the 1999 season to Lakers coach
Del Harris, who insisted the defeat was simply one day's failure,
nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that anybody that's gonna cancel their season tickets
are a little premature,'' he said. ``We played the team that's
played for the championship the last two years, we had a good game
with them, they beat us. It's that simple. But a lot of people
major in overreacting, so what am I going to do to change human
nature?''

WRECKAGE BELIEVED TO BE MISSING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PLANES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As he circled the crumpled wreckage atop Quail's
Peak in Joshua Tree National Monument, Matt Jackson felt sure it
contained the body of his longtime friend, San Fernando Valley
aviation entrepreneur and veteran pilot Bill Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities struggled to recover two bodies from the wrecked
pair of vintage T-28 military training planes on Sunday and had not
yet made an official identification of the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson and others in the San Fernando Valley aviation
community were already mourning Jones, a successful 72-year-old
businessman and vintage airplane aficionado from the suburban Los
Angeles community of Northridge in the city's San Fernando Valley
northwest of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a father to me,'' said Jackson, who set out in bad
weather to look for his friend and the other pilot after they
failed to arrive at their destination on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved aviation. He started buying and collecting war
birds,'' Jackson said. ``He had everything from a P-51 Mustang to
the T-28 he was killed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite bad weather and pleas from friends to wait for better
flying conditions, Jones and a friend from Seattle, whose name was
not available on Sunday, left Van Nuys Airport in the San Fernando
Valley community of Van Nuys in their T-28 planes about 12:30 p.m.
on Thursday, Jackson said. They were headed to Thermal, Calif., for
an annual gathering of T-28 owners but never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Search efforts on Friday were hampered by poor weather, but at
8:30 a.m. on Saturday, Civil Air Patrol pilots locked on to a
distress beacon and found both mangled aircraft atop Quail Peak, a
5,813-foot mountain in the Riverside County section of Joshua Tree
National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``They died on impact,'' said Jackson, who called Jones' family
Saturday while circling the crash site to tell them the sad news.
``They hit 50 feet from the top of the mountain and skidded right
up to the peak. It's very unfortunate. They came real close to
making it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of flying experience,'' said pilot Pete Regina,
who knew Jones for more than two decades. ``It just surprised
everybody that this happened. These weather-related accidents are
just terrible. You just get up into clouds where you can't see, and
in those kind of planes things happen so fast, it's over in
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, investigators from the National Transportation Safety
Board hiked up to the crash site to begin the long process of
determining what caused the crash, said Jerry Acosta of the Federal
Aviation Administration's Regional Operating Center. ``The wreckage
is in very rough and ragged terrain,'' Acosta said. ``It's very
difficult to get access to the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash remains under investigation, but many
local pilots believe Jones, flying lead, and his friend crashed
while trying to fly below the rough weather. A low cloud ceiling
probably obscured Quail Peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody told him not to go,'' Jackson said. ``He just went
up the wrong canyon. It was a box canyon, and they just flew into
the side of the mountain. You've just got to be very, very careful.
These planes we are flying are high-performance aircraft, and you
have very little time to react.''
</P>
<P>
   The T-28 Trojan first went into production in 1948 and was the
primary basic trainer for both the U.S. Air Force and the Navy. The
planes that crashed on Thursday were built in 1955 and 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The tail number on one of the crashed aircraft -- N128BJ -- was
registered to Aircraft Cylinder and Turbine Inc., an engine
overhaul business in the San Fernando Valley community of Sun
Valley that Bill Jones started three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Jones recently turned over the business to his son,
Wayne, and began pursuing his hobby of collecting and flying
vintage airplanes full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jones had a commercial pilot's license and thousands of
hours in the cockpits of many airplanes, including his L39
Albatross, a Czechoslovakian jet.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Burbank, Calif., Jones served as a merchant marine in
World War II, Jackson said. After the war, he made a fortune in
real estate and ran several successful companies, including
Technical Heaters, which is run by his other son, Bruce Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jones is survived by his wife, Darlene, his sons and
several grandchildren. The family was grieving in private on Sunday
and asked not to be disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably the kindest, gentlest human being I'll ever
meet,'' Jackson said. ``Because of his financial wealth, he just
helped everybody he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Regina agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a prince,'' he sighed. ``A real sweetheart.'

UCLA HAS GREAT DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM INGHRAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pitching coach Tim Leary said it was the best two
games he has seen since coming to UCLAthree years ago. Head coach
Gary Adams, in his 25th year, said it was the best he has seen in
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Both were appreciative of the fact the Bruins took two out of
three from a solid Georgia Tech team, concluding the series with a
6-1 victory Sunday at Jackie Robinson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In posting consecutive victories, the Bruins (4-5) used equal
parts pitching, offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, UCLA beat the Yellow Jackets 12-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia Tech is a very good team,'' said Adams. ``They are
going to be in the NCAA playoffs, but when you pitch well, hit well
and play good defense, you're going to win some games. Beating them
is very big for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins starter Jon Brandt was 1-0 with a 3.65 ERA entering the
game but had a bad outing in his last start in an 8-6 loss to
Pepperdine on Tuesday. Sunday, he shrugged it off and limited the
hard-hitting Yellow Jackets to one run on three hits while striking
out six. He walked seven but didn't let it hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday I gave the game away,'' said Brandt, a sophomore from
Palo Alto. ``I feel like I let my teammates down, so to come back
and pitch well today is a big boost for my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt did his best work in the fifth, when he wriggled out of
bases loaded jam to preserve a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech (2-4) had loaded the bases with one out on a walk,
double and an intentional walk. Scheduled to hit was clean-up
batter Eric McQueen. McQueen, a senior from Winder, Ga., has 11
grand slams in his career. He worked the count to 3-1 before Brandt
buzzed a fastball down the middle for strike two, then induced a
sharp grounder that shortstop Jack Santora turned into a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curve ball has always been my pitch,'' Brandt said. ``I'm
not very overpowering and in situations like that the coaches
always tell you to go with your best pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   McQueen appeared out in front and slipped a bit coming out of
the box. It allowed Chase Utley's relay to first baseman Garrett
Atkins to nip him by a slim margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't shake off (catcher) Jason (Green),'' Brandt said.
``He must have thought it was a fastball coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt walked the first two batters in the sixth but used a
force play and two strikeouts to get out of the inning. He was
relived by Dan Keller, who pitched the final three innings,
allowing no runs, three hits and striking out one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon struggled a couple of times,'' said Leary, ``but he
regrouped and made the pitches he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA scored single runs in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings
and broke the game open with a three-run seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Utley homered to right field, with two outs. Atkins singled and
Bill Scott (Alemany High) hit a mammoth home run at least 420 feet
that appeared to be rising as it cleared the fence in left-center
field.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has today off and travels to UC Santa Barbara for a game
Tuesday at 2 p.m.

SALT LAKE CITY RELATIONSHIPS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT OBJECTIVITY

(Subs to add art note)  (ART ADV: Photo of Livingston at his flower shop is being sent to
NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by

 By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ K. McCoy Livingston, a bookish flower seller
here who reveres history and loves to quote John Locke, the English
philosopher, on the burdens of liberty, bumped up against the
Olympics a few years back. It nearly broke him.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, known to all as Mac, discovered that one of the
small chain of florist shops he manages, called the Flower Patch,
was on a downtown block that had been selected as the site for a
$184 million, five-star hotel that was being built by a member of
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, Earl Holding, in anticipation
of a flood of visitors during the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while fighting in court to save his shop, Livingston found
in 1996 that the three local politicians who were being asked by
Holding to declare the area blighted _ and thus eligible for
tax-assisted redevelopment _ all had financial relationships with
Holding, who is one of Utah's wealthiest men. One had borrowed
money from a company controlled by Holding, and another's family
had recently sold a piece of land to Holding for the hotel project,
according to court documents. The third, Salt Lake's mayor, Deedee
Corradini, received more money from Holding for her 1995 mayoral
campaign ($12,000) than from any other donor, court documents
showed. Ms. Corradini was also a member of the organizing
committee. ``It was little old Flower Patch against the world _
that's what it amounted to,'' said Livingston's attorney, James R.
Boud.
</P>
<P>
   The Flower Patch had encountered what many people here call the
Web _ a seamless, often invisible network of economic and personal
relationships among Utah's leaders in business and politics that
quietly influences, if it doesn't quite control, much of the
state's economy and civic life. Experts in local history say the
roots of the Web probably go back to the Mormon pioneer days of the
1800s, when the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was
isolated, persecuted and driven west looking for refuge. For
generations, a distinctive economic and political culture evolved
that valued cohesiveness, cooperation and an internal focus on
using resources that were at hand.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, many residents, including some members of
the organizing committee, say those old patterns of
self-sufficiency just look like conflicts of interest. They say
that while the world's attention is directed at how Salt Lake City
got the Olympics, especially the payments and tuition programs for
International Olympic Committee members, it is how the Olympic
machine has worked on the local level _ how the money is spent, who
profits, and who decides _ that concerns people here as much or
more than the question of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corradini and the other officials involved in the hotel suit
all said that their dealings with Holding had not affected their
judgment on the hotel project, and a judge later ruled that no
state laws were violated. But the pattern _ relationships that
raise questions about objectivity _ is repeated on multiple levels
on the organizing committee's 33-member board, according to court
records, annual reports and federal Securities and Exchange
Commission filings. There are board members who have bid upon and
received multimillion-dollar contracts from the organizing
committee, notably Holding, who also owns the Snowbasin ski area,
the site of the men's and women's Olympic downhill events. There
are multiple layers beyond that of meshed financial interests _
businessmen who have sat on the organizing committee while at the
same time sitting on each other's corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a white male patriarchal system of authority,'' said Tim
Funk, a spokesman for the Salt Lake Impact 2002 and Beyond
Coalition, a group of religious and civic groups that has fought
for greater public and community representation on the organizing
committee. ``That system carries over into business culture and
into political culture. What it does is vest power and trust in a
very few people.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah has changed dramatically in recent years, especially with
the explosion of economic growth over the last decade that has
brought in many newcomers and outside businesses, especially in
computer technology. But dozens of people in business and politics
here say that the $1.45 billion effort to build the facilities for
the 2002 Winter Games has proven all over again how much the
clubby, insular world of the state's past endures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It left me very cynical,'' said Livingston, who ultimately
kept his flower shop, after Holding grew impatient with the
prolonged delays caused by the court fight and scaled back his
hotel project. The area was declared blighted by the city's
Redevelopment Authority, as Holding had requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal strategy succeeded, but it created a great void in
me as to my trust in government,'' Livingston said. The hotel,
which will be one of Salt Lake City's most expensive, is now under
construction and is expected to be the host hotel for the members
of the IOC during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the scandal over payments to IOC members,
however, even the Web may change. An internal Salt Lake City ethics
panel report scheduled for release here on Tuesday, about how the
city won its Olympic bid, is also expected to address issues about
the organizing committee's structure and local contracting since
then. Utah Gov. Michael O. Leavitt said last week at a news
conference that the questions about bribery have created a need and
an opportunity to ``rethink the whole process'' of how the
committee works.  &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Holding declined repeated requests for an interview. A
spokesman, Clint W. Ensign, said that all of the organizing
committee's ethics guidelines had been followed, and that Holding
had recused himself from voting on any matter that affected him. A
spokesman for the organizing committee, Frank Zang, also said that
any contract affecting a committee member was routinely monitored
and assessed for ethical violations or conflicts of interest during
the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   But the interrelated economic interests of the committee
members, whether or not they affected the work of the committee in
awarding its contracts, are unquestionably real, and unquestionably
complicated. Figuring out who is linked to whom is like looking at
a diagram of a complex football play in which everyone is in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of the period in which the major contracts were
signed by the committee, G. Frank Joklik, the committee's acting
president, was also chairman of a gold exploration company partly
owned by Ian M. Cumming, who owns the Park City ski resort, where
about 40 percent of the 2002 Winter Games will be held, according
to the most recent SEC filings through late last year. Two other
committee members are also linked to Cumming through their
employment or membership on the board of the company that owns Park
City.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik and another organizing committee board member, James C.
Beardall, in turn were sitting on the board of directors of the
First Security Corp., whose chairman and chief executive officer,
Spencer F. Eccles, is also on the organizing committee board. First
Security, one of the state's largest banks, has done extensive
business with the organizing committee. Eccles and Robert H. Garff,
the organizing committee's chairman, in turn have both had seats on
the board of Intermountain Health Care, a large not-for-profit
medical provider, according to the SEC filings. The president of
IHC, as it is known, also sits on the board of First Security. Last
October, IHC was awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to provide
health and medical care for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the organizing committee's board, Alan Layton,
who is president of Layton Construction Co., received a contract to
oversee construction of a $24 million roof over the arena where the
Olympic speed skating is to take place. Layton said in an interview
that he had followed all the required ethics procedures, and that
he also rejects the idea that the Olympic effort is compromised by
relationships between the strongest businesses in a community, as
long as a policy is followed. ``The board met, and I read a
statement that I have not spoken to any member about the contract,
and I will respect your decision,'' Layton said.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest controversy over the contracts and local
projects has involved Holding's Snowbasin ski resort. In 1996,
federal legislation was passed _ led by Utah's Congressional
delegation _ giving Holding private title to about 1,300 acres of
undeveloped public forest land near his resort, in exchange for
land he owns elsewhere in the state that will be transferred to
public ownership. Holding also got the federal government to agree
to build a road at taxpayer expense, with an estimated cost of $12
million to $15 million, across the newly private land. And he
received a contract from the organizing committee that will pay him
upwards of $13 million in compensation for using his resort during
the Winter Games. Holding in turn will invest about $73 million of
his money for improvements like new ski lifts to the resort's
summit for the men's downhill course. He also plans to build
condominiums on the newly private land after the Olympics are over.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbasin's general manager, Gray Reynolds, said he believed the
Olympics, and the pressure to get competition sites prepared in
time, acted as a catalyst in moving ahead discussions for the land
exchange that Holding and the Forest Service had been conducting
for years. Reynolds, who was the No. 2 official at the Forest
Service until his retirement in 1996, testified in Congress on
behalf of the land exchange. He said that the offer to come to work
for Holding came only after his retirement, after more than 30
years at the agency, and that he had checked with government ethics
officials before accepting.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the organizing committee said that the
Snowbasin contracts troubled them not so much because improprieties
or illegalities have been exposed, but because the various
agreements have created the appearance _ and, indeed, the reality _
that the Olympics will stand to make one resort vastly more
valuable than it was before, in part because the new road will
shorten the trip to Salt Lake City's airport, and will make one
already wealthy member of the local organizing committee much
richer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to do business with the organizing committee,
then they ought to get off it,'' said Kenneth Bullock, the
executive director of the Utah League of Cities and Towns and a
member of the organizing committee's board of trustees. ``It's as
simple as that.''  &QL;

FRESHMAN'S HOMER GIVES UT A SWEEP OF SOUTHERN CAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As the Southern California Trojans progressed
through a difficult weekend, they formed a distinct view of Texas'
220-pound freshman first baseman, Jeff Ontiveros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew from the get-go that he is clearly a talented, strong,
dangerous guy,'' said USC coach Mike Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   Ontiveros made unhappy prophets of the Trojans yesterday,
hitting a two-run ninth-inning home run to give the Longhorns (5-0)
an 8-7 victory and an three-game sweep of the defending national
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Inserted as a defensive replacement an inning earlier, Ontiveros
with one swing managed to stun the Trojans (1-3), electrify a
Disch-Falk Field crowd of 5,964 that included ``about 60 of my
relatives,'' and fulfill a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just sitting there in the dugout, telling my buddy,
\Rpitcher\S Kevin Frizzell, that I dreamed about doing that very
thing last night,'' Ontiveros said. ``It was a two-run homer that
won the game, except the pitch was a fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   In the real-life version, it was a change-up, and it was the
first pitch Ontiveros saw from reliever Steve Immel. Ontiveros hit
it 395 feet over the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Immel's best pitch,'' Gillespie said. ``But that kid sure
put a charge into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ontiveros also had a tip from the previous hitter, Jason Moore,
who ``told me not to look for a fastball because the guy wasn't
throwing any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, though, I'm not sure I got all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He got enough. Texas coach Augie Garrido was amazed and proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw that ball in the air, I said, `My, that's a
very strong person up there,''' Garrido said. ``That thing would
have gone out of any park in the country, including Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I figured he would do something like this, which is
why I put him in as a defensive replacement.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory went to left-hander Phil Seibel, who finished all
three games for the Longhorns and now has a victory and two saves
on the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bitter finish for the Trojans, who came in as the
top-ranked team in the nation and lost three games by a total of
four runs. It seemed they had finally broken the spell when they
scored four runs to take a 7-5 lead in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas got one back in the bottom half and then sent
Ontiveros to the plate in the ninth after Ben Emond's single and
Moore's sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was a dream.

BELFOUR, STARS COME UP SHORT AGAINST AVALANCHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Measuring sticks.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Stars coach Ken Hitchcock calls games like
yesterday's showdown with the Northwest Division-leading Colorado
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, the ruler is being held pretty close to
Stars goalie Ed Belfour today.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour picked a bad time to suffer a bad game, allowing three
goals on 12 shots and being shown up by Colorado goalie Patrick Roy
as the Avalanche shut out the Stars, 3-0, before a mostly booing
crowd of 16,928 at Reunion Arena and a Fox television audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys worked really hard, and I didn't play my best game,''
Belfour said. ``I wasn't on my game, and that's what happens
sometimes. You can come up with any excuse you can, but I just
didn't stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche looked ripe to have its league-best winning streak
snapped, playing its fourth road game in six nights. And the Stars
seemed intent on making a point and ``measuring up'' with intense,
physical play from the start. But Avalanche winger Claude Lemieux
pushed an easy shot between Belfour's pads at the 8:14 mark of the
second period, and the Stars never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche pushed its winning streak to 12 games _ tied for
sixth-best in NHL history and the longest since the Pittsburgh
Penguins won an NHL-record 17 consecutive to end the 1992-93
season. The Stars, meanwhile, lost the only game they'll play in a
span of 10 days and dropped to 30-10-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 5-5-1 since reeling off a 15-game unbeaten streak,
and have watched much of the league catch up with them. The
Avalanche trail by six points in the standings at 29-19-4 (62
points). The Philadelphia Flyers, who tied the Boston Bruins, 2-2,
on Saturday, are even with the Stars with 68 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really thinking about that. We're worried more about
playing well and letting the wins take care of themselves,'' Stars
winger Grant Marshall said. ``And we can't forget the positives of
today. We worked hard this week and did some things right today.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they couldn't overcome Roy, who stopped 27 shots, won his
401st career game and registered his 46th career shutout. Roy leads
active goalies in shutouts with three more than Belfour. The
comparison was notable yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be blunt and honest, their goaltender outplayed our
goaltender,'' Hitchcock said. ``We just needed more saves. It
doesn't matter how, when or where, we just needed more saves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux's goal was the back-breaker for the Stars, who had
outshot the Avalanche 11-6 up to that point and seemed in control
of the game. The line of Marshall, Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie
Langenbrunner had received numerous scoring chances and was getting
frustrated by the play of Roy. That's when Marshall tried to skate
around two defenders and lost the puck while his two linemates were
charging hard to the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's turnover took Nieuwendyk and Langenbrunner out of the
play and set up a two-on-one breakaway going the other way.
Avalanche forward Adam Deadmarsh fed Lemieux, who skated in alone
on the right wing, scoring between Belfour's pads.
</P>
<P>
   The score remained 1-0, despite some tremendous scoring chances
for the Stars, who went 0-for-7 on the power play, including
botching a 5-on-3 in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Avalanche rookie Chris Drury had made it 2-0 at the
2:11 mark of the third period on a shot over Belfour's glove, and
Roy (21-12-3) was looking unbeatable. Roy moved his career-best
winning streak to 11 games and also stopped an Avalanche winless
streak against the Stars, which had reached five games (0-4-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing well right now,'' Lemieux said. ``Even when we
don't play well, we seem to make the big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, however, are playing well and not making the big
plays. In a 2-2 tie with the Calgary Flames last week, the Stars
played a near-perfect game for 50 minutes, and then faltered to
allow the tie. Yesterday, they also showed flashes of brilliance,
but stumbled when the game was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a good game for a lot of the time, but we had some
breakdowns like mine, and we just can't afford to have those,''
Marshall said. ``What we have to do now is play well down the final
stretch and into the playoffs and the wins will take care of
themselves. We have to stick with our game plan and not panic,
especially at this time of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Hitchcock said the game wasn't a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was a good measuring stick,'' Hitchcock said.
``It shows us how far we have to go.''

   NEW YORK _ When ``Death of a Salesman'' opens Wednesday night, a
crowd of sleek, successful people will gather on Broadway to feel
very sorry for a chubby loser from across the East River who
wanders around babbling about Ebbets Field. It will be the 50th
anniversary of a play that can be seen as a classic American
tragedy _ or as a Manhattanite's revenge on Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Miller first encountered Willy Loman's world in the
1920s, when his parents took him across the river by limousine to
visit their poor relations in the Midwood section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when he was a teen-ager, his father's coat-making business
collapsed in the Depression, and the Millers were forced to move
from their spacious apartment overlooking Central Park to a small
house in Midwood.
</P>
<P>
   The young Arthur Miller was dismayed by their misfortune and by
some of his relatives in Midwood, particularly his uncle Manny
Newman, a loudmouthed salesman with grandiose ambitions, who took
great pride in his two sons' athletic and sexual prowess.
</P>
<P>
   When visiting his uncle, Miller would later recall, he felt
``gangling and unhandsome'' and usually heard ``some kind of
insinuation of my entire life's probable failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The nephew had the last word. Miller moved back across the river
and won international renown with a play about a family modeled on
Uncle Manny, his two sons and his long-suffering wife. In the play,
the salesman ends up envying Bernard, a nerdy teen-age friend of
his sons who grows up to become a lawyer about to argue a case
before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Miller wrote the play not long after the suicide of his Uncle
Manny, who had long suffered from ``black moods'' and anxieties
that ``flooded him with despair,'' according to Miller's
autobiography, ``Timebends.'' When you read today about these fits
of depression alternating with manic dreams of success, it is
tempting to conclude that the real-life Willy Loman's tragedy was
being born before the age of antidepressant drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a biochemical abnormality is not the sort of tragic
flaw that makes a classic play. Miller and his admirers have
grander explanations for the death of a salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Willy's fate is supposed to be partly a result of his own moral
failings, in particular the adulterous affair that his son is
traumatized to discover. When Willy kills himself, he is haunted by
the memory of his infidelity and by the fear that it ruined his
son's life.
</P>
<P>
   But is it plausible for one affair to cause such ruination?
Miller has had his own infidelities _ he left a wife and two
children to marry Marilyn Monroe, then divorced her and married
another woman _ but he has survived to the contented age of 83. And
when you consider Miller's recent impassioned defense of President
Clinton, Willy's indiscretion hardly seems to rise to the level of
a suicidal offense.
</P>
<P>
   Willy's other great failing is supposed to be his deluded
pursuit of the American dream, his embrace of hollow commercial
values. He ends up desperately unemployed because he has no
substance and no skills.
</P>
<P>
   At his grave, the mourners fondly recall the front stoop he
built _ ``He was a happy man with a bag of cement'' _ as they
lament his pursuit of ``the wrong dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a salesman, there is no rock bottom to the life,'' a
neighbor says. ``He don't put a bolt to a nut, he don't tell you
the law, or give you medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   But why is a salesman doing anything less substantial than what
a lawyer does _ or, for that matter, what a writer does? They're
all basically traffickers in information who make a living by
influencing people with words. Why pick on salesmen? And why
imagine, during the postwar boom in white-collar employment, that
Willy would be better off as a blue-collar worker building concrete
stoops?
</P>
<P>
   Miller's attitude resembles the old British aristocratic horror
at those who work ``in trade.'' Social and intellectual elites have
traditionally tolerated lawyers and other professionals, and
they've looked with kindly condescension on peasant farmers and
artisans, but they've disdained money-grubbing merchants. They know
how threatening the bourgeoisie's ambitions can be.
</P>
<P>
   Willy Loman is not a representative figure _ most Brooklyn
salesmen did quite nicely over the past half century, and few of
them were ever as pathetic as Willy. But to certain Manhattanites,
it may be comforting to imagine that vulgarians like him and Manny
Newman are hopelessly stuck across the river.

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC IS SMALL NATION WITH RICH BASEBALL TRADITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ The two-wheeled carts,
called carretas, line the main boulevard on the way into Santo
Domingo from the airport, many of them bulging with coconuts
brought in from the surrounding hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   Those adventurous enough to stop for a moment will find a local
farmer willing to take their money_ less than $1 American _ before
he reaches for his long, razor-sharp machete.
</P>
<P>
   With the big knife he will pare the coconut down, chop open the
top, and pour the semisweet water within _ he'll add sugar upon
request _ into a cup. It's supposed to be good for the liver.
</P>
<P>
   As visitors sip their coconut drink at the intersection half a
block away, feeling as if they've somehow slipped a couple of
centuries back in time, young men slide up and down between the
cars.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the 20th century comes charging back with a jarring
shock.
</P>
<P>
   They're selling cell phone accessories.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Dominican Republic, where the past and the present
often meet like the edge of a machete on a grinding wheel, sparks
flying, and baseball players, like coconuts, seem to grow on trees.
</P>
<P>
   This is the land of Sammy Sosa and Moises Alou; of Raul Mondesi
and Vladimir Guerrero; of Pedro and Ramon Martinez. More important
to the Rangers, it is home to two of their brightest young
prospects, outfielder Ruben Mateo and catcher Cesar King.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 280-plus Latin players listed in the 1998 edition of The
Sporting News Baseball Register, there are more players from the
Dominican Republic, about 140, than from Puerto Rico, Venezuela and
Mexico combined.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dominican Republic were a state _ it's about twice the
size of New Hampshire _ it would rank among the top five in this
country in producing players for major-league 40-man rosters.
</P>
<P>
   That's at least partially because almost every team in the major
leagues, including the Rangers, has opened a baseball ``academy''
in the Dominican Republic, where players are not subject to the
amateur free-agent draft and can sign with any team that
``discovers'' and woos them.
</P>
<P>
   The academies are just that: baseball schools, operated by
professional scouts and coaches, in which young players actually
live, eat and sleep baseball. There are intrasquad games in
February and March, a 72-game summer program nd a 60-game
instructional league in the fall. It's not unusual for young
Dominican players to spend 10 months of the year playing baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the history of the island and the talent that's
come out of there, and they're much like we were in the '40s and
'50s in the development of the sport,'' says Chuck McMichael, the
Rangers' director of amateur and international scouting. ``The
skills and instincts are really developed at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an expression there that they're very proud of: En
la sangre. In the blood.'' FANATICAL FANS The fans' blood is up for
Game 2 of the semifinal playoff series between Licey and Las
Aguilas at Quisqueya Stadium. A seat directly behind home plate, if
you can find one available, is $150 in Dominican pesos _ about
$9.60 American. See where that'll get you at The Ballpark in
Arlington, but don't forget your binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   The word that best describes Latin American baseball fans:
Passionate.
</P>
<P>
   The 15,000-seat stadium is jammed with more than 18,000
flag-waving fans _ blue flags for el Tigres de Licey, gold for
visiting Las Aguilas.
</P>
<P>
   The fans react almost violently to every nuance of the game and
when Licey third baseman Russell Branyan (a Cleveland prospect)
makes a diving stop with two outs and the bases loaded in the third
inning, then leaps to his feet to throw the runner at first out,
the Licey fans are delirious in their joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are even crazier in Venezuela,'' says Ann Dedrick,
whose 30-year-old husband Jim pitches for Licey. ``They get so out
of control there, most of the stadium seating areas are separated
by a chain link fence, to keep the fans from being able to get at
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann is at the game with her mother and her two small daughters,
Allee, 2 1/2, and Megan, 7 months. The four of them have been
living in a hotel suite in Santo Domingo for three months. In
previous years, Ann has also followed Jim to winter seasons in
Australia and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans here are a little more knowledgeable about
the game,'' she says. ``The look of complete joy on their faces
when their team wins is amazing. They are so into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, so is a loud fan a few rows away. He has been
drinking steadily from a large bottle of rum, in itself no
transgression because many other fans are doing the same thing. But
this fan has become loud, obnoxious and profane and soon he has
drawn the attention of la Policia.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out,'' a big policeman in a military-looking uniform tells
him. When the drunk belligerently opens his mouth to argue, he is
roughly pushed into the aisle, clubbed to his knees, cuffed and
hustled out of the seating area in about the time it takes a Pedro
Martinez fastball to reach home plate.
</P>
<P>
   When things get really rough, the police have been known to pull
out swords and use them _ flat-sided usually _ for crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh and eighth innings, selected fans from each team
are allowed onto the field to run the bases with their blue and
gold flags, to the cheers and taunts of their supporters and
opposing fans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Licey will eventually win this series as well as a
playoff with archrival Escogido, earning the right to advance to
the Caribbean World Series in San Juan, this night belongs to Las
Aguilas and Montreal right-hander Miguel Batista, who throws a
four-hitter and strikes out 12.
</P>
<P>
   Licey fans are devastated. ACADEMY OF DREAMS It is mid-afternoon
at San Cristobal Stadium at San Cristobal, 25 miles west of Santo
Domingo, and Hector Acevedo, one of the country's most respected
scouts and director of the Rangers' academy here, has had white
plastic tables set up in the gravel beneath the stands along the
third-base line.
</P>
<P>
   Having conducted a tour of the academy's facilities _
dormitory-style living quarters for the 30-or-so players, training
rooms, workout room, covered pitching and batting cages, cafeteria
_ Acevedo wants to show off the academy's cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch is about to be served by the two women who cook meals for
the players in the academy, which will open its doors for its first
session of the year this month.
</P>
<P>
   In the Caribbean, the midday meal is traditionally the heaviest
of the day. On the menu: Fish steaks pan-fried in a light batter;
fried plantains (a banana-like fruit); a salad of lettuce and
green, but tasty, tomatoes, sprinkled with some sort of oil and
vinegar dressing, all washed down by plenty of Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch starts out for three, but grows quickly. Fernando
Villalona, one of the Dominican's most popular merengue singers,
and his entourage drop by and they're hungry, too. More tables and
more food appear, including a dish of roast duck.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rico Carty _ yes, the same ``Beeg Boy'' who played for the
Rangers in '73 _ lumbers in, looking like some junior George
Foreman. More plates, more food and now it's a party, complete with
glasses of ice cold Presidente, a Dominican beer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is the kind of food the players are served, Acevedo
says with a wide smile, minus the Cerveza.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball academies like this, including a successful one run by
the Hiroshima Carp, are flourishing throughout the Dominican, but
there are rules that prevent major-league teams from hoarding
players. Teams can only bring a player in for 30 days. If he's not
signed to a contract by the end of that time, he must be released
and can't be re-signed to another academy stay by that team for
another 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The rules say 16-year-olds can sign contracts if they turn 17
sometime during their first season, but it's common knowledge that
scouts sometimes don't get around to checking birth certificates
all that quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Acevedo claims to have been the first scout to discover Sosa,
the Cubs' outfielder who came home to a hero's welcome in October
after belting 66 home runs and chasing Mark McGwire to a
record-shattering 70. Working for Cleveland at the time, Acevedo
did not have the money to sign Sosa, who wound up with the Rangers
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the story _ how Sosa and pitcher Wilson Alvarez
eventually were dealt to the White Sox in a deal for Harold Baines
in 1989 _ remains a painful memory for Rangers fans.
</P>
<P>
   Now Acevedo, who has been with the Rangers for seven years,
hopes he has found the next Sammy Sosa: His name is Ruben Mateo.
The next Clemente ``He can be compared to Clemente,'' Acevedo says
in Spanish of Mateo, then he holds up a finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuidado.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful saying that,'' he adds, ``because
people have so much respect for Clemente.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Roberto Clemente, of course, the late, great Puerto Rican
outfielder against whom all Latin players are measured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mateo is much like Sammy Sosa,'' Acevedo says. ``He has the
same abilities. He has the same potential as \RMontreal
outfielder\S Vladimir Guerrero.''
</P>
<P>
   That's heady company for a young man who has yet to play in his
first major-league game and will be celebrating his 21st birthday
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo has been dreaming about playing in Las Grandes Ligas _ the
Big Leagues _ since he was 8.
</P>
<P>
   He carries an air of confidence about him, a sense of maturity
that belies his youth. He has the look of a young man who knows his
destiny and looks forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about being better than anybody else,'' says
Mateo, who speaks English well. ``I just want to be the best _ and
when I'm out there, playing, I think I am the best. Most of all, I
want to help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo graduated from high school in San Cristobal and was
planning to attend college and get a degree as an engineer. But
baseball was always his first love.
</P>
<P>
   As an 11-year-old catcher, he was selected to the team that
represented Latin America in the Little League World Series in
Williamsport, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that experience,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In junior high, he remembers having to keep notebooks for each
subject, math, science, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always used to write in those notebooks what I wanted to be
someday,'' Mateo remembers. ``I would write that I was going to be
the home-run champion, the MVP, win a World Series. Those were my
dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   His teacher took a dim view of Mateo's notes and suspended him
for a week while his friends giggled.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't change his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always focused on my dream to become a major-leaguer,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Acevedo gave Mateo a $3,500 bonus and signed him to a contract
the first time he saw him play.
</P>
<P>
   He has hit above .300 at every level the Rangers have assigned
him, including .309 with 18 home runs and 75 RBIs while helping
lead Double-A Tulsa to the Texas League championship (he was MVP of
the playoff series) last season.
</P>
<P>
   That performance has earned him his first invitation to spring
training with the major-league team, but the Rangers plan on
sending him to Triple-A Oklahoma to start next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm ready,'' Mateo says confidently, ``but I'll do
whatever they say, go where ever they tell me to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be the best player I can be. I want to be like
Clemente.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo wrote that in his notebook once, too, a long time ago.
Nobody's laughing anymore.

AVALANCE PUT STARS ON DIFFICULT CYCLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ With ample free time from NHL play this week, the
Dallas Stars' mandatory workout regimen consisted largely of
lengthy, sweaty, arduous work aboard exercise bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Then their Western Conference rival, the Colorado Avalanche,
rolled into Reunion Arena yesterday afternoon armed with an 11-game
winning streak and an implied message to the Stars:
</P>
<P>
   Pedal faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team isn't just hot,'' said Dallas' Brett Hull after the
Avalanche's 3-0 victory against the Stars. ``That team is good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are in a pothole portion of their schedule, with just
two games in a 12-day span. Thus the stationary bikes last week,
and this week, a hockey-free, team-wide holiday in Newport Beach,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Avalanche, which started 0-4-1 and were 17-19-4
until a month ago, are now on a 12-game, franchise-record winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing from them is a good team that's been in
transition the last couple of years and now has new players doing a
good job filling in around the core players,'' said Stars general
manager Bob Gainey. ``What happened in this game was we saw just
how good they can be.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebound of Colorado, less than three years removed from a
Stanley Cup, creates a logjam of quality atop the Western
Conference. Following the Stars (31-10-8) are Phoenix, Colorado and
defending titlist Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of those teams have had their occasional struggles,
and I guess, relatively speaking, so have we,'' said Dallas' Mike
Modano. ``Phoenix is for real, and you know Detroit will be there
at the end. Colorado's done as good a job as anybody of dealing
with the struggles and turning negatives into positives.''
</P>
<P>
   The best example of that? Earlier this season the Avalanche
managed to appease an angry Patrick Roy, turning an unhappy goalie
into the highest-paid goaltender in the NHL. Add to that the
two-year, $6.7 million deal given defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh, and
Colorado seems re-committed to competing for a title.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the Stars said their focus was on their own play,
Modano conceded that the Stars did give some thought to being the
team that ended the Colorado run.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado coach Hartley said the Avalanche must get used to that.
``It's very important that we stay humble,'' Hartley said,
``because every team will be gunning for us the better we play and
the more this streak keeps going.''

COMPUTER BRIEFS: TAKING A WEB MEETING
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without traveling, how does a San Francisco-based developer of
Web sites get prompt approval for design changes from a client who
is in the South Pacific?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Web developer Parlez Communications, the
answer is the Webex Meeting Center, www.webex.com, a ``virtual
meeting'' Web site that Parlez and other users have been testing.
The Webex site, which is operated by the start-up company Active
Touch Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., officially opens for business on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The site allows users who are linked to one another by standard
telephone and the Internet to discuss and work collaboratively on
documents, spreadsheets and other application software for personal
computers running Microsoft Windows. Parlez was able to use the
site, for example, to meet on line with a client in the Cook
Islands to discuss changes for a graphics project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make changes in real time, and the client can observe
that,'' said Ike DeLorenzo, president of Parlez.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in Webex meetings share control over applications,
so that even if they are miles apart they can add or subtract
elements to a common project. A graphic designer might polish a
document layout, for example, and then turn cursor control over to
a copy editor to edit or trim the text, while all involved in the
virtual meeting watch the changes being made.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can also make telephone conference calls on Webex, for
15 cents a minute. Or they can arrange their own conference calls,
if they prefer. If they would rather dispense with the phone
entirely, they can use their keyboards to communicate through text
chat.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike popular collaborative software already on the market,
such as Lotus Notes or Timbuktu, Webex does not require users to
buy and install special software on their PC's. Either of the two
standard Web browser programs _ Netscape Navigator or Microsoft
Internet Explorer _ will suffice.
</P>
<P>
   Most Webex services except teleconferencing will be free. But
anyone who wants to use the site cleared of advertising will pay a
fee. Active Touch intends to offer business customers an ad-free
meeting service with additional security features for $1,000 a
month. Individuals and small companies can book the site ad free
for $5 a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Active Touch expects the likeliest customers for the service to
be consultants and software companies that want to demonstrate
their products on line. The company is also licensing the
virtual-meeting technology to companies that want to develop their
own services _ as the Baan Co., a producer of corporate computing
software, has done in creating an online service called Cyber
Consult that Baan peddles to its own customers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Webex catches the market's fancy or is simply a
precursor to other offerings of this type, some analysts expect the
concept to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the telephone did for global voice communication, this
class of product is going to do for data visualization,'' said
Stephen Hendrick, a vice president at the International Data
Corporation, a research firm in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Tact For Sale
</P>
<P>
   Boss has bad breath? Time for Uncle Foster to do something about
that unsightly nose hair? To convey a sensitive message discreetly,
a new Web site called gentlehints.com will send a letter _ along
with an appropriate enclosure to reinforce the message _ for a
small fee. Anonymity assured.
</P>
<P>
   The process is simple: The user selects from 13 offending
characteristics _ including bad breath, talking too much and body
odor _ then fills out an online form with names and addresses.
Thanks to the magic of electronic commerce and credit cards,
gentlehints.com then sends off an anonymous letter along with
mouthwash, say, or a bar of soap.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list of offenses are dandruff, flatulence and,
specifically for women, facial hair (for which a pair of tweezers
is enclosed).
</P>
<P>
   Most letters cost $7.95, although one that includes a book on
table manners or a trimmer for ear hair goes for $14.95. You can
also request a letter for an offense that is not on the standard
list.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Ford, one of three friends in Los Angeles who started the
business, says all the letters are diplomatic, worded gently to

GOETSCHL GIVES AUSTRIANS A SWEEP IN WOMEN'S DOWNHILL
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ It seemed like an Austrian national downhill race,
with no one else competing. One by one, members of the Austrian
women's team dusted one another in the standings Sunday until they
had swept the podium clean at the World Alpine Skiing
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   So confident was each Austrian that race results seemed sealed
with each succeeding run. There was the tall, lanky Michaela
Dorfmeister, standing there blowing kisses into the camera as if
the gold medal belonged to her.
</P>
<P>
   And then, four bibs later, came the petite Renate Goetschl,
rose-cheeked and confident, outdoing Dorfmeister. Waiting politely
for a few more skiers _ none of them Austrian _ to take their turn
down the icy International race slope, Goetschl finally gave in to
the flock of European cameras panning her happy face.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Goetschl had won the gold medal with a time of 1
minute 48.20 seconds; Dorfmeister, 25, would claim the silver .15
seconds behind; and Stefanie Schuster, 29, a late-bloomer on the
Austrian team, had the bronze with .17 behind Goetschl.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to just to win any medal,'' said Goetschl, who won
silver medals in the super-G and the women's combined earlier in
the competition. ``This week is unbelievable for me. It's a great
week, unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 races completed in the two-week championships so far,
10 of the medal winners have been Austrian. Earlier in the
competition, the powerful Hermann Maier shared the super-G gold
with the Norwegian Lasse Kjus and won the downhill, edging out Kjus
and another Norwegian, Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who are the event's
only men to successfully take on the Austrian might so far.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is Goetschl, a farm girl from Obdach, Austria, who
makes the most sense of this Alpine domination. Having started
skiing at 3 years old, she dreamed of ski racing, the Austrian
national sport, and tagged along with her brothers to local ski
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Austria, it is like football or baseball in America,'' she
said. ``Where I grew up, it was always a goal for me to be on TV
the way the others were.''
</P>
<P>
   Goetschl first made her mark in the big leagues at 17 when she
won a slalom event in Lillehammer, Norway. By the 1994 Olympics,
she was ready to show her worth as one of the youngest skiers
competing, then failed to finish the course. Now she is fourth over
all in World Cup points, an aggressive skier with talent in all
four of skiing's race disciplines. But her Austrian teammates also
know that on any day, any one of the four who made the training cut
to compete here could also take a medal.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Alexandra Meissnitzer, the gold-medal winner
in the super-G last Monday. She was was fourth Sunday, just .27
seconds behind Goetschl. Were it not for an indecipherable skid
here or an edge there, she might have stood atop the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course was perfect,'' Meissnitzer said. ``It was one of
the best races I've ever had. The difference in not winning was
very small. Renate maybe made a little better speed at the
bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian roadblock made it frustrating for everyone else,
including the best hopes of the United States Ski Team. At first,
it seemed that the Austrians might have made a mistake in choosing
to run in the middle of the pack today rather than with the early
skiers. Snow flurries were predicted for the 11 a.m. start,
something the Austrians wanted to avoid. But no snow fell, and the
day was alternately sunny and cloud-covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought it would come back and bite them,'' Tom
Kelly, a spokesman for the United States Ski Team, said. ``But it
didn't. They just skied right through it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Megan Gerety, the 27-year-old competitor from Anchorage,
Alaska, a skillful early run of 1:49.30 brought a realistic view of
a podium finish. Vail is one of her favorite World Cup
destinations. She had fifth-place finishes in the downhills here in
1991 and 1996. But with an eighth-place finish Sunday, she was one
more victim of the Austrian machine. She was disappointed but not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like it's something new,'' Gerety said. ``They've
been doing well all season. The momentum carries over to everyone
on the team. It pumps everybody up.''

LAWYERS TO ARGUE FOR TYSON'S RELEASE ON BAIL
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson and his lawyers will be back in a Maryland court
Monday morning trying to get the former heavyweight champion free
on bail. Judge Stephen P. Johnson sentenced Tyson to one year in
jail in Montgomery County district court last Friday on two counts
of second-degree assault. Tyson pleaded no contest to the
misdemeanor charges on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence shocked Tyson, his lawyers and his adviser, Shelly
Finkel, as well as many people in the sport of boxing. What was
more stunning to Finkel was that Johnson ordered Tyson held without
bail. Johnson handed down his sentence late Friday afternoon, well
after the courthouse had closed, which prevented Tyson's lawyers
from getting another judge to hear their plea for bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lawyers, in the whole time they have practiced, have never
heard of a lack of bail for a crime this size,'' Finkel said. ``I
don't understand why there was no bail allowed. If Mike was such a
public menace, why didn't they just order him to a trial or jail
back in December when he made his plea agreement? Where is he going
to go? He's such a public figure. He's recognized wherever he goes.
He can't leave the country. He doesn't have a passport.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkel also said the plea agreement that was made with Robert
Dean, the former Montgomery County prosecutor, called for no jail
time. However, Douglas Gansler, who took office as the new
prosecutor in January, ignored that agreement and pushed for jail
time. Finkel said Tyson's lawyers had been in touch with Gansler's
office before the sentencing and thought that the plea agreement
they had worked out with Dean was still in place until portions of
an 11-page memo that Gansler wrote to Johnson was publicized last
week. In that memo, Gansler pushed for jail time for Tyson and
called him ``a ticking time bomb in our backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkel has not seen Tyson since he was taken from the courtroom
on Friday afternoon. A despondent Tyson told his lawyers to come
back and see him in a year. Finkel said Tyson's wife, Monica, has
visited the 32-year-old former heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said he's holding up OK,'' Finkel said, ``but he's shocked
and disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   An appeal of the sentence has been prepared, but it has not been
filed with the court. Tyson has 30 days to file the appeal. If the
appeal of the sentence is granted, Tyson's plea will be erased and
his case will be moved to the circuit court where he will go on
trial before a jury. If he is convicted on the two assault charges
there, he faces a minimum of three to seven years, because he has a
recent rape conviction. With time off for good behavior, Tyson
could spend six months in the Montgomery County jail or he could
spend three months in jail and seven months in a halfway house
where he would work during the day and return at night.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel said Tyson's lawyers are still weighing all the options,
and they have not laid them all out for Tyson. He said they have
not contacted Judge Patricia Gifford, who presided over Tyson's
1992 rape trial and conviction in Indianapolis and must decide now
whether to revoke Tyson's probation, which is up next month. A
revocation could send Tyson back to an Indiana prison for another
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has a fight scheduled for April 24 and Finkel said
Showtime and the MGM Grand are still holding that date, although at
this point it is a technicality. &QL;

2,500 CHAMPIONS AND ONLY WILL BE THE TOP DOG AT WESTMINSTER SHOW
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dress code varies from the Continental clip to
the Michael Jordan scalp-a-rama. Personality is a plus, barking is
optional and biting the judge will definitely get the contestant
disqualified on the spot. That's why 2,500 canine prima donnas, all
of them certified champions with pedigree lines the length of
Broadway, will be on their best behavior when they descend on
Madison Square Garden Monday and Tuesday for the hottest act in
dogdom, the 123rd annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two days it's liver treats for all and, for the
luminary who outshines 2,499 others at crunch time to win best in
show on Tuesday night, it's steak for lunch at Sardi's on
Wednesday. No wonder everyone's panting.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill of squaring off against the best at Westminster is
the culmination of a pricey, year-long trip spent piling into a
handler's van or, in the case of deep-pocketed owners who airlift
their furballs to competitions to pile up points at the less
celebrated shows that dot the landscape every weekend everywhere. A
few competitions along the way attract a bigger crowd of dogs, but
none admits a better contingent: Westminster is the only show
allowed to discriminate against nonchampions, and discriminate it
does. If a dog's date and place it attained championship status is
not clearly marked on his Westminster entry form, into the trash it
goes. The Garden is no place for pretenders.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the entry process opened and closed in a matter of
minutes; as usual, guardians of the 2,000 or so canines who were
turned away were furious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who don't make it call it a fiasco, but if they've
got all of us begging to get into their show, I say more power to
them,'' said Andy Linton, a top handler who led a Doberman to best
in show in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the global dog community will be represented by 152
breeds, ranging from toy-sized lapdogs who fit in a teacup to
100-pound bruisers who take their water by the tub. Of the 153
varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club, only the Finnish
spitz is a no-show for 1999. Though Labrador and golden retrievers
remain the most popular breeds, dachshunds monopolized this year's
entries: 55 of those little logs on legs will duke it out for a
chance to become the top dog to emerge from the Hound division.
</P>
<P>
   Over two days of judging in the chaotic breed rings, the 2,500
contenders, 90 of them returning breed winners from last year's
show, are whittled down to seven group winners over the course of
two days of judging in the chaotic breed rings for the best-in-show
round. Just three of the seven finalists from last year _ the
Sporting group's snazzy Gordon setter, Ch. Bit O Gold Titan
Treasure; the Non-Sporting group's elegant standard poodle, Ch.
Lake Cove That's My Boy, and the Herding group's ebullient Old
English sheepdog, Ch. Lambluv's Desert Dancer, all males _ have
returned.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the last show in the stellar career of Kirby, the
black-and-gold setter who is the only Gordon ever to capture the
Sporting group at Westminster and currently reigns as the group's
two-time defending champion. About to turn 7, Kirby comes into his
retirement party at the Garden with 84 career bests in show and 93
group victories in 1998 alone. The 75-pound dog placed ninth on the
all-breed list in 1998, having defeated 45,533 competitors and,
regardless of what happens at Westminster, has the satisfaction of
retiring as the top-winning Gordon setter in the breed's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never let me down; he's the best Gordon setter ever,''
said his handler, Ken Murray, who describes Kirby as having a bit
of a split personality. ``In the show ring he can be a wild man,
but at home, he's your basic couch potato.''
</P>
<P>
   Provided that he wins it, this could be the last show too for
the big white poodle puffball, Tre-son, who vaulted from ninth on
the 1997 all-breed honor list to No. 1 in the country last year
with defeats of 95,723 rivals. With a full-time trainer in Dennis
McCoy and a full-time hairdresser and beautician in Randy Garren,
Tre-son's maintenance is an overtime proposition. ``He's our last
poodle,'' said Garren, who revealed that he spends so much time
priming and primping the poodle that he feels ``married to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's queen of the show, the Norwich Terrier Ch. Fairewood
Frolic, was pregnant when she took a victory dive into her
silver-plated trophy, and she will not be back in 1999 because she
is busy producing puppies. Perpetuating the breed is, after all,
the first duty of these champions. And the lords of Westminster
seem to smile on anointing new champions every year: It has been
nearly 30 years since a dog reprised an unbeatable performance and
went best in show two years in succession.
</P>
<P>
   The Working, Terrier, Toy and Non-Sporting groups will be judged
Monday night; Tuesday night, after the winners of the Sporting,
Hound and Herding groups are identified, the harrowing decision on
best in show will fall to this year's head judge, Edd E. Biven. The
selection of the 58-year-old Biven, vice chancellor of daily
operations at Texas Christian University, as Westminster's ultimate
arbiter has been a popular one precisely because no one is quite
sure which dog or bitch will catch his nonpartisan eye. Neither is
he.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be surprised, and the exhibitors who've invested
their time, money and emotions in these dogs deserve to have me
walk in there with an open mind,'' Biven said. ``It's going to come
down to an athletic contest on the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Biven, who breeds Dobermans and Pointers, got his start on a
smaller scale when he began showing Pomeranians as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember back in the 50s, when I was about 14, staying
up until 1:30 in the morning on a school night waiting for the wire
service to flash across who'd gone best in show at Westminster,''
Biven said. ``Way back then, that's where I was in my head. Here.''
</P>
<P>
   According to insiders, last year's annunciation of the Norwich
Terrier was predictable; this year, even the intimates of the
statistical headliner, Tre-son, are convinced that Biven's presence
bodes no special treatment for their favorite or anyone else's. The
best dog will win and the rest will have nothing to whine about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Westminster's going to be a sport this year,'' said Linton,
now handling the nation's top Doberman, Ch. Toledobes Serenghetti.
``This judge will go in there with a completely open mind. That's
going to be very good for Westminster.'' &QL;

`THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY': FROM MAHLER TO MINIMALISM IN
MILWAUKEE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ When this native Wisconsinite decamped for New York
three decades ago, Milwaukee remained a solidly Germanic city, with
strong representations of the cultures of Eastern Europe. It has
since become a much livelier place and developed an unexpected
fascination with Ireland, manifested in summer festivals on Irish
themes. Now comes the city's second annual International Arts
Festival, centering on the culture of Ireland (Germany having been
seen to last year).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Milwaukee, once slow to emerge from the musical
shadow of Chicago, evidently has developed a forward-looking
interest in opera. The festival's centerpiece this year is opera:
the United States premiere of Lowell Liebermann's ``Picture of
Dorian Gray'' by the Florentine Opera Company, the premiere of
Richard Wargo's ``Ballymore'' by the Skylight Opera Theater and
related events including a symposium on contemporary opera, all of
which came together over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Picture of Dorian Gray'' had its premiere at the Monte
Carlo Opera in 1996 in a co-production with Opera Pacific, in
Orange County, Calif., which, however, encountered financial
problems that prevented an American premiere at the time. The
Florentine presentation, which ran for only three performances in
Uihlein Hall, the renovated home of the Milwaukee Symphony, was
impressive on every count, with the possible exception of
insinuating the dashing young American composer into the story in
hokey publicity photographs. But then, Oscar Wilde did much the
same in the novel from which Liebermann drew his libretto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basil Hallward is what I think I am,'' Wilde wrote in a letter
quoted by his grandson, Merlin Holland, in a lecture here at the
Pabst Theater on Saturday in Holland's new book, ``The Wilde
Album.'' ``Lord Henry is what the world thinks me; Dorian is what I
would like to be _ in other ages perhaps.''
</P>
<P>
   The spare but attractive Florentine production, based on the
Monte Carlo staging and directed by Linda Brovsky, followed suit,
seeming to portray Lord Henry Wotton, the cynical enabler in the
vain young Dorian's corruption, as Wilde himself, in look and
manner. Wilde, on the other hand, would see himself as the painter
of Dorian's telltale portrait and ultimately the victim of Dorian's
homicidal rage. Wilde wrote the novel in 1889, some two years
before he took the handsome young Lord Alfred Douglas as a lover, a
relationship that would lead through a tortuous series of events to
Wilde's imprisonment and physical decline.
</P>
<P>
   Musically and dramatically, Liebermann's work is effective. As a
first opera, it is remarkable. The score draws heavily on idioms of
the last century _ mostly the tonal ones, from Mahler to Minimalism
_ but the synthesis is generally persuasive on its own terms.
</P>
<P>
   More direct allusions vary in effect. Suggestions of Prokofiev's
``Romeo and Juliet'' in a backstage scene between Dorian and his
momentary inamorata Sibyl Vane, as she is about to play Juliet,
proved superbly evocative. But subsequent allusions seemed more
commonplace (Tchaikovsky's ``Romeo and Juliet'' quoted in the
music, like Shakespeare's text in the libretto, as Sibyl plays the
role) or pointless (glassy harmonic sprays from Strauss'
``Rosenkavalier'').
</P>
<P>
   After bogging down in faux Strauss and in a banal clamor when
the portrait is discovered to reveal Dorian's ravaged character
late in the first act, the momentum and imagination of the opening
pick up again in the second and carry breathlessly to the
conclusion. Liebermann's handling of the orchestra is masterly,
summoning great power at times without in most cases swamping the
voices. His setting of English was natural enough to carry at least
to one choice seat with little need for the supertitles.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock _ naturally enough, if he is to represent Wilde as
Lord Henry _ dominated the first performance, on Friday evening.
His baritone did not always carry easily to the lowest notes, but
his middle and high registers were strong and clear. Kelly
Anderson, a bass-baritone, was a sympathetic Basil Hallward, and
Kristopher Irmiter, another bass-baritone, was excellent as James
Vane, Sibyl's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Thomsen, however, seemed vocally out of sorts in the tenor
role of Dorian Gray, with tone that turned grainy on several
occasions and broke down once. Erie Mills, the soprano, was a
decent Sibyl, though her high notes grew constricted, and the
highest were not quite high enough.
</P>
<P>
   Steuart Bedford, who conducted the Monte Carlo premiere, drew a
fine, fluent effort from the Milwaukee Symphony in the pit, after a
slightly rocky start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballymore,'' in the lovely little Skylight Theater, built in
the style of a Baroque opera house, was an altogether more modest
affair. Wargo also wrote his own libretto, based on Brian Friel's
play ``Lovers,'' in which a romance in youth proves tragically ill
fated (in the first act, ``Winners'') and another in middle age
farcically so (``Losers'').
</P>
<P>
   Wargo provides a slick and clever score that seldom transcends
the Broadway idiom. It avails little to debate whether such a
creation is properly called an opera; there is certainly room in
the world for such an unclassifiable entertainment, especially when
rendered with the enthusiasm and skill shown here on Saturday
evening by nearly all hands in Dorothy Danner's fine production.
(It runs until Feb. 14.)
</P>
<P>
   But the symposium a few hours earlier elicited the usual pieties
to the effect that in opera, the music's the thing. In this
context, in any case, one could only regret that Wargo had not
shown greater ambition musically.
</P>
<P>
   No matter; in its varied parts as in its whole, this little
festival showed a listener who thought he knew Milwaukee how out of
date that knowledge was. Even a lot of the beer is good _
microbreweries be praised.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Phalanxes of young women in red flash by brilliantly
as they fly across the stage at the Joyce Theater. This is
``Panorama,'' or rather a stunning excerpt from a social protest
piece that Martha Graham choreographed in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   She had, then, asked her friend Alexander Calder to create a
mobile for the work. But Calder's geometric forms still were
unfamiliar to the wide public and were considered distracting by
critics. After its premiere at Bennington College in Vermont,
``Panorama'' was never performed in New York until the current
12-minute excerpt, also called ``Panorama'' was reconstructed from
a film in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Graham herself was reluctant to revive the early pieces that she
considered dated. Yet on Saturday at the Joyce, where the Martha
Graham Dance Company's season runs through Feb. 21, this
``Panorama'' looked as abstract in form as a Calder mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would be more misleading than to consider Graham a
literary choreographer just because after the 1930s some of her
greatest works (including her cycle drawn from Greek myth) had
literary sources. In those works as in others, movement was
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panorama'' is revealing _ the content of the piece is conveyed
by movement: the vigorous dynamics, the use of overlapping units of
dancers, the shape of the bodies that telegraphs the spirit of
militancy and, also, contemplation. Emotion is abstracted to its
essence. It is Graham's way.
</P>
<P>
   Form and structure nonetheless come to the fore, and Graham
herself later opted for a more theatrical approach, beginning in
the 1940s. The 1992 ``Panorama'' was reconstructed from a Julien
Bryan film by Yuriko, the former leading Graham dancer who, like
Pearl Lang, is now called consultant for the Graham repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kikuchi, Yuriko's daughter, has superbly directed the
young women from the Graham school in the current staging.
``Panorama'' also had a student cast at Bennington, and its
overlapping patterns and outpouring of energy demand total
commitment to shape and spatial composition. The vestige of a
social theme has disappeared, but the choreography's form is still
dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was neither a formalist nor a utilitarian. Form could
engender content because, she wrote in 1940, dance ``is independent
of service to an idea but is of such highly organized activity that
it can produce idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's vocabulary, although reductive here, is expressive. The
first two sections of the complete ``Panorama'' looked severely at
the Puritan heritage and the exploitation of black Americans. The
third section, ``Popular Theme,'' had Graham as an agitator for
``the people and their awakening consciousness,'' as the original
program note put it.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's role as the soloist has been discarded, but Norman
Lloyd's driving score, heard on tape, easily whips up the whirlwind
of motion. Lines of women march in and then crisscross in leaps,
feet together to one side and arms swinging toward a lifted hip.
The regimented mass dissolves into a huge circle of thrusting
figures. In the second section, five women in changing sculptural
poses under Robert Kracik's mobile, inspired by Calder, offer a
lyrical respite. The ensemble returns to sweep the quintet up into
the relentless and implied call to action. Well done.
</P>
<P>
   The company seemed finally adjusted to the thrust of the stage
in the small Joyce house. The 1931 ``Primitive Mysteries'' found
its true center as it had not on opening night. The dancers were
better cued to the recorded music rather than the live music last
week, and the darker lighting amply distanced the performers from
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Auclair, in a debut as the pioneer woman of
``Frontier'' (1935), was able to give a sense of space around her.
Nuanced rather than frozen in one expression, she advanced three
times and retreated to a symbolic fence with the right air of
increasing confidence. ``Frontier'' is a dance of exploration, not
settlement, and the American myth of open-frontier optimism was
embodied in this performance.
</P>
<P>
   In a cast change, Terese Capucilli's grieving female archetype
had an apt flamenco swirl in ``Deep Song,'' created during the
Spanish Civil War in 1937. On Friday she was Jocasta to Kenneth
Topping's fine and stalwart Oedipus. The angular quality of her
superb dancing was always there, but turbulence was tinged with
serenity too. Most important, the female chorus clawed and leaped
with new energy.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Dakin's lyricism was expressed with power in ``Errand
Into the Maze.'' Martin Lofsnes, as her less than lumbering
Minotaur, used his natural agility to dramatic purpose.

SUPER BOWL VIEWERS CLOSELY WATCHED ADS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surveys taken after Super Bowl XXXIII have found that viewers,
particularly younger ones, said they were more attentive to the
commercials broadcast during the game than they were to spots
during regular programming.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey by Bruskin/Goldring Research for Media That Works in
Cincinnati, a media and marketing agency, 58 percent of respondents
said they paid more attention to the game's spots than to those in
everyday television. For viewers ages 18 to 20, that figure reached
77 percent, compared with 38 percent, for viewers ages 55 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   And 16 percent of all respondents said they paid more attention
to the commercials than to the game.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey by Starcom Media Services in Chicago, a unit of the
Leo Burnett Co., 62 percent of respondents said they paid more
attention to the Super Bowl spots than they do to regular
commercials. For respondents younger than 35, that figure reached
74 percent, compared with 50 percent for older viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Among all respondents in the Starcom survey, 52 percent said
they discussed Super Bowl commercials the following Monday, almost
as many as those who said they discussed the game, 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of viewers recalling the names of advertisers, the
leader in the Starcom and Media That Works surveys, as well as in a
survey by SAA/Research in Farmington Hills, Mich., a unit of
Morpace International, was the Budweiser beer brand sold by
Anheuser-Busch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one company that advertised on Super Bowl XXXIII on
Jan. 31 has decided to shelve its commercial after the single
showing because of criticism about how a character in the spot was
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Just for Feet in Birmingham, Ala., a footwear retailer, will
stop running the spot, created by the Rochester office of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi. The commercial was centered on a squad of Just for Feet
employees so eager to convert a barefoot Kenyan runner into a
customer that they chase him in a Humvee, drug him and put sneakers
on his feet while he is unconscious. Critics complained that the
spot showed the runner being treated like an animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism caught us totally off guard,'' said Michael
Traphagan, a spokesman for the agency. ``There was never any intent
to offend anybody. We as an agency apologize.''

RAIN PUSHES BACK NHRA FINALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ Gary Densham has waited three decades to win a
National Hot Rod Association national event. So what's one more
day.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the veteran Funny Car driver feels after an
early-evening rain forced the postponement of the final round for
the 39th Winternationals at Pomona Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   The professional finals are scheduled to conclude this morning
beginning at 10:30 with Pro Stock Truck. Sportsman racing is set to
begin at 9:15 a.m. Gates open at 8.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket stubs from Sunday are good for admission today.
Spectators not holding tickets stubs can pay $10 to see the finals.
Parking is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the happiest guy on this drag strip,'' said Densham, who
despite three runs in the six-second range advanced to the Funny
Car final against Tony Pedregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had so many deposits in the luck bank over 30 years and
to withdraw so many in one day is outstanding. It's tough (to
wait), but we've run these races like this before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just happy to be here. We didn't run as good as we
should, but I think Tony knows were capable of it. If he backs it
(down) a little bit, he's going to get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunn, who qualified on the pole at this event for the
second consecutive season, will face 1998 Winternationals champion
Larry Dixon in the Top Fuel Final. Brothers Jeg and Troy Coughlin
will do battle in the Pro Stock with Brad Jeter facing Randy
Daniels in Pro Stock Truck.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, the La Mirada native who now resides in Wrightsville, Pa.,
backed up his qualifying pass of 4.503 with a 4.513 in a
first-round victory over Bruce Sarver for a new national elapsed
time record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels real good, obviously (to get the national record),''
Dunn said. ``It feels good just to have a competitive car like
this. It's something we all dream about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, who could be the first driver to win the Winternationals
back-to-back, hopes to bring Dunn back to reality. The driver of
the Don `Snake' Prudhomme Miller dragster certainly could have done
it Sunday after advancing to the final with three consecutive
passes in the 4.50s, including an impressive 4.54 in a semifinal
victory over 1998 Winston Finals champion Kenny Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big deal,'' Dixon said. ``I've worked for Snake
since 1988 and it was always Bernstein and Prudhomme because they
were both four-time Funny Car champs. Anytime they faced each
other, it was always a big deal. And when we switched from Skoal to
Miller (Beer), that made it even bigger deal.''

surrounding the new Times Square, landlords may have pushed rents

writes about fragile families -- families with deep wounds and

<P>
   HONOLULU _ Quarterback John Elway sat at his locker after
helping the AFC defeat the NFC 23-10 Sunday in the Pro Bowl. As he
did after leading Denver to a victory over Atlanta in Super Bowl
XXXIII, Elway deftly dodged questions about his possible
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   When Elway was asked if his next appearance at the Pro Bowl will
be in five years after he is elected into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame, he paused a few seconds as if in deep thought and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought about the Hall of Fame, because it's out of
my hands,'' he said. ``But I did feel really old today when I saw
Eric Dickerson come out on the field with the other members of this
year's class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Dickerson? He and I were drafted the same year, and now
he's in the Hall of Fame. Man, do I feel old.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway was the first pick in the 1983 draft, one spot ahead of
Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's guaranteed,'' Elway said in response to a question
about him being a consensus pick in his first year of eligibility,
which will come five years after he retires. ``I don't take
anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole career, I've looked at what's in front of me. I
always wanted to win a Super Bowl. Now that I've won two, I still
look forward. Only now, I see my kids getting older.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pro Bowl was also supposed to be the last game for Green Bay
defensive end Reggie White, who said during the season that he will
retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't talk to Reggie about it,'' Elway said. ``Besides,
from what I hear, Reggie's going to play another season.''
</P>
<P>
   When Elway was introduced before the game, he was told to wait
in the tunnel because the Pro Bowl was showing a 90-second tribute
on the JumboTron scoreboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about it until right when I came out,''
he said. ``I was kind of embarrassed about it. That's not really my
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway played the first series before 50,075 fans. He completed
four of five passes for 55 yards and a touchdown. His touchdown
came on a three-yard pass to fullback Sam Gash.
</P>
<P>
   Elway wasn't named the game's Most Valuable Player. The
co-winners were Jets receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who had seven
catches for 87 yards, including two that set up touchdowns, and
Patriots cornerback Ty Law, who returned an interception 67 yards
for a touchdown and broke up five passes.
</P>
<P>
   After his series, Elway spent much of the rest of the game
behind the AFC bench signing autographs for fans. When Elway left
the field after the game, he was greeted in the tunnel by NFC guard
Randall McDaniel, who was holding a football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you please sign?'' McDaniel asked Elway, who obliged.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked away, McDaniel said, ``That's one of the greatest
quarterbacks of all time. It means a lot to have something from
him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Elway reached his locker, he was besieged by players and
coaches from both teams who handed him items to sign. He didn't
turn down anyone, including the trainers, equipment men and ball
boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``To throw a touchdown pass and be able to walk away was
perfect,'' he said about the game. ``Now that the season's over,
I'm going to play some golf. I've got a tee time in the morning.
I'll worry about everything else later.''

<P>
   HONOLULU _ A little knowledge about the Pro Football Hall of
Fame and its 36-member selection committee has made a big
difference in Lawrence Taylor's attitude about being part of the
Class of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days after he was elected to the Hall, Taylor didn't
apologize for comments he made about the selection committee, but
he did sound remorseful.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's candidacy had caused controversy because of his
well-documented history of drug and financial problems. On Super
Bowl Sunday, one day after he was elected, Taylor told Fox Sports
News that, among other things, members of the selection committee
had no business judging him off the field because they were
knocking down highballs, going to Miami's trendy South Beach area
and chasing 13-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday during the Pro Bowl why he made such a comment,
Taylor said, ``I'm not going there. That's over. I don't want to
get into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd known then what I know now, I would have felt
differently. I'm humbled by this honor. It's a great honor to be
here and be considered one of the best to play the game. I wasn't
given this award. I earned it. And I deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, running back Eric Dickerson, tight end Ozzie Newsome,
guard Tom Mack and guard Billy Shaw got together for the first time
in Hawaii and participated in the Pro Bowl festivities. They will
be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Aug. 7 in Canton,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to cast a bad light,'' Taylor said. ``There are
four other guys here, and it's not fair to them that everybody
keeps coming to me and talking about all that other stuff. Yes, I
did some things, but that shouldn't take away from what I did on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 199 guys in the Hall of Fame out of how many
thousand that have played? It's great to be recognized as one of
the best _ no matter how I got here. And I'm here to stay. No one
can take it away.''
</P>
<P>
   After being elected Jan. 30, Taylor said he couldn't enjoy it
the way he wanted to because his off-the-field problems commanded
so much attention. He wondered why those problems were such an
issue with his candidacy and why they hadn't been with previous
candidates who had suffered similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time my name came up in the media, that's all anybody
talked about,'' Taylor said. ``Man, I'm trying to get away from all
that. I'm trying to put it behind me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus wasn't on what I did on the field. Man, I played for
13 years. I played hurt. I left everything I had on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Informed that almost 30 members of the selection committee spoke
out on his behalf, Taylor said, ``I didn't know that. You're
telling me something I didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the New York guys stood up for me, but I didn't know
others did, too. I appreciate that.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Mike Krzyzewski insists he isn't giving the matter much thought _
not yet, at least. The jockeying for NCAA Tournament position is
getting a little more intense these days, certainly, but the Duke
coach says he hasn't begun sizing up regions, sites or possible
travel plans.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's what he says, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know where the first-round games are,'' he
offered last week. ``Maybe that's dumb, but I don't think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Press on a bit, though, and you find that perhaps the notion has
crossed his mind a time or two. As things stand, Krzyzewski's Blue
Devils are in the driver's seat for one of those four No. 1 seeds
to be handed out next month. And as the coach knows, not all No. 1s
are created equal.
</P>
<P>
   If Duke were to be sent to the South, for instance, it would
mean opening play in Orlando, Fla., or Indianapolis. (Yes,
Indianapolis.) A seeding in the East, however, would offer a chance
to play in Boston or
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte?
</P>
<P>
   Hmm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ACC is in the East,'' Krzyzewski said, warming to the
pulpit. ``We're not in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   (Neither, of course, is Indianapolis, but that's another story.)
</P>
<P>
   As the big boys begin to limber up for The Sprint to St. Pete,
Krzyzewski at least has a team on the upswing, even after
Saturday's close call at Georgia Tech. If Duke _ which moved up to
No. 1 in the coaches poll this week and likely will do the same in
the Associated Press version _ manages to stay on top, look for the
Devils to be making the relatively short trek from Durham to
Charlotte to get the Tournament run under way.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be as simple as it appeared before the weekend,
however, as reports of Connecticut's untimely demise proved a bit
premature. The Huskies' 70-59 win at Stanford _ accomplished
without leading scorer Richard Hamilton, no less _ kept them very
much in the running for the top spot in the East. That could mean
opening NCAA play in nearby Boston, with an eye toward moving on to
East Rutherford, N.J. (site of the East Regional).
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the other usual suspects have fared quite so well
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland lost by 18 at Duke, effectively withdrawing any claim
on top-rung status. Cincinnati, on pace for the No. 1 seed in the
Midwest, dropped an overtime shocker to DePaul. Kentucky has lost
its last two, and Stanford's attempt at avenging last year's
20-point loss at UConn ended in more embarrassment for the mild,
mild West, which may now struggle to reserve the No. 1 seed for one
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make that statement, and we didn't make it,''
forward Mark Madsen said of the UConn debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn? The Tigers are on a roll, but doubters remain. The Big
Ten boys, meanwhile, keep beating each other up, but Michigan State
is emerging as the best of a good group.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific-10, in turn, is giving Stanford more resistance than
expected, with Arizona already upsetting Cardinal hopes for a
perfect league season and UCLA paying a visit to Maples Pavilion
this week. If Connecticut gets healthy, the Huskies will stay near
the top, but a trip to Syracuse and the Big East tournament remain.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone is looking ahead, mind you. Heaven forbid. But
while Krzyzewski might be putting a convenient spin on his view of
mid-Atlantic geography, he knows this much:
</P>
<P>
   As first-round sites go, Charlotte looks a lot like home. And
when you're driving one of those big luxury models on the road to
the Final Four, you don't want to use up too much gas early in the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   For now, a look at how things have been and where we might be
headed.
</P>
<P>
   Best League _ The Big Ten, notable for its postseason flops in
recent years, should land seven teams in the Tournament, some of
which might actually stay around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Most Disappointing League _ The Big 12. Kansas is living on its
reputation, and not living particularly well. Four could go to the
Tournament, but don't look for anyone to last long. (Dishonorable
mention: the Atlantic 10.)
</P>
<P>
   Biggest Surprise _ Auburn, with only a loss at Kentucky so far.
</P>
<P>
   Most Disappointing Team _ Temple appeared on many a preseason
Top 10 list but struggled early and needed a lift from playing in a
subpar A-10.
</P>
<P>
   Best Coaching Job _ Miami might have collapsed after a deflating
home loss to UConn, but Leonard Hamilton kept his team together and
earned a big win at St. John's last week.
</P>
<P>
   Teams going up:
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State is hanging in atop the Big Ten, which is saying
something for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona might be arriving ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Utah wasn't supposed to be a factor this year, but the Utes have
crawled back into the Top 25 and humiliated New Mexico in its own
building last week.
</P>
<P>
   Texas doesn't have the depth to last long in March, but Rick
Barnes' team has been a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Teams going down:
</P>
<P>
   Kansas may yet win the Big 12, but Roy Williams will be shedding
NCAA tears early again.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford hadn't been impressive before Saturday's loss to UConn,
and the Huskies made the Cardinal look small, slow and indifferent
_ perfect ingredients for an early NCAA curfew.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico isn't fooling anyone. With one of the worst schedules
in the country _ and by far the worst among ranked teams _ the
Lobos could win 20 games and still be sent packing to the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's upsetting evening at Florida could be dismissed.
Following it up with a loss to Alabama makes you wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Key games coming up _ UCLA at Stanford (Thursday), Kentucky at
Arkansas (Feb. 20), Louisville at Cincinnati (Feb. 21), Auburn at
Arkansas (Feb. 24), Arizona at Stanford (Feb. 27), Duke at North
Carolina (Feb. 27), UConn at Syracuse (Feb. 28).
</P>
<P>
   Top seeds on Selection Sunday _ East: Duke; South: Auburn;
Midwest: Cincinnati; West: Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Final Four _ St. Petersburg, March 27 and 29. (This much we can
guarantee.)

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Rockets rookie Cuttino Mobley was still backpedaling and pumping
his fist when Charles Barkley and Matt Maloney reached him in the
backcourt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barkley lifted Mobley in a happy hug. Barkley and Maloney
escorted him to Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who palmed Mobley's
head, later telling him, ``I knew it would go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley's 3-point shot with 19.1 seconds left against the
Warriors on Saturday night had given the Rockets the lead in what
would become their first win this season. And coming in his first
appearance as an NBA player, it gave Mobley about as exhilarating a
debut as any player could want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, that felt so good,'' Mobley said. ``We got the
opportunity, and that happened. I'm just blessed. It was my first
(NBA) game ever, and I hit the game-winner. It feels good.
</P>
<P>
   ``But so what? We've got to get ready for Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is life in the year of the rushed NBA. After splitting
their opening weekend at the Lakers and Warriors, the Rockets
finally offer their lockout-delayed home debut tonight against the
Nuggets. Two games into the season, the Rockets have established
little. It is a work in progress, with potential but equally clear
problems.
</P>
<P>
   They played well enough defensively to push the Lakers to the
final minute in a 99-91 loss, and offensively to hold their breath
through a last-second miss that allowed them to pull out the win
over the Warriors. But they also had long ragged stretches and
still have a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley seemed in midseason form, and of a season several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But considering it is the second week of February, Barkley said,
``It is midseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon seemed strong but out of sync. And Scottie
Pippen will make his home debut plainly struggling with the
adjustment, and possibly with the patience, that the transformation
from the Bulls' triangle offense to his evolving role with the
Rockets will require.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself away from the ball, just watching too much,''
Pippen said. ``I'm going to have to figure out a way to score.
Maybe offensive rebounds. Maybe I can be the Dennis Rodman around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets also received encouraging moments from each of their
rookies, enough to believe Mobley, Michael Dickerson and Bryce Drew
will offer more finishes like Mobley's last-minute 3.
</P>
<P>
   The rookies can play defense and orbit the inside threats of
Olajuwon and Barkley on offense; Pippen seeks ways to contribute
more than occasional jump shots. Against the Lakers, he came up
with rebounds, steals, assists and defense. And there is little
doubt he can be a force in as many areas as any NBA player.
</P>
<P>
   But because becoming the Rockets' Rodman is not an option, he
must worm his way into the offense some other way. Tomjanovich and
the other Rockets believe he and his new teammates will just need
time together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to take a month,'' Barkley said. ``We'll
get more easy shots once everybody knows what the other guy is
going to do. I don't know what Scottie's thinking. He doesn't know
what I'm thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Pippen's offense slumping from his standard, the
Rockets insist he can do enough to make the transition successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``One coach I played for who I learned a great deal from was
(Suns assistant) Paul Silas,'' Barkley said. ``He told me one day
`We have a lousy team.' I thought we had a good team. He said, `As
a coach, if I could look at my team and say this guy is going to do
this for me every night, he's a good player. If I know he's going
to do two or three things, he's a great player.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not many players you can say, `I know this guy is
going to do this for me every single night.' You can put that down
and sleep good at night as a coach. Scottie's not scoring, but he
can beat you with defense, assists, steals. That's how you judge
players. That's why there's very few really good players in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   If stealing a win over the Warriors and playing the Lakers tough
in a loss can be considered a mixed-review weekend, the Rockets
believe it is a place to begin the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to a team that good, opening night, and it's a
four-point game with a minute to go,'' Barkley said. ``If we can do
that, we'll be all right. Scottie's not going to shoot the ball
like he did (going 4-for-18). Hakeem's not going to get in foul
trouble. I like our team.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Rockets said the problems stem only from
unfamiliarity with the offense and each other. Though the system is
relatively unchanged from past seasons, and built around the same
philosophies, running it has been at times mechanical. The
interaction between players who have been teammates for little more
than two weeks could not become instinctive in time for the first
weekend, and is unlikely for the home opener.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Rockets have had to earn every basket, often
individually. But the first two games might have shown the defense
has improved enough to offer signs of promise when the offense
catches up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a lot of plays breaking down,'' Rockets forward Matt
Bullard said. ``Guys aren't in the right spots or guys cut too
quick or too slow, and guys have to try to go one-on-one at the
shot clock. And sometimes, we're taking the quick shot. That's
stuff that will get a lot better for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tomjanovich: ``Everything is not working smoothly. We're
getting to know each other. We do the plays, but in time, will run
the plays but it will be just playing basketball. Now we're
thinking, `I've got to be over there, be over there.'''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Rockets and their sense of urgency born of building
around three stars without years left to grow, patience does not
come easily at the tail end of careers.
</P>
<P>
   But like playing 50 games in 90 days, as the Rockets head to
their home debut, the first weekend might have shown this season
patience might &UR;  &LR; have to be a fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always pressure to win,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It's
also a reality that the first time they heard me talk about
basketball was two weeks ago. If the league was that easy, then the
trophies we won don't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The banners above the court tonight remind that they do. And if
the start had rough moments, they were not too great to believe
Saturday's hugs will be the last.
