<HEADLINE> Italian Chiappucci Fails Blood Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Leading Italian rider Claudio
Chiappucci was forced out of the Tour of Romandie cycling race on
Thursday after failing a blood test, according to a report from
the Swiss news agency ATS.
</P>
<P>
Chiappucci's licence has been suspended for 15 days when he
will be re-tested.
</P>
<P>
International Cycling Union (UCI) officials tested Chiappucci
and several other riders before the 173-kilometer second stage
from Le Locle to Estavayer-le-lac.
</P>
<P>
Blood tests were introduced in January to help combat the use
of EPO (erythropoietin) and injectable blood-doping substances
that simulate altitude training by increasing the number of
oxygen-rich red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
If tests show a rider's level is above 50 percent he is
automatically suspended.

<HEADLINE> Ross: Difficulties Remain in Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- United States special Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross said today that problems still remain in
peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting with Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat in Gaza this afternoon, Ross said
that serious difficulties need to be solved before the talks
could be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters that he discussed difficult issues with
the US envoy, adding "everything was up for discussion,"
however, he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Marwan Kanafani, Arafat's spokesman, said that the issue of
Jewish settlements, in Jerusalem particular, as "a block,"
was stressed by Arafat to Ross at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Ross is doing a great job," said Kanafani, but he expressed
his hope that Ross will also understand that "nothing could be
moved without stopping the Israeli settlement activities."
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here Wednesday for meetings with Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, amid hopes for a new US initiative that
might break the two-month impasse in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Media reports said Ross brings proposals that include
tradeoffs such as an Israeli freeze on settlement construction
and the PNA resuming the sharing of intelligence information,
which was cut off in March.
</P>
<P>
Ross made no comment as he entered the Prime Minister's
Office Wednesday night for talks with Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu. Cabinet secretary Danny Naveh, and advisers Dore Gold
and Yitzhak Molcho joined them for the first part of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a senior US official warned that any further
delay in resuming peace negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians could lead to more violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Before traveling to Gaza today, Ross met with Netanyahu
again, as well as Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, and Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
The US official, who was reportedly to be close to the
meetings, said that the violent confrontation between Israel and
the Palestinians following the beginning of the construction at
Har Homa would return if there is no progress in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between the two sides stalled in March
after Israel started to build a controversial new Jewish
neighborhood at Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) on the
southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the construction
before talks can resume, while, Israel is insisting that the
PNA crack down on terror and reestablish full security
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Senior Netanyahu aide David Bar-Ilan said Wednesday he
expected Ross's presence would lead to progress.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever Ross is here there is some movement in the
peace process and it is usually positive," Bar-Ilan said,
while cautioning against expecting a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Ross is to hold another round of talks with Netanyahu
later today, before meeting with Arafat again Friday in
Ramallah in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The US envoy's visit comes a day after Weizman met with
Arafat at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza
Strip, in an effort to break the deadlock in the talks
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
After that meeting, Weizman said Arafat agreed to resume
contacts between senior security officials, but the Palestinians
conditioned this on the presence of US officials at all
meetings.

<HEADLINE> UK New Car Sales Up 12 Pct in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- New car sales in Britain surged
strongly last month, up 12.3 percent to 182,747, compared with
162,618 in April 1996, according to figures issued today by the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
</P>
<P>
The SMMT said that although the motor industry traditionally
enjoyed an upturn in the spring, this year's rise was bigger than
expected and followed a disappointing performance in March.
</P>
<P>
The society's chief executive, Ernie Thompson, said that the
figures were most encouraging and the increase came from private
buyers drawn to showrooms by millions of pounds spent by
manufacturers on discounts and advertising.
</P>
<P>
Private buyers accounted for 40 percent of April's sales. They
bought 80,000 cars last month, up 10,000 on the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers did not feel Britain's recent rise in interest
rates would dent sales growth, and they were hopeful that the
trend would continue.
</P>
<P>
April's figures lifted sales so far this year to 732,281, 5.5
percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, imports continue to take a large share of the market,
accounting for 65 percent of all new car sales, up from 61.3
percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Ford continues to lead the market, although its market share
was down to 18 percent last month from 19.1 percent in April last
year.
</P>
<P>
Vauxhaul's share was down to 14.1 percent from 15.2 percent and
Rover at 9.9 percent, down from 10.3 percent last April.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Approves Tax Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives today approved in the third reading its own
version of the country's income tax exemption reform.
</P>
<P>
Under the house version, spouses with four children or a family
of six will enjoy 146,000 peso (5,570 U.S. dollar) tax exemption,
according to reports of the state television.
</P>
<P>
The House version also gives substantial tax break to
corporations to encourage foreign investors to put their money in
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, corporations can choose between the modified
gross income tax of 15 percent or 35 percent based on net income.
</P>
<P>
The bill will soon go to the House-Senate joint committee for
final discussion.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here believe that a House-Senate clash is bound to
occur since the Senate is pushing for only 96,000 peso (3,664
dollar) exemption for a family of six.
</P>
<P>
Reform on personal income tax was the third and last part of
the Comprehensive Tax Reform Package launched by the government to
improve its poor financial position.
</P>
<P>
The first two parts, restructuring of oil taxes and the shift
from ad valorem to specific taxes (based on sales volumes) on beer
and cigarettes, were signed into law last year.
</P>
<P>
The congressional passage of the tax reform package has been
set as a precondition for the Philippines' exit from the
supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this June.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1960s, the Philippines has been under the IMF's
strict supervision of its economic performance due to serious
economic problems.

BONN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Spaniard Felix Mantilla stunned Boris
Becker of Germany 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 to reach the quarter-finals of
the 2.3 million U.S. dollars German Open in Hamburg on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion who is uncomfortable on
slow red clay, has never won this tournament in 11 attempts.
</P>
<P>
Mantilla used a powerful forehand and scored repeatedly with
passing shots as the eighth-seeded Becker charged in vain to the
net.
</P>
<P>
Marcelo Rios of Chile, champion in Monte Carlo last week,
crashed out against 19th-ranked Spaniard Alberto Berasategui.
</P>
<P>
Rios, ranked seventh in the world and seeded fifth here, was
overwhelmed 6-4, 6-1 by Berasategui, who will next meet
19-year-old German Tommy Haas.
</P>
<P>
Haas, who upset fourth-seeded Carlos Moya of Spain in the
second round, rallied for a 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 win over compatriot
Oliver Gross.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine, winner here in 1994 and 1995, also
booked a quarter-final berth after beating Spanish qualifier

<HEADLINE> Russia-NATO Accord Almost Ready: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- An accord defining future Russia-NATO
relations is close to be ready and Moscow is expecting its
finalization next week, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the Russia-NATO agreement was "about 98
percent ready" for signing, and he hoped the text would be
finalized during talks in Moscow between Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
scheduled for May 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
The Primakov-Solana meeting is intended to pave the way for the
endorsement of an agreement signed by Yeltsin and NATO heads of
state and government on May 27 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin reiterated Russia's opposition to NATO's
eastward expansion plan, saying "we call on all intelligent forces
in the world and especially Europe to be very careful in this
situation."
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after laying a wreath at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier by the Kremlin walls, to mark the 52nd anniversary
of the Russian victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Primakov and Solana held their latest talks in Luxemburg on May
6, during which they agreed on some rewording of the text but
failed to reach a complete identity.
</P>
<P>
According to news sources, the outstanding differences have
something to do with security issues after NATO's eastern
expansion, which will probably include Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary, three former Soviet bloc countries, into
the powerful European organization.
</P>
<P>
The enlarged NATO will extend its frontier directly to the
borders of former Soviet Union republics in Russia's influence
sphere including Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Alerted over possible military threat from NATO, Russia has
always insisted that it should have the right to take part in
NATO's decision on all important issues concerning its security
and NATO should not deploy weapons, particularly nuclear ones, in
its new member countries.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Press Secretary of the Russian President,
Wednesday urged NATO and its major member states to make further
efforts so as to find "the way both sides can accept."

MOGADISHU, May 8 (Xinhua)-- The radio supporting Somali
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid has accused its Finance
Minister Abdulle Saed Jinni Boqor for corruption and funds
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
A commentary issued today by the radio, the Voice of the People,
has accused Jinni Boqor for misusing Somali Shillings 463 millions
which is close to 60,000 U.S.Dollars allocated for the radio
operations.
</P>
<P>
It said that Jinni Boqor has paid only Somali Shillings 37
million worth of 5000 U.S.Dollars from the annual budget of the
radio estimated to be 500 million Shillings which about US
$63,000.
</P>
<P>
However, the commentary said the operations and the programs
of the radio will not stop for such corruptive actions against
them.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu has been quiet today after days of shelling between
the supporters of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of Osmann Ali
Atto. South Mogadishu's radios supporting the two faction leaders
also seemed to have stopped the propaganda campaign they earlier
used against each other. The people in Mogadishu see this as a
positive sign towards reconciliation between the two Habar Gidir
clan leaders.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Vows to Topple Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's opposition Labor party
is to present a non-confidence motion when the Knesset
(Parliament) reconvenes on May 19, as part of its intensified
campaign to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Labor lawmakers at today's special
session of the Knesset, which is currently at Spring recess but
called to debate eight urgent motions on current political
situation and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Most lawmakers failed to appear at the chamber, but those who
attended from the Labor and the ruling coalition traded
accusations over issues ranging from Jerusalem, settlement
expansion to the peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Labor lawmakers charged the Likud-led government with having
virtually killed the peace process, warning that this could lead
to military confrontation with the Arabs, perhaps within the
year.
</P>
<P>
The coalition members rejected the accusations, saying that
the previous Labor government sold itself off to the Arab
partners. Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi said the Likud
government was committed to promoting the peace process, but in
a much more cautious and responsible way in order not to damage
the security interests of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Hanegbi also denounced Labor lawmaker Yossi Beilin, one of
chief designers of Oslo accords, for holding talks recently with
Palestinian, Jordanian and Egyptian leaders on the peace
process. He said Beilin was trying to sabotage the government's
policies.
</P>
<P>
Beilin, a major contender for Labor leadership, countered
Hanegbi's accusation by saying that the Likud government in fact
had no policy and even did not know how to deal with the
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Meretz lawmaker Ranan Cohen said that the Likud
policies was leading the peace process to nowhere, and could
result in new intifada, or Palestinian uprising.
</P>
<P>
In a move to split the ruling coalition, opposition lawmakers
approached the centrist party The Third Way, which is a breakaway
party from the Labor, urging its lawmakers to quit the
government.
</P>
<P>
During the recent Bar-On scandal which involved the
appointment of former Attorney-General, The Third Way once
threatened to quit the coalition but later decided to stay on
after Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Hanegbi escaped
indictments. Netanyahu has reportedly promised the party to
reshuffle the cabinet so to repair the damage caused by the
Bar-On affair.
</P>
<P>
Avigdor Kahalani, leader of The Third Way, said today that he
rejected the Labor's appeal to topple the government. "I will do
the best to keep this government stronger than we are now," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset will reconvene on May 19 after the current Spring
recess. Under the Israeli law, the government will only be
forced to step down when it loses its 61 majority in the
120-seat Knesset. The Likud government is now holding 66
seats.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Speaks About Hong Kong Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in an
interview with Andrea Koppel, Beijing Bureau chief of the Cable
News Network (CNN) here today, said that the Chinese government
would abide by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) after the territory returns to the
motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that he himself, as General Secretary of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, President of China, and
Chairman of the Central Military Commission, will abide by the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
And he expressed the hope that Hong Kong residents and the 1.2
billion people in the mainland will also abide by the law.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes that the chief executive of the SAR
government will also act in line with the law, and it is certain
that issues concerning Hong Kong will be handled in accordance
with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the return of Hong Kong is a creative way to
resolve questions left over from the past between China and
Britain, using Deng Xiaoping's concept of "One country, two
systems".
</P>
<P>
Some people may have concerns about Hong Kong after its return,
Jiang said, but facts will prove that the concerns are
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
"We have promulgated the Basic Law," he said, and after Hong
Kong's return, the various rights and freedoms that Hong Kong
residents enjoy will be guaranteed by the law.
</P>
<P>
As long as there is no interference from external forces, we
are convinced that the "One country, two systems", "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong", and "high degree of autonomy"
policies will be successfully implemented, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Chinese National People's Congress has
authorized the Hong Kong SAR to exercise a high degree of autonomy
and that it is vested with administrative, legislative and
independent judicial powers, including the right of final appeal
that Hong Kong has never had before.
</P>
<P>
He explained that, except for changes in establishing the final
appeal court, the judicial system as it has originally existed in
Hong Kong, will be retained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the management of media in Hong Kong will come
under the SAR's authority. "We believe the SAR government will be
able to manage it well," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> American Chip-maker Introduces Fast Microprocessor to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The US's Intel Corporation has
introduced to China its latest line of microprocessors, Pentium
II, whose floating computing capacity can hit 300 Mhz, the fastest
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts think the new product can markedly improve the
information management capabilities of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 local PC makers have installed the new chips in
their products. Craig R. Barrett, the president-elect of Intel,
was present for the introduction and spoke about PCs in business.
</P>
<P>
He said that Intel's flash memory production venture is going
smoothly and is expected to be operational next year. Intel is
negotiating with Chinese departments on the second phase of
construction, which involves an amount of investment similar to
the first phase.
</P>
<P>
He said that in future Intel will introduce its latest
technology as soon as it becomes available to help China's
information technology keep up with the world.
</P>
<P>
According to an Intel official, there used to be a gap between
China's computer market and the world's most advanced, but that
has disappeared. As one of the fastest-growing marketplaces, China
has a "strategic stance" in Intel's global network.
</P>
<P>
The introduction ceremony was broadcast live via Internet to
the rest of the world, the first use of this kind of Web broadcast
in China.
</P>
<P>
Intel is the world's leading microprocessor producer. Its
global sales topped 20 billion US dollars last year.

ROME, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Four-time defending champion Conchita
Martinez of Spain advanced into the Italian Open semi-finals with
a 6-0, 6-4 victory over South Africa's Joannette Kruger here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the third-seeded Martinez showed some vulnerability in the
second set, dropping three straight games to fall behind 3-2 and
later wasting four match points in the ninth game.
</P>
<P>
Kruger, a South African ranked 121st in the world, had made the
Italian Open quarter-finals by ousting No. 8 seed Karina Habsudova
of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The other quarter-final pairings Friday had No. 2 Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario of Spain against Swiss Patty Schnyder; No. 7 Irina
Spirlea of Romania against No. 11 Austrian Barbara Paulus; and
No. 10 Mary Pierce against No. 14 Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania.

Pierce knocked out top seed American Monica Seles in Thursday's

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  Sino-Cameroun Economic and Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Though Cameroun and China are far
away from each other, mountains and seas can not obstruct the
friendly exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The fruitful results of the exchanges are seen here in
Cameroun in various domains, and the Cameroun Conference Center
sitting on the top of the Yaounde Mountain witnesses Chinese
people's sincere friendship toward Camerounian people.
</P>
<P>
The Center was built in 1972 by Chinese engineers following
the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Cameroun
in 1971. Since then, hundreds of Chinese technicians and workers
have been sent here to help Cameroun fulfill its various
construction programs ranging from hydro-power station,
high-voltage power transmission and the enlargement of the
Mbalamayo hospital to the restoration of the crippled women
sewing workshop.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade cooperation between the two countries
has made an encourging progress over the past 26 years. In line
with the deepening of China's economic reforms and opening up the
country to the outside world in recent years, China has
readjusted its external trade system and increased imports from
Cameroun. At the same time, following Cameroun's national
economic revitalization, China has added new items to its export
lists to the country while retaining the traditional ones. The
economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has thus
entered a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, the Sino-Cameroun trade volume
reached 35 million US dollars as against the only 10 to 25
million US dollars before 1994. In 1996, it rocketed to 46
million US dollars. This year it is expected to be over 50
million US dollars and that will be a new record in the history
of trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Among Cameroun's trade partners today, China ranks the 10th in
import and claims the 13th in export, thus becoming one of
Cameroun's most important trade partners.
</P>
<P>
During the last 26 years, the economic and technological
cooperation between China and Cameroun has made remarkable
achievements. Four agreements on economic and technological
cooperation have been reached by the two sides. With the discount
loan granted by the Chinese government, China has finished the
construction of 10 plants with another one still going on and
three others soon to be started.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the 1980s, China and Cameroun started to develop
various kinds of cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit. Many
joint ventures have been established, and a tractor assembly
plant and a tyre plant are to be set up in the near future. At
the same time, some of the Chinese enterprises have entered the
Cameroun market. They have been engaged in a wide range of
contracted projects, such as housing, road construction and well
drilling. Statistics show that from 1982 to 1996, Chinese
enterprises have signed 156 contracts worth 157 million US
dollars with the Camerounian counterparts and the turnover has
amounted to 62.99 million US dollars. The opening of Chinese
shops in Yaounde and the economic capital Douala has made it
possible for Camerounians to buy their favorite Chinese goods
locally.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Cameroun are developing countries, and the
differences between the two countries with regard to their
resources, economic structures and industrial setup require the
two countries to further reinforce their economic and trade
cooperation which will complement and benefit each other.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun, also known as "Africa in miniature", is situated in
the heart of Africa with rich natural resources. It has a surface
area of 475,000 square kilometers with a forest coverage of 47
percent. It is rich in trees such as ebony, teak and mahogany,
making it the 4th largest timber producer in the world. At
present, it produces 2 million cubic meters of timber annually,
of which about 40 percent is exported. It is estimated that
timber production could be raised to over 5.5 million cubic
meters annually if transport and other facilities are improved.
Cameroun is also rich in mineral resources. The proved reserves
of bauxite stand at 100 million tons; the reserves of iron is
estimated at 1600 million tons; the reserves of crude oil amount
to 100 million cubic meters and natural gas 1150 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
However, Cameroun's local market is flooded with imported
manufactured goods because its economy depends very much on
imports. The main import items include food, medicines, drinks,
energy and lubricants, transport equipment and tractors,
agricultural implements and industrial equipments. Chinese
commodities are warmly welcomed in Cameroun for their excellent
qulity and reasonable prices. Machinery and electrical equipments
are mostly favoured by the local people.
</P>
<P>
Since the Sino-Cameroun trade volume accounts for only 1.5
percent of Cameroun's total import and export volume, the two
countries should increase their exchanges and expand cooperation
in various fields to boost their economic development.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The leaders of six African countries, including President
Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, met in Gabon and suggested that Zaire's
transitional parliament elect a leader who would assume power if
Mobutu resigned. Diplomats doubted that the rebel leader Kabila
would consider the proposal.
</P>
<P>
-- The Republican National Committee announced it was returning
more than 100,000 U.S. dollars in illegal donations from a Hong
Kong company. It was the Republican's first admission that they
had adopted substantially the same practice as the one that had
embroiled the Democrats in scandal.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- FBI investigating that a U.S. government official may
have passed sensitive information to Israeli intelligence began
conducting surveillance of several high-ranking officials of the
State Department and the National Security Council staff in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross sought to restart the
moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, but officials on both
sides played down his chances of success.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton told regional leaders at a summit in
Costa Rica that there will be no mass deportations of Central
Americans under the new U.S. immigration law. The issue has
aroused apprehension in the area.
</P>
<P>
-- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made clear that he
remains poised to boost interest rates further, though he
acknowledged that inflation seems well under control.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that "I hope the US government will be cautious about
the Taiwan issue and will not again let the issue disturb or
affect the improvement and development of Sino-US relations."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader made the statement in an interview with
Andrea Koppel, Beijing Bureau chief of the US Cable News Network
(CNN), here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Taiwan issue concerns China's sovereignty,
territorial integrity, and the great cause of reunification, and
has been the most important and the most sensitive issue in Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that improper handling of the Taiwan issue will cause
twists and turns in the Sino-US relations, and it will be
difficult for the Sino-US relations to develop healthily and
steadily.
</P>
<P>
"The three Sino-US joint communiques formed the foundation for
the Sino-US ties and the key of the communiques is the Taiwan
issue," the Chinese leader pointed out, adding that the US side
has recognized in the communiques that there is only one China in
the world, that Taiwan is part of China, and that the government
of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate
government of China, and that the US side has promised to pursue
the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also said that the Hong Kong and Macao
issues are problems left over from an earlier period of history
between China and relevant countries, while the Taiwan issue is
one left over from China's civil war, and therefore, is one of
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that with the successful solution of the Hong Kong
and Macao issues, he believes that the Taiwan issue will be
solved, and China's great cause of reunification will be
accomplished.

<HEADLINE> Zairian Rebels Urged to Cooperate With U.N. Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations human rights
mission for eastern Zaire today issued a statement, urging Zairian
rebels to allow its investigations into human rights situations in
areas under their control.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the U.N. Joint Investigative Mission for
eastern Zaire deeply regretted that the Alliance of Democratic
Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) had so far
declined to allow it to enter the territory under its control.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the leadership of the ADFL to reflect on its
responsibilities and reconsider its current position," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is generally accepted that there have been massacres and
other grave violations of the right to life and international
humanitarian law in eastern Zaire since September last year," said
mission members in their statement.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the victims have been refugees from Rwanda but Zairois
have also been targeted. There is evidence that various groups are
responsible for such attacks. It is also clear that violations of
human rights are continuing."
</P>
<P>
The mission, set up by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights on
April 15, 1997, planned to investigate what it called a number of
more serious and credible allegations of massacres, so as to
ascertain whether they were carried out in a systematic and
planned manner.
</P>
<P>
They are also charged with investigating which individuals or
groups have been responsible for such killings.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the mission members asked the ADFL to give
its full and unconditional cooperation to help the mission fulfill
the mandate.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their concern that there would be no longer
enough time for the mission to conduct sufficient investigations
in Zaire so as to present a substantive report to the U.N. General
Assembly by June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission consists of three members. They are Roberto
Garreton from Chile, special rapporteur for Zaire, Bacre Waly
Ndiaye from Senegal, special rapporteur for extra-judicial,
summary or arbitrary executions and Jonas Foli from Ghana, a
member of the working group on enforced or involuntary
disappearances.

BUENOS AIRES, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian champions Sporting
Cristal knocked former champions Velez Sarsfield out of the South
American Libertadores Cup thanks to a goal in the dying minute on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Argentines, winners in 1994, had held Cristal to a 0-0
draw in Lima in the first leg of the second round tie but were
unable to capitalise on their apparent advantage against a
well-organised Peruvian defence.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Soto scored the only goal of the match with two minutes
remaining to give Cristal a shock 1-0 win on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for 30 years that a Peruvian team had
won a Libertadores match in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Cristal joined Bolivia's Bolivar, Brazil's Gremio, Argentina's
Racing club and Uruguay's Penarol in the quarter-finals. The

(AA) signed today two sub-leases with Cathay Pacific Airways,
finalizing the airline's plans to build a flight training center
and a stores building at the Chek Lap Kok new airport.
</P>
<P>
The twin developments, adjacent to Cathay Pacific's new
headquarters building which is presently under construction at the
 airport, will be completed soon after the airport's opening in
April 1998.
</P>
<P>
The commitment is worth some 900 million HK dollars (115
million U.S. dollars) and brings Cathay Pacific's total investment
 in corporate facilities at the new airport to 4,900 million HK
dollars (623 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Construction will start as soon as the AA hands over the site
to Cathay Pacific in the middle of the month.
</P>
<P>
The sub-leases, like that of Cathay Pacific's headquarters
development signed with the AA in May 1996, will last until 2047.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely pleased to sign these agreements today as
this puts the final elements of the Cathay Pacific City at Chek
Lap Kok in place," said Philip Chen, deputy managing director of
Cathay Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Designed to house more than 4,000 staff, Cathay Pacific City
comprises the headquarters building with recreational facilities
and a staff hotel, the flight training center and the stores
building.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in the history of Cathay Pacific that
the whole airline will be in a single location," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
With a gross floor area of 16,500 square meters, the flight
training center will house simulators for training flight crew and
 a flight operations safety training school. Cabin and cockpit
crew from Cathay Pacific will benefit from the facilities.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific will transfer its eight simulators from Kai Tak
Airport to the center, which will also house aircraft cabin
mock-ups with inflatable emergency slides, classrooms and
supporting offices.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Step Up Coconut Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Coconut Authority
(PCA) said today that it will step up its campaign against
damaging of the country's coconut trees by strictly enforcing the
Coconut Preservation Act.
</P>
<P>
PCA Administrator Virgilio David said the authority will
intensify monitoring of illegal cutting of coconut trees in
various coconut-producing provinces.
</P>
<P>
He warned that those violating the law will be sued and
punished severely.
</P>
<P>
To protect the country's coconut resources, the government last
year promulgated the preservation law under which violators will
be punished by imprisonment of not less than one year but not more
than six years.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the PCA has the right to request the assistance
of any local government unit to ensure its strict and efficient
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The coconut sector plays an important role in the Philippine
economy, accounting for over 25 percent of the cultivated area and
over 40 percent of the country's agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
The sector provides incomes for at least one-fourth of the
rural families and a significant number of urban people engaged in
coconut-based industries and trade.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Cameroun Economic and Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Though Cameroun and China are far
away from each other, mountains and seas can not obstruct the
friendly exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The fruitful results of the exchanges are seen here in
Cameroun in various domains, and the Cameroun Conference Center
sitting on the top of the Yaounde Mountain witnesses Chinese
people's sincere friendship toward Camerounian people.
</P>
<P>
The Center was built in 1972 by Chinese engineers following
the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Cameroun
in 1971. Since then, hundreds of Chinese technicians and workers
have been sent here to help Cameroun fulfill its various
construction programs ranging from hydro-power station,
high-voltage power transmission and the enlargement of the
Mbalamayo hospital to the restoration of the crippled women
sewing workshop.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade cooperation between the two countries
has made an encourging progress over the past 26 years. In line
with the deepening of China's economic reforms and opening up the
country to the outside world in recent years, China has
readjusted its external trade system and increased imports from
Cameroun. At the same time, following Cameroun's national
economic revitalization, China has added new items to its export
lists to the country while retaining the traditional ones. The
economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has thus
entered a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, the Sino-Cameroun trade volume
reached 35 million US dollars as against the only 10 to 25
million US dollars before 1994. In 1996, it rocketed to 46
million US dollars. This year it is expected to be over 50
million US dollars and that will be a new record in the history
of trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Among Cameroun's trade partners today, China ranks the 10th in
import and claims the 13th in export, thus becoming one of
Cameroun's most important trade partners.
</P>
<P>
During the last 26 years, the economic and technological
cooperation between China and Cameroun has made remarkable
achievements. Four agreements on economic and technological
cooperation have been reached by the two sides. With the discount
loan granted by the Chinese government, China has finished the
construction of 10 plants with another one still going on and
three others soon to be started.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the 1980s, China and Cameroun started to develop
various kinds of cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit. Many
joint ventures have been established, and a tractor assembly
plant and a tyre plant are to be set up in the near future. At
the same time, some of the Chinese enterprises have entered the
Cameroun market. They have been engaged in a wide range of
contracted projects, such as housing, road construction and well
drilling. Statistics show that from 1982 to 1996, Chinese
enterprises have signed 156 contracts worth 157 million US
dollars with the Camerounian counterparts and the turnover has
amounted to 62.99 million US dollars. The opening of Chinese
shops in Yaounde and the economic capital Douala has made it
possible for Camerounians to buy their favorite Chinese goods
locally.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Cameroun are developing countries, and the
differences between the two countries with regard to their
resources, economic structures and industrial setup require the
two countries to further reinforce their economic and trade
cooperation which will complement and benefit each other.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun, also known as "Africa in miniature", is situated in
the heart of Africa with rich natural resources. It has a surface
area of 475,000 square kilometers with a forest coverage of 47
percent. It is rich in trees such as ebony, teak and mahogany,
making it the 4th largest timber producer in the world. At
present, it produces 2 million cubic meters of timber annually,
of which about 40 percent is exported. It is estimated that
timber production could be raised to over 5.5 million cubic
meters annually if transport and other facilities are improved.
Cameroun is also rich in mineral resources. The proved reserves
of bauxite stand at 100 million tons; the reserves of iron is
estimated at 1600 million tons; the reserves of crude oil amount
to 100 million cubic meters and natural gas 1150 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
However, Cameroun's local market is flooded with imported
manufactured goods because its economy depends very much on
imports. The main import items include food, medicines, drinks,
energy and lubricants, transport equipment and tractors,
agricultural implements and industrial equipments. Chinese
commodities are warmly welcomed in Cameroun for their excellent
qulity and reasonable prices. Machinery and electrical equipments
are mostly favoured by the local people.
</P>
<P>
Since the Sino-Cameroun trade volume accounts for only 1.5
percent of Cameroun's total import and export volume, the two
countries should increase their exchanges and expand cooperation
in various fields to boost their economic development.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticizes Turkey-Israel War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today strongly criticized the
planned Turkish-Israeli-U.S. sea war games east of the
Mediterranean, describing it as "provocative and hostile action
agaisnt the Arabs and Muslims."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said
the manoeuvres come "at the expense of the Arabs and Muslims."
</P>
<P>
The planned war games are "an insult to the Arab Mediterranean
countries whose sovereign rights are still usurped by Israel," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at Turkey's participating in the military
exercises with Israel, saying the involvement of Muslim people in
war games with Israel "is an action out of the ordinary."
</P>
<P>
He called upon Ankara to reconsider its participation in the
war games.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's criticism coincides with a current visit by Turkish
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Recai Kutan to Baghdad
for talks on the projected Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have said that the joint maneuvers "will be
of a humanitarian nature and focus on search-and-rescue
scenario," dismissing reports that they are aimed at Iran and
Syria, the alleged long-time foes of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also praised the stand of the Arab League
and some Arab countries in protest against the tripartite war
games.

TOKYO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar plunged to less than
123 yen today, the lowest in about one month, on comments from a top
Japanese official supporting the yen.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was traded at 122.84-87 yen at 5 p.m., down some 0.8
yen from 123.72 yen late Thursday, also below its late New York
level of 123.77 yen overnight, which was its lowest level since
April 3.
</P>
<P>
The dollar, triggered by a yen-supportive comment from Japanese
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, continued to lose ground today.
</P>
<P>
Mitsuzuka told a press conference this morning that he was not
yet satisfied with the current yen-dollar rate.
</P>
<P>
In the past days, the dollar has been retreating from above 127
yen at the end of last month, its highest level against the
Japanese currency in nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
On the Stock Exchange, the key index closed below 20,000 points
as the U.S. dollar's depreciation hurt export-oriented companies'
earning prospects.

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in an
interview with CNN Beijing Bureau chief Andrea Koppel here today,
said he believes that China and the United States will not have

Because China suffered from foreign aggression and expansion in

peace and are concentrating all efforts on developing the economy
and improving people's standard of living.
</P>
<P>
China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace, he said,
and the objective of such a foreign policy is an environment of

development.
</P>

"China's military forces are entirely defensive in nature," he
said, and this year the country's defense expenditures are less
than 10 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with the US and other big powers, our military
expenditures and armament levels are very low," Jiang
explained. "China has never had expansionist intentions," he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the so-called "China Threat", the president said that it
has been fabricated by people with a cold war mentality.

PUSAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese national flag was raised at
the athletes village here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
China has sent a 396-member strong contigent for the second East
Asian Games, which will begin here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the flag-raising ceremony, Mayor of athletes village Samuel S.
Park said that the East Asian Games would bring athletes of the region
together and promote friendship as well as sports standards in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shouzhang, Chief-de-Mission of the Chinese delegation, expressed
his greetings to the host and hoped the games a complete success.
</P>

The Chinese delegation, including 275 athletes, will take part in
14 sports out of 15 on offer. It was expected that Chinese lifters,
gymnasts, athletes, swimmers, shuttlers, divers, martial artists and
judokas would display impressive performance at the games.

<P>
At the first East Asian Games in Shanghai in 1993, China has
collected 105 gold medals, beating Japan and South Korea to the second
and third. Japan and South Korea had 25 and 23 golds respectively.
</P>
<P>
Among the 275 Chinese athletes for the games, 28 took part in the
Asian Games in Hiroshima in 1994 and 42 competed in the Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Shouzhang, China would take the games as a warm-up
for the next Asiad and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We would do our best to win golds, but we have to put our eyes on
the next Asiad in 1998 and the Olympic Games in 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hosts South Korea, another sports power in Asia, may get all
out to prove their strength in the games.
</P>
<P>
About 1,900 athletes and officials from nine countries and regions
including Guam, Mongolia, Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei and Kazakhstan
will take part in the 201 events of 15 sports in the 10-day games.

<HEADLINE> Former S. African Defense Minister Urged to Seek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) today issued a final appeal to former
Defense Minister Magnus Malan to apply for amnesty before Saturday's
deadline for applications.
</P>
<P>
TRC Deputy Chairman Alex Boraine told reporters that the commission
had noted Malan's decision not to seek amnesty with "deep concern".
</P>
<P>
The TRC, chaired by retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, is
a special fact-finding group authorized by the government to investigate
violent activities and crimes committed by people in the course of
defending or fighting apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Tutu announced May 10 as the deadline for people seeking amnesty
for crimes committed. He said last week that anyone failing to come
forward to confess by the ultimatum would be liable to prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"It is my opinion that he (Malan) would be well advised not only
in terms of reconciliation but in terms of his own self-interest to
apply for amnesty," Boraine said.
</P>
<P>
Malan told a special TRC hearing in Cape Town on Wednesday that he
had authorized many cross-border raids, approved in principle the
establishment of the notorious Civil Cooperation Bureau, and helped
set up South Africa's chemical and biological warfare program.
</P>
<P>
He also took moral and politcal responsiblity for the actions of
South African defence force members during the 1970s when he was
defence force chief, and later as defense minister under then state
president P W Botha.
</P>
<P>
During that period, he had issued orders and authorized operations
which had led to the deaths of innocent civilians in cross-fire.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that cross-border raids had "caused bloodshed",
but said he would not apply for amnesty for them as he considered
them legal actions of the state.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia must do more to meet the
needs of children, UNICEF Australia Chief Executive Gaye Phillips
said in Sydney today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a public inquiry into Australian children's rights
being conducted by the U.N. Joint Standing Committee on Treaties,
Phillips said it is time that Australia started putting children
first.
</P>
<P>
She called on the federal government to establish a position of
 independent commissioner for children, the Australian Association
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The report did not mention major problems facing the nation's
children, but there are local newspaper reports about mistreatment
of and violence against children, especially those of ethnic
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
Under a proposal made by UNICEF Australia, a commissioner for
children would monitor and report on children's rights, "provide
an effective voice for children and young people" and "advocate
strongly for their interests when political decisions are being
made."
</P>
<P>
Phillips said Australia has an obligation to safeguard
children's rights as it is a signatory to a U.N. treaty on the
issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The world's first commercial
sea-borne space satellite launch platform has completed the
successful trials in Stavanger, Norway, the Daily Telegraph
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The platform, made from a former North Sea oil rig, will send
its first satellite into space next year. It will compete in the
satellite market along with its sister ship as part of a 350
million pounds (about 560 U.S. dollars) project.
</P>
<P>
The sister vessel is being fitted out at Govan, Glasgow,
Britain, as a floating rocket assembly factory, providing crew,
accommodation and a mission control.
</P>
<P>
The launch platform is one of the world's largest
semi-submersible vessels, with an empty displacement of 31,000
tons. It is about to leave for Russia to have rocket launching
equipment installed.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the platform's final destination is Long
Beach, California, and a launch is planned for June, next
year. The first of 18 scheduled launches will be a communications
satellite.
</P>
<P>
The launch site has been chosen because it is on the equator
and provides the shortest route into orbit for the geostationary
satellites.

<HEADLINE> Mounting Crime Hampers Foreign Investment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Mounting crime, poor roads and
unreliable tele-communication systems are among the elements that
hamper foreign investment in Malawi, the World Bank said in a
report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said there is particular concern over increasing
property theft including burglary, vehicle theft and theft from
businesses by employees.
</P>
<P>
"Besides direct losses incurred by these thefts, businesses
have had to incur extra costs to increase their security forces
and systems," it said.
</P>
<P>
Uneasiness about personal security also prevails. According to
the police, over the past two years armed robbery has constituted
41 percent of all crimes, murder 28 percent and car theft 8.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, legal flaws are to blame. For example, when
thieves are caught red-handed, if the police are unable to gather
sufficient evidence within 48 hours they have to let the suspects
go.
</P>
<P>
As criminals are easily able to get back on the street with
minimum risk of penalties, they quickly become bolder and more
organized.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank called for Malawi's police authority to wage a
nationwide campaign to fight against all forms of crimes and to
maintain public law and order.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said it should be made clear that democracy does
not mean indiscipline and that freedom does not mean people are
free to do whatever they want at the expense of others.

JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu held a secret meeting with King Hussein of Jordan
Thursday in the Red Sea resort of Aqaba on water differences
between the two countries, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed Israel's promises on sharing water
with Jordan and ways to bring the stalled Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came after Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan canceled
his meeting with Netanyahu due to the water dispute earlier this
week. They were originally to held political talks on bilateral
issues and the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Hassan's move was in protest to Israel's
failure to implement the water article in the Jordanian-Israeli
peace treaty signed in 1994, which stipulates that Jordan shall
obtain 150 million cubic meters of water from Israel to cover
Jordan's urgent needs.
</P>
<P>
Israel has allocated one third of the promised amount of water
to Jordan, which is demanding more in order to alleviate a severe
water shortage. But Netanyahu has rejected Jordan's
request.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Test Link of Hormone Therapy and Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A million British women aged between
50 and 64 are to be invited to take part in a unique study to find
whether hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of breast
cancer, the Daily Telegraph reported here today.
</P>
<P>
As many as 2 million women in Britain are thought to be on
hormone replacement therapy, which is known to help prevent
osteoporosis, the weakening of bones that often comes with age.
But there have been persistent fears that it may increase the risk
of breast cancer and possibly thrombosis and cancer of the womb.
</P>
<P>
The new study, jointly announced Thursday by the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund and the NHS breast screening program, will
provide firm answers to those questions, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 1.5 million women offered a breast screening test
each year will be asked to complete a 41-question form that asks
whether they are on hormone replacement therapy or not, and if so
which brand, together with other health details.
</P>
<P>
The study will then follow the medical histories of the first
one million women who complete the form to see whether there is
any link between those who are on hormone replacement therapy and
those who subsequently develop breast cancer, heart disease or
other conditions.
</P>
<P>
The study has already started in some centers and it is hoped
that more than 250,000 women will be recruited by the end of this

LUSAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-nine percent of Zambia's
national population are currently under poverty line, compared
with 76 percent last year, according to preliminary estimates by

unit of the office, showed that many Zambians have managed to
cope with negative impact of the Structural Adjustment Program
projected by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wool Prices Fall Again As Market Softens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Wool prices ended their uphill run
this week, with the eastern market indicator falling 18 Australian
cents (14 U.S. cents) to close at 660 cents (515 U.S. cents) per
kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters in a news release said
today that the fall follows a series of price rises since the
Easter break, resulting from tightening supply.
</P>
<P>
The wool market softened at sales in Melbourne and Sydney this
week due to a lack of competition, with overseas customers
unwilling to pay higher prices, the council said.
</P>
<P>
It said 71,236 bales were offered at auction this week, with a
pass-in rate of 11.3 percent and the western market indicator
remained at 631 cents (492 U.S. cents) per kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
"The market may ease further next week, due to the large
offering of 110,568 bales nationally and as a result of resistance
to higher prices, exporters are hopeful of price rises in late May
or early June as supply contracts," the council said.
</P>
<P>
Beyond May, offering would be much smaller, it added. "This
indicates that although further easing is expected next week,
prices will consolidate and reach levels of support."

<HEADLINE> Hainan Auctions Off Bankrupt State-Owned Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 9 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province has
auctioned off a state-owned textile mill that had declared
bankruptcy after it became debt-ridden.
</P>
<P>
The Hainan Modern Industries Conglomerate bought the bankrupt
Haikou Textile Printing and Dyeing Mill for a price of 80 million
yuan at a public auction yesterday afternoon, local sources say.
</P>
<P>
The mill, a state-owned business in Haikou, the provincial
capital, had accumulated a total of 361.98 million yuan in
debts because of bad management practices, a shortage of technical
personnel, and non-competitive products when it declared
bankruptcy. Its total assets were 212.86 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Xing Yechuan, chairman of the board of the Hainan Modern
Industries Conglomerate, says that they will spend money so that
the mill can produce goods competitive on the market. Xing said
the enterprise will find work for mill employees or make other
arrangements according to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial official, the island province, which
is China's largest special economic zone, has plans to let five
other state-owned enterprises declare bankruptcy. It will also go
ahead with a takeover of 17 other poorly-performing state-owned
companies this year, to increase reforms of state-owned
enterprises, according to local sources.

<P>
There is an exhibition of works of artist Tonio Trzebinski
between 1978 and 1997 in the hall at the National Museum.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti thanked 28 Kenyan companies which sponsored the
exhibition, saying its success came from the linkage between
talent and financiers.
</P>
<P>
No culture can exist without art and music which has to be
nurtured from the local talent, he stressed, calling for more
patronage between art and music and the private Kenyan companies.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has taken a leading role in promoting
culture through the annual display of music and drama and was
aware of the need to support artists in such exhibitions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Isahakia, the Director-General of the museum, noted
that such exhibitions would effectively foster the cultural
tourism in the eastern African country. enditem

<P>
SHENYANG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The people's congress of Liaoning
Province in northeast China has passed Labor Market Management
Regulations that are expected to make the labor markets more legal
and help state-owned enterprises streamline their workforce,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning first opened labor markets in 1986, and after more
than a decade of development, they have become more important for
both jobless people and state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Last year, of the 1.2 million jobless who turned to labor
markets for help, 740,000 people found employment.
</P>
<P>
Being a major industrial province, Liaoning has had some real
headaches in trying to solve its unemployment problem. It is
estimated that 759,000 people are going to be looking for jobs
this year.

MOSCOW, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin today
congratulated Russian citizens on the occasion of the Victory Day.

May 9 will touch the deepest chords in our souls and evoke noble
thoughts both today and for centuries to come."

Fifty-two years ago Soviet people defeated the German fascists
in the Great Patriotic war, which left more than 20 million Soviet
people dead.
</P>

"By winning the Victory," Yeltsin said, "the nation upheld its
right to life and freedom. No one can imagine, however, the degree
of suffering that the war brought to each family."
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that those war times brought back "a
feeling of dignity, without which freedom and democracy can never
be achieved. They sharpened the understanding of a great benefit
of peaceful life."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin praised the veterans for their actions to save the
motherland and defend the freedom of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is indebted to you forever, and the debt can never be

This year, Yancheng city will devote more of its effort to
off-shore fisheries and processing of aquatic products, and will
draw more overseas investment to develop large tracts of land.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Develops New Irrigation Technique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Agricultural Research
Institute (KARI) has developed a new irrigation technique to
enable small-scale farmers to improve their produce.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Research, Science and Technology Maalim Mohammed
said the project has been successfully piloted among 1,000
small-scale farmers at Eldoret and Uasin Gishu districts,
northwestern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The minister asked KARI to consider introducing patent
protection to prevent the technology from being illegally copied.
</P>
<P>
The important factor behind the technical breakthrough is
water harnessing and management, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-level drip irrigation system was originally designed
for use in the production of horticultural crops using very
little water.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that farmers in remote and drought-stricken
parts of the east African country especially find the technique
useful.
</P>
<P>
The innovation is a brainchild of KARI in collaboration with
Chapin Third World Projects.

NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- At least five people died and 89
others were admitted to hospital following an outbreak of cholera in
Mandera District, northeast Kenya, the Daily Nation reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that 10 of those admitted were in critical
condition and a ward at the Mandera District Hospital had been
set aside to cater for the rising number of cholera patients.
</P>

Mohammed Irshad, the District Officer of Health, was quoted as
saying that more than 1,500 people suffering from diarrhoea had
been treated at the hospital in the past one week.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 9 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of woman
workers who were laid-off in Wenzhou city in Zhejiang Province in
east China have begun to make a living by going into business, and
some have become successful managers.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 120,000 woman workers in state-owned or
collective enterprises in the city, nearly a third of whom lost
their jobs because their employers were not doing well.
</P>
<P>
Pan Xiuhong, 39, was laid off in 1993 by a chemical plant, but
didn't sit around waiting for help to arrive. Instead she managed
to borrow 80,000 yuan and started a shrimp paste factory.
</P>
<P>
To see that product quality remained high, Pan often worked at
gathering fresh shrimp until late at night. But, the fact that she
was illiterate kept her business from doing well. So, she became
her daughter's classmate in third grade in a local primary school.
</P>
<P>
The more educated Pan began to learn how to make her company
compete more profitably, and her factory now has assets worth nine
million yuan, an astronomical figure for most ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
And there are not just a few successful women like Pan in the
city. Out of more than 90 woman entrepreneurs in Lucheng district,
35 are former laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Less competent laid-off female workers have also become
self-employed, and work in one third of the individually-run
firms, and nearly half the taxi drivers are from their ranks.
</P>
<P>
Some laid-off female workers have joined the migrating groups
of laborers and are doing well in other parts of the
country.

NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (Habitat) has set up a global urban observatory unit
to monitor and research human settlements conditions and trends
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
It will also be mainly responsible for analysing the impacts
of policies and programs on shelter and human settlements, Wally
N'Dow, the chief executive of the center, was quoted by today's
Kenyan Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move, with a final goal of making settlements more
sustainable, follows proposals of the Habitat Agenda, a global
plan of action resulting from Istanbul Habitat II Summit in 1996,
he said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
"Habitat is asked first, to provide guidelines for monitoring
and evaluating the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the
national and local levels, and second, to facilitate a global
exchange of information about successful policies and programs
for improving both urban and rural living environments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jay Moor, the coordinator of the urban indicators program,
added that the new organization will help governments, local
authorities and various non-governmental groups amplify their
knowledge concerned and help them form proper urban policies.

HANGZHOU, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Auctions of calligraphy or
paintings have been doing a brisk business in Hangzhou, the
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, making it one of the
most auction-conscious cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 auctions have been held in the last year. They're
usually held on the weekends and the opening prices are low enough
to attract the attention of ordinary urban dwellers to get them to
take part.
</P>
<P>
The calligraphy and painting auction department of the Zhejiang
International Commodities Auction Center holds auctions at the end
of each month in Hangzhou and other cities in the province, with
as high as 86 percent of the goods ending up sold.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 300 businesses involved in selling
calligraphy or paintings in the province, a third of which are in
Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Increasing incomes and the city's history are often cited as
reasons for the good auction business.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Removes Buildings Affecting Kublai Khan Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Cultural relics authorities have
torn down some new buildings that damaged part of a city wall
built by the Emperor Kublai Khan more than 700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Kublai Khan, the first emperor of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368),
began construction of his capital in Beijing in 1267, and moved
into the city in 1272. The Italian traveller Marco Polo was
received by him in Beijing at that time.
</P>
<P>
The rammed earth wall, the only remainder of which was a
12-kilometer-long section in downtown Beijing, was listed among
the first group of cultural relics under municipal protection in
1957.
</P>
<P>
Government departments are investigating the matter of who was
responsible for building nine two-story office and residential
buildings on the site, the Beijing Urban Planning Bureau's
Supervision and Examination Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"The buildings have not only destroyed the site, but have also
had a negative impact on surrounding areas," said Wang Hongnian,
an official with the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that developers violated a state law on the
protection of cultural relics, and that the illegal buildings
must be torn down.
</P>
<P>
"The site provides important research materials for the study
of ancient city construction and planning. It is also valuable for
research into Beijing's history," Wang said, "It should have been
better protected."
</P>
<P>
The departments of cultural relics and urban planning inspected
the site jointly in early April after they received reports from
people living near the site. They discovered that the buildings
had been built without approval by a tree-planting brigade of the
Beijing Forest and Park Bureau and an advertising company.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Vows to Fight Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
has adopted some measures to crack down upon organized crime,
especially money-laundering, to ensure its newly-found democracy
and openness to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 1997 International Forensic
Accounting Network Conference in Cape Town on Thursday, Justice
Minister Dullah Omar said it had become "an open season" for
well-organized crime and drug syndicates to make profits by means
of using sophisticated and ingenious methods to evade the police
and customs.
</P>
<P>
Omar said money-laundering, a movement toward deregulation of
national economic and markets, had been made easier by the
internationalization of economies and financial services.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, South African law provide no legal way in
which information could be gathered to track down money
launderers, carry out investigations in foreign countries or
repatriate the proceeds of any crime or the criminals involved.
</P>
<P>
However, this situation changed last year when the parliament
passed several acts in this regard. In addition, the Office for
Serious Economic Offenses has been set up to help track down
economic criminals of various kinds.
</P>
<P>
Omar also said he was encouraged that the business community
had started showing a more positive attitude in reporting
commercial crime and was cooperating with the police in
investigation.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that businesses which reported economic
crime to the police had increased from 20 percent in 1994 to 53
percent in 1996. While the number of cases reported to the police
commercial crime component increased by 7.3 percent from 1995 to
1996.

<HEADLINE> Japan Calls for Diversified Political Framework in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's foreign ministry, in its blue
book for 1997 issued today, calls for a diversified political
framework in the Asia-Pacific region to ensure the country's
security and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In establishing a better political framework in the
Asia-Pacific region, said the book endorsed today by Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's cabinet, Japan should build up
friendship and cooperative ties with such neighboring countries as
China and South Korea while promoting Japan-U.S. relations as the
core of its diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Such a framework is necessary to deal with the changing
structure in international politics created following the end of
Cold War, the ministry said in its 40th annual blue book titled
"Japan's diplomacy in the world where interdependence has
deepened."
</P>
<P>
In summarizing Japan's diplomacy in 1996, the book said, it is
still necessary to ensure national security and prosperity through
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
To meet that end, the government should extend official
development assistance (ODA) more actively, with the support and
understanding from the Japanese people, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan should also do more to solve global problems such as
environmental issues, the book said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo said his government is shifting its focus
from domestic affairs to regional peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is, since becoming a democracy, been preoccupied
with its internal matters to participate in regional
peacekeeping," said Nzo, who is in Zimbabwe's capital of Harare
to attend a meeting on the Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) meeting on politics, defense and security.
</P>
<P>
"But now we have reached a point when we can participate in
peacekeeping when called upon to do so. And peacekeeping does not
only mean deploying troops but assisting with logistical material,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has in the past been accused by some SADC member
states of playing "big brother" and being reluctant to
participate in matters it was not directly interested in.
</P>
<P>
Responding to local daily "The Herald", Nzo said there were no
"problems" existing between South Africa and Zimbabwe, adding "if
there are any differences they are always resolved."
</P>
<P>
"Naturally there have been problems in certain areas of trade
but these problems can be resolved," said Nzo.

<P>
HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) this year faces a combined cereal deficit of
nearly two million tons of maize, wheat, rice and sorghum, local
daily "the Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Official of the SADC regional food security program Phumzile
Mdladla said in a season that experienced a regionally mixed
rainfall pattern from floods to average rainfall and long dry
spells, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Malawi were leading
in their gross cereal harvest as at March 31.
</P>
<P>
While individual country positions were still revisable the
four states currently have 10 million, three million, four
million and two million tons respectively, the 1997/98 yield
projection was generally poor compared to the previous season.
</P>
<P>
"The regional situation so far is not looking as good as we
thought even with the last good rains. Each country had its own
problems to contend with. It was generally a mixed season with no
definite pattern across the region," said the report.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sonia Gandhi Steps Out Of Shadows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW Delhi, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Sonia Gandhi, widow of India's
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, has formally enrolled herself
as a "primary member" of the Congress Party in a move that is
likely to change the political equation both inside and outside
the party.
</P>
<P>
"We warmly welcome her participation in the activities of the
party. Her participation will enthuse, galvanize and electrify the
rank and file and grassroots workers," V. N. Gadgil, spokesman of

the All-India Congress Committee (AICC), said while announcing the
new development at a regular press briefing at the AICC
headquarters here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Congress Constitution, only an active party member is
entitled to become a member of party fora including the Congress
Working Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body of the
party.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi was offered the party presidency in 1991 soon
after the assassination of her husband, but she declined the
offer, saying she wanted to stay away from active politics. She
has since been consistently spurning offers for party posts,
including CWC membership, made to her after Sitaram Kesri assumed
office as the Congress president in September last year.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi's formal entry into the Congress was welcomed by
Congress leaders and members.
</P>
<P>
Hailing her decision, five AICC joint secretaries said in a
statement that Congress members look upon her as the legacy of the
Nehru-Gandhi family and are confident that the party under her
leadership would emerge stronger.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic AICC announcement on Thursday raised high hopes in
the Congress circles about the party getting reinvigorated and
regaining its fighting spirit. Her entry is also a morale booster
for the younger generation of Congressmen to whom the party
leadership was devoid of its traditional appeal and charisma.
</P>
<P>
These upbeat developments in the Congress will inevitably have
an impact on the United Front whose constituents have been feeling
uneasy in one another's company. A rejuvenated Congress holds out
a better appeal to them.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a senior United Front leader, Sonia
Gandhi's joining the Congress would in any way affect the
stability of the United Front government and its vote base.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the biggest opposition party
in the country, hopes to gain from the likely fallout of Sonia
Gandhi's entry into the Congress. The BJP feels that the Sonia
factor will help it more than the Congress. The BJP leadership,
however, prefers to maintain silence at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The Left parties in the United Front are expected to further
distance themselves from the Congress after having disclosed their
aversion to any arrangement that facilitates the Congress'
participation in power.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil Maanila Congress, a constituent of the United Front,
headed by G. K. Moopanar may reconsider its association with the
United Front if Sonia Gandhi accepts a more active role in the
Congress Party. In that case, a realignment of political forces is
not unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Indian Industry Sees Growth in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian industry has projected
a buoyant 8-percent growth for the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1997-98 following the announcement of the budget
and various recent policy changes.
</P>
<P>
In the 47th business outlook survey of the Confederation of
Indian Industry (CII), about 74 percent of the corporate houses
which responded to the CII survey projected a growth rate of 8
percent for the GDP in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
About 59 percent of the respondents said they expected the
industrial growth rate to pass 10 percent while all the
respondents expected a sharp rise in capital investment.
</P>
<P>
This optimism is in sharp contrast to last year's survey, in
which 74 percent of the respondents predicted stagnation or a
slowdown in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the CII, this year's outlook has improved because
of the dramatic policy changes in the last 10 months. "The
depressed industrial output results and the low growth in the last
fiscal year reflect the effect of the virtual standstill in our
economic liberalization in the last two years under the previous
government," CII Secretary-General Tarun Das said.
</P>
<P>
The CII conducted the survey last month to find out industry's
perceptions about the domestic economy after the changes proposed
in the budget, the new export-import policy, the takeover code,
the slack season credit policy and the draft companies bill.
</P>
<P>
The CII has projected a GDP growth rate of 8 percent in
1997-98, with industrial growth estimated at 12 percent and
agricultural growth at 4 percent. The CII has also projected a
20-percent rise in exports, while imports are slated to increase
by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the buoyant financial scenario, the CII has
predicted an inflow of 3.5 billion U.S. dollars of foreign direct
investment and an inflow of 4.5 billion of foreign institutional
investment in 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Joint Effort Help Laid-offs Get New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 laid-off
workers in Shijiazhuang, capital city of north China's Hebei
Province, have found new jobs this year with the help
not only from government but from the rest of society.
</P>
<P>
Shijiazhuang, a major industrial center, was listed as one of
China's pilot cities to experiment with readjustment in capital
structure. As part of this restructuring process, more state-owned
enterprises are expected to go bankrupt or to be merged with other
companies.
</P>
<P>
But, in the process, a much as 35,000 workers will be laid off
this year, sources from the local labor bureau say.
</P>
<P>
To deal with this, the city labor bureau, federation of trade
unions, women's federation, and the commission of commerce and
trade have developed various programs to provide job opportunities
and to help the unemployed find work.
</P>
<P>
Some special businesses have been opened to take these workers
in, and free training courses are also being offered.
</P>
<P>
In a recent week-long job fair, 1,400 people found jobs right
away in the city, and nearly 1,000 signed letters of intent with
employers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cagers Gear Up for Tough Games in East Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese men's under-22 basketball
squad faces a tough road as both South Korea and Japan send in veteran
cagers for the basketball tournament in the Pusan East Asian Games,
team manager Kuang Lubin said at the courtside here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to exploit the current games to prepare for the World
Under-22 Championship to be held in Australia in August and the 2000
Sydney Olympic Games, yet we're not to surrender any games without
exerting our efforts and whetting our prowess," Kuang said as his
disciples were undergoing training at the Kudok Stadium.
</P>
<P>
In the current games, China will vie against six other squads in
the single round-robin tournament, with top four entering the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"We have no upperhands in height against Kazakhstan, both South
Korea, the reigning champions, and Japan pose as chief rivals in the
tournament," the manager said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuang, Kazakhstan boasts of six members with a height
of two meters plus, and China had never played the former soviet
republic in any international meets.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chinese squad is manned by three cagers of the
national squad, spearheaded by 2.12-meter Wang Zhizhi, the South
Korean national squad is not to surrender its title at home turf and
the Japanese nationals also gear up to challenge the hosts, not to
mention China for the silver medal, Kuang explained.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei, fourth-placers in the inaugural meet, also pay keen
attention to the tournament as those cagers had survived some 150
league games in three years wherein only one-on-one tactics are
allowed at the court, a reporter from Chinese Taipei chatted.
</P>
<P>
Other members for the men's tournament include Mongolia and Guam,
both are tipped to be eliminated in the round-robin tournament.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Liberal Economic Policy Recognized: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The economic policy to promote
private investment in Nepal has already been recognized by local
as well as foreign investors, Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur
Chand said.
</P>
<P>
Chand, while inaugurating a business exhibition here Wednesday,
said that the government has adopted a liberal and open market
policy by introducing a number of incentives like tax reductions,
relaxed visa regulations and one-window facility for investors.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister on the occasion assured local businessmen
that his government is willing to listen to the problems faced by
the private sector and try to find their practical solutions.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the role of promotion activities in attracting
foreign investment and increasing the country's export, he
expressed the hope that the Himalayan Expo'97 would provide
greater opportunities for promoting Nepali products on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
About 200 companies from Nepal, India, the United States and
Britain are taking part in the five-day exhibition with the
exhibits including information technology, telecommunication

PUSAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Athletes from nine EAGA members will
compete for 201 gold medals at stake in the second Pusan East Asian
Games, 33 more than the inaugural meet.
</P>
<P>
The number of sports events being staged during the Pusan meet will
rise to 15 categories, two more than the first Shanghai edition.
</P>
<P>
Rowing and bowling with 14 gold medals on offer, regular events
during the Shanghai games, will be downgraded to a demonstration level
during the upcoming meet.
</P>
<P>
Instead, taekwondo, a Korean martial art, wrestling and soft tennis
will be added to the list of regular sports events in the Pusan sports
gala.
</P>
<P>
The number of gold medals of the wrestling events will be reduced
from previous 20 to 16 following a weight readjustment by the world

</P>
<P>
The number of taekwondo gold medals will also be reduced to eight
during the 1997 games.

<HEADLINE> IPE Hosts Electricity Industry Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's electricity industry
experts agreed at a seminar today that it was not the right time
to launch an electricity futures contract, but vowed to undertake
further research into the market to prepare for a future
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Lynton Jones, chief executive of the International Petroleum
Exchange (IPE), the seminar's sponsor, said that IPE would like to
launch a futures contract as soon as the time was right. But the
organization did not want to jeopardize the success of such a
contract by premature actions.
</P>
<P>
"We will concentrate our efforts on developing our
understanding of the industry and market so that when conditions
allow, and the industry feels the time is right, we will be
prepared and ready to take the initiative," he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the seminar said the future development of
the industry was unclear, particularly after the recent change of
the government.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Tony Blair became prime minister after a
landslide victory over John Major's Conservatives on Friday.
</P>
<P>
One of the key preconditions for any successful futures
contract was political, economic and regulatory stability, said
Richard Ward, the IPE's executive vice president for business
development.
</P>
<P>
Other factors included industry support; a large number and
diverse range of participants, with a fair balance between buyers
and sellers; price volatility and risk; and an underlying spot
market.
</P>
<P>
Although some of these factors already existed, the experts
felt a number of key prerequisites had yet to be met.
</P>
<P>
The participants also agreed to hold regular meetings with the
industry to monitor the situation.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set up Copyright Violation Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay
Virawan has ordered the establishment of a copyright violation
suppression center.
</P>
<P>
The order came after the U.S. trade representative announced on
April 30 to keep Thailand on its "watch list" and to review
Thailand on an out-of-circle basis on intellectual property rights
protection.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the center is aimed at better coordination
between police and officials, who attributed the continuing
rampant existence of piracy to lack of staff.
</P>
<P>
The center is to be jointly managed by the Police Department,
the Commerce Ministry and the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The center will start work in Bangkok and then move to other
tourist destinations, such as Phuket, Chiang Mai, Pattaya and Hat
Yai.
</P>
<P>
Popular products subject to copyright violation in Thailand are
wrist watches, leather goods, apparel and more recently, computer
software.

<P>
ROME, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy is trying to help Albania's
political parties reach an agreement which would clear the way for
general elections at the end of June, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said tonight.
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy statement on the situation in Albania, Dini
referred to disagreements which have emerged within the Albanian
government of national reconciliation over a proposed electoral
reform to introduce a measure of proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
Reform is opposed by Albanian President Sali Berisha's
Democratic Party, which currently dominates parliament.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Bakshim Fino has said he will give
approval for the new electoral law, subject to a parliamentary
vote of confidence in his government if prior agreement cannot be
reached.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Dini warned that the March 9 agreement between
Albania's political parties, which led to the formation of the
national reconciliation government, remained the basis for
international action to help Albania.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, if that basis should be reduced, the premise for
our intervention, for the intervention of Europe, the OSCE and the
international community, would be reduced," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for the disagreements within the government "which
seem to be emerging" not to be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
"We are working in direct contact to encourage all the parties
to reach an agreement which represents a fair balance that
satisfies one side and the other," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the "four fundamental aspects" to any
agreement. He said any electoral law should guarantee all parties'
adequate representation in parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said everyone that was not convicted of serious and proven
crimes against humanity should be allowed to take part in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Dini said all parties should recognize the legitimate
institutions of the country, and the salvation committees which
were set up during the crisis should therefore be dissolved.
</P>
<P>
He added that all parties should reconize the forces of law and
order, which must act according to transparent criteria and in a
neutral manner in the interest of the whole community.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the new electoral law had to match the principles of
the national reconciliation agreement, to guarantee fair access to
the media during the election campaign, and to give the
international community a role in monitoring the whole process.
</P>
<P>
Dini stressed that the mandate of the Italian-led multinational
protection force did not extend to controlling public order.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Italy had already put in train a bilateral
programme to help the local police, and he welcomed moves by the
Western European Union to help too.

The council was an appropriate forum to discuss matters of
mutual interest, said the minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton and the leaders of six Central American countries, and the
Dominica Republic, began a meeting today in Costa Rica on trade
and migration in the region.
</P>
<P>
The summit, called "Bridge Toward the 21st Century", in San
Jose's National Theater was to last three hours. A joint statement
from the eight leaders was to follow.
</P>
<P>
"We need a bridge that will unite our nations and our
economies," said Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, in a
brief welcoming ceremony.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the Central American leaders were to press
President Clinton to soften a new American immigration law and
expand a hemispheric free trade agreement to include their nations.
</P>
<P>
The tough U.S. immigration law that took effect April 1 was to
be the main topic of discussion
</P>
<P>
Prior to the discussion, Clinton called the Central American
countries to work together "to strengthen democracy, unite against
criminals, drug traffickers, and all those who trafficked with
people crossing borders illegally, and who were a threat to open
societies."
</P>
<P>
The issue of immigration has been one of the most controversial
themes in relations between the United States and Central American
countries.
</P>
<P>
Up to 600,000 Central Americans live in the United States, many
of them people who fled their countries to escape civil wars that
raged across the region in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Clinton was joined by presidents Figueres;
Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador; Alvaro Arzu of Guatemala;
Carlos Roberto Reina of Honduras, and Arnoldo Aleman, of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister of Belize, Manuel Esquivel, and the
president of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez, attended
the summit .
</P>
<P>
Some diplomatic sources doubt that the summit will conclude
with a free trade agreement between the United States and Central
America. enditem

<HEADLINE> Italian Leaders Urge Complete Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian leaders said today that there
was more to Europe than the single European currency -- the goal
of the long process of European integration was a political
government and a political parliament.
</P>
<P>
Italian President Oscar Scalfaro said a political government
and a political parliament was "absolutely essential if Europe is
to be what we have dreamed." He was meeting Italy's members of the
European Parliament (MEPs) on the eve of Europe Day.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro told the MEPs that "the power of geography will
certainly triumph over all the uncertainties and questions."
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said the blueprint drawn
in the Maastricht Treaty for European Union was not limited to the
single currency, and must be completed in its full vision.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the inter-governmental conference (IGC) to revise the
treaty was the last chance to respect objectives and timetables.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that for Italy, it was necessary to
develop the aspects of European union: political, social, civil
and security. Otherwise, there would be the risk of creating an
unstable and incomplete Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the single currency, the euro, was "certainly a central
element" in achieving full European integration.
</P>
<P>
However: "The overall design is much more comprehensive and
vast because it is a union of currencies and peoples, producers
and citizens, economic development and political growth, freedom
and security."

<HEADLINE> 3 Men Arrested in Sri Lanka for Alleged Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Three men have been arrested in Sri
Lanka by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for allegedly
attempting to defraud 10 million US dollars from a local bank
here, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the three suspects were a leading liquor
exporter A.C. Suaris, a Filipino identified as Oscar and former
press secretary of the president Victor Fernando.
</P>
<P>
The main suspect Suaris had failed to pay the liquor taxes
imposed on him by the Excise Department which filed a case against
him to recover the taxes, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, his licence was suspended and his distillery was
closed down.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter he is alleged to have formed a new company with
Victor Fernando as consultant and Oscar as advisor and planned the
fraud.
</P>
<P>
The three of them had proceeded to Hong Kong and negotiated
with businessman there to supply the liquor produced by them in
Sri Lanka for sale in Hong Kong and neighboring regions, according
to police sources.
</P>
<P>
On their return here, they had obtained from the Hong Kong
businessman copies of bank drafts, fixed deposit certificates and
other related documents, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently the three persons were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the CID is seeking Interpol assistance
to investigate the roles played by two other foreign businessmen,
an Indonesian from Bali and a Hong Kong resident.

WARSAW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
says he hopes Turkey and Poland will establish a strategic
partnership.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, who arrived here on Wednesday on a three-day visit,
told the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Polish parliament today
that his visit aims at providing an opportunity to set up the
partnership.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the bilateral ties were good, there were
great potentials in cooperation. The two countries would expand
economic cooperation and strive for free trade in 1998, Demirel
said.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski
on Wednesday, Demirel said the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's (NATO) eastward expansion should not harm
Russia. If it did it would cause a new split in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey supported NATO's expansion, but the procedure
must synchronize with the expansions of the European Union and
Western European Union. The Turkish President also expressed full
support for Poland's participation in NATO.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski hoped the Russian-NATO agreement would be signed
with cooperation instead of confrontation.

BELGRADE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Prime Minister Gojko
Klickovic said today that the Serbs will not patrol in the
strategic city of Brcko with Muslim-Croatian federal police.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks after talks on Brcko with
Kai Eide, the United Nations representative handling the issue of
Bosnian and Herzegovinan police. He said the Serbs only carried
out their Dayton accord obligations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting in Pale, capital of the Serbian Republic,
Eide demanded that the Serbs form a joint patrol troop with
Muslim-Croatia federal police and wore the same uniforms and
badges. This was refused by Klickovic.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs respected the document signed on Brcko, Klickovic
said. However, there were no such requirements, as suggested by
Eide, in the document.
</P>
<P>
"Serbs can't accept any thing beyond the Dayton accord and
relevant documents concerning the issue of Brcko," the prime
minister noted. Neither should Eide be allowed to wantonly change
the decision made by the international community in this regard."

<HEADLINE> Dini Sees Need for Proportional Vote in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The search is still on for an
agreement on what voting system should be used in the Albanian
elections set for the end of June, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said in Florence today.
</P>
<P>
A mixed first-past-the-post or proportional system such as
Italy's remains one possibility, said Dini.
</P>
<P>
He said Italian and other diplomats are in "direct contact"
with the Albanian authorities in order to find a "just point of
equilibrium" between the various parties on questions such as a
reorganization of the police and security forces.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the small Albanian parties are obviously
asking for a right to representation and noted that a purely
majority voting system would eliminate them from a future
parliament.
</P>
<P>
After noting that there are various formulas, Dini said the
Italian system, first-past-the-post with the addition of a
proportional vote, could be the answer. "I hope it goes in this
direction," he added.

<HEADLINE> No Specific Goal for Chinese Women Basketball Team at EAG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women basketball team for
the second East Asian Games do not set up a specific goal this time,
but will try hard to do its best on the court, team manager Kuang
Lubin said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese squad, with only two members Liang Qing and Jiang Xu
from the national team, will face a tough challenge from their
rivals from South Korea, Japan and Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, South Korea has sent their nationals for the
games," Kuang said. "What we should do is to play each game well and
try to win every match."
</P>
<P>
Liang Qing and Jiang Xu, who just joined the team after playing in
the Asian Championships on May 6, admitted that fatigue and team work
is their biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
"I am feeling very tired, " She said. "I am not in my top form
after the Asian Championships."
</P>
<P>
At the Asian Championships in Thailand early this month, China
managed to finish third after losing to Japan in a semi-final match.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuang, the South Korean team, taking advantage on home
soil, has the biggest chance to win.
</P>
<P>
"If we are lucky enough, we may have possibility to beat them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, also taking the games as a chance to prepare for
the World Youth Championships, won the title after beating South Korea
in the final at the last East Asian Games in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Chairman Defends Raising Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve (Fed) Alan Greenspan today dismissed criticism of the
Fed's interest-rate increase in March and paved the way for more
increases in the future.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been folly not to take this small prudent step,"
Greenspan said, with unusual clarity and force, in a speech at the
New York University.
</P>
<P>
As usual, Greenspan refrained from saying explicitly what
action Fed policy-makers would take when they meet next on May
20. But analysts believe the remarkably strong tone of his
remarks suggested that the U.S. Fed might add to the quarter-point
rate increase engineered on March 25.
</P>
<P>
"For the Federal Reserve to remain inactive against a possible
build-up of insidious inflationary pressures would be to sanction
a threat to the job security and standards of living of too many
Americans," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the U.S. Fed, including some congressmen, have
argued that higher rates are not needed because the U.S. inflation
rate is at a 30-year low. Recent government data also showed that
U.S. economic growth was slowing down.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also said in the past that Fed policy-makers have
acted too slowly and have had to raise rates much higher and slow
growth much more sharply to tame inflation.

<P>
Korda said after the match that at the end of the second set he
felt like he was going to collapse. He is to skip next week's

<P>
COLOMBO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Workers of Sri Lanka's Shell gas
company ended their week-long strike Thursday evening and returned
to work today after talks between Labor Minister Mahinda Rajapakse
and representatives of the workers and the gas company.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the ministry said today that the company agreed to
reinstate four workers who had been dismissed and refer for
arbitration the case of two others at the workers' request.
</P>
<P>
A collective agreement on matters relating to transfers,
incentives and other allowances was signed by both parties last
night.
</P>
<P>
The company reassured the public that the stock levels of gas
remain at a high level at Shell's main filling plant. A shipment
of 2,000 tons of gas is outside the port of Colombo and further
2,000 tons of gas is on its way.
</P>
<P>
The availability of gas was never in question, but the strike
prevented the filling and distribution of gas, thereby causing
artificial scarcity, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the company is making every effort to
bring gas distribution back to normal as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Mafia Turncoats May Yet Pay, Says Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy's state anti-Mafia prosecutor,
Piero Luigi Vigna, said today that Mafia turncoats may have to
have their illicitly acquired assets disclosed and confiscated
under a draft bill awaiting parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
"Logically, those who speak about crimes must also speak about
what the crimes produce," said Vigna, "This makes it possible to
identify the Mafia's systems of reinvestment."
</P>
<P>
Tracking down the Mafia's bank accounts and other assets has
been a major tool in the judiciary's fight against organized
crimes since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, assets worth about 590 million U.S. dollars were
confiscated from Mafia money recycler, Vincenzo Piazza, who was
jailed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Vigna said the confiscated assets could fund the country's

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not Planning Diplomatic Ties with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said the government had no intention to open diplomatic
ties with Israel so far.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia would stick to its principles that it would not open
any ties with that country if the Middle East issue had not yet
been comprehensively settled, Alatas said Thursday in Dili, East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia will consider opening diplomatic ties with Israel
only if the Palestinian and Arab-Israel conflicts have been
solved," reports reaching here today quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Alatas, who was in Dili to conduct a three-day election
campaign for the May 29 general election, said Indonesia fully
supports the struggle of Palestine to regain its homeland occupied
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's stance is that Israel has to give the opportunity
to Palestine to exercise its own determination and gain its
independence and sovereignty, he added.
</P>
<P>
Alatas noted that Indonesia on various international forums had
urged Israel to return Arab territories it illegally occupied
through wars.
</P>
<P>
Israel "still occupied Syrian and Lebanese territories," he
said, adding that the Jordanian and Egyptian territories which
were occupied by Israel had been settled.
</P>
<P>
The problem that still had to be solved was that its occupation
of Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese territories, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Attract Investors in Automotive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will encourage more
automotive electronic parts makers to set up factories in the
country.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the Board of Investment (BOI), chaired by the
prime minister, is considering granting special promotional
privileges to the sector so that Thailand can better compete for
investment with Malaysia and Singapore, BOI Secretary-General
Staporn Kavitanon said at a seminar this week.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that as Asia's demand for automobiles expanded,
the automotive electronic parts sector would grow by 5 percent to
25 percent in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Thailand considers the electronic parts manufacturing sector an
important part of a larger goal to make the country a regional
automobile assembly hub.
</P>
<P>
The development of automotive electronics is focused on safety
features, engine control, comfort accessories and the transmission
system.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the value of automotive electronic parts
manufacturing in the country has tripled to 30 billion baht (1.2
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Vehicle sales in Thailand have grown by an average of 14
percent annually since 1990, and are expected to reach 700,000
units in 1998 and 800,000 units by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Helping Agriculture In North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment in Shanxi
Province's agriculture in northwest China is playing an important
role in helping 20 counties shake off poverty.
</P>
<P>
The province had brought in nearly four billion yuan in foreign
investment by the end of last year, about a quarter of the total
amount of local financing for the farming sector over the past
three years, according to the Provincial Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has economic and technological contacts with more than
30 countries, and has co-operated on agricultural improvement,
water conservation, forestry, farm machinery, and agronomy
projects.
</P>
<P>
It imported more than 50 new crop strains over the past three
years, and the cultivation of potatoes has improved the province's
potato processing industry and allowed it to acquaint the rest of
the world with its produce.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Linyi County have benefited from imported
water-saving techniques, which have not only increased per-unit
grain output considerably, but have also saved 600 yuan per
hectare by using 80 percent less water for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The province launched 18 projects with help from international
financial institutions. The Shanxi Province Poverty Relief
Project, funded by the World Bank, was the largest of this kind,
with a total of 1.74 billion yuan, and 100 million US dollars in
loans from the Bank. Farmers' per-capita income increased 354 yuan
in Luliang Prefecture, where 67 percent of the poor households got
out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Overseas participation has increased export-oriented
agriculture in the province, and township enterprises earn 2.8
billion yuan from exports annually.

<HEADLINE> European Envoy Mediates in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting European envoy Franz
Vranitzky held talks today with Albanian President Sali Berisha to
try to find a way out of the current crisis which might delay the
election due by June 29.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky, a former Austrian chancellor, and now acting as
envoy of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), is on his fourth visit to Albania since February when
widespread rioting caused by failed savings schemes broke out in
the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the envoy noted that it was imperative to
hold a new general election in Albania in a proper period of time.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE and the European Commission (EC) would monitor the
polls, and the latter would present a formal report on the
election, he added.
</P>
<P>
Berisha asked the OSCE, the European Union (EU) and the EC to
form a joint observation group to study the current situation in
Albania, particularly the situation in southern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The group would decide the final date for the election after
their on-the-spot investigation, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all Albanian parties to sign an agreement to
guarantee a peaceful and fair election campaign.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday when Viranitzky arrived here for a three-day
visit, the envoy talked with interim Albanian Prime Minister
Bashkim Fino about the election.
</P>
<P>
Fino expressed his willingness to continue his efforts in
dragging Albania out of the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Sharp differences emerged among Berisha's Democratic
Party, Fino's Socialist Party and the other seven parties in the
National Reconciliation government, set up on March 9. The
differences were on the revision of the electoral law, the date of
the election and how to deal with the military groups in southern
Albania.
</P>
<P>
Fino said that the government would now adopt the new electoral
law by majority vote and pass it on to the Democrat-dominated
parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
He warned that his government would resign if the new electoral
law was not passed.
</P>
<P>
Alleging widespread fraud, Fino's Socialists pulled out of the
May 1996 general election in which the Democrats won 122 seats in
the 140-seat parliament
</P>
<P>
Berisha accused the military groups in the south of the country
of undermining the holding of free elections.
</P>
<P>
Those groups have been calling for the resignation of Berisha
and the return of money lost in the savings schemes.
</P>
<P>
Viranitzky said during his talks with Fino that European
countries would definitely reject any proposal for putting off the
election until autumn.

<HEADLINE> New Technology Developed for Dam Construction in Muddy River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese engineers have succeeded
in solving some technical problems in large dam projects on rivers
with silt problems.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi, the largest water control project on the Yellow
River, China's second longest river, is the most challenging water
project ever in China, says Wang Xianru, chief engineer on the
project.
</P>
<P>
One of the muddiest rivers in the world, the Yellow River
carries an average of 1.6 billion tons of sand and dirt annually,
sometimes reaching 4 billion tons. An unusal approach had to be
developed in dam construction.
</P>
<P>
Workers built an 80-meter-high concrete cutoff wall 1.2
m. thick with a deep base in the riverbed, and a rockfill inclined
dam. The dam 1,317 m. long.
</P>
<P>
Because the spillways, bottom outlets, and power house are on a
hill on one side of the river, engineers designed an intake tower
275 meters long and 113 meters high, with 16 tunnels, buried
inside the hill.
</P>
<P>
Water experts say that China will build a dozen dams on the
Yellow River in the next several years, and the Xiaolangdi
experience will make the job easier.

was intended to expand the sports exchanges among the countries and
regions of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Through the process of exchanging sports events, it is hoped that
the participating countries and regions will forge closer bonds of
friendship and improve the overall level of their teams.
</P>
<P>
It was at a 1991 meeting of the Northeast Asian Countries Olympic
Committee (NOC) when the committee's three members countries of
China,
Japan and South Korea concurred in setting up an East Asian Games
regularly.
</P>
<P>
The founding members of the games are China, Japan, South Korea,
DPR Korea, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Mongolia and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan joins the games from now on, Guam is an associate
member
of the games and Australia was accepted on Thursday to compete in the
third edition in Osaka of Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, DPR Korea forewent the right to host the second games,
and
Pusan of South Korea decided to bid for the hosting right as part of
its preparation for the 2002 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
In October 1994, Pusan was chosen as the venue for the 1997 games
at the East Asian Games Association (EAGA) General Assembly in
Horishima of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Although a relatively small number of countries participate in the
games, it can be considered a miniature of the Asian Games as the
three sports nations of China, Japan and South Korea will convene to
compete in good spirit.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the East Asian Games will determine the success of
the 2002 Asian Games. Hosting the 1997 East Asian Games will enable
Korea to acquire the experience and gain the exposure to host the
2002
Asain Games," officials at the Pusan organizing committee said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,859 athletes and officials from nine countries and
regions will compete for the 187 gold medals in 13 official sports
and
14 golds in two demonstration sports of rowing and bowling in
nine-day
regional sports meet slated from May 10-19.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the demonstration sports, athletes will vie against
each
other in the sports of athletics, badminton, basketball, boxing,
football, gymnastics, judo,

<HEADLINE> Farmers Show Enthusiasm for Direct Elections In Rural China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-year-old Liu Jiayu, holding
the first ballot he'd ever seen, walked into the voting place, and
carefully made a small circle above the name of his choice and
dropped the slip into a box covered with red paper, barely
concealing his excitement.
</P>
<P>
The young man then relaxed, having just made the important
decision. "This is a new thing for me," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
The place was Fashi Village in Quanzhou City in coastal Fujian
Province in east China. It was April 12, and new village
committees were being chosen in six villages of Quanzhou City that
day.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, villagers above the age of 18 have
the right to vote. In Fashi Village there are 3,340 people and
2,435 eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
The clean and tidy village has many houses of several stories,
and wall bulletins and blackboards with the names of voters and
information about the candidates dot the streets. Slogans
exhorting people to "Develop democracy and hold the election in
accordance with the law" and "Elect a good village head" can be
seen here and there.
</P>
<P>
The election began at 7:30 a.m. Cai Shuhua, a woman of 50, and
her husband and two children had gone to the voting station early
in the morning. They showed their voter's registration cards, got
ballots, and went into the restricted access room one by one.
</P>
<P>
After casting their votes, the family went off to work in
village factories. "We filled in our ballots independently, and and
don't know each other's choice," the woman said.
</P>
<P>
Ruan Wei, an 89-year-old woman, could not recall how many times
she had participated in the voting process. She can not read, but
knows all the villagers. Looking at the color photos alongside the
names of candidates, she seemed lost in thought. A man in charge
of the voting station, responding to her request, helped her fill
in her ballot.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good method, a good method, " she repeated. "We
villagers used to gather at a large compound and vote by raising
our hands." She used to feel embarrassed when she looked around
and saw that all the others had raised their hands, she
explained.

<P>
More than 15,000 village committees in Fujian Province will be
re-elected this year by villagers. And there are more than 930,000
village committees across China, in charge of local affairs,
settling disputes, and safeguarding social security.
</P>
<P>
"The direct election of village committees in rural China is
the embodiment of democracy at the grassroots level, and provides
an opportunity at direct participation," says Wang Zhenyao, a
senior official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Villagers are enthusiastic about the democratic election and
value their right and play an active part, he said.
</P>
<P>
A village in Talou Township, Xiaoshan City, Zhejiang Province
in east China, holds the record for all villagers taking part in an
election. More than 400 of the eligible voters work in the
transport business, but come village committee election day, none
of them left the village.
</P>
<P>
In Fujian's Meishan Village, more than a thousand villagers
were away on business on election day, but most drove back or took
a taxi to be able to vote.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, direct elections of village committees have
been held in China's rural areas several times. This year,
villagers in Shanxi, Hebei, Heilongjiang and Fujian provinces will
choose new village committees.
</P>
<P>
Some novel methods are being used this time, like secret
balloting, giving each voter a ticket, and no voting by proxy,
said Zhang Xiaogan, of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs
in charge of building grassroots political power.
</P>
<P>
In some places, mobile ballot boxes or even voting by mail are
being used. On the whole, more than 90 percent of rural voters
participate in the elections, Zhang said.

On the election day in Dongxia Village, near Fashi Village, Xu
Jingyi, who is in his twenties, carried the ballot box on his back
to collect ballots at the homes of the elderly and
handicapped. Donxia was using two mobile boxes and four regular
ones in two polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Ye Daoming, who is in his sixties and who had suffered from a
stroke, was lying in bed worrying about not being able to
participate in the voting when the mobile ballot box service
arrived at his door, and he made his choice like the others.
</P>
<P>
The two mobile boxes collected 41 ballots. "We managed to see
that all voters got to exercise their right to vote," said Xu
Jinhui, head of the village's election group.
</P>
<P>
Laicuo Village, in Gutian County in the northern part of
Fujian, has only 447 eligible voters, but the atmosphere of a
democratic election still prevailed.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to notices issued by the village election group,
people working outside the village had been notified in advance
about the election of new village committee officials and received
ballots.
</P>
<P>
When the voters sent these in, the group put them aside
unopened until the election day.
</P>
<P>
Lai Renshe was handling vegetables in Hainan Province. He sent
his ballot back by express mail and then followed it up with a
long-distance phone call to see whether his ballot had arrived or
not.
</P>
<P>
By the election day, 14 of the 16 people working outside the
village had sent in ballots.
</P>
<P>
"For Chinese farmers, their democratic aspirations have been
realized. That provides a solid foundation for the entire country
in building democracy," one official in charge of civil affairs
said.
</P>
<P>
"In a country of 900 million farmers, democratic politics is
only empty talk without the participation of the vast number of
farmers," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Manila Scraps Port Privatization Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has agreed
to scrap the plan to privatize the country's ports in a bid to
prevent the recurrence of another nationwide strike by port
workers, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines confirmed Thursday
that President Fidel Ramos earlier issued a decree to stop the
implementation of the Open Competition Policy in Philippine Ports,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The trade union said Ramos made the decision in compliance with
a promise made to labor leaders who lobbied for the repeal of the
open competition policy.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy endorsed by Ramos last year, all the country's
ports will be sold off to multiple cargo-handling contractors to
improve efficiency and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
But the policy was strongly opposed by portworkers for fear of
losing jobs after the privatization.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide strike was staged in May last year to protest the
implementation of the privatization plan, resulting in the
paralyzation of port operations in Manila and other major ports.
</P>
<P>
After the strike, the privatization plan was put on hold.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to attract domestic and foreign capital and improve
the country's industry competitiveness, the government has begun
massive privatization of state-owned assets and corporations since
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The government has already privatized the water supply and
sewage system worth billions of U.S. dollars in the capital region
and other major state-run projects.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Plans to Increase Forest Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has set a policy
to increase forest cover by 30 percent in two years.
</P>
<P>
The policy was stated by Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
Thursday at a meeting with 500 senior officials, including
provincial governors, The Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Chavalit said Thailand's forest cover
had in the past 30 years dropped from 130 million rai (20.8
million hectares) to about 80 million rai (12.8 million hectares).
</P>
<P>
He said without proper planning and maintenance, forests might
be wiped out in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Local Administration Department Chief Chanasak Yuwaboob said
provincial-level committee would be set up in each province to
solve the problem of forest encroachment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Workers Electing Factory Managers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Factories in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, one of the country's major manufacturing centers,
are having success with choosing managers through direct elections
by workers.
</P>
<P>
The new practice was introduced on a trial basis last year to
invigorate state enterprises, many of which have been money
losers, said an official in charge of the province's personnel
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Candidates must go through an assessment process by the
workers, and must make policy speeches before the election. All
procedures are strictly supervised by the workers' congress, a
body that safeguards employees' rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
One of the difficulties in the new process is expressed by the
newly elected director of the Anshan Strip Steel Plant, Wang
Donglai, who says, "I feel pressured, because I have to keep my
promises, or the workers will vote me out of office."
</P>
<P>
Some older enterprises are doing better because of elected
managers who turn out to be good at management. Thirty-two
enterprises attached to the Communications Bureau of Shenyang city,
which adopted the democratic election process, increased profits
by 50 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Relations between managers and workers have also improved
remarkably because of the elections. Workers not only support the
managers, but also oversee their performance.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time we are entitled to choose managers we have
confidence in, and of course, we try our best to be qualified as
supervisors," one worker explained.
</P>
<P>
Elections were held in nearly 100 state enterprises in the
province, and the newly-elected managers and directors are doing
well -- and they pay attention to workers' suggestions and to
their well-being.

BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports in April this

an increase of 5.1 percent over the same period last year,
according to Ponsathorn Siriyothin, secretary to the finance
minister.
</P>

The five percent growth in exports showed that things are
looking up for Thailand's export sector.

Thailand's exports in the first quarter this year were valued
228 billion baht (9.12 billion dollars), a decline of 0.2 percent
compared with the same period last year.

When looking at the complete picture for the first four months
of 1997, Thailand's export value rose by one percent to 466.83
billion baht (18.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has forecast export value to reach 1,550
billion baht (62 billion dollars) this year, up 10 percent over

<HEADLINE> Croatia Secures Loan From Western Banking Syndicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Croatia has secured a loan of 150
million U.S. dollars from a western banking syndicate to help an
oil company in debt servicing and technological upgrading.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported today that an
agreement on the loan was signed in Zagreb on May 3 by the INA oil
company, Croatia's largest enterprise, and a 21-bank syndicate led
by the Bankers International Trust.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the INA oil company will use one-third of the
five-year loan for debt servicing and the rest for modernizing an
oil refinery and establishing gas station networks across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The INA oil company, which controls 30 percent of Croatia's oil
production and 80 percent of natural gas exploitation, is the
first Croatian enterprise to directly raise funds on the
international financial market without government guarantee.
</P>
<P>
The western banking syndicate said the INA oil company has a
good prospect for expanding its business in Bulgaria, Romania and
Bosnia.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Paraguayan government has
evicted some 120 peasant families who had been illegally occupying
privately-owned land, police sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Anti-riot police, armed with batons, shields and tear gas,
removed the families from two settlements in San Pedro, 250
kilometers north of the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion, and
arrested 20 people.
</P>
<P>
There were violent confrontations during the eviction, in which
eight police officers and nine peasants suffered injuries.
</P>
<P>
Land ownership is one of the main causes of social conflicts in
Paraguay after the mass privatization of state-owned land since
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Similar conflicts in the last three years resulted in the death
of 21 peasants at the hands of the security force.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that 74 percent of the land in Paraguay is
owned by one percent of the population, while non-governmental
organizations indicate that 84 percent of the rural population are
living in extreme poverty.

<HEADLINE> UN Peace Mission to Leave Guatemala in Mid-May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations mission which
supervised the demobilization of the former Guatemalan guerrillas
will leave the Central American country on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Alfredo Crespo, spokesman for the multinational mission
said the task of verification of disarmament and demobilization of
the former guerrillas "has been successfully done," reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish military officer said: "We have finished the job
well." He stressed that "This is the first time in the history of
UN peace missions that one has finished within the time announced."
</P>
<P>
Crespo said the withdrawal would start on May 17, and the only
tasks still pending related to the concentration of the guerrilla
weapons, and other technical aspects to certify demobilization.
But that they would be discharged soon.
</P>
<P>
Crespo explained that the Guatemalan peace agreements cannot be
reverted and will serve as models for other peace processes in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan government and the National Revolutionary Unity
of Guatemala signed the agreement last December 18, under the
mediation of the UN and the international community. The agreement
on a firm and lasting peace ended 36 years of armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The UN military body attached itself to the peace process in
January, 1996, to supervise aspects of the first stage of the
demobilization.
</P>
<P>
The UN will maintain a civilian mission in the Central American
country to watch the peace process which will conclude at the end
of 1997.

MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are business news in
brief in the Philippines:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine Central Bank Thursday re-aligned its
borrowing and lending rates as the financial market returned to
normal, the bank's treasury director Sergio Edeza said. The
central bank brought down its overnight borrowing rate by 35 basis
points to 11.25 percent from 11.5 percent after raising the level
several times last week. At the same time, it increased the rate
of its overnight lending by 25 basis points to 13 percent from
12.75 percent. Edeza said the adjustment were part of the central
bank's strategy to re-align the rates to bring them back to normal
levels.
</P>
<P>
-- Sale of passenger cars in the Philippines from January to
April this year fell 4.6 percent, or 27,309 units from 28,638
units for the same period last year. Chamber of Automotive
Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. data showed that Japanese
car maker Honda Cars Philippines Inc. padded its lead disposing
5,136 units. The chamber said the decrease was mainly due to the
slow processing and selective approval by some financing companies
and other financial institutions for retail financing applications
of prospective buyers, especially those with very low
downpayments.

<P>
He said there were no instant solution to revive the peace
process but Blair had been "positive" and he believed the new
British Prime Minister would make the search for peace in Northern
Ireland one of his top priorities.
</P>
<P>
"I think he recognizes that there is a moment of opportunity
here...but obviously he has to be very careful and balanced in the
way that he responds to that opportunity," said Bruton, the first
foreign leader to meet Blair.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting so soon after the prime minister came into
office...indicates the very high priority he is attaching to these
issues and to moving forward towards peace and reconciliation in
Northern Ireland."
</P>
<P>
Bruton earlier called for the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
political wing Sinn Fein to be admitted to all-party talks on the
future of Northern Ireland next month if the guerrillas announced
an immediate, genuine ceasefire. The IRA ended a 17-month truce in
February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the talks had been
helpful but stressed a new IRA ceasefire was required before Sinn
Fein could enter talks.

<HEADLINE> Sydney's Chinatown to Undergo Facelift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Sydney's Chinatown, which attracts
more people than many parts of the city, is to undergo a 13
million Australian dollar (10 million US dollar) facelift.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lord Mayor, Councilor Frank Sartor, the
precinct is now "shabby in parts, dirty in other parts", but all
is "fixable" and will be revamped in time for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Once described as a "winding dragon with its head in Campbell
Street, its body climbing up Ultimo Road and its tail in Dixon
Street," Chinatown has slowly decayed over two decades of dramatic
change in the Chinese community's economic and social fortunes.
</P>
<P>
The mayor was quoted today by the Sydney Morning Herald as
saying the Chinatown "attracts more people than many, many parts
of Sydney, it is actually very successful with tourists".
</P>
<P>
"We have committed 5 million Australian dollars (3.89 million
US dollars) over the next three years for community facilities and
street improvements and the Darling Harbor Authority will spend
between six and eight million...," the councilor said.
</P>
<P>
The council's decision to invest in Chinatown follows a
comprehensive study by a Melbourne planner, Professor David
Yencken.

ROME, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Mary Pierce took two straight sets to
oust No.1 seed Monica Seles at the Italian Open tennis here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Before that, Pierce had never taken a set off Monica
Seles. However in Thursday's match that was delayed for hours by
rain, Pierce downed Seles 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (8-6) to move into the
quarterfinals of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, Seles recovered back, up from 0-3 and 2-4,
but at the decisive moment it was Pierce who hit some perfect
baseline ball to save three set points in the tie-breaker and then
took the set.
</P>
<P>
Seles served for the second set at 6-5, failed to close on two
set points and went into another tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, who holds dual French-American citizenship, had been a
virtual pushover for Seles in their three previous meeetings. The
10th seed, has yet to win a tournament this year, reaching the
finals twice, including the Australian Open, the Grand Slam she
won in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Seles has reached two finals too, losing each to the new No. 1

</P>
<P>
Question: Will Hong Kong residents be allowed to speculate in
gold and stocks?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Foreign exchange, gold, securities and futures markets
are component parts of Hong Kong's financial market, and gold and
stock speculation is a popular form of investment for Hong Kong
residents.
</P>
<P>
Owing to their advantages in terms of geographical location and
time zone, Hong Kong, London and New York together make it
possible for the global gold, foreign exchange and stock markets to
operate continuously 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
Investment of Hong Kong residents in gold, foreign exchange and
stock transactions adds vitality to the Hong Kong economy and
contributes to the maintenance of Hong Kong as an international
financial center.
</P>
<P>
Article 112 of the Basic Laws stipulates, "Markets for foreign
exchange, fold, securities, futures and the like shall continue"
in Hong Kong after 1997. And the Hong Kong SAR government will
safeguard the free flow of capital within, into and out of the
region.
</P>
<P>
This will allow both Hong Kong residents and foreigners to
continue to invest in gold, stock, foreign exchange and futures
after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Question: What will be the status of Hong Kong's pegged
exchange rate system?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The pegged exchange rate system, which refers to
linkage between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar,
was initiated on October 17, 1983. The pegged rate stands at 7.8
Hong Kong dollars to one US dollar.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's pegged exchange rate system has two main features.
</P>
<P>
First, linkage at the time of currency issues. Banks issuing
Hong Kong dollars must, in accordance with the aforementioned
exchange rate, deposit US dollars of the same value in the
government's foreign exchange fund in return for certificates of
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
When removing bank notes from circulation, the issuing bank may
return such certificates to the foreign exchange fund for US
dollars of equal value.
</P>
<P>
Second, when other banks want to obtain Hong Kong dollars from
issuing banks, they should exchange them with US dollars of equal
value; when other banks deposit Hong Kong dollars in issuing
banks, they should be paid US dollars of equal value.
</P>
<P>
Market prices of the Hong Kong dollar will be decided by supply
and demand. It is obvious that the pegged exchange rate system
also has the function of regulating monetary supply and demand on
the market.
</P>
<P>
Of course, with this pegged exchange rate system, the Hong Kong
dollar is more or less subject to price fluctuations of the US
dollar. This weakens Hong Kong's ability to use monetary tools
such as the exchange rate to control inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, the pegged system in the main is conducive to
stabilizing the Hong Kong dollar and Hong Kong's financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
It does more good than harm. In several global financial crises
in recent years, the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar
remained stable at approximately 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to the US
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Given the performance of pegged exchange rate system, the
Chinese government has clearly stated that, for a long period of
time after 1997, the Hong Kong SAR will continue to apply this
system.

LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A former shipping magnate was
sentenced to 14-year imprisonment for mastrerminding a massive
fraud involving 750 million pounds (1,200 million U.S. dollars) in
loans from the bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), a
British court announced today.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Gokal, 61, the ex-boss of the Gulf Group -- BCCI's
biggest borrower -- was convicted last month. His term is a record
for fraud.
</P>
<P>
Gokal was given four years for conspiring to account falsely
and 10 years for conspiracy to defraud. He was earlier on
Thursday fined 2.94 million pounds (4.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The convict used the borrowed money to fund a lavish lifestyle
and had homes around the world.
</P>
<P>
BCCI collapsed in 1991 with debts of more than 12 billion
U.S. dollars after evidence emerged of widespread money
laundering. Thousands of people lost their savings in the affair.
</P>
<P>
There are also civil cases pending against both Gokal and his
Gulf shipping and trading group and further action is expected
against him in Pakistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC ) said today that its total investment portfolio
in Zimbabwe now exceeds 180 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
CDC Country Manager for Zimbabwe, Christopher Brain said the
increase in its investment portfolio in Zimbabwe was propelled by
changes in the structure of the corporation, which were brought
about by the new CDC act introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
''CDC in Zimbabwe is now positioned to provide long term
finance for all sizes of private sector businesses, execpt the
very smallest,'' said Brain, whose organisation is involved in 52
countries worldwide, 12 of which are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw the corporation injecting 25 million U.S.Dollars
in the Commonwealth Africa investment fund, set up to promote
private sector initiatives on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Under the changes to the CDC act, which were approved by the
British parliament last year, the corporation will now
participate in emerging market funds which will in turn invest in
quoted equities as a way of promoting the development of capital
and other financial markets.

<HEADLINE> Siemens to Build New Zealand's Largest Combined-Cycle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Siemens AG announced today
that it has acquired an order to build the largest and most modern
combined-cycle power plant in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
According to Siemens Power General Group, the 400-megawatt
plant will use both a natural gas turbine of the latest 3A
generation of Siemens and a steam turbine to generate power, a
solution which was described as particularly environment-friendly.
</P>
<P>
The order was awarded to Siemens by New Zealand's power
producer Contact Energy Limited. The value of the contract was not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Located some 20 kilometers south of Auckland, the power plant
is scheduled to go on line as early as November 1998.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's installed power plant capacity amounts to around
8,400 megawatts, with almost 70 percent based on hydro power and
30 percent on fossile energy sources.
</P>
<P>
Also today, another Siemens subsidiary, Siemens Electrocom
GmbH, said it had received a 25 million German mark (14.5 million
U.S. dollar) contract for five integrated mail processor systems
from New Zealand Post Limited from mail services centers in
Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.
</P>
<P>
The order would supplement an ongoing modernization of the New
Zealand company's existing address reading equipment, Siemens
said.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Commends S. Africa for Efforts to Peaceful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today lauded South Africa for its diplomatic efforts to ensure a
peaceful solution to the Zairean conflict and avoidance for
further bloodshed in the Central African nation.
</P>
<P>
During talks with South Africa's Deputy President, Thabo
Mbeki, who called on him at the state House in Dar es Salaam,
President Mkapa said Tanzania strongly supported South Africa's
initiative on Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"Zaire is an expansive territory with a big population, which
if it was to be left to be involved in the turmoil, the
spill-over effects were certain to cause untold suffering to
neighbouring countries, including Tanzania," a State House
statement quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
He further said, "though change of government seemed certain
in Zaire, it is all the same necessary for a compromise solution
to be reached out by the warring parties to ensure an acceptable
smooth transition."
</P>
<P>
Mkapa urged other African countries to render their diplomatic
contributions in support of the South African initiative.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki arrived in Dar es salaam on Wednesday night to brief the
president on progress so far achieved after a meeting between
Laurent Kabila and President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire which was
brockered by South Africa's President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The South African deputy president visited Angola on a similar
mission.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference shortly before his departure for
Rwanda on a similar mission, Mbeki said he would later in this
evening fly back to South Africa to start preparations for
another meeting between Kabila and President Mobutu which might
take place in Kinshasa next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commentig on reports that some troops from neighbouring
african countries were involved in the war in Zaire, Mbeki said
that the issue had not featured in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He, however, admitted that if the issue were to feature it would
have complicated the peace talks. "At this moment we have not
addressed ourselves to the question of who supports who." he said.

NIAMEY, NIGER, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
arrived in Niamey, the capital of Niger, today aboard a special
plane in defiance of an air embargo imposed by the U.N. on Libya
in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi flew directly from Tripoli, the capital of Libya, to
Niamey, a Libyan official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Niamey International Airport,
the Libyan leader was warmly welcomed by Niger's President
Ibrahim Barre Mainassara, other government officials and
thousands of local people.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan official who did not want to be named said that
Gaddafi came directly from Libya "by a Libyan Arab Airlines
plane."
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who was invited to lead prayers in Niger to celebrate
today's Muslim new year, attended a large gathering this
afternoon and delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
He violated the U.N. air ban when a Libyan registered plane
flew him to Cairo, Egypt, to attend an Arab summit last June.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. embargo was imposed to pressure Libya to abide by
U.N. resolution 731 to surrender two Libyan suspects involved in the
bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockbie, Scotland, in 1988,
which killed 270 people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Sets Growth Record Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- African gross domestic product
(GDP) increased by 3.96 percent in 1996, the highest since the
start of the decade, according to a latest report published by
the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).
</P>
<P>
Subregionally, the economic performances varied from 4.4
percent increase in north Africa and central Africa to 3 percent
growth in southern Africa, said the "1997 Report on the Economic
and Social Situation in Africa".
</P>
<P>
North Africa enjoyed the highest GDP growth rate in Africa
last year. The subregional economies rebounded appreciably in
1996, following four years of modest to lacklustre growth.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the subregional output increased by 4.4 percent,
compared to 1.8 percent in 1995, and the upsurge in growth was
largely attributable to the return of excellent weather
conditions, spirited industrial growth, a rise in oil prices and
recovery in the tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
However, developments in some parts of the subregion remained
fragile as a result of continued exposure to civil strife,
localized drought and United Nations imposition of economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Algeria benefited in particular from the high oil price as
well as good weather to post a growth rate of 5.5 percent. While
in Tunisia, a strong recovery in industry and services more than
made up for the fall in agriculture, so much so that a GDP growth
rate of 6.1 percent was achieved.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt and Sudan, GDP growth was sustained at 3.2 percent
and 4.0 percent respectively, mainly because of the strong
performance in agriculture. Positive growth was also reported in
Libya, and Morocco is estimated to have reached almost 9 percent
in GDP growth last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth momentum that started in the west Africa subregion
in 1994 was maintained into 1996, despite threats to sustained
agricultural production in a few countries and the problems and
uncertainties in Sierra Leone and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The subregional GDP growth rate is estimated at 4.2 percent in
1996, compared to 3.4 percent in 1995 and 2.5 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the subregion, virtually all countries of the CFA Franc
Zone are expected to register increasing benefits from favorable
investment opportunities emanating from the economic reform
programs under way since 1994.
</P>
<P>
In Cote d'Ivoire, the largest CFA Franc Zone economy in the
subregion, GDP growth fell below expectations but was still a
respectable 6 percent in 1996, driven mainly by strong recovery
in agriculture and water, power and construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
Senegal's GDP growth is estimated to have reached 5 percent in
1996 due to the expansion in the tourism, construction and
services sectors, and export-oriented activities.
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria, significant economic recovery was recorded in 1996
with GDP growth rate of 3.8 percent as against 2.3 percent in
1995. While in Ghana, GDP growth was 5 percent in 1996, compared
favorably with 4.2 percent in 1995 and 3.8 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In central Africa subregion, average GDP growth declined from
a high 5 percent in 1995 to 4.4 percent in 1996. In the Franc
Zone part of the subregion, growth was vigorous at 4.8 percent,
as against 3.1 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The fastest growing country was Equatorial Guinea, where real
GDP increased by 16.5 percent as a result of the strong revival
in the minerals producing sector and high oil output accruing
from the new fields coming on stream.
</P>
<P>
Growth also improved significantly in Congo, rising from 2.2
percent in 1995 to 4.3 percent in 1996, while the recovery which
started in Gabon in 1995 has remained on course, with GDP growth
set at 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the other countries of the subregion, however, GDP growth
was either lacklustre or on the decline. Cameroon's economic
growth was below expectations in 1996 as oil production sagged
further due to insufficient investment. Overall rate of growth in
GDP in Zaire is estimated at 1.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth in the eastern African subregion declined from 4.9
percent in 1995 to 4.3 percent in 1996 mainly because of the
slowdown in the Kenyan economy.
</P>
<P>
Still, in the subregion there was a significant improvement in
industrial growth in 1996, estimated at 5.3 percent, due to
stronger domestic demand as well as improved inflows of foreign
direct investment.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, GDP growth declined from a high of 6.5 percent in
1995 to 3.9 percent in 1996 mainly because of the weak
performance in agriculture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
There was a slow-down in 1996 in the high economic performance
that Uganda has been experiencing in the last few years, with GDP
growth slowing down to 6 percent in 1996 from 8.2 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia, economic growth was vigorous in 1996. A
combination of good weather and revival in the manufacturing
industries were the major factors behind the growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
In southern African subregion, economies generally experienced
improved performance in 1996. GDP growth has been estimated at 3
percent because of favorable weather conditions and increased
export receipts.
</P>
<P>
Economic recovery in the subregion has been aided by political
stability, reform measures and the improved international
economic environment.
</P>
<P>
The southern African economy registered a phenomenal increase
in agricultural output, and a small rise in manufacturing,
although mining output decreased mainly due to a 5 percent fall
in gold output.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the most developed country in the subregion
and source of more than a quarter of its overall output, economic
performance in 1996 was rather disappointing.
</P>
<P>
Its GDP growth was less than 2.5 percent, compared with the
previous year's 2.9 percent, although cereal production increased
from 7,463,000 tons in 1995 to 13,205,000 tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, real GDP registered a growth rate of 6.6 percent
and agriculture recovered by 18.6 percent in 1996. Zambia's
economy emerged from a declining 1.9 percent GDP growth in 1995
to a respectable 4.9 percent increase in 1996, while in Angola,
GDP growth recorded 7.2 percent increase as against 5.6 percent
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> List of Goods Exempted From Sanctions on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The list of goods exempted
from the sanctions imposed on Burundi has been expanded with a
view to easing hardships facing children, women and the elderly
people in the war-torn country, a press statement said today.
</P>
<P>
The statement from Foreign Ministry of Tanzania said the Great
Lakes Sanctions Committee which met here on May 6, has released a
list of 25 categories of goods to be exported to Burundi,
including food stuffs, medicines, construction, educational and
agricultural items.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "The idea is to ease the difficulties on
the elderly people, women and children, so the goods which are
supposed to consolidate the military regime in Burundi are still
not allowed", emphasizing that the sanctions against Burundi are
still intact.
</P>
<P>
The food stuffs allowed include animals and their products,
fish and marine products, fruits, nuts, vegetables and edible
roots and tubers.
</P>
<P>
On the list there are also cereals like maize, wheat, rice,
millet and animal or vegetable fats and oils and related goods.
Others are agricultural items like hoes, fertilizers, chemicals
and pesticide.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the above-mentioned, the list also includes
minerals, construction materials along with laboratory equipment,
medicines and pharmaceutical products.
</P>
<P>
However, sources from the ministry said there is no bilateral
trade between Burundi and any other country in the zone and those
goods may be traded by individuals.

your own life in danger."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for the police to maintain law and
order in the country so that investors can take advantage of the
peace in the liberalized economy and invest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Only those countries which are free of fraud, crime and
disorder will attract investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Police Inspector Francis Njovu said as
crime in the country is getting more sophisticated, more law
enforcement officers should be trained and retrained to ensure

<P>
LUSAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government today gave
the small-scale gemstone mines of the country three months to
present their working plans or risk having their plots
repossessed.
</P>
<P>
Mines Minister Christon Tembo today expressed disappointment
with the operation of some mines in Ndola Rural, northen Zambia

</P>
<P>
He regretted that most of the small mines are operated hastily
without due exploration work.
</P>
<P>
At one mines, he found that the safety of the workers is not
guaranteed because they do not use recommended safety clothing
while their up-keep is randomly done.
</P>
<P>
He said the government expects the mines to raise their own
capital and improve operations.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government repossessed most gemstone plots in
Ndola Rural because of under-development and failure by the
owners to comply with mining laws but they have since been given
back on the understanding that they would be developed.

Traffic East and Southern Africa, the monitoring program of
the World Wide Fund for Nature and the World Conservation Union,
recommended that CITES should accept the proposals by Botswana,
Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In accepting the proposals, CITES should, however, impose a
zero quota for trade in ivory from each country and for trade in
elephants hides from Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Traffic Director Tom Milliken said today in a statement, "this
would allow trade in live animals and hunting trophies but not in
elephant ivory or hides for the time being."
</P>
<P>
Milliken said, "in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe, the
elephant is an abundant species and clearly does not meet the
criteria for the highest level of protection under CITES."
</P>
<P>
The three countries collectively hold over 100 tons of ivory
in government strongrooms.
</P>
<P>
Harare will host the 10th CITES conference from June 9 to 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Army Gen. John Shalikashvili,
chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, will travel to China
on Sunday for a four-day visit as part of a program to improve
military relations between the two countries, the Pentagon said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The visit, at the invitation of Gen. Fu Quanyou, chief of the
General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army of China,
will be the first by the top U.S. military officer to China since
Army Gen. John Vessey's trip to China in 1983.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of our program of strengthening
military-to-military relationships between China and the United
States," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to increase understanding and transparency so that
we have a clearer idea of how each military establishment operates
so we can do more to cooperate with each other when necessary," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili is expected to meet with Chinese government
officials and military leadership. In addition to visiting
military installations and units, he will address the National
Defense University.
</P>
<P>
Since President Bill Clinton advocated his diplomatic strategy
of "constructive engagement" with China, Vice President Al Gore
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have visited China
separately this year.

UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior United Nations
official will go to Cyprus, Greece and Turkey for a visit later
this month to prepare for a face-to-face meeting between leaders
of the Greek and Cypriot communities, U.N. sources said on

</P>
<P>
The visit is expected to be made by U.N. Under-secretary

his post earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said last month that he

Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in June. It
would be their first known face-to-face encounter for nearly three
years.
</P>

But no date has been announced for the meeting nor their
duration.
</P>
<P>
"If the June talks go well, we would hope to have two more
sessions and hopefully have a clear indication by August or
September whether we are going to make real progress or not," the
U.N. chief told reporters.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) - Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said
he is "heartened" by his meeting with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair at Downing Street today.
</P>
<P>
He said there were no instant solution to revive the peace
process but Mr Blair had been "positive" and he believed the new
British Prime Minister would make the search for peace in Northern
Ireland one of his top priorities.
</P>
<P>
"I think he recognizes that there is a moment of opportunity
here...but obviously he has to be very careful and balanced in the
way that he responds to that opportunity," said Bruton, the first
foreign leader to see Blair.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting so soon after the prime minister came into
office...indicates the very high priority he is attaching to this
issues and to moving forward towards peace and reconciliation in
Northern Ireland," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bruton earlier called for Irish Republican Army (IRA) political
wing Sinn Fein to be admitted to all-party talks on the future of
Northern Ireland next month if the guerrillas announced an
immediate, genuine ceasefire. The IRA ended a 17-month truce in
February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the talks had been
helpful but stressed a new IRA ceasefire was needed before Sinn
Fein could enter talks.

<HEADLINE> House Working on Legislation to Try Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Faced with increased violent
crimes by young people, the House of Representatives neared a vote
Thursday on a get-tough bill ordering adult trials for violent
Americans barely into their teens.
</P>
<P>
Both the Clinton administration and the Republican-led Congress
are proposing get-tough measures on juvenile crimes.
</P>
<P>
The House's bill, if enacted, would change the notion that
violent offenders of 15, 14 or even 13 should be treated as
youngsters and their offenses considered childhood misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
The legislation concerns federal crimes. But it also tries to
persuade states to transform their own juvenile justice systems by
offering 1.5 billion dollars in incentive grants over three years.
</P>
<P>
To be eligible for the money, states would have to, among other
things, try 15-year-olds as adults for serious violent crimes and
require that open criminal records be established for minors after
a second offense.
</P>
<P>
"The essence of what we're doing today is to try to fix a
juvenile justice system so the very bad are removed from society
because they commit the most heinous of crimes that we have here,"
said Republican Representative Bill McCollum, the bill's chief
author.
</P>
<P>
Even many Democrats who criticized the legislation because it
contained no money for prevention or intervention efforts
supported the bill.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, adult trials of youths as young as 14 would
become routine for federal crimes including murder, rape,
aggravated assault, armed robbery and major drug offenses -- and
conspiracy to commit those crimes. To keep such a case in juvenile
court, the attorney general would have to certify that public
safety interests would be best served by doing so.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen-year-olds could also be transferred to adult federal
court if the attorney general approved the move.
</P>
<P>
While the Clinton administration's proposed bill and McCollum's
bill had much in common, the administration opposed the Republican
legislation in part because it lacked money for prevention and
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Minors were responsible for 14 percent of all violent crime in
1995, up from 10 percent in 1980, a recent Justice Department
report found. In 1995, juveniles committed 9 percent of murders,
15 percent of forcible rapes, 20 percent of robberies and 13
percent of aggravated assaults, it said.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Set Up Special Police to Monitor Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece would soon set up a special
police unit to monitor traffic on the country's two main national
highways in an effort to reduce road accidents, a Greek official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision in the Greek Parliament, Public Order
Minister George Romeos said that a patrol car would monitor
traffic at 30-kilometre intervals along the length of the
Athens-Thessaloniki and Athens-Corinth motorways after the
formation of the special traffic police division in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government was also considering banning the
circulation of large trucks at weekends and on public holidays
when many people head for the countryside in droves, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Greek Transport and Communications Minister Haris
Kastanidis also announced a government plan calling for the
establishment of a National Council For Road Safety, which would
submit recommendations concerning national policy on road safety
and supervise its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Each year, 2,000 people are killed and 32,000 injured in about
22,000 road accidents in Greece.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 days, 520 road accidents occurred in Greece,
leaving 65 people dead and 740 injured.

<HEADLINE> Reno Confirms Probe Underway on Israeli Penetration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Attorney General Jenet Reno on
Thursday confirmed that there is an investigation into an
intercepted conversation which suggested Israel may have an
intelligence source in the U.S. government who could obtain
sensitive information for the Israeli intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
"We have an ongoing investigation, so I can't comment," Reno
said at a news briefing when she was asked whether there was any
probe into the intercepted conversation.
</P>
<P>
Reno and Justice Department officials declined to give any
details of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said on Wednesday that the FBI began its
investigation in January when the National Security Agency
intercepted a secure communication between a senior Israeli
intelligence office in Washington and his superior in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The intercepted communication disclosed that there might be a
U.S. official code-named "Mega" who worked for Israel by handing
over sensitive U.S. informations to the Israeli intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
Israel has flatly denied the FBI was probing whether a senior
U.S. government officials had been involved into spying
activity.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet secretary Danny
Naveh said: "I believe everyone will understand how false and
ludicrous the story is."
</P>
<P>
Israel's Haarets newspaper said "Mega" was apparently a
mistaken decoding of "Elga" -- an old Israeli intelligence word
for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.

NEW YORK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks bounced back and
retreated moderately before closing today as investors put aside
worries about inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average added 50.97 points to
7,136.62, led by a big gain from IBM. Earlier in the afternoon,
the Dow was up nearly 130 points, nearly erasing Wednesday's
140-point plunge.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators also pulled back before the close, but
ended with sizable gains.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 534.11
million shares, up from 497.57 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 4.66 to 820.28, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 1.95 to 426.90.

<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 7.89 to 1,330.80, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.45 to 570.95.
</P>
<P>
Stocks opened the day lower, amid pressure from the bond
market, where long-term interest rates nearly pushed back above 7
percent before retreating.
</P>

IBM surged back toward a nine-year high, wiping out the
remnants of a steep slide that began in late January.
</P>

Bond prices initially fell this morning, boosting the yield on
the 30-year Treasury to 6.99 percent. But as bonds recovered, the
long-bond yield fell to 6.92 percent.

<HEADLINE> IPE Hosts Electricity Industry Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Petroleum Exchange
(IPE) hosted a meeting of experts from the UK electricity industry
today to discuss the current state of the market and the potential
for a futures contract.
</P>
<P>
Many participants expressed an interest in the transparency and
risk management facilities that futures markets typically offer.
</P>
<P>
However, there was general agreement that given current UK
electricity market conditions, this would not be a good time to
launch a futures contract.
</P>
<P>
Richard Ward, the IPE's Executive Vice President for Business
Development outlined a number of preconditions for any successful
futures contract.
</P>
<P>
They include a large number and diverse range of participants,
with a fair balance between buyers and sellers; price volatility
and risk; an underlying spot market; political, economic and
regulatory stability and industry support.
</P>
<P>
Although some of these factors already exist such as high price
volatility and risk, those present at the seminar felt that a
number of key prerequisites have yet to be met.
</P>
<P>
The political and regulatory climate was identified as a key
variable. The experts at the seminar believed that the future
development of the industry was unclear, particularly given the
recent change of UK government.
</P>
<P>
The IPE agreed to hold regular meetings with the industry to
monitor the situation, and to undertake further research and
development into the market.
</P>
<P>
After the seminar Lynton Jones, chief executive of the IPE
said: the IPE would like to launch an electricity futures contract
as soon as the time is right. But it does not want to jeopardize
the success of such a contract by premature action.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, " we will concentrate our efforts on developing
our understanding of the industry and market so that when
conditions allow and the industry feels the time is right, we will
be prepared and ready to take the initiative," he added.

million pounds (1200 million US dollars) in loans from the bank of
Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), a British court
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Gokal, 61, the ex-boss of the Gulf Group -- BCCI's
biggest borrower -- was convicted last month. His term is a record
for fraud.

Gokal, was given four years for conspiring to account falsely
and 10 years for conspiracy to defraud. He was earlier on
Thursday fined 2.94 million pounds (4.8 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The convict used the borrowed money to fund a lavish lifestyle
and had homes around the world, the Old Bailey heard.
</P>
<P>
BCCI collapsed in 1991 with debts of more than 12 billion US
dollars after evidence emerged of widespread money laundering.
Thousands of people lost their savings in the affair.

There are civil cases pending against both Gokal and his Gulf
shipping and trading group and further action is expected against
him in Pakistan.

The Western Sahara has been controlled by Morocco since 1975.
But it is a disputed area of North Africa claimed by Morocco and a

NEW YORK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell for the fourth
straight day against the yen Thursday in a broad sell-off after
remarks by Japan's top foreign-exchange policy-maker suggested it
could fall as low as 103 yen by year-end.
</P>

The comments from a top official of the Finance Ministry
international finance bureau stunned traders who less than a few

currencies.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar cost 123.77 yen, down from 125.13 yen
Wednesday and the lowest since April 3. The decline left the
dollar down 2.80 yen or 2.2 percent this week.
</P>
<P>
Against the mark, the dollar dropped to 1.7083 marks, down from
1.7212 Thursday and down 2.1 pfennigs or 1.2 percent this week.

<HEADLINE> House of Representatives Passes Bill to Try Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Faced with increasing juvenile
crime, the U.S. House of Representatives Thursday passed a
get-tough bill ordering adult trials for violent offenders barely
into their teens.
</P>
<P>
If enacted, the bill would bring about a sweeping change in
federal handling of juvenile crime, ending the notion that violent
offenders of 15, 14 or even 13 should be treated as youngsters and
their offenses considered childhood misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 286-132, with 77 Democrats joining 209 Republicans
in supporting the crackdown. Voting against it were 122 Democrats,
nine Republicans and one independent.
</P>
<P>
Both the Clinton administration and the Republican-led Congress
wanted to impose severe treatment on some juvenile offenders. But
the administration did not support this measure, largely because
it did not include money for crime prevention and did not require
that child safety locks be provided with firearm purchases.
</P>
<P>
The issue now goes to the Senate, where the Judiciary Committee
is preparing to work on a bill by Chairman Orrin Hatch, a
Republican from Utah, that also envisions more adult trials of
juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
The House bill concerns federal crimes. But it also tries to
persuade states to transform their own juvenile justice systems by
offering 1.5 billion dollars in incentive grants over three years.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, adult trials of youths as young as 14 would
become routine for federal crimes including murder, rape,
aggravated assault, armed robbery and major drug offenses -- and
conspiracy to commit those crimes.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen-year-olds could also be transferred to adult federal
court if the attorney general approved the move.
</P>
<P>
Minors were responsible for 14 percent of all violent crime in

WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved a
40 million U.S. dollar loan to help Bulgaria reduce shortage of
vital commodities.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to help finance the immediate purchase of
socially-important goods, such as medicine, wheat, and fuels,
which are currently in extremely short supply, and whose immediate
availability is crucial to preventing the deterioration of
conditions facing the Bulgarian people, a news release from the
Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's loan will play an important role in helping to boost
public support for the Bulgarian Government's reform program and
lay the groundwork for the next phase of reforms, it added.
</P>
<P>
Since Bulgaria joined the World Bank in 1990, the World Bank's
commitments total some 933 million dollars for 13 operations.

SARAJEVO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Council of Ministers on
Thursday reached an agreement on the country's 1997 budget, the
Bih TV reported.
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour session, the ministers agreed that the budget
of 136 million German marks would be financed partly by the two
entities, with the rest to be sought from international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The council's co-chairman Boro Bosic said that besides
financing institutions at the state level, most of the budget
would be used to the service of foreign debt, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is part of the so-called "quick start economic
package" of legislation of the passage of which is required by
Western countries as a pre-condition for giving more aid to the

<HEADLINE> OSCE: Elections to Proceed in Serb-held Brcko </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe said on
Thursday that upcoming local elections in the Brcko area will be
confined to the Serb-held part, despite opposition from Muslims
and Croats.
</P>
<P>
Robert Frowick, head of the OSCE mission here, said that the
elections will only be held in "an electoral district" which
covers the town of the Brcko area now under the Serbs control,
with refugees and displaced persons outside able to vote in
absentee.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the Muslim and Croat-controlled part of Brcko,
"de facto governing arrangements...do not permit the (OSCE)
Provisional Election Commission to proceed with elections there".
</P>
<P>
Both Muslims and Croats have opposed separating the
Serb-controlled part with the rest of the Brcko area, for fear
that Serb refugees there, if allowed to vote, would outnumber
their ethnic foes.
</P>
<P>
Brcko is located in a narrow corridor linking the two parts of
the Serb entity, while it also connects Bosnia with Croatia and
Central Europe because of its port and railway facilities.
</P>
<P>
Due to its strategic importance, its fate could not be decided
during the Dayton talks and had been left to an international
arbitration.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Visits Bosnia on Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel on Thursday paid a brief visit to Sarajevo, to tackle the
controversial issue of repatriating Bosnian refugees from Germany.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Bosnian officials, he said that the aim of
his visit was to coordinate the repatriation process with Bosnian
authorities, who had protested that sending back refugees at
present is premature due to the housing shortage and the danger of
reinforcing ethnic separation since those returning could not go
back to the region where they are now minority.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that the current situation in Bosnia is not ideal,
but it does not preclude the possibility of refugee return.
</P>
<P>
European Union External Affairs Commissioner Hans van den
Broek, who accompanied Kinkel, said that EU is ready to facilitate
refugee repatriation.
</P>
<P>
He said that EU would finance the construction of 13,000
housing units in Bosnia by the end of 1997, which should
accommodate more than 50,000 returnees.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, Kinkel also chided Momcilo
Krajisnik, the Serb member of the Bosnian presidency, for his
failure to show up at a meeting with the Germany official, because
of disagreement over seating arrangements.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Repeats Call for Bloodless Transition in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- With Zairian rebel forces almost
certain to enter the capital of Kinshasa, the United States on
Thursday again called for rebel leader Laurent Kabila to avoid
bloodshed in taking over the power.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters that
the United States "would like to see a transition period worked
out by meetings between Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko and
rebel leader Kabila, or their representatives, so that there could
be no "loss of life and bloodshed."
</P>
<P>
Kabila "needs to think about being a responsible person who can
lead the government. And in anticipation of that, he needs to
think about ways to preserve life," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila was said to have avoided a direct reply to the U.S.
entreaties, including those from Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, who has been to Central Africa to play a
part of mediator by meeting with several countries' leaders and
Kabila in order to help realize a "soft landing" when Kabila's
rebel forces enter the capital.
</P>
<P>
Burns said: "We understand from our conversations with Mr
Kabila that he would very much like to avoid that (bloodshed). He,
however, said also that he is determined to take the capital. Our
view is that he and others need to be mindful of their own actions,
which are a test of their credibility."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, President Mobutu left for a regional summit
meeting in Libreville, Gabon, and many speculated that he might
not return to his country.
</P>
<P>
Burns said he did not know "if the president will be returning
to Kinshasa. This is a decision he, alone, can make."
</P>
<P>
But a Zairian official dismissed that speculation, saying that
Mobutu has no intention of resigning or going into exile. "This is
his country. He will not be forced out," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu held a meeting with Kabila on board a South African ship
on Sunday on a possible transfer of power. The meeting ended
without reaching any agreement except another meeting possibly
next week.

<HEADLINE> Six African Chiefs of State Urge Stop of Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Six African chiefs of state meeting
today in the Gabonese capital Libreville on the crisis in Zaire
urged the immediate stop of hostilities, while fighting is raging
in Kenge and Kikwit east of Kinshasa between the Zairian warring
sides.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration issued after the "extraordinary summit," the
presidents of Gabon, Congo, Central African Republic, Chad,
Equatorial Guinea and Zaire said they would "take missions of
mediation and peace with the chiefs of state of the countries
concerned by the conflict of Zaire."
</P>
<P>
The chiefs of state launched "a vibrating appeal to the
parties of the conflict for an immediate cessation of the
hostilities in order to create the conditions of a political and
negotiated solution to the Zairian crisis," said the
"Declaration of Libreville."
</P>
<P>
The African leaders "took note" of the promise made by
President Mobutu Sese Seko that he would not participate in a
future presidential election, which they said has opened the "new
perspectives of a negotiated and political solution."
</P>
<P>
They also called on all the political forces of Zaire to
"instantly" prepare for a presidential election "under the
direction of the High Council of the Republic" in order to allow
a "regular functioning of the (state) institutions" and a
"democratic and orderly transition" of power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted sources of the
humanitarian groups in Kinshasa as saying that the city of
Bandundu, 300 kilometers northeast of the capital, has fallen to
the hands of the rebels of Laurent-Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that violent fighting is going on in Kenge, 200
kilometers east of Kinshasa, where the government forces have
reportedly encircled the rebels who entered the town after three
days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is also going on in Kikwit, 500 kilometers east of
Kinshasa, where the government troops are fighting the rebels from
resistance pockets, according to AFP.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Supports UN Efforts for Solving Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Sweden supports U.N. efforts to
bring about direct talks between the two communities of Cyprus for
a settlement, a Swedish official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with President Glafcos
Clerides, Swedish Deputy Foreign Minister Jan Eliasson said
Sweden believes the solution to the Cyprus problem will
contribute toward efforts to achieve peace in the region,
</P>
<P>
The Swedish official is in Cyprus for meetings in view of his
country's presidency of the U.N. Security Council in July, as
well as Cypriot prospect to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Referring to U.N.-led proximity talks between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides, Eliasson said he has seen "signs of an
interest in finding a solution on both sides", but stressed it
is up to the two parties to take the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Jan Eliasson also crossed into the Turkish-controlled northern
part of the island, where he had talks with Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is one of the countries that has contributed troops in
the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force on the island since the 1960's.

<HEADLINE> UN Official: Medical Supplies to Arrive in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Under-Secretary General
Yasushi Akashi said here today that medical supplies purchased by
Iraq will arrive in the country soon.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, the senior U.N. official for
humanitarian affairs said medical supplies will arrive in Iraq
within one or two weeks, and other humanitarian goods such as
sugar and tea will also arrive soon.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the complaints from Iraq over the slow
implementation of the oil-for-food deal signed last May by Iraq
and the U.N., Akashi said that "this is an unprecedented, very
ambitious and very complicated program and it takes time."
</P>
<P>
"I can understand the sense of impatience of the Iraqi
government and people. However, in the days to come, you will see
much quicker speed in the arrival and distribution of the
humanitarian goods," Akashi stressed.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the Iraqi accusation that the U.S. has
been deliberately hampering the implementation of the deal, Akashi
said he is not in the position to discuss the policies of a
U.N. member's government and his mission is only to address the
non political and technical problems.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction with the cooperation of the Iraqi
government in the implementation of the deal which allows Iraq to
sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy food and medicine
over a six month period.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under the U.N. sanctions following its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.

TEHRAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today urged officials in charge of elections to
observe neutrality in the upcoming presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani warned that those who violate the law and
regulations would be prosecuted and all state institutions
especially the Interior Ministry are expected to fully undertake
their legal obligations in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president made the warning at a special
ceremony to mark the National Day.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government organizations not to misuse the
state-owned facilities during the elections, otherwise "those
involved in such action would be prosecuted".
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the need for full impartiality of the government
agencies in the course of the presidential polls, the
president said, "individuals' votes are respected and no one is
entitled to use the government facilities and public assets to
the benefit or against a candidate and any discrimination toward
any of the hopefuls is forbidden and unlawful."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani recommended every individual and official to honor
the rules and hold the elections in a way to build public
confidence and prevent any distortion in the process of the
polls.
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old president has to step down from the office
in August because the Constitution bars him from running the
third term of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the Guardians Council, a supreme body above the
Parliament, announced four presidential candidates selected from 238
applicants for the 7th presidential elections scheduled for May
23.
</P>
<P>
The four candidates are hardliner Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri, former information minister Mohammad Mohammadi
Reyshahri, former cultural and Islamic guidance minister Mohammad
Khatami and Deputy Judicial Chief Reza Zavarei.
</P>
<P>
The candidates are to launch their election campaign
beginning from Saturday until 24 hours before the balloting
starts on May 23.

HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- All is set for the fifth southern
Africa economic summit to be held in Harare from May 21 to 23
when regional and international political and business leaders
will gather to discuss how to tap more private sector investment
and increase trade.
</P>
<P>
The organisers of the summit, the Geneva-based World Economic
Forum and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), are
expecting over 600 delegates to attend, including presidents of
South Africa, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The organisers noted many analysts and business leaders agree
that the economic and investment potential of sub-Saharan Africa
and particularly southern Africa, could lead the region to become
one of the world's preferred investment sites over the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the organisers believe the region's untapped
potential can only be realised if governments continue to
liberalise economies, introduce more incentives for investors and
revamp ailing infrastructural facilities still retarding economic
growth in many countries.
</P>
<P>
meanwhile, the delegates will discuss a wide range of issues,
such as harmonising monetary policies, development of the small
and medium-scale sector, privatisation, capital markets and steps
needed to improve the competitiveness of such key sectors as
manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> Parliamentary Reform Committee Appointed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's parliamentary democracy
is poised for greater heights following the launch of a reform
committee to review structures and procedures of parliament to
make it more efficient and effective.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony, speaker of parliament
Cyril Ndebele said that
the 28-member committee will resolve the need to extend
functions of committees so they can play a pro-active as opposed
to a reactive role in the formulation of legislation.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''In this way, committees will have the power
to examine any relevant legislation before it is introduced into
parliament, as well as examine government policies before they
are brought into effect.''
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary Reform Committee will examine and make
recommendations concerning mechanisms for involving civil society
in the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
Ndebele said, ''In order to be effective, parliament must
have at its disposal relevant and timely information from
independent sources rather than from the executive or the public
service, whom it is its responsibility to scrutinise.''

The ministry will also be responsible for the licensing of waste
disposal sites, waste management systems and other facilities
relating to the disposal of hazardous waste especially the dumping of
used oil.

Chimutengwende said that environmental impact assessment would also be
included in the new act, which would reguire industrial developments
to be subject to assessments to ensure all impacts on the environment
be taken into account with industrial development using engine oil
required to develop plans showing how they would dispose of waste oil
in an environmentally friendly manner.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Hails Moldova-Dniester Region Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
praised the memorandum signed by the Republic of Moldova and the
Dniester Region today in the Kremlin as a "big success" scored by
Russia's Foreign Ministry and by Yevgeni Primakov personally.
</P>
<P>
Presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrazhembsky told
journalists that the president evaluated today's signing of the
peace agreement as a "breakthrough" in Russian foreign policy,
saying "it was not so often that the sides managed to reach out to
such solutions" in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Yastrazhembsky emphasized that Yeltsin "is surprised and
indignant" at pronouncements by some media with regard to the
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The president is "fully satisfied" with the ministry's work,
the press secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Lebed, former secretary of the Russian Security
Council, today also lauded the signing of the memorandum on the
normalization of relations between Moldova and its breakaway
Dniester Region.
</P>
<P>
Lebed was commander of the Russian 14th Army, which effectively
disengaged armed groups of Moldova and the Dniester enclave after
they were locked in a bloody conflict over Dniester's unilaterally
declared independence.
</P>
<P>
"Any civilized solution to a problem is a boon. The main thing
now is that people survive, and they will sort things out later,"
Lebed told reporters after he laid a wreath at the Unknown Soldier
tomb near the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The Dniester Region is a sliver of land in eastern Moldova
dominated by the Russian-speaking population. But two-thirds of
the Moldovan population are ethnic Romanians.
</P>
<P>
The fear of Moldova's reunification with Romania drove
Dniester's separatists to unilaterally declare independence in
1992, triggering an eight-month civil war against Moldovan
government forces.
</P>
<P>
The war, which left about 700 dead, ended when the Russian 14th
Army based in the Dniester region intervened. So far, some 6,500
Russian troops are still stationed there.
