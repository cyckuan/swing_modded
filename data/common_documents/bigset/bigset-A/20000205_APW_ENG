<HEADLINE> Mother Charged With Shooting Kids  </HEADLINE>
   By C. BRYSON HULL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMBALL, Texas (AP) -- A woman fatally shot her teen-age daughter and
wounded her son, then called 911 to report what she had done, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Linda McKenty Carr, 41, a single mother who was a substitute teacher at her
daughter's school, bought a handgun hours before shooting the teen-agers
Thursday afternoon and intended to kill herself, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   Why Carr allegedly shot Aubrey, 15, and Justin, 13, was unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just know that for whatever reason, she had got distraught, and thought
she'd be better off dead and her children, too,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Bob Black.
</P>
<P>
	   Black said he expects to learn more once investigators speak with Justin,
who was hospitalized in fair condition Friday night. The children's father, John
McKenty, was en route to Houston from Colorado to be with his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Carr called 911 after the shootings and told police what had happened,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tomball High School made counselors available Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to say on behalf of district that our thoughts and prayers are
with the family,'' said Lee Weeditz, a spokesperson for the Tomball Independent
School District.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeditz said Carr passed a criminal background check when she was hired.
</P>
<P>
	   A portion of the 1993 Brady Bill that provided a mandatory five-day
``cooling off'' period on handgun purchases expired in November 1998. Carr was
able to pass an instant background check, and leave for her house with a
brand-new gun, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carr, 41, was charged with murder and aggravated assault with a deadly
weapon. She is being held in lieu of $400,000 bond.

<HEADLINE> Report: Deutch Still Has Clearance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Deutch, the former CIA director who was stripped of
his agency security clearance, still has Pentagon clearance that allows him to
work on classified defense contracts, according to The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch's clearance permits him to serve as a paid consultant on Defense
Department contracts with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, SAIC Corp.
and Raytheon Corp., the newspaper reported in its Saturday editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, now a professor at MIT, lost his agency clearance last summer after
it was discovered he kept classified documents on his home computer, which was
connected to the Internet and not protected by any security devices. At the same
time, the Pentagon also suspended his clearance from the Defense Intelligence
Agency, the nation's main military intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post, however, said Deutch never lost his industrial security clearance.
</P>
<P>
	   An unidentified Pentagon official quoted by the Post said Friday that the
Defense Department's industrial clearance was based on a different standard than
CIA and DIA clearances and it involved specific defense programs and not the
broad information covered by an intelligence clearance.
</P>
<P>
	   That type of clearance, the official said, is harder to revoke because it
may cause the person to lose a job or income.

<HEADLINE> TV Pioneer Syd Cassyd Dies at 91  </HEADLINE>
   By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Syd Cassyd, a writer, producer and television pioneer
who founded the Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences, died Friday. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
	   Cassyd died at home from a neurological disease, according to his daughter,
Donna Cassyd.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone in the broadcasting industry has gained by Syd Cassyd's vision in
establishing our academy more than 50 years ago, when television was in its
infancy,'' said academy Chairman Meryl Marshall.
</P>
<P>
	   The Teaneck, N.J., native served in World War II with the Army Signal Corps,
working as a film editor under legendary director Frank Capra. He moved to Los
Angeles after the war and found jobs as an editor for Boxoffice magazine and as
a Paramount Pictures grip.
</P>
<P>
	   He worked with another TV trailblazer, Klaus Landsberg, on the experimental
Los Angeles TV station W6XYZ, now KTLA. The growth of television inspired Cassyd
to create the academy in 1946 as a clearinghouse for ideas about the new medium.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven people attended the first meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But by the fifth meeting, there were 250 members,'' Cassyd said in 1996 on
the 50th anniversary of the organization, when he received a star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame. He called television ``the greatest instrument that has
ever been invented.''
</P>
<P>
	   The academy became a nonprofit organization in 1948, its stated goal to
``promote the cultural, educational and research aims of television.'' Its best
known symbol is the Emmy Award.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, the father of actress Candice Bergen, was
recruited by Cassyd as the first academy president in 1947. Cassyd served as
president in 1950 and held other posts over the years.
</P>
<P>
	   Cassyd, who also taught film production at New York University and helped
establish film education programs at various schools, produced the 1952
children's shows ``Candy's Playhouse'' and ``Young Musical America.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also produced documentaries and a monthly magazine of television
criticism, TV News.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, the academy's board of governors instituted the Syd Cassyd Founders
Award and named Cassyd its first recipient in honor of his distinguished
service. He also received three of the academy's Governors Awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides his daughter, Cassyd is survived by his wife, Miriam.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Better Manufacturing  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for an additional
$386 million for training and trade enforcement programs designed to strengthen
U.S. manufacturing jobs, the White House said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget request, which will be part of the spending package that Clinton
sends to Congress on Monday, comes as he is beginning a major push to convince
fellow trade Democrats in Congress to support a new trade arrangement with
China. Trade unions are among the most vocal opponents of the proposed pact.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton wants $39 million for more training and extended unemployment
benefits for workers who lose their jobs due to imports or other trade-related
shifts and $35 million for a new bureaucracy to administer such emergency funds.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also wants to increase the number of federal trade enforcement
officers, including a tripling of officers assigned to ensure China complies
with trade rules, a statement from the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   Increased enforcement would help ``ensure that U.S. manufacturers and others
benefit fully from the opportunities created by our trade agreements and laws,''
the White House statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration also wants $215 million more for new loans to
U.S. businesses to foster exports. The increase would bring funding for the
Export-Import Bank to just above $1 billion next year -- a 36 percent increase
over the amount Congress approved for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House estimated the new export loans would generate more than $3
billion in new manufacturing exports and fund more than 25,000 manufacturing
jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We like what we see in the president's proposals,'' said Jerry Jasinowski,
president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   Jasinowski noted the budget request puts particular emphasis on increasing
workers' high-tech skills and on helping smaller businesses take advantage of
commercial opportunities on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration wants Congress to give up its politically charged
annual review of trade benefits for China and instead grant Beijing normal,
permanent trade status.
</P>
<P>
	   After the collapse of global trade talks in Seattle and a determined
campaign by organized labor and environmental groups, President Clinton faces a
tough sell in persuading Congress to grant permanent trade benefits to China.
</P>
<P>
	   The election year heightens political pressures as well, prompting Clinton
and his allies to push for a vote as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   Permanent trade benefits are part of the trade-opening agreement negotiated
by China and the United States as the price for China's entry into the
135-nation World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for global commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House contends the trade-opening agreement will dramatically
reduce Chinese tariffs on everything from agricultural and industrial products
to computers and semiconductors.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Giuliani still leads; one shows carpetbagger issue dims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Two statewide polls have Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
still leading Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York's budding Senate campaign, but
one says the carpetbagger issue for her may be dimming.
<P>
	   And, by a 3-1 margin, New York voters queried by Marist College's Institute
for Public Opinion said questions about the respective marriages of the first
lady and the Republican mayor were unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton's marital strife has become part of the American fabric, there
have also been published reports of trouble in Giuliani's marriage to
newswoman-actress Donna Hanover. The mayor has refused to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that does emerge during the campaign, you can expect a loud boo from the
New York electorate," Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marist poll found that 47 percent of voters favored the New York City
mayor while 40 percent favored the first lady, statistically unchanged from
Marist polls in December and January.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll from Zogby International had Giuliani leading Clinton, 48 percent to
42 percent. Zogby's December poll had the mayor favored, 50 percent to 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is scheduled to formally announce her candidacy on Sunday. The mayor
hasn't said when he plans to make his candidacy official.
</P>
<P>
	   Marist's Miringoff said that for the first time since February of last year,
fewer than half the voters surveyed in his poll said they were concerned that
Clinton lacked New York roots.
</P>
<P>
	   This time around, 47 percent of voters said they were at least somewhat
concerned about Clinton not being from New York while 41 percent said they were
not concerned at all about that. In the Marist poll, the carpetbagger concern
peaked in December when 57 percent of voters said they were at least somewhat
concerned.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton moved into her new $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County
just last month, officially establishing her New York residency.
</P>
<P>
	   As in previous polls, the two new ones found Giuliani and Clinton tied among
women voters with Giuliani leading among men.
</P>
<P>
	   While President Clinton's job approval rating in New York remained high, at
64 percent in the Marist poll, three of every four voters said his campaigning
for his wife wouldn't make any difference in how they voted. Twenty percent told
the Marist pollsters that President Clinton stumping for his wife would make it
less likely they would vote for her.
</P>
<P>
	   Marist's telephone poll of 634 registered voters and Zogby's poll of 700
likely voters were conducted Wednesday and Thursday and each has a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Family acquaintance tried for killing two, wounding three  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - An acquaintance of a family bound and terrorized
during a bungled robbery could face death row if convicted of killing two boys,
ages 14 and 2, and wounding a mother and her two teen-age daughters.
<P>
	   Jose Julian Santiago, 25, went on trial this week on charges of first-degree
murder in the execution-style shootings of Bernetta Wims' son, Zyrone, and her
toddler grandson, Drequan, last March 1. Both children were shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
	   Before fleeing from the family's house, police said Santiago also shot and
stabbed Wims, 36, and her daughters, ages 19 and 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection began Wednesday and could last up to two months, prosecutors
say. Already, 750 potential jurors have been summoned to court.
</P>
<P>
	   The family, who had known Santiago for a few months, said he talked about
being depressed and having no money during a visit to their home that night.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Santiago then pointed a gun at Zyrone's head when the boy
arrived home from basketball practice, stole some jewelry and demanded cash.
After the mother pleaded that she had none, Santiago allegedly forced her and
her daughters to lie face-down on a bed.
</P>
<P>
	   When one of the girls cried out "Oh God," Wims said Santiago replied, "What
are you saying God for? Where is he? He ain't gonna help you now." The younger
daughter, Chaquita, also told police that Santiago made an unwanted sexual
advance on her.
</P>
<P>
	   Her sister, Shuntavia, said she heard Santiago yelling at her infant son to
stop crying, then a gun went off "and my son stopped crying and fell back on
me."
</P>
<P>
	   After being shot and stabbed, the mother alleged that Santiago splashed a
cold liquid on her to determine if she was dead. "He must have been checking to
see if we were dead because when I reacted to the cold, he started stabbing me
some more," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she freed herself after Santiago left and flagged down a patrol
car. He was captured soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Wims' husband, Zyrone Scrivens, was shot to death in 1997 by his cousin, who
was sentenced in 1998 to 20 years to life in prison. Her slain son was named
after his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Santiago pleaded guilty in Syracuse in 1998 to possessing crack cocaine and
was on probation when he was charged with the killings.
</P>
<P>
	   He is the second person to stand trial for his life in Rochester since New
York restored the death penalty in 1995. Angel Mateo was dispatched to death row
a year ago for abducting and executing a mentally ill man during a frenzied hunt
for his estranged girlfriend in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Independence Party schism spills into Albany courts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The split in New York's Reform Party seems to be
growing.
<P>
	   Party Chairman Jack Essenberg - a Donald Trump supporter - on Friday had a
judge slap a restraining order on party members who support Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Reform Party - known in New York as the Independence Party - had a state
committee meeting set in Albany to remove Essenberg. The Independence Party's
Democracy Coalition, led by leftist activist Lenora Fulani, back Pat Buchanan
and have called for Essenberg's removal.
</P>
<P>
	   Essenberg was trying to read a letter when Buchanan supporter and Fulani
spokeswoman Cathy Stewart started interrupting him. When he wouldn't recognize
her the Buchanan supporters tried to take over the meeting to vote Essenberg
out.
</P>
<P>
	   However, his lawyer, Thomas Spargo, pulled out a restraining order signed
the day before banning the meeting from continuing without Essenberg, who then
walked out.
</P>
<P>
	   The stunned Fulani supporters were left in the room trying to figure out
their next move. They later moved to another room and continued meeting, Fulani
spokeswoman Sarah Lyons said. She said the restraining order was eventually
lifted.
</P>
<P>
	   The restraining order was signed on Thursday by state Supreme Court Justice
Thomas McNamara, the same judge who threw Trump off the Independence Party
ballot last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides now plan to head to the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an unbelievably illegal restraining order," Stewart said. "We
should sit tight. The day is not over."
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll see what the courts say," Essenberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump is not an announced presidential candidate for the Reform Party.
Nonetheless, he is considering running for the party's presidential nomination
and has picked up support from Reform Party members.
</P>
<P>
	   While Fulani is backing conservative Buchanan's bid for the Reform Party's
nomination, her faction is running delegate slates for the New York primary that
are uncommitted to any candidate. They convinced McNamara to throw out all of
the Trump delegates, saying Trump supporters did not get enough signatures to be
on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Fulani supporters say Essenberg wants to use the Independence Party to set
himself up as a kingmaker and endorse other candidates similar to the state's
Conservative and Liberal parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Essenberg denies that and says the Fulani supporters just want control over
the party.

<HEADLINE> Testimony concluded in church arson case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal jury will soon deliberate a case in
which prosecutors suspect a clergyman ordered the burning of a rival's church.
<P>
	   Defense lawyers decided against calling any witnesses Friday in the case.
Instead, a federal court jury will begin on Monday to decide who was responsible
for a 1997 Utica church fire, based on the testimony of the prosecution's
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Brown, 22, and Jimmy Jackson, 31, both of Utica, are on trial, but
prosecutors said it was a rival clergyman who ordered the burning of Believers
Miracle Deliverance Church in an attempt to drive out the competition.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trial's final day of testimony on Thursday, Roger Perkins
testified that Bishop Calvin Ashley Jr., head of St. Mark's Healing and
Deliverance Tabernacle in Utica, repeatedly said not to implicate him the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "He told me not to worry about it, and he'd take care of everything," said
Perkins, who pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court to a noncriminal charge
that he was allowed to enter because he was 17 at the time of the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Carr, the evidence showed that
Jackson, Brown, Henry Savage and Perkins were involved in setting the fire at
Ashley's request.
</P>
<P>
	   Ashley, 65, is listed in a grand jury indictment as an unindicted
coconspirator. Prosecutors have given no explanation why Ashley has not been
charged.
</P>
<P>
	   According to testimony, Perkins had dinner with Ashley the evening before
the fire. Ashley talked about his anger with Willie Jewel Steele for starting
the rival church. Steele was assistant pastor at St. Mark's for 13 years until
she left in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Later that same night, after attending a service at Ashley's church, Perkins
met with Savage, Brown and Jackson. Jackson was the musical director at St.
Mark's.
</P>
<P>
	   With Jackson working as the lookout just after midnight, Perkins testified
that he forced open the church door and that Savage poured gasoline on the floor
and doors leading to the church sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
	   During cross-examination, defense lawyers Frank Policelli and Scott
DeTraglia made note of the deal Perkins struck with authorities, which leaves
him without a criminal record. They also contended that Perkins should not be
believed. He gave as many as nine different stories to police, DeTraglia said.

<HEADLINE> Jurors hear another appraiser on land claim's worth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - In calculations that must consider not just
economics but centuries, appraiser for the state figures the disputed tract of
New York that the Cayuga Indian Nation claims as its ancestral home is worth $46
million.
<P>
	   The state's appraiser believes the 64,015-acre land claim should be
considered as a single tract.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be virtually impossible to value separate parcels of land over 204
years," John D. Dorchester Jr. told a nine-member U.S. District Court jury.
Dorchester is the state's key witness in the two-week-long damages trial.
</P>
<P>
	   An appraiser for the federal government, Arvel Hale, testified last week
that the land had a present-day market value of $264.7 million and a rental
worth of $70.4 million. The state spent three days trying to show that Hale's
methods were flawed and that the sum was grossly inflated.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first day on the witness stand, Dorchester explained the steps he
took in doing his appraisal, in which he put the land's present-day market value
between $25 million and $40 million and its rental worth at no more than $6.5
million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I looked at the property as a single tract, with single ownership ... and
with no private improvements," Dorchester said.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout his testimony, Dorchester returned to a theme that has become the
state's refrain as it seeks to undermine the testimony from Hale, who was the
only witness for the federal government and Cayugas, who are joint plaintiffs in
the case. The state has contended that Hale reached his values by adding
individual parcels instead of considering the claim area as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury is being asked to decide how much New York state should pay the
Cayugas for illegally acquiring the land in Cayuga and Seneca counties two
centuries ago. U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn has said the Cayugas should be
compensated for the land's present-day market value, as well as compensation for
its use and occupancy since 1795.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his testimony, Hale said he looked at 5,700 parcels and used a
"highest and best use" approach to derive a per-acre average price in
determining the claim area's worth.
</P>
<P>
	   "To try to value them as individual parcels ... would be difficult to
impossible. There are major problems in doing it that way," said Dorchester, who
will return to the witness stand Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time New York acquired the Cayuga land in 1795, that part of upstate
New York was considered frontier. New York divided the land into 600-acre
parcels and auctioned them off in 1796 to help promote settlement. They have
undergone repeated subdivision since that time.
</P>
<P>
	   Records from the earliest years are scarce and both appraisers said they
supplemented sales records with other information to calculate rental value.
Hale based his value on 6 percent of an acre's worth as farm land. Dorchester
said Friday he used a 2 percent figure.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, Dorchester went over his credentials from nearly 50 years in
the profession, including his work appraising Alaskan lands damaged by the Exxon
Valdez spill.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Attorney General John Pickett made sure the jury heard that
Dorchester had earned recognition as a Member of the Appraisal Institute, a
professional organization that sets industry standards, by completing a series
of tests and completing other requirements, and that he had help author the
industry's standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale told the jury under cross-examination that he had started but not
completed MAI requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   About two dozen members of Upstate Citizens for Equality, a grassroots
citizen's group opposed to the land claim, attended Friday's session.

<HEADLINE> Mets Sign Wendell for $2.05 Million  </HEADLINE>
   By RONALD BLUM
AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Last year, Turk Wendell signed for $1.2 million
plus 99 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   He had to be even odder this year, so when the colorful reliever
avoided salary arbitration Friday night, he did it with a deal
worth $2.05 million -- plus a $13.99 bonus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We finally gave into the bonus,'' Mets general manager Steve
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wendell, who wears No. 99 and likes to slam resin bags into the
mound, was 5-4 with a 3.05 ERA and three saves in 80 relief
appearances last year. The 32-year-old right-hander, who is
eligible for free agency after next season, had sought a three-year
contract, but the Mets weren't interested at his price.
</P>
<P>
	   He had asked for $2.15 million in arbitration and had been
offered $1.85 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Just last week, Wendell was rescued in Rocky Mountain foothills
30 miles from Denver after wandering with a guide too far from his
vehicle and spending the night camping with the temperature at
minus-10. Wendell was mountain lion hunting at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   New York also agreed to a $750,000, one-year contract with Pat
Mahomes and added another arm for spring training by signing free
agent Dennis Springer.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahomes, a 29-year-old right-hander, was 8-0 with a 3.63 ERA in
39 games last year, all in relief. He made $310,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He kept us in so many games that we were able to come back and
win,'' Phillips said. ``We know he'll be a force out of the bullpen
this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mahomes, who struck out 51 in 63 2-3 innings, can earn an
additional $100,000 in performance bonuses based on a points
system. He had asked for $940,000 in arbitration and had been
offered $625,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Closer Armando Benitez is the only Met remaining in arbitration.
His hearing is scheduled for Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Springer, a right-hander who turns 35 next week, opted for free
agency after last season rather than accept an outright assignment
to the minors from the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
	   He was 6-16 with one save and a 4.86 ERA in 29 starts and nine
relief appearances, throwing shutouts against Atlanta and Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Hampton, Al Leiter, Rick Reed and Bobby J. Jones figure to
be the Mets' top four starters, while Springer and Mahomes compete
for the fifth spot with Bobby M. Jones, Bill Pulsipher, Rich
Rodriguez and Glendon Rusch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel we have added depth,'' Phillips said. ``He's versatile
and has proven that he can throw a lot of innings.''

<HEADLINE> Family acquaintance tried for killing two, wounding three  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - An acquaintance of a family bound and terrorized
during a bungled robbery could face death row if convicted of killing two boys,
ages 14 and 2, and wounding a mother and her two teen-age daughters.
<P>
	   Jose Julian Santiago, 25, went on trial this week on charges of first-degree
murder in the execution-style shootings of Bernetta Wims' son, Zyrone, and her
toddler grandson, Drequan, last March 1. Both children were shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
	   Before fleeing from the family's house, police said Santiago also shot and
stabbed Wims, 36, and her daughters, ages 19 and 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection began Wednesday and could last up to two months, prosecutors
say. Already, 750 potential jurors have been summoned to court.
</P>
<P>
	   The family, who had known Santiago for a few months, said he talked about
being depressed and having no money during a visit to their home that night.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Santiago then pointed a gun at Zyrone's head when the boy
arrived home from basketball practice, stole some jewelry and demanded cash.
After the mother pleaded that she had none, Santiago allegedly forced her and
her daughters to lie face-down on a bed.
</P>
<P>
	   When one of the girls cried out "Oh God," Wims said Santiago replied, "What
are you saying God for? Where is he? He ain't gonna help you now." The younger
daughter, Chaquita, also told police that Santiago made an unwanted sexual
advance on her.
</P>
<P>
	   Her sister, Shuntavia, said she heard Santiago yelling at her infant son to
stop crying, then a gun went off "and my son stopped crying and fell back on
me."
</P>
<P>
	   After being shot and stabbed, the mother alleged that Santiago splashed a
cold liquid on her to determine if she was dead. "He must have been checking to
see if we were dead because when I reacted to the cold, he started stabbing me
some more," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she freed herself after Santiago left and flagged down a patrol
car. He was captured soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Wims' husband, Zyrone Scrivens, was shot to death in 1997 by his cousin, who
was sentenced in 1998 to 20 years to life in prison. Her slain son was named
after his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Santiago pleaded guilty in Syracuse in 1998 to possessing crack cocaine and
was on probation when he was charged with the killings.
</P>
<P>
	   He is the second person to stand trial for his life in Rochester since New
York restored the death penalty in 1995. Angel Mateo was dispatched to death row
a year ago for abducting and executing a mentally ill man during a frenzied hunt
for his estranged girlfriend in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Independence Party schism spills into Albany courts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The split in New York's Reform Party seems to be
growing.
<P>
	   Party Chairman Jack Essenberg - a Donald Trump supporter - on Friday had a
judge slap a restraining order on party members who support Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Reform Party - known in New York as the Independence Party - had a state
committee meeting set in Albany to remove Essenberg. The Independence Party's
Democracy Coalition, led by leftist activist Lenora Fulani, back Pat Buchanan
and have called for Essenberg's removal.
</P>
<P>
	   Essenberg was trying to read a letter when Buchanan supporter and Fulani
spokeswoman Cathy Stewart started interrupting him. When he wouldn't recognize
her the Buchanan supporters tried to take over the meeting to vote Essenberg
out.
</P>
<P>
	   However, his lawyer, Thomas Spargo, pulled out a restraining order signed
the day before banning the meeting from continuing without Essenberg, who then
walked out.
</P>
<P>
	   The stunned Fulani supporters were left in the room trying to figure out
their next move. They later moved to another room and continued meeting, Fulani
spokeswoman Sarah Lyons said. She said the restraining order was eventually
lifted.
</P>
<P>
	   The restraining order was signed on Thursday by state Supreme Court Justice
Thomas McNamara, the same judge who threw Trump off the Independence Party
ballot last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides now plan to head to the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an unbelievably illegal restraining order," Stewart said. "We
should sit tight. The day is not over."
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll see what the courts say," Essenberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump is not an announced presidential candidate for the Reform Party.
Nonetheless, he is considering running for the party's presidential nomination
and has picked up support from Reform Party members.
</P>
<P>
	   While Fulani is backing conservative Buchanan's bid for the Reform Party's
nomination, her faction is running delegate slates for the New York primary that
are uncommitted to any candidate. They convinced McNamara to throw out all of
the Trump delegates, saying Trump supporters did not get enough signatures to be
on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Fulani supporters say Essenberg wants to use the Independence Party to set
himself up as a kingmaker and endorse other candidates similar to the state's
Conservative and Liberal parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Essenberg denies that and says the Fulani supporters just want control over
the party.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Giuliani still leads; one shows carpetbagger issue dims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Two statewide polls have Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
still leading Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York's budding Senate campaign, but
one says the carpetbagger issue for her may be dimming.
<P>
	   And, by a 3-1 margin, New York voters queried by Marist College's Institute
for Public Opinion said questions about the respective marriages of the first
lady and the Republican mayor were unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton's marital strife has become part of the American fabric, there
have also been published reports of trouble in Giuliani's marriage to
newswoman-actress Donna Hanover. The mayor has refused to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that does emerge during the campaign, you can expect a loud boo from the
New York electorate," Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marist poll found that 47 percent of voters favored the New York City
mayor while 40 percent favored the first lady, statistically unchanged from
Marist polls in December and January.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll from Zogby International had Giuliani leading Clinton, 48 percent to
42 percent. Zogby's December poll had the mayor favored, 50 percent to 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is scheduled to formally announce her candidacy on Sunday. The mayor
hasn't said when he plans to make his candidacy official.
</P>
<P>
	   Marist's Miringoff said that for the first time since February of last year,
fewer than half the voters surveyed in his poll said they were concerned that
Clinton lacked New York roots.
</P>
<P>
	   This time around, 47 percent of voters said they were at least somewhat
concerned about Clinton not being from New York while 41 percent said they were
not concerned at all about that. In the Marist poll, the carpetbagger concern
peaked in December when 57 percent of voters said they were at least somewhat
concerned.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton moved into her new $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County
just last month, officially establishing her New York residency.
</P>
<P>
	   As in previous polls, the two new ones found Giuliani and Clinton tied among
women voters with Giuliani leading among men.
</P>
<P>
	   While President Clinton's job approval rating in New York remained high, at
64 percent in the Marist poll, three of every four voters said his campaigning
for his wife wouldn't make any difference in how they voted. Twenty percent told
the Marist pollsters that President Clinton stumping for his wife would make it
less likely they would vote for her.
</P>
<P>
	   Marist's telephone poll of 634 registered voters and Zogby's poll of 700
likely voters were conducted Wednesday and Thursday and each has a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Testimony concluded in church arson case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal jury will soon deliberate a case in
which prosecutors suspect a clergyman ordered the burning of a rival's church.
<P>
	   Defense lawyers decided against calling any witnesses Friday in the case.
Instead, a federal court jury will begin on Monday to decide who was responsible
for a 1997 Utica church fire, based on the testimony of the prosecution's
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Brown, 22, and Jimmy Jackson, 31, both of Utica, are on trial, but
prosecutors said it was a rival clergyman who ordered the burning of Believers
Miracle Deliverance Church in an attempt to drive out the competition.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trial's final day of testimony on Thursday, Roger Perkins
testified that Bishop Calvin Ashley Jr., head of St. Mark's Healing and
Deliverance Tabernacle in Utica, repeatedly said not to implicate him the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "He told me not to worry about it, and he'd take care of everything," said
Perkins, who pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court to a noncriminal charge
that he was allowed to enter because he was 17 at the time of the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Carr, the evidence showed that
Jackson, Brown, Henry Savage and Perkins were involved in setting the fire at
Ashley's request.
</P>
<P>
	   Ashley, 65, is listed in a grand jury indictment as an unindicted
coconspirator. Prosecutors have given no explanation why Ashley has not been
charged.
</P>
<P>
	   According to testimony, Perkins had dinner with Ashley the evening before
the fire. Ashley talked about his anger with Willie Jewel Steele for starting
the rival church. Steele was assistant pastor at St. Mark's for 13 years until
she left in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Later that same night, after attending a service at Ashley's church, Perkins
met with Savage, Brown and Jackson. Jackson was the musical director at St.
Mark's.
</P>
<P>
	   With Jackson working as the lookout just after midnight, Perkins testified
that he forced open the church door and that Savage poured gasoline on the floor
and doors leading to the church sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
	   During cross-examination, defense lawyers Frank Policelli and Scott
DeTraglia made note of the deal Perkins struck with authorities, which leaves
him without a criminal record. They also contended that Perkins should not be
believed. He gave as many as nine different stories to police, DeTraglia said.

<HEADLINE> Jurors hear another appraiser on land claim's worth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - In calculations that must consider not just
economics but centuries, appraiser for the state figures the disputed tract of
New York that the Cayuga Indian Nation claims as its ancestral home is worth $46
million.
<P>
	   The state's appraiser believes the 64,015-acre land claim should be
considered as a single tract.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be virtually impossible to value separate parcels of land over 204
years," John D. Dorchester Jr. told a nine-member U.S. District Court jury.
Dorchester is the state's key witness in the two-week-long damages trial.
</P>
<P>
	   An appraiser for the federal government, Arvel Hale, testified last week
that the land had a present-day market value of $264.7 million and a rental
worth of $70.4 million. The state spent three days trying to show that Hale's
methods were flawed and that the sum was grossly inflated.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first day on the witness stand, Dorchester explained the steps he
took in doing his appraisal, in which he put the land's present-day market value
between $25 million and $40 million and its rental worth at no more than $6.5
million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I looked at the property as a single tract, with single ownership ... and
with no private improvements," Dorchester said.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout his testimony, Dorchester returned to a theme that has become the
state's refrain as it seeks to undermine the testimony from Hale, who was the
only witness for the federal government and Cayugas, who are joint plaintiffs in
the case. The state has contended that Hale reached his values by adding
individual parcels instead of considering the claim area as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury is being asked to decide how much New York state should pay the
Cayugas for illegally acquiring the land in Cayuga and Seneca counties two
centuries ago. U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn has said the Cayugas should be
compensated for the land's present-day market value, as well as compensation for
its use and occupancy since 1795.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his testimony, Hale said he looked at 5,700 parcels and used a
"highest and best use" approach to derive a per-acre average price in
determining the claim area's worth.
</P>
<P>
	   "To try to value them as individual parcels ... would be difficult to
impossible. There are major problems in doing it that way," said Dorchester, who
will return to the witness stand Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time New York acquired the Cayuga land in 1795, that part of upstate
New York was considered frontier. New York divided the land into 600-acre
parcels and auctioned them off in 1796 to help promote settlement. They have
undergone repeated subdivision since that time.
</P>
<P>
	   Records from the earliest years are scarce and both appraisers said they
supplemented sales records with other information to calculate rental value.
Hale based his value on 6 percent of an acre's worth as farm land. Dorchester
said Friday he used a 2 percent figure.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, Dorchester went over his credentials from nearly 50 years in
the profession, including his work appraising Alaskan lands damaged by the Exxon
Valdez spill.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Attorney General John Pickett made sure the jury heard that
Dorchester had earned recognition as a Member of the Appraisal Institute, a
professional organization that sets industry standards, by completing a series
of tests and completing other requirements, and that he had help author the
industry's standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale told the jury under cross-examination that he had started but not
completed MAI requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   About two dozen members of Upstate Citizens for Equality, a grassroots
citizen's group opposed to the land claim, attended Friday's session.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies 101, Bulls 76  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Michael Dickerson scored 20 points as
Vancouver routed Chicago 101-76 on Friday night, the Grizzlies' most decisive
victory in their five-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Bibby added 16 points for the Grizzlies, whose biggest previous victory
margin was 20 in a 109-89 road victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Nov. 14.
Vancouver also beat the Bulls for the first time in eight career meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago, an NBA-worst 9-35, offered little resistance in the middle game of
a six-stop road trip. Toni Kukoc led the Bulls with 27 points, and Elton Brand
added 22.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls, coming off an 88-81 victory Wednesday night in Seattle, got no
closer than 10 points after the first quarter and went through a 12:05 stretch
in the second half without scoring a basket. It was their 19th loss in 22 road
outings.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver led 58-44 at the break, largely on the strength of a sizzling
first quarter. The Grizzlies led 37-20 after the opening 12 minutes, easily
their best period of the season, shooting 60 percent from the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory gave interim Vancouver coach Lionel Hollins a 9-14 record since
taking over from the fired Brian Hill on Dec. 16. Vancouver went 8-42 under Hill
last season.

<TEXT>
<P>
    EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Felicity Willis scored 17 of her 19 points in the
second half as No. 19 Arizona defeated Oregon 73-66 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The win moved the Wildcats (17-3 overall, 6-2 Pac-10) into a three-way tie
for first place with Stanford and UCLA, and was the first loss at McArthur Court
for the Ducks (14-6, 5-3) since Colorado State beat them 72-70 on Nov. 16, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Angela Lackey added 17 points for Arizona, while Willis dished out eight
assists. Brianne Meharry led the Ducks with 19 points and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   After Arizona blew a 13-point second-half lead, the Ducks took a 58-57 lead
with 3 1/2 minutes to play when Nicole Strange hit a medium-range jumper. But
Willis responded with a layup at the other end to give the lead back to the
Wildcats, and Arizona added five more points during a 15-second span to lead
64-58 with just over two minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Down 32-31 at halftime, Arizona took command with an 18-4 run in the first
five minutes of the second half for a 49-36 lead. The Wildcats connected on four
3-pointers during the run, including two by Willis.
</P>
<P>
	   But Meharry brought the Ducks back, scoring the last seven points of a 15-2
run, and Oregon tied the score at 51-all with 7 1/2 minutes to go.

Clinton Seeks Manufacturing Funds
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for an additional
$386 million for training and trade enforcement programs designed to strengthen
U.S. manufacturing jobs, the White House said Friday. The budget request, which
will be part of the spending package that Clinton sends to Congress on Monday,
comes as he is beginning a major push to convince fellow trade Democrats in
Congress to support a new trade arrangement with China. Trade unions are among
the most vocal opponents of the proposed pact.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Deutch, the former CIA director who was stripped of
his agency security clearance, still has Pentagon clearance that allows him to
work on classified defense contracts, according to The Washington Post. Deutch's
clearance permits him to serve as a paid consultant on Defense Department
contracts with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, SAIC Corp. and
Raytheon Corp., the newspaper reported in its Saturday editions.

French Troops Clash With Kosovars

	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Hundreds of ethnic Albanians pelted
French soldiers with stones and bottles Friday, charging that NATO-led
peacekeepers failed to prevent the deaths of at least six Kosovo Albanians. The
latest round of violence started after a rocket attack Wednesday killed two
elderly Serbs on a bus run by the U.N. refugee agency that was carrying them
through predominantly Albanian areas near Kosovska Mitrovica. That attack
destroyed what little faith minority Serbs had in the power of U.N. peacekeepers
to protect them from violence by ethnic Albanians.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A governing coalition tainted by a party identified
with Nazi sympathies took power in Austria Friday, triggering diplomatic
sanctions and egg-throwing protests that forced the new ministers to leave the
swearing-in ceremony through an underground tunnel. President Thomas Klestil,
who swore in the new center-right coalition, appealed to the world to give the
new government a chance to fulfill its promises to govern under European
standards of democracy and human rights.

Noises Heard on Airline 'Black Box'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Two noises were heard on the "black boxes" from
Alaska Airlines flight 261 just before the plan crashed in the Pacific ocean,
federal officials said. The tape revealed new details of what occurred on the
flight in its last minutes as the pilots struggled to control a problem with the
horizontal stabilizer -- the wide part of the tail that keeps a plane flying
level. The plane nose-dived into the Pacific Ocean en route from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco on Monday, killing all 88 aboard.

NASA Listens for Mars Signal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Giant dish antennas in Europe and North America
were aimed toward Mars on Friday to begin another attempt to detect what may be
a flicker of life from NASA's Mars Polar Lander. It's the largest effort to
listen for a signal since Stanford University engineers announced last month
that they received an extremely faint signal that could have originated from the
$165 million probe. The lander was to have touched down Dec. 3 for a 90-day
mission to study the atmosphere and dig for water beneath the surface near Mars'
south pole. But it failed to radio its arrival.

Missing Musher Found Alive in Alaska

	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A rookie sled dog racer who disappeared in
blizzard conditions during a 200-mile race was found alive Friday afternoon, six
days after he was last seen. Rod Boyce was found near the race trail in the
Caribou Hills of the Kenai Peninsula at about 1:30 p.m., said Greg Wilkinson, an
Alaska state troopers spokesman. A group of snowmobilers found Boyce and took
him to a nearby lodge. Sgt. Jim Hibpshman, commander of the trooper post in
Homer, said Boyce refused medical treatment and instead went to the Soldotna
airport, where his wife was waiting. "He is tired, hungry, but he's talking and
says he's fine," said Hibpshman.

Pacers Defeat Kings 104-94

	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mark Jackson had a triple-double and cold-shooting
Reggie Miller hit two key jumpers as the Indiana Pacers defeated Sacramento
104-94 Friday night to tie their franchise record of 17 straight home wins. The
Pacers won despite losing All-Star forward Dale Davis to a broken nose. He had
helped limit Chris Webber to eight points on 4-of-13 shooting until he caught an
inadvertent elbow from Nick Anderson with 1:20 left in the half.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Jails Choose 'Wholesome' TV  </HEADLINE>
    By GEORGE STRAWLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- State prison inmates will have to say goodbye to
"The Sopranos" and documentaries on strippers and hello to "The Waltons" and the
Recovery Network.
</P>
<P>
	   State corrections officials said a satellite television service that
emphasizes "education and wholesome entertainment" will replace cable agreements
that allowed some Pennsylvania prisoners to subscribe to premium channels like
HBO and Showtime.
</P>
<P>
	   The new statewide service gives the 14,900 inmates at the state's 24 prisons
who subscribe to cable a one-size-fits-all package similar to a typical basic
cable setup.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody had the Playboy Channel, but some of the stuff on these premium
channels can be pretty suggestive," Corrections Secretary Martin F. Horn said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Inmates will pay $15.25 a month for 38 channels, replacing deals negotiated
between individual prisons and cable providers.
</P>
<P>
	   Prison officials had considered eliminating cable service entirely from the
prison system, but decided to make a switch in line with the department's
philosophy of "sobriety, education and work," Horn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal being worked out includes three channels of ESPN sports
programming, all the major broadcast networks and cable networks like Discovery
Channel and CNN, as well as minority-themed programming.
</P>
<P>
	   The Corrections Department also gets two institutional channels over which
it plans to beam instructional programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials plan to have eight of the institutions online by May. Other
prisons will be included in the system as current cable contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
	   Word of the change has slipped out to inmates mostly by word of mouth, said
William DiMascio, executive director of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, an
organization that assists prisoners and their families.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the loss of premium channels, "I can't get myself too exercised about
that," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Two days after returning to the United States aboard
a chartered medical plane, a Silicon Valley executive beaten into a coma in
China has died.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese officials say Steven Leung, 52, was attacked by an employee of a
karaoke bar in Beijing after he harassed a hostess. His family has disputed the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
	   Leung had returned to California on Tuesday. His sister-in-law, Charlotte
Imoto, said he died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're all devastated and hope that the people who did this would be caught
and brought to justice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bar manager and the hostess remain in custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Leung, a father of three, had been declared brain-dead at a Hong Kong
hospital, apparently the result of repeated kicks to the head, family members
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leung immigrated to the United States from Hong Kong in the 1960s and lived
in San Jose. He was president of Emvix Communications Inc., a developer of
telecommunications products, and chairman of Scenix Semiconductor Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Leung's family said he had gone to Asia to line up customers for Emvix.

<HEADLINE> 1954 Testimony OKd in Sheppard Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Testimony from the 1954 trial at which Dr. Sam Sheppard was
convicted of killing his wife was not tainted, and will be allowed at the
upcoming trial aimed at clearing his name, a judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard's son, Sam Reese Sheppard, is suing the state of Ohio, claiming his
father was wrongfully imprisoned for his mother's beating death.
</P>
<P>
	   He wanted the old testimony banned, but prosecutors said they have no choice
but to read transcripts to the jury -- the case is 46 years old, and many
original witnesses have died.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard's lawyers argued that the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the
original verdict partly because the testimony had been publicized before
witnesses appeared in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Ronald Suster ruled Friday the witnesses' testimony was not tainted.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Sheppard was found guilty of murder and spent 10 years in prison before
being acquitted at a retrial. He died in 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   The original trial was one of the most highly publicized of the 1950s and
inspired ``The Fugitive'' TV series and movie. Sheppard had insisted that a
``bushy-haired intruder'' killed his wife, Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Reese Sheppard, the couple's only child, contends that the weight of
evidence indicates his father was innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday.

<HEADLINE> New Austria Coalition Takes Power  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's new chancellor is struggling to defend his
coalition with a party identified by critics with racial bias and Nazi
sympathies in the face of growing international isolation and angry protests in
the streets at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel in a nationally televised interview Friday
defended Joerg Haider and said he ``sharply'' rejected what he called
``unjustified accusations'' from Europe against the participation of members
from the far-right Freedom Party in the new government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I must defend myself against unacceptable comparisons. There is no Hitler
on the rise,'' said Schuessel, who is head of the Austrian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that he hopes work, patience and a dogged information campaign will
bring about international acceptance for his new government, whose swearing-in
Friday triggered demonstrations across Austria and diplomatic sanctions from the
European Union and Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Criticism and worries such as those voiced by Israel -- who recalled their
ambassador even before the new government took power Friday -- must ``accepted
and borne with strength,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the ministers were taking their oaths, some 5,000 protesters massed
outside the presidential offices, pelting police with eggs and paint. The new
ministers were forced to leave through an underground tunnel to avoid the melee.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the day Friday, small groups of demonstrators roamed throughout
the streets of the city, pelting police with stones, bottles and eggs. At one
point a group of protesters briefly took over the Social Affairs Ministry --
which is to be controlled by the Freedom Party. Several police cars were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   By the evening, the demonstrations had moved in front of the Freedom Party
headquarters on Vienna's main Kaertner Street. Police used tear gas and water
guns to break up the roughly 200 diehard demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after swearing-in the new government, Austrian President Thomas
Klestil appealed to Austrians and the world to give the new government a chance
to fulfill its promises to govern under European standards of democracy and
human rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the day was over, the 14 nations sharing European Union membership
with Austria started reducing diplomatic ties, canceling contracts and official
visits and freezing high-level contacts. Norway and Switzerland also took steps
to isolate Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Walt-Hall
would leave for Washington to report and then return to Vienna to monitor the
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety for statements praising Adolf Hitler's
``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of the Waffen SS as
``decent people of good character'' -- comments for which he has since
apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider is not part of the new government and remains governor of Carinthia
province. But critics fear he will influence government policies from the wings.
</P>
<P>
	   The new chancellor also stood up for the new coalition, which was formed
after talks broke down between Schuessel's People's Party and their old
coalition partners, the Social Democrats. In the Oct. 3 elections, the People's
Party and Freedom Party won 104 of the 183 parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
	   The new government will give the far-right wing a greater voice in Austrian
policies than in any other European country. Freedom Party member Suzanne
Riess-Passer is vice chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   Many European Union governments fear that the success of Haider's party
could boost rightist parties in their own countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-U.N. Military Ties Resume  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.S. military is resuming high-level contacts
with U.N. peacekeeping officials after years of strained relations over the
debacle in Somalia and the U.S. failure to pay its U.N. debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is rebuilding a relationship which was severely strained and more or
less dried up'' in recent years, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said in an
interview on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're trying to use Pentagon know-how to help the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations in its planning effort. This is not an attempt to take
over U.N. responsibilities,'' he said. ``Since American taxpayer dollars are
involved, and at times even American lives are at risk, we want to help get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen came to the United Nations on Jan. 20
and met Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Undersecretary-General Bernard Miyet,
who heads the peacekeeping department. Cohen has invited Miyet to Washington for
the first time Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Walt Slocum, who is in charge of policy, has
also been at the United Nations twice in the past month, and the White House and
Pentagon sent senior officials to New York Thursday to discuss U.N. peacekeeping
plans in Congo and East Timor, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We welcome the improved collaboration with the Pentagon, with whom we've
had good relations in the past,'' said U.N. Communications Director Shashi
Tharoor.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1990s, as U.N. peacekeeping operations were built up following
the end of the Cold War, the Pentagon and the United Nations worked hard to
establish a close relationship, said David Malone, a former Canadian ambassador
to the United Nations who now heads the New York-based International Peace
Academy.
</P>
<P>
	   But the killing of 18 American soldiers in Somalia during a U.S.-led
peacekeeping operation in 1993 was partly responsible for the United States
backing away from the ties. Relations worsened over the U.S. failure to pay its
U.N. debt.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Defense Department spokesman P.J. Crowley also welcomed the new
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We certainly agree with U.N. efforts to stabilize important regions of the
world through its peacekeeping efforts and we are in renewed discussions with
the U.N. on ways to make these efforts most effective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations is currently involved in 17 peacekeeping operations
around the world, the newest in East Timor and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
	   American military observers and civilian police are currently participating
in a number of U.N. peacekeeping operations, including Bosnia, East Timor,
Georgia, Kosovo and Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council has scheduled a vote Monday to nearly double the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone from 6,000 to 11,100. The council is also
expected to consider, possibly later next week, a U.S.-drafted resolution to
expand the current U.N. mission in Congo from 79 military liaison officers to
5,537 military personnel, including at least 500 military observers.
</P>
<P>
	   Diplomats have said U.S. approval and financing for the expanded Sierra
Leone and Congo operations would be a clear sign of Washington's concrete
commitment to peacekeeping in Africa and would back promises Holbrooke made
during the U.S. focus on Africa in the Security Council in January.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. sources said the United States is likely to provide some military
observers in East Timor in addition to civilian police as well as engineers and
medical personnel to help with humanitarian relief.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. peacekeeping department maintains high-level contacts with many
countries, including Britain and France which last year became the first
permanent members of the Security Council to put frontline troops on standby for
rapid deployment around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   While high-level U.S. military contacts are just resuming, Tharoor noted
that the chief planner for U.N. military missions is currently an American
colonel, Bob Phillips.
</P>
<P>
	   Timothy Wirth, president of the United Nations Foundation and a former U.S.
undersecretary of state for global affairs, said November's vote in Congress to
pay a significant part of the U.S. arrears and Holbrooke's advocacy of improved
U.S.-U.N. relations paved the way for the high-level military contacts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our ulterior motive is our exterior motive,'' Holbrooke said. ``It's to
help the U.N. through very difficult planning because the U.S. Pentagon's
planning capability is quite ahead of the U.N., and they are understaffed.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mediator Recalled From Mideast  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American mediator Dennis B. Ross is leaving the Middle
East this weekend without making much headway in peacemaking between Israel and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a difficult process,'' State Department deputy spokesman James B.
Foley said late Friday. ``We don't particularly see a crisis, but it is hard
going.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ross went to the region this week to try to spur the two sides toward the
outline of a settlement. Among the diplomatic options was to set up a three-way
summit in Washington with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   But Foley said ``things did not go swimmingly well this week'' and the next
step the administration might take was not clear.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Friday described the negotiations as
``faltering'' and said he had asked for help from the United States, Europe and
the Arab world. He commented after meeting with Ross for three hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat's summit with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Thursday ended in
sharp disagreement over West Bank territory Israel is to hand over next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Deadlocked over the partial troop pullback, the leaders apparently spent
little time on the more explosive issues of a final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel and the Palestinians face a Feb. 13 deadline for a framework accord
on such hot issues as the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian aspirations for a
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Ross would meet with Israeli and
Palestinian officials today for a joint ``hearing'' in which both sides would
present their positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, an architect of past
Israel-Palestinian accords, said the gaps were too wide to allow for American
mediation at this time.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has played down the dispute, but the Palestinians used
uncharacteristically sharp language to express their anger.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Barak completely backed off yesterday from all agreements, dates and
stages of the withdrawals, using unfounded pretexts,'' Arafat said in a
statement issued after the Palestinian Cabinet's weekly meeting. ``The
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are going through a major, unprecedented
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said outside help was needed immediately ``to salvage the
peace process from imminent collapse and the return of anarchy to the Middle
East.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has rejected intensive international mediation, saying it was up to
the two sides to resolve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak adviser Danny Yatom denied on Israel Radio that talks were in crisis,
but warned that the withdrawal dispute should not prevent negotiators from
bridging the gaps in a final treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians rejected the remote West Bank territory Israel planned to
hand over in the coming days, as part of interim agreements, holding out for
villages bordering Jerusalem. The Israelis said the agreement allows them to
make that decision themselves, but the Palestinians insisted they must be
consulted.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, separate peace negotiations between Israel and Syria remain
sidetracked as well.

minute,'' said the 17-year-old Trimble, a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses who
likes the option of practicing his faith privately. ``Since it's morning time,
some people try to sleep. The main thing is, it's a break.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the nearly 40 years since the Supreme Court banned organized school
prayer, more states have delighted religious conservatives and angered civil
libertarians by enacting moment-of-silence laws that either encourage or require
public schools to observe a minute of silence for meditation, prayer or
reflection at the start of every school day.
</P>
<P>
	   Civil liberties groups condemn the movement as a backdoor attempt to flout
the 1962 and 1963 Supreme Court rulings against organized prayer in schools,
which said it violates the constitutional dividing line between church and
state. Legal challenges have been mounted in several states.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia's moment-of-silence law was the first in the nation to survive a
court challenge. Last week, Virginia moved a step closer to requiring the silent
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of
Church and State, expects the Virginia law as it appears to be heading to face
legal challenges. ``There is a pretty strong record that the effort is to bring
back prayer into Virginia schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teachers and students approach the silent moment in different ways. Not all
teachers block off the time, and when they do the children often fill the brief
time as they wish: praying, passing notes, studying, just keeping quiet or even
napping.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But the teachers are real good about letting them know that you're not
supposed to be talking at that time,'' said Trimble, of Lithonia, Ga.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservatives say the practice encourages prayer and reflection and also
builds character and combats violence in schools. In Virginia, Republican Gov.
Jim Gilmore supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn said state legislators used last April's school shootings in Littleton,
Colo., to push moments of silence, posting of the Ten Commandments, creationism
and other religious policies into public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If these legislators can't find any better solution than moments of
silence, they ought to find a new line of work,'' he said. ``This is not a very
serious endeavor for solving real problems. You just have taxpayers spending
money to defend the indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 20 states and the territory of Guam have a moment of silence law
on their books, according to a search of a legal database. The states include
Arizona, Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana, Louisiana,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York,
Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Mississippi and Oklahoma are among states considering similar laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia law's, which survived review by a federal appeals court in 1997,
says students should open the day with 60 seconds of ``silent reflection on the
anticipated activities of the day.'' Laws in North Dakota and New Jersey were
struck down because they were seen as encouraging students to pray.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin McDowell, general counsel for Indiana's Education Department, advises
school boards there not to follow the 1975 state law because it could fall into
that category. ``Anytime you have law on the books that falls into
constitutional disfavor, someone may rely on it to their detriment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are misunderstandings about what the Supreme Court has said on
that,'' Matthew D. Staver of the Orlando, Fla.- based Liberty Counsel, a legal
organization helping defend the silent moment in Louisiana. ``To the contrary, a
moment of silence would be considered constitutional because during that time
you have, you can pray or you can look at your tennis shoes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama, which lost a Supreme Court challenge, enacted its current
moment-of-silence law in 1998. Lawmakers said they hoped the law, which requires
up to a minute of silent reflection, would help ease tensions over school
prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers say they want a mandatory time period because teachers and school
officials charged with cramming many lessons into a short day would neglect to
offer the time voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just not on their radar screen,'' said Andrew Linebaugh, a spokesman
for the Massachusetts Teachers Association. ``The principal hasn't directed them
to do this, so some classes do the Pledge of Allegiance and some may do a moment
of silence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Parents like Nancy Mitchell of Montgomery, Ala., want their children to have
and use a moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are very comfortable with it; we discuss it at home and we pray at
home,'' said Mitchell, a mother of three. ``Of course I would like to have God
brought back into our classrooms anyway.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It floors me to attend a meeting with the legislature and legislators get
to pray, yet they don't allow our students to pray (openly),'' she said.

	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Antawn Jamison scored 19 points, including six in
the final 1:53, as Golden State beat Denver 103-101 on Friday night for the
Warriors' season-high fourth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Warriors withstood a 30-point game by Denver's Antonio McDyess and held
the Nuggets scoreless in the last 2:55, making up a six-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Caffey added 17 points, Vonteego Cummings had 16 and Donyell Marshall
and Mookie Blaylock each had 14 for the Warriors, winners of six of eight since
snapping a 12-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Marshall, who had 12 rebounds, also produced the game's biggest defensive
play when he blocked Raef LaFrentz's layup attempt with 33 seconds remaining.
George McCloud missed a 3-point try in the final seconds and Bryant Stith's
rebound and putback attempt rimmed out as time expired, leaving the Nuggets with
their eighth straight loss on the road and ninth straight defeat in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
	   LaFrentz and Nick Van Exel added 12 points apiece for Denver, which missed a

	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton scored 23 points and won his duel with Jason

</P>

fouled by Oliver Miller to put Sonics on top 82-76 with 4:30 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton also had a career-high 13 rebounds and seven assists in 45 minutes in
his matchup against Kidd, who played 42 minutes and had 12 rebounds and six
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Brent Barry and Ruben Patterson each scored 17 points for the Sonics, while
Penny Hardaway had 17 for Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns didn't play Clifford Robinson in the second half after he was
ineffective in the first half. Robinson sprained his right foot in practice
Thursday in Phoenix before the team flew to Seattle. X-rays before the game
showed no broken bones.
</P>
<P>
	   After McCoy's three-point play, Hardaway scored after getting an offensive
rebound to cut Seattle's lead to 82-78, but Patterson's 5-foot banker put the
Sonics in front 84-78 with 3:41 to go.

	   The Sonics took a 17-point lead in the first 6:38, moving to a 23-6 lead on

</P>
<P>
	   Barry hit two 3-pointers in the final 5:49 of the second quarter as the
Sonics took a 54-45 lead at halftime. Notes: The Sonics bounced back after
losing 88-81 to the Chicago Bulls, the team with the worst record in the NBA,
Wednesday night at home. The Sonics had dropped two straight at the Key Arena.
... The Sonics beat the Suns for the second straight time after losing six in a

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soldier Fights Discharge  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. soldier who received a bad-conduct discharge after
refusing to serve on a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia is
appealing his case, claiming President Clinton's order to deploy was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Henry L. Hamilton, who represents former Army medic Michael New,
argued Friday before five judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed
Forces that Clinton's 1995 order was illegal because he did not have
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Superiors may not compel subordinates to obey illegal orders,'' said
Hamilton, a retired Army judge advocate general. ``The government must prove
lawfulness. ... If it's not a legal order, there's no duty to obey it.''
</P>
<P>
	   At New's court-martial four years ago, a jury took only 20 minutes to
convict him of disobeying an order. He was sentenced to be given a bad-conduct
discharge, but the discharge is being held in abeyance during his appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Kelly Haywood, representing the government, argued that the legitimacy
of Clinton's order was never for the seven-member military jury to decide, and
New had a duty to obey the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mission lives and dies by the soldier following an order,'' Haywood
said.
</P>
<P>
	   New was among a few hundred mainly support troops that Clinton sent to
Macedonia, one of six republics of former Yugoslavia, to guard against the
spread of unrest from other areas torn by ethnic turmoil because of Yugoslavia's
dismemberment. They served in a peacekeeping force dispatched by the United
Nations, and New refused to wear U.N. insignia on his U.S. Army uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court judges must decide whether Army Judge Lt. Col. Gary
Jewell, who oversaw court-martial proceedings against New in January 1996, erred
by essentially telling the jury that Clinton's order was constitutional. If so,
the case would be sent back down for new court-martial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   The judges' decision is expected within two to three months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's at stake here is whether or not it's illegal for a soldier to wear
the uniform of foreign nations, of foreign commanders,'' New said later, outside
the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   While stationed in Germany in 1995, the native of Conroe, Texas, refused to
remove his American military uniform patch in favor of the insignia and blue
beret of the United Nations, saying he would not serve a foreign power. Hamilton
described his client as a patriot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Clinton lied to Congress to effect the deployment in
Macedonia,'' Hamilton said outside the courthouse. ``It all stemmed from his
duplicity in failing to inform Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   New joined the Army in 1993. He served with U.S. units in Kuwait since the
1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
	   While awaiting the outcome of his case, New is on involuntary leave. The
26-year-old medical specialist has been working for a Texas manufacturing firm
and studying computers at a local college.
</P>
<P>
	   He was arrested last July on drug charges for allegedly phoning in a phony
prescription to a pharmacy for a drug commonly prescribed for people suffering
anxiety. If convicted on that charge, he could be sentenced to as much as 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   He was convicted in January 1998 of forging prescriptions and was fined $500
and sentenced to seven years probation.
</P>
<P>
	   In March, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear New's military case. The
justices said he must exhaust all avenues of military appeals before seeking
relief from federal civilian courts.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mulls Execution Moratorium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is concerned about the issues raised by
Illinois' decision to halt executions and he will consider putting federal
executions on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension request came in a letter from Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and
is being reviewed by White House counsel, said Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart.
However, he added, there's no guarantee Clinton will act soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president was certainly concerned by the issues raised by the governor
of Illinois,'' Lockhart said Friday. ``If there are legitimate concerns that are
brought to us, we will look at the concerns. But I can't predict anything beyond
that until we've had a chance to study the issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold based his request on Gov. George Ryan's halt of executions in
Illinois until authorities determine whether the death penalty is administered
fairly. Since 1976, Illinois has executed 12 prisoners. But 13 death row inmates
have been exonerated since 1987 through appeals, DNA evidence or, in a few
cases, persistent investigation by college journalism students.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter dated Wednesday, Feingold asked that Clinton suspend federal
executions and have Attorney General Janet Reno thoroughly review how the
federal death penalty has been used.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before the federal government executes anyone, the Justice Department
should be absolutely certain that innocents have not been condemned to death,''
Feingold wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Feingold, sponsor of a bill to abolish the federal death
penalty, federal courts have sentenced 21 people to die, three-quarters of whom
are minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the condemned is Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, 85 people have been freed from death row since 1973, according
to the Death Penalty Information Center.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 113, Jazz 67  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN PETERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal and the Los Angeles Lakers limited Utah
to only 21 points in the first half and sent the Jazz to their sixth straight
loss, 113-67 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz just barely managed to avoid their most lopsided defeat ever -- a
158-102 loss to Milwaukee on March 14, 1979, when they still played in New
Orleans. The Lakers' biggest lead was 51 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the Jazz lost by more than 40 points was March 5, 1986, in a
130-84 defeat against the Lakers. Utah had not lost six in a row since March
1983.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal finished with 25 points. The Lakers led 33-14 after the first quarter
and made it 56-21 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   The 21 points marked the second-lowest half ever for the Jazz, and their
lowest since they moved to Utah. They scored 20 in the first half in 1975
against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The NBA record low for a half is 19, set by the Los Angeles Clippers in a
loss to the Lakers earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah's starters got a quick hook. Karl Malone played just 18 minutes and
scored 14 points, and John Stockton was on the floor for just 14 minutes and two
points.
</P>
<P>
	   In a match of two of the NBA's better teams -- but teams that have been
struggling recently -- the Lakers ended a two-game losing slide and won for just
the fourth time in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Rice added 20 points for the Lakers, and A.C. Green had 10 rebounds.
Kobe Bryant had eight of his 13 points in the first five minutes. Los Angeles'
starters played about half the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers, beaten 105-101 in double overtime at Utah on Jan. 24, took
charge immediately this time, as the Jazz made just one of its first 14 shots
and fell behind 20-4 in the first seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant and O'Neal started the Lakers rolling early, with Bryant scoring
eight points and O'Neal adding four points and blocking two shots as Los Angeles
took a 15-4 lead in the first five minutes. Notes: Los Angeles was coming off
its worst loss of the season, a 105-81 defeat at San Antonio. ... Utah's Jeff
Hornacek will be a busy man at All-Star Saturday on Feb. 12 in Oakland,
competing in both the 3-point shootout, in which he's the defending champion,
and the 2ball competition, a test of all-around basketball skills. ... Utah has
lost eight of its last 13 games.

<HEADLINE> Report: Deutch Still Has Clearance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former CIA Director John Deutch was stripped of his top
security clearance but he still works on classified Pentagon contracts, The
Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, lost
his CIA clearance last summer after it was discovered he kept classified
documents on his home computer, which was connected to the Internet and not
protected by any security devices.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Department also suspended his clearance from the Defense
Intelligence Agency, the nation's main military intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post, however, said Deutch never lost his industrial security clearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch's clearance permits him to serve as a paid consultant on defense
contracts with MIT, SAIC Corp. and Raytheon Corp., the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   An unidentified Pentagon official quoted by the Post said Friday that the
Defense Department's industrial clearance was based on a different standard than
CIA and DIA clearances and it involved specific defense programs and not the
broad information covered by an intelligence clearance.
</P>
<P>
	   That type of clearance, the official said, is harder to revoke because it
may cause the person to lose a job or income.

<HEADLINE> Attorney Favors Opening Skakel Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A lawyer for the 39-year-old nephew of Robert F.
Kennedy charged in a 1975 murder has supported a motion to open his client's
juvenile court arraignment to the public.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm absolutely not opposed to it,'' said Michael Sherman, an attorney for
Michael Skakel. ``There's been enough of the `Kennedy kin cover-up' garbage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's case is in juvenile court because he was 15 in October 1975, when
he is alleged to have killed Martha Moxley, his 15-year-old neighbor. The girl
was beaten to death with a golf club.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel, a nephew of Ethel and the late U.S. senator, is scheduled to be
arraigned Tuesday. The hearing on whether to open the arraignment is scheduled
for Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Several newspapers have filed a motion to open the hearing to the public.
Normally, juvenile proceedings are held in closed courtrooms to protect children
from negative publicity that might affect their rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Those concerns don't apply in Skakel's case, according to the motion filed
Thursday by The Advocate of Stamford, Greenwich Time, The Hartford Courant,
Newsday and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Mark Kravitz said he believes Sherman's support of the motion
guarantees its success.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only reason for secrecy in juvenile proceedings is to protect the
child,'' Kravitz said. ``We have someone who is not a child, and someone who is
agreeing to have it open.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Raises Another $5 Million  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In addition to shattering campaign fund-raising records,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's money team raised $5.2 million more for Republican
organizations in 20 key states during the last two months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The funds, some in chunks as large as $25,000, can be used for issue
advertising, get-out-the-vote campaigns and other efforts designed to support
not only the state parties but also Bush's campaign should he win the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The money will be allocated among Arizona, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Virginia and Washington state. The distribution will be based on a
ratio that favors states with the most voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Lindner and members of his family gave $150,000. Clinton administration
officials have been fighting for years against European Union rules they say
unfairly discriminate against bananas grown in Latin America by Lindner's
Chiquita Brands International and Dole Food Co. In April, the World Trade
Organization supported the U.S. position and authorized $191 million in tariffs
on European goods in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
	   Other big donors include New York Jets owner Robert Wood Johnson IV, who
gave $25,000; Thomas Hicks, owner of the Texas Rangers, Dallas Stars and an
investment firm that owns radio and television stations, $20,000; and Kenneth
Lay, chief executive officer of Enron, the energy company that has been the most
generous giver to Bush throughout his political career, $15,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee also received $2,500 from the political action committee
controlled by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee; and $10,000 from President Bush's former chief of staff,
Samuel Skinner.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Bush already became the first presidential candidate to raise more than
$70 million -- $68.7 million for his campaign committee and $1.3 million for a
separate account to pay his legal and accounting costs for the general election.
He spent $37.3 million through Dec. 31; most other candidates, who are receiving
taxpayer funds to help finance their campaigns are limited to spending around
$40 million through next August.
</P>
<P>
	   The only venue where those candidates have outraised Bush is online. Bush is
dead last when it comes to donations over the Internet. GOP rival John McCain
and Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley have gathered significantly more money on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, McCain raised twice as much money through his Web site in the first
day after winning the New Hampshire primary than Bush has raised online for his
entire campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Internet is the great equalizer,'' McCain campaign spokeswoman Nancy
Ives said. ``It's turned politics on its head.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has raised more than $2.5 million online since the start of the
campaign, with about half coming since his New Hampshire victory Tuesday. For
the Democrats, former Sen. Bradley has raised more than $1.6 million and Vice
President Gore around $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, on the other hand, has raised just $340,000 online. Half of that has
come this year; the Texas governor sent out two fund-raising e-mails since Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
	   For McCain, the Internet has allowed him to turn his victory in New
Hampshire into instant cash without having to spend any scarce dollars on direct
mail or other fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the past, candidates had to send letters out, either in advance of the
primary hoping they would do well or engaging in manic fund raising right after
the primary,'' said Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College
in Waterville, Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even then, you didn't have the money until seven to 10 days after the
primary. By the time the checks start coming in, and they clear the bank, it
usually wasn't until the next week that you had any money.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Fund Raising Glance  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   In addition to raising a record $68 million through Dec. 31, top
fund-raisers for Texas Gov. George W. Bush brought in another $5.2 million to
help finance Republican Party operations in 20 states that are critical to his
general election strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Several big givers are counted among Bush's Pioneers, fund-raisers who have
brought in at least $100,000 for his presidential campaign. Others have
interests before the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   The list includes:
</P>
<P>
	   John Chambers, president, Cisco Systems, $5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis Eisenberg, co-founder, Republican Leadership Council, a moderate GOP
group that ran ads attacking Bush opponent Steve Forbes, $7,000.
</P>
<P>
	   C. Boyden Gray, former counsel to President Bush and partner in the
law-lobbying firm of Wilmer, Cutler &AMP; Pickering, whose clients include the
American Bankers Association, McDonald's and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Hall, chairman, Hallmark Cards, $20,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Hicks, owner, Texas Rangers and Dallas Stars, and owner of several
radio and television stations through the investment firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP;
Furst, $20,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Wayne Huizenga, owner, Miami Dolphins, $20,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Wood Johnson IV, owner, New York Jets, $25,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Lay, chief executive officer, Enron Corp., $15,000. Enron employees
and their families have been Bush's top patron throughout his political career,
according to the Center for Public Integrity. Enron was one of 26 companies
grandfathered under a 1971 law from having to comply with Texas' clean air
rules, though only one of the company's plants was involved. Bush signed
legislation in 1999 to reduce emissions from grandfathered plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Schwab, head of the investment firm that bears his name, $19,500.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Skinner, former chief of staff for President Bush, $10,000.

<HEADLINE> Bush Hits Back at McCain in New Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking to stem John McCain's momentum in the battle for
the Republican presidential nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush is running a
new TV ad that accuses the Arizona senator of distorting Bush's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain's ad about Governor Bush isn't true and McCain knows it,''
says the new ad, which began airing Friday in South Carolina. ``On taxes, McCain
echoes Washington Democrats when we need a conservative leader to challenge
them.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new spot -- Bush's first to name the McCain by name -- reflects a more
aggressive new strategy for the governor, who was stunned by his lopsided loss
in New Hampshire's primary Tuesday. Bush also went after McCain on the campaign
trail Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This ad shows Governor Bush intends to fight back,'' said Bush spokesman
Ari Fleischer. ``We know we have a fight on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Next week, after responding to McCain's criticisms, the Bush team will take
the offense in the air wars, with possible topics including taxes, education and
campaign finance reform, said a Bush adviser, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the issue in the ad war is how much each man sets aside to bolster a
Social Security system that might otherwise run out of money as the baby boomers
begin to retire.
</P>
<P>
	   In a TV ad that ran in New Hampshire and now is appearing in South Carolina,
McCain implies that Bush would spend ``every last dime'' of the budget surplus
on tax cuts, mostly for the rich.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute stems from the fact that there are actually two surpluses in
Washington. There's the ``Social Security surplus,'' made up of the extra money
coming into the trust fund from Social Security taxes, and the extra money
coming into the general Treasury from other federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men would leave the Social Security surplus untouched, but Bush would
spend most of the rest on tax cuts, whereas McCain would save some of it to
bolster the retirement program.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush complained about the McCain ad, called ``Every Dime,'' when it aired in
New Hampshire but opted against responding in his campaign's paid advertising.
After losing in New Hampshire by 18 percentage points, Bush is changing
strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was 'above the fray' in New Hampshire and look what happened,''
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said it was disappointing to see Bush
turn on a fellow Republican. ``Governor Bush, seeing his inevitability quickly
fade, is resorting to typical desperate tactics,'' he said. Asked earlier about
the possibility of an ad like this, media adviser Greg Stevens said they are
ready for the fight: ``Bring 'em on.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men also use their rivals' supporters against each other.
</P>
<P>
	   In his new ad, Bush refers to former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber, who said he
would support Bush's plan if he were in Congress. The ad doesn't mention that
Weber actually prefers McCain's approach, and Weber issued a statement through
Opinsky on Friday saying the ad should be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's camp points to Bush backer Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who said more
money is needed to shore up Social Security than Bush proposes. But Gregg also
taped an ad for Bush saying the money will just get spent if it left in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   As for next week's Bush ads, campaign polling shows South Carolina voters
respond when McCain's tax plan is termed more liberal than President Clinton's.
On education, the Bush team believes McCain is vulnerable because he has few
school policies and is opposed to Bush's plan for vouchers.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign is divided over how to handle campaign finance overhaul,
McCain's signature issue. Some say Bush's best argument is that changing
campaign spending laws would turn politics over to the media and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
	   Some narrowly targeted advertising also may question McCain's commitment to
abortion rights, an adviser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's team planned to discuss their options throughout the weekend.

<HEADLINE> US Biological Attack Said Inevitable  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Terrorists will likely attack the United States with the
small pox or anthrax viruses within the next five to 10 years, says an expert
who warns the country is unprepared.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are a long way away from being even modestly prepared,'' D.A.
Henderson, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies,
said Friday at a conference on bioterrorism. ``But we're doing a lot more now
than we did 12 months, or even 6 months ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two-day conference brings together more than 300 physicians, scientists,
public officials and law enforcement agents to discuss possible ways to respond
in the event of an attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a problem that's going to have to be dealt with at the local
level,'' said Henderson, who was a leader in the effort to eradicate smallpox
and now is mobilizing health workers against bioterrorism. ``Doctors and nurses
in emergency rooms will be the first ones to see signs of an epidemic. They need
to know how to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bioterrorism is the release of deadly bacteria, viruses or products of those
agents. Those that pose the greatest threat are smallpox, anthrax and plague
because they have the potential to spread quickly and cause large numbers of
deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   Such an attack is expected in this country within the decade, Henderson
said, noting that some governments have stockpiles of the agents. Fringe groups,
meanwhile, have already threatened attacks. In 1995, a Japanese doomsday cult
tried and failed to release botulism toxin and anthrax in Tokoyo, Henderson
said. They later released the nerve gas sarin in a subway, killing 12 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Policy-makers know how to respond to chemical spills and nuclear plant
leaks, but those hazardous material plans won't work for a bioterrorist attack,
Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With a virus, signs aren't apparent for days or weeks,'' Henderson said.
``The flu-like symptoms may get misdiagnosed until the disease reaches an
epidemic level.''
</P>
<P>
	   With shortages of hospital space, vaccines and antibiotics, ``there would be
chaos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Margaret Hamburg, who helps direct a bioterrorism initiative of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, urged people not to panic, saying the
federal government has allocated millions of dollars to help states prepared for
bioterrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People shouldn't go to bed at night worrying about it,'' Hamburg said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States hasn't vaccinated against smallpox since the 1970s, and
there's only enough vaccine left for 7.5 million people and no factories to make
more, Henderson said. The development of an anthrax vaccine available to the
public is another 5 years away, he said.

<HEADLINE> Warriors 103, Nuggets 101  </HEADLINE>
    By DENNIS GEORGATOS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Antawn Jamison scored 19 points, including six in
the final 1:53, as Golden State beat Denver 103-101 on Friday night for the
Warriors' season-high fourth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Warriors withstood a 30-point game by Denver's Antonio McDyess and held
the Nuggets scoreless in the last 2:55, making up a six-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Caffey added 17 points, Vonteego Cummings had 16 and Donyell Marshall
and Mookie Blaylock each had 14 for the Warriors, winners of six of eight since
snapping a 12-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Marshall, who had 12 rebounds, also produced the game's biggest defensive
play when he blocked Raef LaFrentz's layup attempt with 33 seconds remaining.
George McCloud missed a 3-point try in the final seconds and Bryant Stith's
rebound and putback attempt rimmed out as time expired, leaving the Nuggets with
their eighth straight loss on the road and ninth straight defeat in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
	   LaFrentz and Nick Van Exel added 12 points apiece for Denver, which missed a
chance to win away from home for the first time since Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Blaylock pulled up for a 15-foot jumper to tie it at 94 with 4:22 remaining,
but McDyess answered with a baseline jumper, triggering a 7-1 burst that put
Denver up 101-95 with 2:55 remaining. The sequence also included McDyess
grabbing an offensive rebound and passing to LaFrentz for a dunk, and Van Exel
hitting a 3-pointer and then skipping a couple steps in celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was premature.
</P>
<P>
	   Caffey drove in for a layup and Jamison tipped in his own miss and hit a
short baseline floater to even it at 101 with 1:14 left.
</P>
<P>
	   After Van Exel missed an 18-foot jumper, Jamison finished a fastbreak with
the go-ahead layup.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing by three at the break, Golden State pulled into a 64-64 tie on a
3-pointer by Starks and held a one-point advantage heading into the final
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State opened a nine-point lead on Cummings' 18-foot jumper midway
through the second but the Nuggets came right back, getting a 3-pointer from Van
Exel to start a 10-3 spurt leading to a 41-all tie.
</P>
<P>
	   A layup by McDyess, who had 20 of his points in the first half, and Van
Exel's long jumper in the final seconds of the second put the Nuggets up 50-47
at halftime.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of Bush's Latest Commercial  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   An analysis of George W. Bush's latest television commercial, which responds
to an earlier ad by John McCain:
</P>
<P>
	   TITLE: ``Solid Values.''
</P>
<P>
	   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   PRODUCER: Maverick Media.
</P>
<P>
	   AIRING: South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   SCRIPT: (Announcer:) ``John McCain's ad about Governor Bush isn't true and
McCain knows it. McCain's economic advisor says he'd support Bush's plan -- $2
trillion to protect Social Security, pay down debt and a real tax cut. McCain's
plan? A tax cut smaller than Clinton's, and not a penny in tax cuts for 30
million Americans. On taxes, McCain echoes Washington Democrats when we need a
conservative leader to challenge them. Governor Bush. Proven. Tested. And ready
to lead America.''
</P>
<P>
	   KEY IMAGES: Words on screen echoing the announcer's script. Ends with images
of Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ANALYSIS: In the sharpest ad of his campaign, Bush takes on a McCain spot
now airing in South Carolina. Bush opted against a similar response when McCain
aired this ad in New Hampshire, but that was before the governor was walloped in
the primary. Newly aggressive, Bush's team is going on the attack, even though
it means the campaign may appear defensive.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Bush have been battling for weeks over how large a tax cut the
nation can afford, with Bush proposing a $483 billion, five-year tax cut plan --
about double McCain. The Arizona senator says more money is needed to pay down
the debt and secure Social Security and Bush argues that any money left in
Washington will be spent on federal programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush ad objects to a line in the McCain ad where McCain says: ``There's
one difference between me and the others. I won't take every last dime of the
surplus and spend it on tax cuts...'' Bush protests that his plan saves $2
trillion over 10 years for the retirement program.
</P>
<P>
	   Who's right? Arguably, both. The surplus is actually made up of two streams
of cash. There's the extra money pouring into the Social Security trust fund and
then there's extra money coming into the general treasury from other federal
taxes and fees. Both men leave the Social Security surplus untouched, but Bush
spends most of the rest on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's ad is right when he says McCain's tax plan is closer to the smaller
tax cuts that Democrats prefer. And he's right that the McCain plan would not
mean a tax cut for everyone. But he's misleading when he says ``McCain's
economic adviser'' said he'd support Bush's plan. He's referring to former Rep.
Vin Weber of Minnesota -- a McCain supporter but hardly the man who shapes
economic policy for the campaign. And the ad takes Weber's quote out of context;
Weber said he would support the Bush plan if it were presented to him as a
member of Congress, but he prefers McCain's approach.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, Bush charges that McCain's tax cut is smaller than Clinton's, and
it is if you account for the $150 billion in tax loopholes that McCain would
close. Closing a loophole amounts to raising taxes somewhere, but McCain rightly
notes that generally this affects special interests rather than regular
Americans.

<HEADLINE> Packers, Favre Reach Agreement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Green Bay star Brett Favre reached an agreement on a
contract designed to give the Packers' leeway under the NFL salary cap, the
quarterback's agent said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've agreed in principle," James "Bus" Cook told the Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel. "Brett probably will sign it over the weekend or Monday or Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not about new money. It's just a restructuring of his current deal to
enable the team to have some cap room to sign some other players."
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations do not extend the seven-year, $47.25 million contract that
Favre signed in July 1997, Cook said. It involves adjustments of the $5.35
million base salary this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cook and Packers finance director Andrew Brandt declined to say how much
room becomes available under the cap.
</P>
<P>
	   "Brett Favre has always been a team player on the field," Brandt said. "He
has proven himself to be the same off the field with this renegotiation."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm delighted," general manager Ron Wolf said. "We would have had to do
something else, like drop some folks, I guess."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf would not say how much easier it might be for Green Bay to hire
expensive talent.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're asking me, 'Will that make us a big-time player in free agency?'
the answer to that is absolutely not," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cook refused to say if the deal affects base salary in 2001 ($5.3 million)
or subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't say we reduced anything," he said. "We just rearranged things a
little bit."

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Karens Flee Myanmar  </HEADLINE>
   By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- More than 250 Karen refugees have fled fighting in
Myanmar between the rebel group God's Army and government forces and entered
Thailand in recent days, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest group, mostly women and children, had arrived overnight Thursday,
said Phayakkhaphan Phothikaew, chief of Suan Phung district in western Thailand
across the border from the fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   They were given shelter in a temporary camp at Baw Wi, and joined 1,078
refugees already there, he said. The camp is 2 miles from the border, and has
been off-limits to journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of them are civilians affected by the fighting,'' said Phayakkhaphan,
adding that he had no word about the estimated 100 to 200 God's Army fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   Government troops overran the God's Army jungle base at Ka Mar Pa Law on
Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighters, led by 12-year-old twin boys believed to have magical powers
of victory, are thought to have split into smaller bands. They are believed to
be skirmishing with larger government forces while trying to link up with the
4th Brigade of the Karen National Union.
</P>
<P>
	   But the mainstream Karen group has insisted it will not take in God's Army
fighters unless the group yields to KNU discipline.
</P>
<P>
	   The KNU has disavowed the 10 gunmen from God's Army and the radical Vigorous
Burmese Student Warriors who seized a provincial Thai hospital Jan. 24, taking
hundreds of hostages. The gunmen were killed in a Thai commando raid.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai officials have said they will not grant refuge to the God's Army
fighters unless they lay down their weapons at the border. They also insist they
will arrest the twins, Johnny and Luther Htoo, and a student rebel leader known
as Johnny.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnny's group -- the Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors -- took hostages
last October at Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok, then fled to take refuge with
God's Army at Ka Mar Pa Law.
</P>
<P>
	   The actions have outraged Thailand and strained relations between Thais and
refugees. At least 100,000 refugees, mostly ethnic Karens, are taking shelter in
camps along the border.
</P>
<P>
	   The representative in Thailand of the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees
attempted Friday to soothe some of the tensions by visiting the Baw Wi camp and
donating financial support to four local schools in Suan Phung district.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karens, many of them fundamentalist Christians in a predominantly
Buddhist country, have been fighting Myanmar's government for more autonomy for
half a century.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the students are survivors of the bloody crackdown against a 1988
uprising against military rule. The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as
Burma, since 1962.

<HEADLINE> 1921 Race Riot Panel Urges Redress  </HEADLINE>
   By RENEE RUBLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- When the state Legislature appointed a commission to
study one of the nation's deadliest, but little-known race riot, Veneice Dunn
Sims didn't expect much more than a lot of rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
	   So news that the committee recommended reparations to survivors of the 1921
Tulsa race riot came as a very welcomed surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, all right!'' the 94-year-old riot survivor said Friday. ``I didn't
think anything was going to happen! How long has it been? ... What, 79 years!''
</P>
<P>
	   After two years of meetings, the Tulsa Race Riot Commission recommended
Friday that direct payments be made to survivors and descendants of riot
victims.
</P>
<P>
	   The 11-member panel also called for a memorial to the dead, scholarships and
a tax checkoff program to fund economic development in the Greenwood district,
where the 1921 rampage by a white Tulsa mob killed as many as 300 people, most
of them black.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I asked myself, 'What would I want if my life was basically destroyed,'''
commission member Vivian Clark said in favor of payments to survivors. ``The
country has a problem as a whole in giving compensations to African Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The commission recommended that the direct payments be a priority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This way we will be helping people first, which is what we are supposed to
be doing,'' said commission member Jim Lloyd, who is white.
</P>
<P>
	   About a half-dozen of the 80 known riot survivors watched as the commission
heard personal accounts, newspaper stories and a subcommittee recommendation
before approving the reparations.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no specifics on who would get the scholarships. It also wasn't
decided how much the reparations package should cost and who should make the
payments.
</P>
<P>
	   But the commission passed a resolution that said the racial hatred then was
tolerated through laws of local, state and federal governments and said
restitution would be good public policy and help repair the emotional and
physical scars of the riot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a government issue. Let the government solve it,'' said commission
member Eddie Faye Gates, who is black.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission's recommendations will be presented to the Legislature on
Monday, which was the deadline for a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
	   Historical findings also will be handed over with hope that the Legislature
will continue the commission indefinitely, Chairman Bob Blackburn said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've still got a lot of unanswered questions -- a lot to pursue,'' said
Blackburn, who is white.
</P>
<P>
	   The riot broke out May 31, 1921, when a white lynch mob clashed with blacks
who were protecting a black man accused of assaulting a white elevator operator.
</P>
<P>
	   Over two days, white mobs set fire to homes, businesses and churches in
Greenwood, a thriving black business district known at the time as the Black
Wall Street of America. When the smoke cleared, the area lay in ruins.
</P>
<P>
	   Many blacks left and never returned. The National Guard rounded up thousands
of others and held them at the fairgrounds, convention hall and a baseball
stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission, which included a survivor, historians, lawmakers and
community members, held meetings for two years and agreed that it may be
impossible to get a complete, accurate account of what happened.
</P>
<P>
	   There is uncertainty over such things as how many died, whether a Tulsa
cemetery holds mass graves, and what role the National Guard played.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, some in the crowd shouted and others let out a low ``no, no, no''
when white Democratic state Rep. Abe Deutschendorf recalled a riot survivor's
account that the National Guard saved his life.
</P>
<P>
	   For decades, the city ignored the riot. It was only in 1996 that it
recognized its anniversary. The next year, the Legislature created the
commission when Tulsa lawmakers raised the issue of restitution.
</P>
<P>
	   For Genevieve Elizabeth Tillman Jackson, an 84-year-old black woman who
survived the riot, the panel's recommendation was a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's great,'' she said. ``I think the survivors should be helped, and the
children of survivors.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, Florida set the precedent in reparations by paying up to $150,000
to survivors of a 1923 attack on blacks in Rosewood, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arkansas, historians and residents are holding a conference next week to
discuss a major race riot in 1919 at Elaine, Ark. The death toll has been put at
anywhere from 20 to 200.

<HEADLINE> Missile Accusations in Korea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea accused South Korea of developing
long-range ballistic missiles under the disguise of a satellite-launching
program.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea announced in December that it will have its own satellite
launching station by 2005. It says the program is purely commercial and has no
military purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   In a dispatch from North Korea late Friday, the isolated communist nation's
Korea Central News Agency said the South's rocket program is actually designed
to build intercontinental ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will immediately and unhesitatingly take a strong countermeasure
against the South Korean authorities' `satellite launch program' when it is
confirmed,'' KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last September, North Korea announced it would suspend all missile tests as
long as talks continue to improve ties with the United States. But it recently
began threatening to kill the moratorium, after Washington tested a missile
interceptor last month to counter a potential North Korean missile attack.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea accused the United States and Japan of applying ``double
standards'' in the missile dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea alarmed the region in 1998 by firing a multistage rocket over
Japan and into the Pacific. The North claims it launched a satellite into orbit,
but U.S. officials believe it was a missile. They are pressuring North Korea not
to test its new missile, believed capable of reaching Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea will resume sensitive talks
Tuesday in Hawaii on Seoul's desire to develop longer-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a 1979 accord with the United States, South Korea was barred from
developing missiles with a range longer than 112 miles.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea now wants U.S. permission to develop missiles with a range of up
to 312 miles, covering all of North Korea.

<HEADLINE> Villagers Killed in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMMU, India (AP) -- Separatist militants attacked a village in southern
Kashmir, killing three members of the region's dwindling Hindu community, police
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The killings took place Friday night in Telwani, a village 155 miles north
of Jammu, the winter capital in the Himalayan territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Muslim militants surrounded the village and opened fire, killing two men and
an 8-year-old girl. Policemen posted in the village to protect the six Hindu
families that remained in Telwani, returned the fire, engaging militants in a
short gunbattle. The militants subsequently fled.
</P>
<P>
	   One policeman was seriously injured in the fighting. Casualties among the
attackers were not immediately known. Senior officers rushed to Telwani with
reinforcements, but were fired on by the militants who were hiding in the nearby
forest, police said. No losses were reported on either side.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of Islamic militant organizations are fighting government troops to
separate Kashmir from India. More than 26,000 people have been killed in the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a series of massacres where Hindus were targeted by Islamic
militants, the Kashmir government set up police posts in all villages where
Hindus remain.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the insurgency began in 1989, tens of thousands of Hindus have fled
Kashmir and live as refugees across northern India.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Grandma's Account Stuns Family  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Angry calls came rolling in to a Spanish-language television
station after viewers heard details of Elian Gonzalez's meeting with his
grandmothers that went beyond playing with toys and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
	   Station officials said their audience joined the 6-year-old Cuban boy's
Miami relatives on Friday in expressing outrage over one of the grandmother's
accounts of how she playfully bit Elian's tongue and unzipped his pants during
their long-awaited reunion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone we have talked to ... thought this was inappropriate behavior for
grandmothers,'' said Maria Lewis, managing editor at WSCV-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview on Cuban television Tuesday, Elian's paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, said she had ``played jokes'' with the boy during a U.S.
government-ordered meeting Jan. 26 at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Quintana said the boy was ``reserved'' at the start of the meeting, so she
joked that he might have lost his tongue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I took his tongue out of his mouth,'' she said, gesturing with her hand as
if she was pulling her own tongue from her mouth. ``I bit it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I even opened up his zipper,'' she said, making an unzipping gesture. ``I
told him, `Let me see, let me see ... if it has grown.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, spokesman for Elian's Miami relatives, said the family
was ``shocked and disturbed'' by the account.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is not a Cuban custom,'' he said. ``I lived in Cuba until I was 11
and my grandmother, rest in peace, she never measured me that way.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, who arranged the meeting, and Sister Lenore
Esnard, who also was in the house, were unaware of the exchange until Quintana's
remarks were broadcast on Miami television, said Barry University spokeswoman
Michele Morris. O'Laughlin is president of the school.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, few professed to finding anything strange about Quintana's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   Uva de Aragon, assistant director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida
International University, said Quintana's behavior might seem odd to people in
the United States, but it was probably innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The way the woman said it on national television shows it wasn't something
perverted,'' de Aragon said. ``She was joking with a little kid, trying to get
him to respond, the same as if she were tickling him or trying to see his
muscles.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said that most Hispanic cultures have a different concept of personal
space, and that the Cuban culture traditionally has been very male-oriented.
Fathers, particularly in lower classes, often boast about the size of their
sons' genitals, associating that with bravery and virility.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued on Thanksgiving after clinging to an inner tube for two
days following a shipwreck that killed his mother. The first-grader has been
living with relatives in Miami who hope to keep him despite an immigration order
to send him back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatives have requested a meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno next
week to discuss unspecified new information about the case, said Carole Florman,
a Justice Department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the request was being considered.
</P>
<P>
	   She also said the Justice Department is reviewing a letter from Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, asking Reno to move his son to the home of another
Miami relative who is more sympathetic to his wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez, who is pressing for his son's return, wrote that he is ``deeply
concerned and anguished'' over Elian's condition.

<HEADLINE> Miss Tennessee Wins Miss USA Pageant  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUG JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- A 21-year-old pre-law student from Tennessee who had
some good advice for her home state's football team won the Miss USA title
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   During a staged news conference early in the show, Lynnette Cole was asked
whether she had any advice for the Tennessee Titans, the NFL team that lost the
Super Bowl to the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wish their arms were longer,'' quipped Cole, referring to the last play
of the game when the team came a yard short of a tying touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss New Hampshire, Bridget Jane Vezina, was named first runner-up. Miss
Alabama, Jina Mitchell, was the second runner-up.
</P>
<P>
	   For the second straight year, the pageant was held at the Grand Palace, one
of the many theaters that draw millions of tourists to Branson, southwest
Missouri's country music mecca.
</P>
<P>
	   Carson Daly of MTV emceed the show. Grammy nominees Lou Bega and Christina
Aguilera were among several stars who performed.
</P>
<P>
	   Cole, of Columbia, Tenn., moves on to compete in the Miss Universe Pageant
in Nicosia, Cyprus, on May 12. Donald Trump, the New York real estate magnate
and a possible Reform Party presidential candidate, is a co-owner of the Miss
Universe Organization with CBS Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Cole will be given a media coach and a travel manager as she makes
appearances on behalf of charities and events held by Miss Universe corporate
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
	   From the various sponsors, the winner receives a silver convertible Camaro,
a year's supply of makeup, a $5,000 scholarship and, because she is on the road
for most of the year, $7,500 in phone cards.

<HEADLINE> 1921 Race Riot Panel Urges Redress  </HEADLINE>
   By RENEE RUBLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- When the state Legislature appointed a commission to
study one of the nation's deadliest, but little-known race riots, Veneice Dunn
Sims didn't expect much more than a lot of rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
	   So news that the committee recommended reparations to survivors of the 1921
Tulsa race riot came as a very welcomed surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, all right!'' the 94-year-old riot survivor said Friday. ``I didn't
think anything was going to happen! How long has it been? ... What, 79 years!''
</P>
<P>
	   After two years of meetings, the Tulsa Race Riot Commission recommended
Friday that direct payments be made to survivors and descendants of riot
victims.
</P>
<P>
	   The 11-member panel also called for a memorial to the dead, scholarships and
a tax checkoff program to fund economic development in the Greenwood district,
where the 1921 rampage by a white Tulsa mob killed as many as 300 people, most
of them black.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I asked myself, 'What would I want if my life was basically destroyed,'''
commission member Vivian Clark said in favor of payments to survivors. ``The
country has a problem as a whole in giving compensations to African Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The commission recommended that the direct payments be a priority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This way we will be helping people first, which is what we are supposed to
be doing,'' said commission member Jim Lloyd, who is white.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Enter Dragon Year  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM FOREMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Eye-stinging clouds of incense wafted through one of
Taipei's most popular temples, where thousands of Taiwanese bowed, prayed and
made offerings of oranges and cakes today on the first day of the Dragon Year.
</P>
<P>
	   Traffic was bumper-to-bumper for several blocks around the Hsingtien Temple,
where crowds followed the Chinese tradition of praying for peace, good luck and
wealth at the start of the Chinese Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwan is one of the best places in the world to observe China's unusual mix
of Buddhism, Taoism and folk religions. Unlike in China, where the communists
once banned such beliefs, people here have worshipped freely for centuries in
hundreds of ornate temples across the island.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hsingtien Temple in northwest Taipei is dedicated to Kuangkung, the god
of war and martial arts and the patron saint of businesspeople. Dressed in gold
and green robes, the red-faced, bearded god sits on a throne inside the temple.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Taipei's usually bustling streets were eerily quiet today, as shops
and restaurants closed for the four-day New Year holiday, which is as festive as
Christmas is in the West.
</P>
<P>
	   But sidewalks just blocks away from the temple were congested with shoppers
and hawkers selling handbags, chestnuts, lottery tickets, clothes and incense.
</P>
<P>
	   Brenda Yu, an accountant who recently graduated from college, eagerly
scratched a red lottery ticket decorated with a gold dragon and hoped she would
win big.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a lucky time to gamble a little bit and to pray at the temple,'' she
said, smiling after the lottery ticket she bought for about $3 turned out to be
a loser.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing on a red plastic stool, Hsu Yu-tse called out to shoppers in a
hoarse voice to buy the sweaters and jackets piled high on his table. Hsu said
business has been bad because many Taiwanese are saving their money to repair
damage from a massive earthquake that hit the island on Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Grabbing the sleeve of a brown fleece jacket, Hsu said the jacket would
usually sell for about $33, but in these times would go for $23.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hsingtien Temple seemed like a good place to celebrate the Year of the
Dragon, among the most auspicious signs in the 12-year zodiac. The structure's
red-tile roof has statues of eight fierce dragons, spikes jutting out of their
arched backs and their front claws raised for battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside the temple's walls, men handed smoking incense sticks out to the slow
shuffling masses of worshippers. People held the incense high over their heads
so not to poke others in the eye. Ashes blew away and landed on the recently
permed hair or new suits worn by the faithful.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people carried red plates with small offerings of oranges, crackers,
cookies and other snacks. The food was placed on long tables already crowded
with bottles of golden cooking oil, pineapples, candied lotus seeds and sticky
rice cakes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the temple's large courtyard, long lines of people from all generations
waited to pray before Kuangkung, who could barely be seen through the clouds of
incense.
</P>
<P>
	   Young mothers gripped the hands of their toddlers. Teen-agers in faded jeans
giggled. Executives in blue suits talked on mobile phones. Elderly grandmothers
with bent backs stared straight ahead, their lips moving as they murmured
inaudible prayers.
</P>
<P>
	   When they reached the front of the line, they held the incense in both hands
or pressed their palms together tightly and bowed slightly as they prayed.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Lin, a Taipei teacher, followed the river of people inside the temple.
``My family comes here every year. We come to pray for wealth, good fortune and
peace. Peace is the most important,'' he said.

latest round of violence started after a rocket attack Wednesday killed two
elderly Serbs on a bus run by the U.N. refugee agency that was carrying them
through predominantly Albanian areas near Kosovska Mitrovica. That attack
destroyed what little faith minority Serbs had in the power of U.N. peacekeepers
to protect them from violence by ethnic Albanians.

Caribou Hills of the Kenai Peninsula at about 1:30 p.m., said Greg Wilkinson, an
Alaska state troopers spokesman. A group of snowmobilers found Boyce and took
him to a nearby lodge. Sgt. Jim Hibpshman, commander of the trooper post in
Homer, said Boyce refused medical treatment and instead went to the Soldotna
airport, where his wife was waiting. "He is tired, hungry, but he's talking and
says he's fine," said Hibpshman.

Lakers Crush the Jazz 113-67
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal and the Los Angeles Lakers limited Utah
to only 21 points in the first half and sent the Jazz to their sixth straight
loss, 113-67 Friday night. The Jazz just barely managed to avoid their most
lopsided defeat ever -- a 158-102 loss to Milwaukee on March 14, 1979, when they
still played in New Orleans. The Lakers' biggest lead was 51 points. O'Neal
finished with 25 points. The Lakers led 33-14 after the first quarter and made
it 56-21 at halftime.

<HEADLINE> Mexico University Strike Continues  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHANNA TUCKMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Striking students at Latin America's largest university
and top school officials failed to reach an agreement on ending their nine-month
standoff during nearly 12 hours of talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Strike leaders and officials from the National Autonomous University of
Mexico accused each other of intransigence after talks ended Friday evening
shortly before midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Strike leaders said talks broke down because of the university's insistence
that they turn over university facilities before beginning formal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   University officials gave no details of the meeting. No further talks are
scheduled, though striking students urged officials to meet with them Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been little movement since the strike at the 260,000-student
university began in April with students protesting plans to raise tuition, which
had been just a few cents, to the equivalent of $140.
</P>
<P>
	   The university backed down on the tuition increase, but a small core of
radical students pressed ahead with the strike. They pushed six demands that
involved reversing academic reforms implemented in recent years and giving
students a greater voice in running the university.
</P>
<P>
	   University Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente called for the talks Friday
following a violent clash three days earlier between striking students and
university security officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The rector asked strikers to spell out exactly what it would take for them
to turn over the main campus, and striking students reluctantly agreed to send
10 representatives to the closed-door talks.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary vigil and interfaith service remember Amadou Diallo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bertrand Simmons remembers being shocked when he learned
Amadou Diallo had been killed by police, describing his former neighbor as a
quiet, unassuming man.
<P>
	   On the first anniversary of Diallo's death, Simmons watched a candlelight
vigil Friday in front of the Bronx apartment building where Diallo lived.
Several hundred people attended the vigil, where members of Diallo's family and
others spoke from a small stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking at the illuminated vestibule where the West African immigrant was
shot by four police officers, Simmons, 71, questioned how the officers could
claim that poor lighting made it difficult to see that Diallo was reaching for a
wallet, and not a weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   "They saw him well enough to shoot 19 bullets into his body," said Simmons.
</P>
<P>
	   The four plainclothes officers fired 41 bullets at Diallo, hitting him 19
times, in the early morning of Feb. 4, 1999. They were charged with second
degree murder, and are being tried in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   From the stage Friday, the victim's mother asked that her son not be
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think what happened to him should not happen to anyone anywhere in the
world," said Kadiatou Diallo. "We pray and hope that justice will be done," she
said, referring to the murder trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Also at the vigil were Diallo's father and three siblings, and Rev. Al
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
	   Several hundred people attended an interfaith healing service held at the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine earlier Friday, just days after the start of
the murder trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is this the proper time to talk about healing?" asked Sheik Abd'Allah Latif
Ali during a sermon. The Muslim cleric noted that some observers were concerned
that such a service could damage the case against the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said it was the Diallo family "who inspired me to say, 'We need a
healing service,' ... a healing to parallel the court process."
</P>
<P>
	   Chairs reserved for Diallo's parents remained empty during the two-hour
memorial that included rites following Islamic, Christian, Jewish, Hindu and
Native American traditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The massive cathedral on Manhattan's Upper West Side was chosen for the
service as "a place of compassion, a place of justice and a place of community
healing," said its dean, the Very Rev. Harry Pritchett Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   For some on Friday, that meant compassion for both Diallo, a black man from
Guinea, and the four white officers who shot him.
</P>
<P>
	   The Very Rev. James P. Morton pointed to "the many injustices that befell so
many immigrants, so many people of color."
</P>
<P>
	   But he asked the audience to consider "the suffering that (the officers) and
their families are enduring at this moment," said Morton, the head of New York's
Interfaith Center.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one member of the congregation was unmoved by Morton's appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want justice for Amadou!" she yelled out, repeating the words throughout
the service.

<HEADLINE> Empire State Building lit in gold and red for Year of the Dragon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - This year's lunar new year celebration got a
1250-foot-tall kickoff as the Empire State Building was bathed in red and gold
lights to welcome the Year of the Dragon.
<P>
	   In a tribute to New York's increasing diversity, a swirling 50-foot long,
red and yellow dragon snaked its way around the famed New York monolith's
observatory on Friday to the ooh's and aah's of tourists and children alike.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope the lunar new year will become a citywide event and not just one
celebrated by the Asian community," said John Wang, president of the Asian
American Business Development Center, the group that organized the lights.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who represents Chinatown in lower
Manhattan, said the city embraces its cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
	   "We in New York have grown very accustomed to celebrating the diversity of
all the cultures that live in our city," Silver said during a ceremony at the
80th floor observatory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Year of the Dragon repeats itself every 12 years, according to the
Chinese lunar calendar system. It is considered to be a particularly auspicious
year, as the dragon is a symbol of authority, courage and good fortune in
ancient Chinese society, said James Yu of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Children born during the Year of the Dragon are believed to attract wealth
and good fortune to their families, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peggy Huang, 17, of Manhattan, was part of a youth contingent watching the
dancing dragon curl around the observatory. She said she was excited because
"it's the time of year when all the kids get a lot of red envelopes." As part of
the holiday tradition, relatives exchange red envelopes filled with money.
</P>
<P>
	   The new year, which officially begins today, is year 4698. A parade was to
make its way through Chinatown starting around 11 a.m. The fire department said
no fireworks or pyrotechnics permits were requested from parade organizers. Four
years ago, City Hall banned fireworks at most events in the interest of safety,
but still grants licenses for some major events under what it deems controlled
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Loud Noise Recorded Before Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTINE HANLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Two noises about 10 minutes apart, and loud
enough to be heard in the cockpit, could hold the key to why Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 suddenly spun out of control and crashed into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators aren't speculating about the noises, heard on the plane's
cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
	   But an aviation safety expert not connected to the probe said they are
consistent with a deteriorating problem in the plane's tail, where pilots had
reported a a problem with the stabilizer -- the wide part of the tail that keeps
the plane level.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sounds like something failed in the tail, and it certainly would
account for a jammed stabilizer,'' William Waldock, associate director for the
Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   But he cautioned that it is impossible to diagnose the noises without a
better description than what has been provided so far.
</P>
<P>
	   The first bang, about 12 minutes before the end of the recording, was so
loud a flight attendant came to the cockpit to report it, and was told by pilots
that they also heard the sound.
</P>
<P>
	   About 10 minutes later, a second loud noise is heard, ``and the airplane
appears to go out of control,'' said John Hammerschmidt of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses who saw the plane go down Monday said it flipped upside down and
spiraled straight into the ocean. All 88 people aboard the flight -- bound for
San Francisco and Seattle from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico -- were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   As the investigation continues, a private memorial service for victims was
scheduled today at Pepperdine University, which overlooks the Pacific in Malibu.
On Sunday, the Coast Guard planned to drop flowers from the service over the
crash site, a few miles to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, investigators were to continue mapping the crash site.
Hammerschmidt said that stage of the investigation was progressing rapidly, with
a Navy vessel using side-scan sonar to track the debris in the Santa Barbara
Channel, about 10 miles from shore.
</P>
<P>
	   Sonar appeared to show the debris in a single concentration within an area
the size of a football field, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A video taken by a remote-operated underwater robot indicated most of the
wreckage consisted of pieces about 5 or 6 feet long, but there was a section of
fuselage estimated to be 10 feet long.
</P>
<P>
	   The robot also has sent up video of the plane's tail and a 5-foot section of
the leading edge of the 40-foot long horizontal stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   After the crash site is mapped, robots like the one that salvaged the
plane's flight recorders earlier this week will eventually be sent down to help
retrieve bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't do it overnight,'' said Navy Capt. Terry Labrecque. ``You have
to be methodical.''
</P>
<P>
	   Four bodies have been recovered so far, and authorities believe more may be
trapped beneath debris 650 feet underwater.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's voice recorder shows that for at least 30 minutes before the
crash the pilots were struggling to correct a problem with the tailwing
stabilizer, which they reported had jammed.
</P>
<P>
	   About 12 minutes before the end of the recording the plane apparently lost
vertical control, Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew recovered control about 90 seconds later. Shortly after, a flight
attendant is heard telling the pilots of a loud noise from the rear of the jet,
and ``the crew acknowledged that they had heard it too,'' Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The second noise, actually recorded by the device, sounded just near the end
of the tape.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane has an audible alarm to indicate a stall, or dangerous loss of
lift, but no such warning is heard on the tape, Hammerschmidt said.

Cuban Grandma's Account Stuns Family
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives are outraged over his Cuban
grandmother's account of how she playfully bit the 6-year-old boy's tongue and
unzipped his pants during their long-awaited reunion. "The family is shocked and
disturbed," Armando Gutierrez, spokesman for the Miami relatives, said Friday.
"That is not a Cuban custom." Through Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., Elian's Florida
relatives requested a meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno next week to
discuss unspecified new information about the case, Justice spokesman Carole
Florman said. The request was being considered.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for an additional
$386 million for training and trade enforcement programs designed to strengthen
U.S. manufacturing jobs, the White House said Friday. The budget request, which
will be part of the spending package that Clinton sends to Congress on Monday,
comes as he is beginning a major push to convince fellow trade Democrats in
Congress to support a new trade arrangement with China. Trade unions are among
the most vocal opponents of the proposed pact.

Noises Heard on Airline 'Black Box'

<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Two noises were heard on the "black boxes" from
Alaska Airlines flight 261 just before the plan crashed in the Pacific ocean,
federal officials said. The tape revealed new details of what occurred on the
flight in its last minutes as the pilots struggled to control a problem with the
horizontal stabilizer -- the wide part of the tail that keeps a plane flying
level. The plane nose-dived into the Pacific Ocean en route from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco on Monday, killing all 88 aboard.

	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A rookie sled dog racer who disappeared in
blizzard conditions during a 200-mile race was found alive Friday afternoon, six
days after he was last seen. Rod Boyce was found near the race trail in the
Caribou Hills of the Kenai Peninsula at about 1:30 p.m., said Greg Wilkinson, an
Alaska state troopers spokesman. A group of snowmobilers found Boyce and took
him to a nearby lodge. Sgt. Jim Hibpshman, commander of the trooper post in
Homer, said Boyce refused medical treatment and instead went to the Soldotna
airport, where his wife was waiting. "He is tired, hungry, but he's talking and
says he's fine," said Hibpshman.

<HEADLINE> Judge orders open NY primary, strikes down GOP ballot rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - New York Republicans will face an unfamiliar sight in
the voting booth next month - a choice of four different candidates for the
presidential nomination.
<P>
	   Arizona Sen. John McCain and his supporters hope the long list of names will
mark an end to state GOP bosses' practice of closing New York primaries to
everyone but their favorite candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The system died here today," McCain lawyer Burt Neuborne said Friday, after
a federal judge ordered the party to open its primary and struck down major
elements of the GOP's notoriously complicated ballot rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowing to heavy pressure to let McCain on the ballot, party leaders conceded
that parts of their rules were unfair and agreed not to appeal the judge's
order.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision means Republican voters in every New York congressional
district will be able to choose on March 7 from among Gov. George Bush, McCain,
publisher Steve Forbes and conservative activist Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Edward Korman declared large parts of the state GOP's
election rules invalid, accusing party leaders of rigging the race in favor of
their favorite candidate - Bush. Korman said the requirements unfairly abridge
New Yorkers' voting rights by making it too difficult for legitimate candidates
to get on primary ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a good day for McCain, it's a good day for New Yorkers, and it's a
great day for democracy," Neuborne said.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision came a day after Gov. George Pataki decided to abandon a
politically damaging - and clearly losing - effort to keep McCain's name off
ballots in more than a third of New York's congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki and the state party are backing Bush and had hoped to guarantee him
an easy ride through the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain, who trounced the Texas governor in the New Hampshire primary,
made his ballot troubles a potent campaign issue, using them to bolster his
image as a renegade and likening New York's system to that of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Sensing voters' frustration, the Bush campaign asked the state party this
week not to appeal if Korman ruled against them in the Brooklyn federal court
lawsuit filed by McCain and joined by Forbes and Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain declared victory, saying the judge's order would end the days of
closed elections in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am glad there will not be a repetition of the kind of machine-style
political control of the process of selecting the nominee of our party," he
said. "I am pleased that the Republicans in the state of New York will now be
able to make a choice on March 7th."
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP chairman Bill Powers defended the old rules, adding that the party
did not like Korman's order but would accept it.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York's primary process ensures that every individual seeking the
highest office in the land ... develop(s) the grassroots support needed to earn
the right to represent our families in the fall election," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Korman said it was clear party leaders were using petition requirements
to block ballot access.
</P>
<P>
	   He did not cut the number of signatures Republican candidates must collect
in each of the state's 31 congressional districts. Party rules, enacted by the
state Legislature, require presidential hopefuls to get signatures from 0.5
percent of registered Republicans in each district, plus 5,000 more statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said the problem was the restrictions placed on how signatures can
be gathered and the legal challenges the party uses to invalidate opponents'
petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   He singled out as unconstitutional a requirement that petitions be
circulated only by people who live within the district where they gather
signatures. Korman said the rule gives unfair advantage to the candidate favored
by the party, since GOP leaders can easily mobilize local foot soldiers, while
outside candidates struggle to find workers in every district.
</P>
<P>
	   He also struck down a requirement that signers list the town where they live
instead of the village. He said that rule - used to knock Forbes off ballots in
three Long Island districts and McCain in one - was an unconstitutional
technicality.
</P>
<P>
	   Korman told each campaign to submit the names of the convention delegates it
wants listed on ballots by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision restores McCain's candidacy in 12 districts where challenges to
his petitions were unresolved and puts Bush's name back on in a South Bronx
district where it was removed because his supporters forged signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders had tried to eliminate McCain in 17 districts, but Pataki
relented on Thursday. "John McCain should be on the ballot," he said. "This
should be a campaign about ideas and issues, not technicalities."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush praised Pataki's move, saying before the judge's order was announced,
"It's the right decision. I welcome it."

<HEADLINE> Three-Way Tie At Pebble Beach  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- After a three-week break, all Tiger Woods
wanted to do in the first round of the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am was get into
position to contend for his sixth straight PGA Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The mission was accomplished. The method was maddening.
</P>
<P>
	   It took two days to play 18 holes in weather that ranged from splendid
sunshine to raging winds, to rain that soaked the three golf courses to
conditions so soft and serene that shots into the green looked like a game of
lawn darts.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods made eight birdies, six pars and four bogeys, and finished his round
Friday with only 13 clubs. The head on his favorite driver, the one responsible
for the longest winning streak in 47 years, snapped off at impact on his tee
shot on the 16th hole.
</P>
<P>
	   Add it all up, and Woods was two strokes behind David Duval, Vijay Singh and
Notah Begay, all of whom recorded a 6-under 66 at Poppy Hills.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was shocking," Woods said. "You don't expect that to happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Expect anything at Pebble Beach, where the tournament rarely goes according
to plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the real madness could begin.
</P>
<P>
	   The PGA Tour, hopeful of a 72-hole tournament at Pebble Beach for only the
second time since 1995, scheduled the next three rounds through Monday. But
overnight rain was in the forecast, and another huge storm was predicted for
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got three days to get in 54 holes, if you ask me," Duval said.
</P>
<P>
	   That means making the most out of every shot. Unpredictable weather at
Pebble doesn't lend itself to final-round comebacks, because there's no
guarantee of a final round. A year ago, a one-stroke lead after the third round
Saturday turned into a one-stroke victory for Payne Stewart when Sunday's round
was washed out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I heard there's another storm coming in," Woods said. "I'll have to make
more birdies."
</P>
<P>
	   Or, he could take the cue from former Stanford teammate Begay, whose round
of 66 featured two eagles. That included a hole-in-one on No. 6 at Poppy Hills,
a 6-iron from 168 yards that landed 4 feet past the flag and spun back into the
cup.
</P>
<P>
	   That last time Begay had an ace in competition was on the Nike Tour, the day
he shot 59. This was only a 66, but still nothing to sniff at.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think I've shot 66 and ever been mad," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Begay managed his 66 despite a myriad of distractions, all related to his
drunken driving conviction in New Mexico last month that will require one week
in jail when the West Coast swing is over.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hardest part was dealing with my own personal disappointment in
myself," he said. "There was a low point there for about three days after the
incident that I really wasn't interested in playing golf."
</P>
<P>
	   Ten of the top 16 players after the first round played at Poppy Hills, the
easiest of the three courses because it has five par-5s and is sheltered from
the seaside winds.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Janzen had a 68 at Pebble Beach Golf Links, while Grante Waite had a 68
at Spyglass Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   No one had a round -- or an experience with the driver -- quite like Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1948 to win six
straight tour events, Woods was playing for his first tournament in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even if you take a week off, for some reason when you come back it seems
like it's a different start," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He got the same kind of results. Even-par through 10 holes and not swinging
the club his best, Woods returned Friday and hit laser shots into every green.
His only bogey was a three-putt from 15 feet that he drilled 4 feet by the cup.
</P>
<P>
	   The wheels didn't come off, but the head of his driver did.
</P>
<P>
	   After a 4-iron into 4 feet for birdie on the par-3 15th, Woods lashed at his
driver and was left holding only a stick. The head tumbled some 85 yards down
the fairway.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nice Arnold Palmer follow-through," Mark O'Meara told him, not realizing
there was a reason for the whipping finish.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods stared in disbelief at the shaft, then turned to the gallery and
flexed his muscles.
</P>
<P>
	   He still made birdie by hitting a 7-iron into 12 feet, and followed with
another birdie on the par-3 17th, this from 6 feet. He had to hit 3-wood on the
par-5 18th, which kept him from reaching the green in two. He wound up with a
par.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods wasn't allowed to use the driver in the bag of his amateur partner,
Stanford buddy Jerry Chang, but he's got another one for Saturday's round.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the one that broke has some special memories.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've had it since the winter of '98," Woods said. "It's worked pretty well
for me."
</P>
<P>
	   If the backup works the same, another victory could be in store for him.

<HEADLINE> M. Schmidt Makes Tour Debut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- Although Mike Schmidt showed he can still hit the
long ball, he learned quickly that being a pull-hitter in golf isn't quite as
effective as it was in baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmidt, the Hall of Fame slugger who retired in 1989, displayed rookie
jitters in his shaky debut on the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
	   The former Philadelphia Phillies third baseman, known for his consistency
over a stellar 18-year major league career, flashed a promising, yet erratic
golf game. He scattered five birdies, but threw in two double bogeys and five
bogeys to finish with minus-1 point, 16 behind leader Vicente Fernandez after
the opening round of the $1.1 million Royal Caribbean Classic.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt relaxed all day, but you wouldn't know that," said Schmidt, who
received a sponsor's exemption after making it to the final round of qualifying
school in December. "I say I wasn't nervous, but I must've been anxious off the
tee being in a different environment. I was trying too hard."
</P>
<P>
	   Fernandez had eight birdies against one bogey Friday, earning 15 points
under the Modified Stableford scoring system that awards 8 points for a double
eagle, 5 for an eagle, 2 for a birdie, nothing for par, minus-1 for a bogey and
minus-3 for a double bogey.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think players that make the most birdies have an advantage," Fernandez
said. "The mental approach of this format is different."
</P>
<P>
	   Fernandez's only bobble came at No. 11, when he missed an 8-foot par putt.
</P>
<P>
	   Hugh Baiocchi, who had six birdies on the back nine, had 14 points and would
have had a share of the lead had he not bogeyed the par-3 17th. Bob Eastwood and
Mike Hill each had 13 points on the 6,869-yard, par-72 Crandon Park Golf Club
course.
</P>
<P>
	   Another prominent rookie also had some trouble Friday. Tom Kite, a 19-time
winner on the PGA Tour, had 6 points and was tied with defending champion Bruce
Fleisher.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmidt, who received a loud ovation when he stepped up to the first tee,
realized that nine years of making more than $100,000 a year on fringe tours,
doesn't equate to being a pro golfer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Absolutely not," Schmidt said. "There's a fine line and I couldn't hit my
tee shot. I smoked it right down the middle on the practice range, but I
couldn't take my range tee out on the course.
</P>
<P>
	   "I could stand with 'em, dress with 'em, put the glove in the back pocket
and do all the things big-time golfers do. I could talk the talk, walk the walk,
but as soon as they announced me on the tee box I wasn't freed up."
</P>
<P>
	   While Schmidt kept his poise despite needing two shots to get out of a pesky
greenside bunker on 11, his wife, Donna, admitted to the same butterflies she
felt when her husband was trying to stick with the Phillies in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a rookie again and he was feeling his rookie oats," she said. "I was
dying out there watching. It's nervewracking for me. I feel like it's 26 years
ago and I'm saying, 'Please keep him in the majors.' This is the majors. It's
another challenge and I think he enjoys the struggles. That's what makes him so
good."
</P>
<P>
	   Schmidt averted further damage with birdies at Nos. 16 and 18, the latter a
tap-in on the par-5 hole that drew a large ovation. After each meaningful putt,
Schmidt punched the air as if he just took Nolan Ryan deep.
</P>
<P>
	   While he was satisfied with much of his round, the perfectionist in Schmidt
wouldn't let him enjoy the experience -- not yet.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe in five or 10 years I'll look back and realize how special this was,
but it's my nature to grind it out until I convince myself that I belong
competing here," he said. "Right now, I'm here on an exemption."
</P>
<P>
	   While several baseball fans tagged along in Schmidt's gallery, his playing
partners Hawaiian Steve Veriato and Spaniard Jose Maria Canizares, seemed
unfazed by the attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "They didn't say much and that's right down my alley," Schmidt said. "If it
was Lee Trevino, I might've had to tell him to shut up."
</P>
<P>
	   Veriato struggled at -1, but Canizares sparkled at plus-11, four points off
the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   So much for celebrity.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, yeah, the beisbol player," Schmidt mimicked Canizares' recognition of
the former Phillies star.

<HEADLINE> Firsts Abound at NHL All-Star Game  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA PODELL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- The NHL All-Star game has returned to where it all started.
Even after 49 editions, there's plenty of room for first-time occurrences.
</P>
<P>
	   The celebration began in 1947 at Maple Leaf Gardens, the Yankee Stadium of
the NHL. Now, for the 50th game, the Maple Leafs serve as hosts Sunday for the
eighth time -- first at the year-old Air Canada Centre.
</P>
<P>
	   The most glaring first is that Wayne Gretzky will not play in the game for
the first time since 1978. His 18-game streak is a record, one that will be
matched once North America team captain Ray Bourque of the Boston Bruins takes
the ice.
</P>
<P>
	   "I miss it dearly," Gretzky said Friday night during a reception at his
local restaurant. "I wish I was playing Sunday."
</P>
<P>
	   The native of Ontario, who retired from the New York Rangers after last
season, will not be far from the festivities, however. His No. 99 jersey will
officially be retired by the NHL in the same fashion baseball did with Jackie
Robinson's No. 42.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the biggest disappointments I went through last year when I retired
was that I was not going to play in the All-Star game in Toronto," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis goalie Roman Turek, selected Thursday in place of injured starter
Dominik Hasek, also claimed his spot in the opening lineup Friday. Turek will be
the first goalie to start the game in his All-Star debut since Toronto's Felix
Potvin in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Injuries also sidelined Pierre Turgeon of the Blues and Colorado's Peter
Forsberg, replaced by Ray Whitney of Florida and Patrik Elias from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit's Nicklas Lidstrom will serve as the World team captain.
</P>
<P>
	   Two rookies were chosen to play, for the first time in four years. Petr
Buzek of the expansion Atlanta Thrashers will suit up for the World team, while
New Jersey's Scott Gomez is on the North American squad.
</P>
<P>
	   Gomez, from Alaska, is the first Hispanic player in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3-year-old format matching North America against the World, established
when NHL players went to the 1998 Nagano Olympics, has drawn mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Recchi, one of four Philadelphia Flyers selected to play World team, is
not a fan of the format.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's obviously a lot more North Americans than there is World players,
so I think some players that deserve it get left out a little bit," Recchi said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teammate John LeClair, who on Sunday might play on a line with Recchi and
Flyers captain Eric Lindros, sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it adds a little more intensity to the game and it puts a little
bit more on the line," LeClair said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I couldn't see how it would ever be a problem. I think it would just be a
friendly ribbing," he added when asked if it's troublesome when teammates play
for different All-Star teams.
</P>
<P>
	   All three agreed it would be ideal to play as linemates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to have a blast up there," Lindros said. "I have a pretty good
idea what those guys are going to do. I'm just happy to be going and go out and
have some fun. I've always played with John every year."
</P>
<P>
	   The Flyers have even more representation as defenseman Eric Desjardins also
was selected and coach Roger Nielson, currently battling cancer, will serve as
the North American assistant in his second All-Star appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Neilson, from Toronto, got his first NHL head coaching job from the Maple
Leafs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's great for Roger," LeClair said. "He deserves it for all the
time he's put into hockey, especially to go to Toronto like that -- his hometown
-- hopefully will be a big thrill for him."
</P>
<P>
	   The thrills begin tonight with the Heroes of Hockey taking on former Maple
Leafs players in a pair of games. That will be followed by the skills
competition, featuring the NHL's fastest skater, hardest shooter and top goalie.
</P>
<P>
	   Much is new but in this 50th All-Star game, the old Maple Leafs Gardens
arena was not forgotten. Those who will play in the Heroes games, hit that
historic ice again Friday to practice and scrimmage.

<HEADLINE> Lewis' Lawyers Criticize Charge  </HEADLINE>
    By ERIN McCLAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Ray Lewis' attorneys said police based murder charges
against the All-Pro linebacker on the word of one witness, and they claim to
have other witnesses who say Lewis wasn't involved in a fight that left two men
dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the Baltimore Ravens star portrayed him as a concerned bystander
during the stabbing early Monday of Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth "Shorty"
Baker, 21.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference Friday, the lawyers said Lewis acted as a peacemaker
after the post-Super Bowl party in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood, herding his
friends into a limousine and away from danger.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported today that the witness was Lewis'
limousine driver, Duanne Fassett. Investigators said Fassett, employed by All
Stretched Out Limo in Baltimore, was the first and only solid witness thus far
to give police any statements, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fassett's friends and attorney have told reporters that Fassett insists
Lewis had no role in the killings.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know the evidence will show Mr. Lewis was not a participant," Lewis
attorney Jana Harris said. "Being present with people, having some knowledge of
it, being nearby -- that is not a crime in this or any other state."
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyers released a police officer's affidavit quoting one witness as
saying Lewis punched, beat and stabbed Lollar and Baker. The affidavit said the
witness had known Lewis for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis can be tried for murder if he helped the killer or if he was involved
in the fight that preceded the slayings. But Harris said many witnesses had told
Lewis' attorneys that he did not participate in the assault.
</P>
<P>
	   She said Lewis tried to settle the fight, then became concerned for his
friends' safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was shepherding a large group of people through a herd of chaos into his
limousine," Harris said.

	   Two Atlanta homicide investigators were in Baltimore County, Md., on Friday
working with local police, county police spokesman Bill Toohey said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying to determine who was there and what their involvement was,"
Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police still were looking for two men they believe were riding in Lewis'
rented limousine, which reportedly was seen speeding from the scene of the
stabbings.
</P>
<P>
	   A.J. Johnson and Kwame King are wanted for questioning, but are not
necessarily suspects, Quigley said. Johnson is a former University of Maryland
player who had a tryout with the Miami Dolphins, and King grew up in Lewis'
hometown of Lakeland, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution he was not in Lewis' limousine
after the Super Bowl and that he knew Lewis through another friend on the
Ravens.
</P>
<P>
	   In Baltimore County, Deputy State's Attorney Howard Merker said Friday he
was postponing a hearing on an assault charge against Lewis for allegedly
hitting a woman in a bar.
</P>
<P>
	   Merker said he had received "fairly substantial and pretty convincing"
statements from 15 to 20 witnesses who said Lewis did not attack the 24-year-old
woman. Merker postponed a hearing scheduled for Wednesday to give the woman a
chance to provide statements supporting her story.

<HEADLINE> HDTV Could Open Eyes to Hockey  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN ROBINSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- In baseball, good hitters condense the skills needed to put
bat on ball into a simple stratagem: "See the ball, hit the ball."
</P>
<P>
	   If only it were that simple in hockey.
</P>
<P>
	   A sport with a relatively small but enormously loyal fan base has
traditionally struggled to sell itself for one simple reason: new viewers can't
follow the action on TV, get discouraged and never watch again.
</P>
<P>
	   Can't see the puck, can't get interested.
</P>
<P>
	   That's where high-definition television enters the picture -- an
unblemished, clear-as-a-photograph, wide-as-a-hockey rink picture at that.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, big players, big rinks and a small puck, viewed on a 20- or
27-inch screen at an 8-foot distance, have added up to tiny TV ratings for
hockey in the United States. Most ESPN games, for example, are watched by
slightly more than 1 percent of all TV households.
</P>
<P>
	   No wonder hockey is embracing high-definition television, and its highly
detailed images, almost as much as it would a comeback by Wayne Gretzky or Mario
Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
	   One week after the Super Bowl was first televised in HDTV to the
approximately 120,000 U.S. homes that already have adopted the new technology,
Sunday's NHL All-Star game will be the first hockey game shown nationally in
high-definition.
</P>
<P>
	   Watching sports in high-definition is eye-opening because the rectangular
picture, shaped more like a movie screen than the traditional square box TV
viewers are accustomed to watching, allows more players to fill the screen.
</P>
<P>
	   And a picture approximately six times more detailed than standard, analog TV
makes the puck clearly visible in every shot, from every angle.
</P>
<P>
	   Hockey Night in Canada? Watching hockey in high-definition is more like
Hockey Night at the Cinema.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both the pictures and the sound are more like a cinematic experience in
that many HDTV sets are tied into a multichannel sound system with full surround
sound," said Ken Michael, ABC's vice president of network engineering. "You will
be able to see the puck in ways people haven't seen before."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC Sports president Howard Katz thinks high-definition TV, which should be
widely available by 2006, could have a greater impact on hockey than any other
sport.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a fan, I can tell you that the first we saw HDTV, a lot of us thought
this could really revolutionize the way this sport is covered," Katz said. "This
format, being able to see away from the puck, is just a tremendous advantage and
I think it is going to be a great experiment."
</P>
<P>
	   The HDTV telecast will be shown on the 23 ABC affiliates, mostly in large
cities, that already are broadcasting a digital signal. To add oomph to the
standard telecast most viewers will see, ABC will put microphones on coaches
Scotty Bowman of the World All-Stars and Pat Quinn of the North American
All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
	   Does Quinn worry he might momentarily forget his words are resonating from
millions of TV sets in the 171 countries where the game will be televised?
</P>
<P>
	   "I am not particularly enamored with the idea. I have never seen where that
works effectively ... but you can't be contrived, because it looks phony," Quinn
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, ABC and CBC reporters will wander the benches to ask players questions
submitted via the Internet. It will be a nontraditional telecast, for sure, one
that ABC is promoting with the NFL Pro Bowl as a two-games-for-one package it
hopes will attract fans who normally tune out hockey.
</P>
<P>
	   The NHL game will be televised at 2:30 p.m. EST, followed by the Pro Bowl at
5:30 p.m. And, appropriately enough in a year when the game's first Hispanic
star, Scott Gomez, will play, the NHL game will be broadcast in Spanish for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't have a problem reaching hockey audiences in Detroit and Denver and
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh," Katz said. "Our problem, our challenge, is to
attract fans in areas that haven't been traditionally great hockey
marketplaces."

<HEADLINE> Familiar Faces Win Millrose Races  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Runners are like thoroughbreds, sometimes shaken by events
surrounding them -- a delayed start for their race, a runner coming up from
behind and peeking over their shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	Unless, of course, they've been around the track as often as miler Regina
Jacobs and 800-meter man Johnny Gray. They just shrug off that other stuff and
run.
</P>
<P>
	Both were decisive winners Friday night in the 93rd Millrose Games at Madison
Square Garden. Gray took his specialty in 1:49.88, going wire to wire after the
race was delayed about a half-hour. Jacobs, running alone, took the mile in
4:24.04, winning by more than 14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	``I had warmed up preparing for an 8:25 race,'' Gray said. ``Then I just jogged
for 30 minutes. In the past, I might have panicked. I handled it. I turned it
into a workout.''
</P>
<P>
	Gray, 39, set the Millrose record for this event 14 years ago. He's still
running at an age when others are thinking about masters events.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm reminded about it every week,'' he said. ``I feel as good at 39 as I did
at 29. The only difference is I have experience to go along with my shape.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a very proud individual. I've been criticized as being inconsistent.
Check it out. I'm one of the most consistent half-milers to step on this planet.
Hard work makes you good. Hard work, dedication and consistency makes you a
great athlete.''
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, 36, laughs off questions about her age.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm old and I'm getting older by the minute,'' she said after running away
with the women's mile. ``Old ladies are really sexy.
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things come with age. From the mid-30s to 40, I think a runner
mid-distance and up is in their prime. It's an exciting place to be. I'm
physically at my top.
</P>
<P>
	``I have a competitive advantage. I'm more mature and experienced. A lot of
things that rattled me don't because I've been there. That's the competitive
edge. At our age, if you stay emotionally interested and excited about it, you
can still win.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a different position. I'm still learning a lot of things, my stride,
my arm swing, things I should have learned as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
	Both Gray and Jacobs will be in Boston on Sunday, shooting for records -- Gray
in the two-mile relay with the Santa Monica Track Club, and Jacobs in the 1,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
	Other winners Friday included Mark Carroll in the Wanamaker mile, world record
holder Maurice Greene in the men's 60 meters, Joetta Clark Diggs, who won the
women's 800, her seventh Millrose victory in her final race here, and Mark
Everett in the men's 500 meters.
</P>
<P>
	Carroll knew the importance of the mile, the glamour event of this meet.
</P>
<P>
	``It's the Wanamaker mile, a great race to win in your running career,'' he
said. ``Your trophy cabinet won't be full until you win the Wanamaker.''
</P>
<P>
	Greene, who set the world record of 6.39 two years ago, was timed in 6.45 for
the 60.
</P>
<P>
	``Now is not the time to get excited,'' he said. ``The Olympics are not until
September. When I make the team in July, then I'll start to get excited.
</P>
<P>
	``My biggest competition is myself. Mentally, I believe I'm unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
	Clark Diggs closed out her Millrose career with a win.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to go out winning this one,'' she said. ``I was getting tired. I'm
not as fit as I'd like to be but I wanted to win this. I got my start here. To
have this victory here was great.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The blowout was so bad, there was only one thing for John Stockton and the
Utah Jazz to do -- hope to avoid a repeat performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz scored just 21 points in the first half and stumbled to their sixth
straight loss Friday night, a 113-67 humiliation by the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah barely managed to avoid its most-lopsided defeat ever, a 158-102 loss
to Milwaukee on March 14, 1979, when the team still played in New Orleans. The
Lakers came close, leading by 51 points in sending the Jazz to its first
six-game skid since March 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   "You find out a little bit about yourselves after a game like this,"
Stockton said. "If you can fight back from something like this, then it's just
one game. If you let it affect you -- your confidence, the way you play, the way
you trust each other -- then you can easily continue to slide."
</P>
<P>
	   Utah's next game is Sunday, at home against San Antonio. Shaquille O'Neal
scored 25 points for the host Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew that they were struggling and we just took it to them," O'Neal
said. "Obviously, the Jazz are having problems."
</P>
<P>
	   In other games, Indiana stopped Sacramento 104-94, Seattle defeated Phoenix
94-86, Vancouver beat Chicago 101-76, Golden State downed Denver 103-101,
Portland defeated Atlanta 97-90, Minnesota topped Houston 102-85, Boston beat
New Jersey 100-95, Detroit downed Cleveland 105-96 and Miami beat Washington
99-92.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers, beaten by the Jazz 105-101 in double overtime at Utah on Jan.
24, quickly turned the rematch into a rout. Los Angeles led 33-14 after the
first quarter and 56-21 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   The 21 points marked the second-lowest half ever for the Jazz, and their
lowest since they moved to Utah. They scored 20 in the first half in 1975
against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The NBA record low for a half is 19, set by the Los Angeles Clippers in a
loss to the Lakers earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was just one of those games when we didn't have a chance," Utah coach
Jerry Sloan said. "They just dominated. We couldn't run any plays, and they
block the shots and did everything they wanted to do."
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz had not lost by more than 40 points since March 5, 1986, when the
Lakers routed them by 46.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah's starters played sparingly as the game got out of hand. Stockton
scored two points in 14 minutes and Karl Malone had 14 in 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver posted the most-lopsided victory in its five-year history as
Michael Dickerson scored 20 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Bibby added 16 as the Grizzlies beat Chicago for the first time in
eight career meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver's biggest previous win was 109-89 over the Los Angeles Clippers
last Nov. 14. The Bulls went 12 minutes without a basket in the second half and
fell to 3-19 on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Smith, playing in the city where he starred for five years, scored 21
points as Portland won at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hawks took their only lead at 78-77 on Dikembe Mutombo's hook with 3:47
remaining. The Trail Blazers then scored on 11 of their last 12 possessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Jackson, traded with Isaiah Rider to Atlanta in the deal that sent Smith
to Portland before the season, scored 25 to lead the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana tied a team record with its 17th straight home win, beating
Sacramento behind Mark Jackson's 15 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacers won despite losing Dale Davis to a broken nose late in the first
half. He was hit by an inadvertent elbow from the Kings' Nick Anderson.
</P>
<P>
	   Reggie Miller missed 12 of his 14 shots, but hit two late jumpers for
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Payton scored 23 points and won his duel with Jason Kidd as Seattle
stopped visiting Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton held Kidd, the Suns' All-Star guard, to eight points. Vin Baker added
22 points for Seattle while Rodney Rogers led Phoenix with 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Antawn Jamison scored 19 points, including six in the final 1:53, and Golden
State won its season-high fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   The Warriors held Denver scoreless for the last 2:55 and made up a six-point
deficit. Antonio McDyess had 30 points for Denver, which lost its ninth straight
at Oakland.
</P>
<P>
	   Alonzo Mourning scored 32 points and Miami rallied from a 17-point deficit
in the third quarter to beat visiting Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Mourning has scored at least 20 in a franchise-record 12 straight games, the
NBA's longest active streak. It was Mourning's 500th game in the league.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Garnett had 23 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists to lead Minnesota
over Houston.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryce Drew, starting in place of rookie Steve Francis, scored 20 points for
the Rockets. Francis missed the trip so he could get treatment for a minor
hernia.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenny Anderson made a go-ahead jumper with 48 seconds left, capping Boston's
comeback from a 17-point deficit in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Celtics improved to 17-7 at home and sent New Jersey to its sixth
straight loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindsey Hunter had 26 points and 10 assists as Detroit won for just the
second time in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Shawn Kemp led visiting Cleveland with 22.

<HEADLINE> AmericaOne, Prada Winner Takes All  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Dozens of luxury yachts will stream out to the
race course. A flotilla of smaller watercraft will join them. Only two boats
really matter -- AmericaOne and Prada.
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Italy. Paul Cayard and Francesco de Angelis. One winner
and one loser.
</P>
<P>
	A massive spectator fleet is expected Sunday when Cayard and de Angelis skipper
their sleek, finely tuned boats in a winner-take-all race for the right to face
defending champion New Zealand for the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
	Prada forced one more race with a 37-second win today in which a penalty on the
second of six legs was devastating to AmericaOne, forcing it to make an extra
270-degree turn.
</P>
<P>
	The victory snapped a three-race losing streak for Prada and tied the best-of-9
series 4-4. After 201 races in a series of trials that began Oct. 18 with 11
boats from seven countries, only one race remains.
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that this was going to be a tough regatta and the pendulum has swung
back and forth and the boats are even, the teams are pretty even,'' Cayard said.
``It's basically just and fitting that it comes down to a ninth race.''
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old San Franciscan, representing that city's St. Francis Yacht
Club, has a resume long on comebacks but short on America's Cup success.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard, driving Il Moro di Venezia of Italy, rallied from a 3-1 deficit to beat
New Zealand 5-3 in the 1992 challenger finals. But he lost 4-1 to America3 in
the Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
	He made it to the Cup finals again in 1995 in San Diego, but was swept 5-0 by
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
	De Angelis also has shown an ability to stay cool under adversity. Even when
his team fell behind 4-3 by losing Friday, it had its usual post-race routine.
</P>
<P>
	``We went from technical debriefing to debriefing until time goes by and you
sit at the dinner table and then have a cocktail drink,'' he said, ``scotch.''
</P>
<P>
	While the challenger series has slowly been drawing attention in the United
States, fans in Italy are watching closely. This is the country's fifth Cup
campaign, but it has never won the silver trophy, the top prize in the sailing
world.
</P>
<P>
	``Francesco and I are good friends, or have been,'' Cayard said. ``I know we're
enemies for this week because I've been reading in the Italian press, but he's a
good guy and he's taking all this well.''
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the series advances to another best-of-9 round against New
Zealand, which has been practicing with its two boats.
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody sailed against the Kiwis, so nobody knows how fast they are,'' de
Angelis said.
</P>
<P>
	There's not much difference in speed between his silver-and-red boat and
Cayard's gray-and-green yacht. The crews seem to be equally talented.
</P>
<P>
	But Cayard's mistake in blocking Prada and incurring a penalty cost him today's
race in moderate southwest winds of 10 to 16 knots. As the windward boat,
AmericaOne was required by the rules to give way and didn't.
</P>
<P>
	``I can admit to that being a mistake,'' Cayard said. ``I've just got to do
better next time.''
</P>
<P>
	Prada led at the first five marks by 20, 19, 30, 17 and 16 seconds. And Cayard
still had to make his penalty turn, which cost him about 30 seconds on the last
3 1/4-mile leg of the 18 1/2-mile Hauraki Gulf course.
</P>
<P>
	His best chance was to get close enough to Prada to force it into a penalty,
which would have wiped out AmericaOne's and required neither boat to make the
extra turn.
</P>
<P>
	But it never happened.
</P>
<P>
	Prada started the race with confidence and ended it with one more race to sail.
</P>
<P>
	``We left the dock very determined to sail well,'' de Angelis said. ``That's
what we'll do again.''
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne must win to have a chance to bring the Cup back to America, where it
resided from 1851 until Australia won it in 1983. It returned to the United
States in 1987 when Dennis Conner won in Fremantle, Australia, but went to New
Zealand five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	``Going into today, there were two races left and the odds probably are that
each of us would win one,'' Cayard said. ``So that looks good for us.''

<HEADLINE> Investors Look To Save Ben &AMP; Jerry's  </HEADLINE>
    By ROSS SNEYD AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Will Ben &AMP; Jerry's next flavor be Capitalist Crunch?
Not if a group of "socially responsible" investors can help it.
</P>
<P>
	   Worried that the hippie, civic-minded ice cream maker that gave the world
Wavy Gravy and Cherry Garcia may soon fall into big-time corporate hands, the
group is stitching together a rival bid against Unilever NV, an Anglo-Dutch food
conglomerate, and Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The investors, who are scattered across the country, confirmed only that
they are working on a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're in the middle of forming an offer and we're all sworn to hold this in
confidence," said Judith Wicks, owner of the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia and
a prominent member of the Social Venture Network, a San Francisco "socially
responsible" investment group.
</P>
<P>
	   Dreyer's, based in Oakland, Calif., issued a statement Friday saying it
would not court Ben &AMP; Jerry's -- or any other company -- without being welcomed.
It did not confirm it was actively trying to take over the Vermont-based
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's merely confirmed that the Social Venture Network was
interested.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's announced in December that companies it did not identify were
interested in taking it over. That raised fears that the company might sell out
to corporate suits who will abandon the Ben &AMP; Jerry philosophy of doing good
while doing good business.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's donates 7.5 percent of its pretax profits to charity and
maintains a so-called double bottom line dedicated to earning a profit and
promoting social good. That includes buying milk from small family farms and its
nuts from sustainable farms in the South American rainforests.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben Cohen, the ex-hippie who founded the company with boyhood friend Jerry
Greenfield, told The Wall Street Journal there is logic behind a socially
responsible group trying to keep his company independent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Quirky brands don't usually do well as part of large conglomerates," Cohen
said. "I'm delighted there's an investor group trying to find a way to keep the
company independent."
</P>
<P>
	   The group of investors includes Robert E. Barton, chief executive of
Catalyst Financial Group Inc., a Brookfield investment bank that focuses on
environmental companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you and I think Ben &AMP; Jerry's has sold out and we're disillusioned, then
are we going to continue to be loyal to them or are we going to buy from the
next little micro ice cream company?" Barton said. "I would probably go to the
next micro ice cream company."

<HEADLINE> Cuomo to get involved in Gore's New York effort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Andrew Cuomo will be spending a lot of time on his
home turf in the weeks leading up to the March 7 presidential primary in New
York.
<P>
	   The federal housing secretary said Friday he's taking a lead role in Al
Gore's New York campaign and will stump extensively for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   The heightened visibility of Cuomo - who is mulling a run for governor in
New York - began with an appearance at a senior citizen center Friday in
Manhattan where he came out swinging at Bill Bradley's health care plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York is going to be a very competitive state. It's Bill Bradley's
backyard - senator of New Jersey, former (New York) Knick," Cuomo said in an
interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I truly believe the more people hear the positions on the issues the
more they're going to support Al Gore, which is what happened in New Hampshire,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said Gore was stronger on issues like Medicare and Medicaid that
affect millions of New Yorkers.
</P>

Most polls show Gore and Bradley in a statistical dead heat in New York, a
crucial battleground for Democrats.
</P>

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules on Coke Waiver Demand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that Coca-Cola Co. can withhold
enhanced severance benefits from laid-off employees who refuse to sign a waiver
saying they won't join a class-action discrimination lawsuit against the
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for plaintiffs in the discrimination lawsuit said the company was
"coercing" recently laid-off employees into giving up their rights to be part of
the lawsuit and any future judgment by requiring them to sign the waivers as a
condition of receiving the benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   They asked a judge to stop Coke from requiring the waivers.
</P>
<P>
	   In his ruling Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Story said Coke must
clarify to laid-off employees that they still can participate in the lawsuit as
"witnesses or sources of evidence" and still get the extra benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke, which announced 6,000 job cuts late last month, said such waiver forms
targeting future litigation are common in job reductions.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Ben Deutsch had said the waiver lists telephone numbers of two
Atlanta-area lawyers representing the plaintiffs that laid-off employees might
want to contact before signing.
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit, four current and four former employees contend that
Coca-Cola has discriminated against blacks in pay, promotion and performance
evaluations. The lawsuit seeks to expand the case to represent more than 2,000
black employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola has denied the allegations of discrimination and is fighting the
efforts to certify the lawsuit a class action.

<HEADLINE> FTC Sues To Halt BP Amoco Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB EGELKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The $30 billion merger of BP Amoco and Atlantic
Richfield Co. is on hold while a judge considers the Federal Trade Commission's
claim that the deal would cripple competition for oil supplies to West Coast
refineries.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC filed suit Friday in U.S. District Court, two days after its members
voted 3-2 to oppose the merger. The case could become the biggest antitrust
battle in the oil industry since the government suit that broke up Standard Oil
in 1911.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based BP Amoco -- created a little more than a year ago by the merger
of British Petroleum and Amoco -- agreed last March to acquire Los Angeles-based
Atlantic Richfield, known as Arco.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger would create the second largest non-government oil company,
behind Exxon Mobil.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger was originally scheduled to be completed Monday. But Atlantic
Richfield spokeswoman Linda Dozier said the companies had agreed with the FTC to
await the outcome of the request for an injunction. A hearing is scheduled March
10 before U.S. District Judge Susan Illston.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're confident that the companies will be successful in this case," Dozier
said.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco and Arco account for about 70 percent of Alaska crude oil
production and dominate oil activities in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC contends increased control of Alaska supplies to West Coast refiners
would create a dangerous concentration in the market, resulting in higher oil
prices to refiners.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies contend the proper focus is the international oil market,
which would compensate for any effect on the price of Alaska oil.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to head off anticompetitive concerns, BP Amoco had said it
would sell off 13 percent of the production as well as part ownership in two
Alaska oil fields. But the FTC said that even with the proposed divestitures,
the combined company still would account for 55 percent of the oil flowing from
Alaska's North Slope.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles said Thursday his state would go to court to
support the merger, saying uncertainty over the deal was hurting Alaska's
economy.

<HEADLINE> Wen Ho Lee Challenges 'Secret' Label  </HEADLINE>
   By SUE MAJOR HOLMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Lawyers for the Los Alamos lab scientist accused
of transferring data onto unsecured computer tapes say the information they
contain is far from ``top secret.''
</P>
<P>
	   In seeking to free 60-year-old Wen Ho Lee from jail while he awaits trial,
the attorney's filing sent on Thursday to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
disputed the government's contention that the data in question represents the
``crown jewels'' of U.S. weapons science.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the lawyers said, the tapes contained information that was
classified secret or confidential restricted data.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. attorney's office declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, fired from Los Alamos National Laboratory in March, is accused of
transferring nuclear weapons information to unsecured computers and tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   He has pleaded innocent to 59 criminal counts under the Atomic Energy and
Espionage acts, though is not charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. weapons labs executives testified at Lee's detention hearings that the
tapes contain electronic blueprints to a variety of weapons designs -- from
easily made atomic bombs attractive to terrorists to thermonuclear warheads the
officials said they feared could change the global nuclear balance of power.
</P>
<P>
	   One weapons scientist testified the data was ``the whole ball of wax,'' and
another called the information the nation's nuclear ``crown jewels.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Lee's lawyers say the information's ``secret'' classification is lent to
material which does not reveal ``critical features.''

<HEADLINE> BellSouth Cutting 2,100 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
    By CHAD ROEDEMEIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- In an effort to eliminate redundant positions, BellSouth
Corp. is planning to cut 2,100 jobs this year, the brunt of them in the Atlanta
area.
</P>
<P>
	   About 65 percent of the cuts -- 1,365 jobs -- will come in metro Atlanta,
the company said Friday. Another 420 jobs will be cut in Birmingham, Ala., and
the remaining 315 will be cut in seven other Southeastern states.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the move was not a surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "In an industry being revolutionized by technology and increased
competition, BellSouth is just doing what they need to do to stay alive and keep
regulators and their shareholders happy," said Anthony F. Ferrugia, an analyst
with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were pleased with the move, pushing shares of the company up $1.43
3/4 to $45.50 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta-based BellSouth is eliminating staff positions in human resources,
financial, legal and regulatory departments in order to streamline its
operations, said spokesman Bill Getch.
</P>
<P>
	   "This gives us the ability to bring new products to market faster, the
ability to bundle products, that's where the competitive market is heading,"
Getch said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company plans to make most of the reductions by offering early
retirement or severance packages to employees who leave voluntarily. Getch said
the bulk of the cuts will be completed between April and October.
</P>
<P>
	   BellSouth, created in 1984 after the breakup of AT&AMP;T, had 96,162 employees
last year. This job reduction represents about 2 percent of the company's total
work force.

<HEADLINE> Detained Tanker Heads to Oman  </HEADLINE>
   By SAEED AL-NAHDI
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) -- A Russian tanker detained by the U.S. Navy on suspicion
it was violating U.N. sanctions against Iraq headed today to Oman, where experts
will determine if the oil on board came from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship was seized in the Gulf earlier this week because it was suspected
to be carrying Iraqi oil. The United States and Russia have been at loggerheads
over the matter after Washington spurned a demand by Moscow that it release the
tanker.
</P>
<P>
	   The vessel, Volga-Neft-147, is expected to arrive late today or early Sunday
in Muscat, the Omani capital, and will leave as soon as the oil has been
offloaded, an Omani Foreign Ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil will be held pending the completion of an investigation, the
official said. Specialists in oil analysis are expected to arrive in Muscat
shortly.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia maintains the oil is from Iran, not Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the origin of the oil has been determined, Oman, the United States and
Russia will decide what should be done with it, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials have said that if the oil is Iraqi, the cargo will be
confiscated and sold, with a portion of the proceeds used to pay for the U.N.
sanctions monitoring operation.
</P>
<P>
	   A Pentagon spokesman, Army Col. Vince Ogilvie, said Friday that two
officials from the Russian consulate in the United Arab Emirates boarded the
tanker as it sailed in international waters, as did two American defense
attaches.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq's government-run Al-Thawra newspaper said in an editorial that the
American claim that Iraq benefits from smuggling oil is ``a sheer lie.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has long been at odds with Russia over Iraq. Russia is a
strong supporter of steps toward the eventual lifting of the U.N. economic
embargo against Iraq. The Clinton adminstration demands stronger proof from Iraq
that it is meeting U.N. Security Council resolutions, including a requirement
that Iraq not possess weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. officials have argued that the administration was merely enforcing
the embargo against Iraq in ordering the seizure Wednesday of the Russian
vessel, saying U.N. resolutions authorize seizures in cases where smuggling is
suspected.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is banned from most international commerce but is allowed to export up
to $5.2 billion in oil every six months in order to buy food, medicine and other
essentials for its people, and spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the effort to enforce the U.N. sanctions, the U.S. State Department
said Thursday that illicit oil exports from Iraq average 100,000 barrels a day,
compared with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil prices were much lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraqi officials deny smuggling crude oil or by-products. Iraq says the
United States scrutinizes Gulf ships traveling to and from Iraq, but does
nothing to stop brisk oil smuggling over land from northern Iraq -- a Kurdish
area outside the Baghdad government's control -- into neighboring Turkey, a U.S.
ally.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Medicaid Coverage  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying too many poor women lack access to breakthrough
cancer treatments, President Clinton today proposed that states provide full
Medicaid benefits to uninsured women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   In his weekly radio address, the president said his budget proposal for
fiscal 2001 sets aside $220 million over five years so that states could provide
Medicaid coverage to uninsured women who are screened through the National
Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program and discover they have
cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At a time when we know more about cancer than ever and can fight it better
than ever, we must not leave women to face cancer alone,'' Clinton said.
``Together, we can save lives and bring medical miracles of our time within the
reach of every American.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's proposal, uninsured women would receive Medicaid coverage
for the duration of their treatment, meaning radiation treatment, chemotherapy
and other services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Too often, uninsured women face a patchwork of care, inadequate care, or
no care at all. Many are denied new or better forms of treatment, or wait months
to see a doctor,'' Clinton said. ``This initiative will help get comprehensive
treatment, and get it right away. It will make state-of-the-art therapies
available to women who need them, not just those who can afford them.''
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 2 million women will be diagnosed with either breast or
cervical cancer this decade, and about 500,000 will die from the diseases. More
than 180,000 women will be diagnosed this year and 40,000 are likely to die,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-year survival rate is 97 percent when the diseases are diagnosed
early, but that rate falls to 21 percent after the cancer has spread.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is especially troubling, given the stunning progress scientists are
making in the fight against cancer,'' said Clinton, whose mother died of breast
cancer in 1994. ``Lifesaving new therapies can only help if patients have
insurance or other resources that enable them to afford state-of-the-art
treatment or any treatment at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton appealed to Congress to act quickly on his plan, citing strong
bipartisan support. Similar legislation has been proposed by Sens. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Reps. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., and
Rick Lazio, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an issue that transcends political boundaries, because it touches
all of us,'' Clinton said. ``Together, we can save lives and bring medical
miracles of our time within the reach of every American. We can do it this year,
and we ought to do it soon.''

<HEADLINE> False Data Alleged in Cancer Study  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A South African study of a last-ditch treatment that had
given hope to some women with advanced breast cancer contained falsified data,
U.S. cancer officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came after U.S. officials received word from a university
in Johannesburg that the study's author acknowledged he had made a "foolish"
mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is an aggressive treatment usually reserved for the most advanced
breast cancer: ultrahigh doses of chemotherapy followed by a bone marrow
transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of women have demanded the procedure, believing it is their last
best hope even though there has been no scientific proof of its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   Last spring, five long-awaited studies that experts hoped would settle the
issue were announced -- and four found no difference in survival for breast
cancer patients who underwent the arduous bone-marrow transplant therapy than
those who tried less risky treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   That prompted top cancer specialists to conclude that, at least for women
with advanced breast cancer, high-dose chemotherapy was not a good option.
Whether it helps other women is still under study.
</P>
<P>
	   But the fifth study, performed by a South African researcher on 150
late-stage cancer patients there, had positive results, prompting believers in
the therapy to cling to hope that this arduous treatment might work in some
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Friday, U.S. cancer officials released a letter from Johannesburg's
University of Witwatersrand announcing that that study now "is discredited."
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the university said it is investigating Professor Werner
Bezwoda for scientific misconduct for misrepresenting the study's results.
Bezwoda could not be reached for comment, but the university released a
statement attributed to Bezwoda in which he said, "I acknowledge my error and
take sole responsibility."
</P>
<P>
	   "This was done out of a foolish desire to make the presentation more
acceptable to an audience" of cancer experts, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bezwoda's presentation at a high-profile cancer meeting in Atlanta last May
prompted the U.S. National Cancer Institute to convene a meeting of oncology
specialists to consider why his results were so positive, said NCI spokesman
Brian Vastag.
</P>
<P>
	   Bezwoda claimed to use different chemotherapy agents than U.S. researchers,
prompting speculation that maybe different drugs could produce better results.
</P>
<P>
	   A team of five oncologists went to Johannesburg to audit Bezwoda's results,
but were only able to find 50 of the 150 patients' records, Vastag said. They
reported the inconsistencies to the university's ethics office, which began
investigating and notified U.S. cancer officials Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We felt an obligation to notify everyone as soon as we had the
information," said Dr. Joseph P. Bailes of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology, which alerted cancer patient groups of the problem late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The society allowed Bezwoda's study to be presented its May meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   As far as U.S. cancer patients are concerned, Bailes noted that the South
African study used different chemotherapy drugs than Americans have tried.
Still, "it adds further to the weight of evidence that the procedure has not had
as much effect as many people had hoped," said Dr. Harmon Eyre of the American
Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
	   But the issue is not entirely settled, Bailes said. In the four studies that
found no benefit to high-dose chemotherapy, women continue to be watched in case
some late-term improvement is seen, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And the NCI is sponsoring another study of high-dose chemotherapy in 1,000
women whose breast cancer is not as advanced to see if this treatment helps at
an earlier stage of the disease, Vastag said.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans who wish to try high-dose chemotherapy should do so only in a
clinical trial, Eyre and Bailes stressed.

<P>
	   Every type of oil has certain specifications that can help trace its origin,

<P>
   WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- The Army's newest Patriot interceptor
missile successfully knocked a target missile from the sky during its fifth test
flight early today, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   During the test, a modified Minuteman 2 target missile was launched from
Fort Wingate near Gallup, and traveled roughly 200 miles toward the missile
range.
</P>
<P>
	   A Pac-3 was fired, hitting the target missile, called a Hera, over White
Sands, Army spokesman Jim Eckles said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mission had been scrubbed the previous two days because of weather and
equipment problems. But today's launch at 7:09 a.m. went off without a hitch,
Eckles said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pac-3 missiles had successfully completed four missions prior to today's
test.
</P>
<P>
	   The missiles use kinetic energy, rather than an explosive warhead, to
destroy targets. They are designed to defend against tactical ballistic
missiles, cruise missiles and enemy aircraft.

   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate will vote soon on a constitutional amendment
to prevent crime victims from being hurt twice -- first by a criminal and then
by a justice system that fails to protect them, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said
today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless these victims' rights are in the same federal Constitution as the
defendant's rights, they will never be of the same legal status,'' Kyl said in
the weekly Republican radio address.
</P>
<P>
	   Proposals to amend the Constitution require approval by two-thirds of the
House and Senate, followed by ratification by three-fourths of the states. Few
such proposals survive the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyl said Arizona and 32 other states had passed protections for crime
victims, who under the Constitution have no right to be present at trial or to
be informed of hearings in their case. They also have no right to be heard at
sentencing or parole hearings, and they have no right to challenge delays in
their case.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed amendment would establish these rights and also ensure that
victims are notified of their assailant's release or escape from custody.
Victims would also be entitled to restitution from a convicted offender.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to victims rights, Kyl said the nation should follow Arizona's
lead by enacting a tax credit for teachers, who often have to pay for classroom
materials out of their own pockets. He said the average K-12 teacher spends more
than $400 in personal funds every year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Shouldn't every teacher in America be at least partially reimbursed for
these financial sacrifices for our nation's children?'' Kyl said. ``This isn't
the answer to all of our problems in education, but it's a start.''

<HEADLINE> IRA Remains Defiant on Disarmament  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Sounding defiant at a critical moment for
Northern Ireland's peace process, the Irish Republican Army warned today that it
would not start to disarm in response to Protestant or British government
demands.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's statement appeared to rule out even a token act of disarmament
before Friday, when the British government has pledged to withdraw powers from
the 12-member Cabinet in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement to RTE, Ireland's state broadcasters, the outlawed group said
arguments over when, if ever, the IRA should disarm ``can be resolved.'' But, it
stressed, ``this will not be on British or unionist terms nor will it be
advanced by British legislative threats.''
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the province's 1998 Good Friday peace accord, Britain transferred
some governmental control to a local power-sharing administration eight weeks
ago. But the British government plans to withdraw powers from the local Cabinet
-- which includes the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party -- unless the IRA makes clear
it will disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   The major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, has vowed to resign from
the province's Cabinet, forcing its collapse, unless powers are withdrawn in
protest at the IRA's refusal.
</P>
<P>
	   The British and Irish governments have been pressing Sinn Fein leaders in
public, and IRA figures in private, to clearly state the group's intention to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's statement fell short of that demand, seeking to sound positive while
offering no concrete assurances -- much like a previous statement Tuesday. Both
stressed the value of the group's 1997 cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   In the statement, the IRA emphasized its willingness to ``support efforts to
secure the resolution of the arms issue,'' but didn't directly say whether it
would begin scrapping its weapons dumps in cooperation with a disarmament
commission, as the Good Friday accord envisaged.
</P>
<P>
	   The group also sternly disputed others' expectations that its members should
have begun identifying its hidden arms dumps by now. The Good Friday accord
pledged that all parties would make their best efforts to achieve disarmament by
May, but the IRA was not a party to the accord -- Sinn Fein was.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA has never entered into any agreement, undertaking or understanding
at any time with any one on any aspect of decommissioning. We have not broken
our commitment or betrayed anyone,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who have once again made the political process conditional on the
decommissioning of silent IRA arms are responsible for creating the current
difficulties and keeping the political process in a state of perpetual crisis,''
the group said, concluding: ``The peace process is under no threat from the
IRA.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday accord anticipated that the IRA would completely disarm in
cooperation with an independent international commission. But the commission's
first detailed report -- presented Monday to the British and Irish governments
following two months of contacts with IRA leaders -- said no concrete progress
had been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Budget Bolsters Education  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mindful of his legacy and the fall elections, President
Clinton is proposing a $1.84 trillion budget Monday that would bolster education
and health care in fiscal 2001, cut taxes for the poor and help other Democratic
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's final spending blueprint envisions an activist government using
massive projected surpluses to boost dozens of programs while shoring up Social
Security and Medicare and paying down big portions of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   In an election year in which compromise is unlikely on most issues, the
budget all but dares Republicans to fight over schools, health and other areas
where Democrats traditionally enjoy strong public support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our budget is going to stand for the principles of fiscal discipline and
investing in the future,'' White House budget chief Jack Lew said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposal -- 2.5 percent more than the $1.79 trillion to be
spent this year -- is certain to hit rough waters in Congress, where Republicans
must sign off before a 2001 budget can be enacted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We won't let the agenda of a lame duck president in any way reduce our
commitment to smaller government, saving Social Security, paying down debt and
providing for tax fairness,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the
House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's package projects $746 billion in federal surpluses over the next
decade without counting Social Security's even larger balances, said
knowledgeable Democrats speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   That is less than half the $1.9 trillion the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office -- assuming much less spending than Clinton wants -- projected
last month as the surplus' best-case scenario. That means Clinton would leave
far less money available for the tax cuts wanted by many Republicans, among them
GOP presidential hopeful George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton would use much of the surplus to trim the accumulated $5.7 trillion
national debt, saying in the process that he will extend Medicare's solvency to
2025 and Social Security's to 2050, Democratic aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also would spend $168 billion over the next 10 years to create a
prescription drug benefit for the elderly, officials said, a popular idea that
Republicans ignored last year. They are now preparing their own version.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's plan, monthly premiums would start at $26 and rise to $51 by
2009, but be reduced or eliminated for many low-income people.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton would finance the program with $99 billion from the surplus and the
rest from savings extracted from hospitals and other Medicare participants, the
aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House already has released many other proposals, including tax
breaks to help families afford college and sick relatives' long-term care. The
president would spend billions to provide health insurance to the poor, combat
global warming and modernize schools, while boosting defense, farm subsidies and
anti-terrorism activities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He hearkened back to basic Democratic programs,'' Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., said in describing Clinton's remarks to Democratic senators Friday about
his priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Clinton ideas are sure to die or be watered down by Republicans, such
as a plan to expand the earned income tax credit for low-income families.
Already, Republicans are saying Clinton's budget does not cut taxes deeply
enough, should not raise other taxes and spends far too much money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's flavor of the day,'' Kasich said. ``Whatever any interest group
wants, the president is making a promise to them.''
</P>
<P>
	   In one coming clash, the president would let the one-third of the budget
that covers everything but automatically paid benefits like Social Security grow
annually at about the rate of inflation for a decade. Republicans would hold
such spending closer to this year's level of roughly $600 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever its reception, Clinton's budget can be seen as his fiscal farewell
address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no better way to understand what legacy a president wants to
leave in his final year than to look at his budget,'' said Mark Rozell, a
political scientist at Catholic University. ``Clearly, Clinton does not want to
go out with a whimper.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget could help Vice President Al Gore's presidential
aspirations by touting an agenda similar to his own on health care, the
environment and other issues. It might help congressional Democrats by focusing
budget combat on issues the party does well on, like Medicare and education.
</P>
<P>
	   The president would cut taxes by $350 billion over 10 years, largely for
low- and middle-income people. To defray the cost, Clinton would raise other
levies by $100 billion, including a 25-cent per pack boost in cigarette taxes
plus tobacco industry fines if teen smoking is not cut in half by 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also would:
</P>
<P>
	   --Eliminate the publicly held $3.7 trillion portion of the national debt by
2013. The remaining $2 trillion debt is money the government owes its own Social
Security and other trust funds. The total national debt stands at $5.7 trillion.
</P>
<P>
	   --Provide more money for housing vouchers for the poor, cleaner fuels,
biomedical research, military housing, anti-missile defense, gun safety and
uranium cleanups.

<HEADLINE> US Increases Role in Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United States stepped into a dispute between Israel
and the Palestinians on Saturday, amid hints from the Palestinians that the
crisis could suspend or even halt peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was meeting with officials from both sides to
try to bridge the gaps over the location of an Israeli withdrawal from 6.1
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, describing an ``unprecedented crisis,''
sent envoys to consult with officials in Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh told The Associated Press that the
Palestinian leadership's course of action will depend on the outcome of U.S.
mediation. He said Ross was to meet with Palestinian and Israeli officials
together later Saturday to hear the positions of each side.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross was then to report back to the U.S. administration, despite Israeli
complaints that it was up to the two sides to resolve the dispute directly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are round-the-clock consultations and efforts,'' Abourdeneh said.
``The next 24 hours are critical, after which we will assess what steps to take
next.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abourdeneh would not elaborate on the options being considered, but
Palestinian Cabinet Minister Ziad Abu Zayyad said the Palestinians would take
public opinion into account in deciding whether to continue talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For now, negotiations are our choice, but if Israel keeps dragging on the
peace process, we will go back to our people and ask what should be the
option,'' Abu Zayyad said. He would not specify what form the popular
consultation would take.
</P>
<P>
	   A summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Thursday
ended in sharp disagreement over the location of the West Bank territory Israel
is to hand over.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians want the land to include populated suburbs of Jerusalem, a
request that Israel rejected, saying it has the sole right to decide the
location of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israel also proposed including
another troop redeployment, the last under interim peace agreements, in a final
peace treaty slated for September. A framework agreement for that treaty is due
by Feb. 13, but the latest dispute made meeting that deadline unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jordan, Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo met with Foreign
Minister Abdul-Illah Khatib, who said Jordan would raise the Palestinian
concerns with Barak on Sunday when he visits Amman.

<HEADLINE> International Custody Fights on Rise  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In government parlance, Juan Gonzalez is a ``left
behind'' parent, fighting from afar to persuade U.S. officials to return his
son, Elian, to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of Americans are fighting similar battles, including more than
1,100 on the State Department list of active cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials believe the longer Elian's case drags on, the more difficult it
will be to help American parents seeking return of children taken overseas in
custody disputes.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, it has been 10 weeks since the 6-year-old boy was pulled from the
Atlantic Ocean after a shipwreck killed his mother as they neared Florida while
they were fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   One ``American Elian'' is Amanda Johnson. Her father, Thomas Johnson, a
State Department official, has spent $250,000 of his savings trying to
re-establish a relationship broken five years ago when she was taken to Sweden
by Johnson's former wife, a Swedish diplomat. His efforts have yielded but a
handful of brief supervised visits with her in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department, Johnson's employer for 20 years, has tried to help him
but with scant results, a common occurrence because governments often refuse to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Nationalization Service has ordered that Elian Gonzalez
be sent home, consistent with international law, but the boy's relatives in
Miami have taken the case to court. They and their supporters believe it would
be cruel to return him to a country not known for democratic liberties.
</P>
<P>
	   No resolution of the case is expected before next month.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, U.S. officials increasingly are anxious about the
implications for American parents who are victims of international
child-abduction cases.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the failure to implement the
INS decision could ``seriously jeopardize'' the department's efforts on behalf
of parents seeking the return of American children to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In a court brief filed in Elian's case, Mary Ryan, the department's top
consular affairs official, said, ``Because other countries carefully scrutinize
the practices of the United States, our credibility and effectiveness depend
upon our ability to adhere to the principles we espouse.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Nancy Hammer of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
wonders whether the Elian case will make a difference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United States has always been a leader on issues of child
protection,'' she said. ``Other countries do look to us for that leadership. On
the other hand, we haven't seen a lot of reciprocity from other governments.
Even if we do the right thing, there is no guarantee that this will inspire
others to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hammer said American parents are amazed at the amount of energy the U.S.
government has summoned in the Elian Gonzalez case on behalf of a foreign
father.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson agrees, asserting there is no comparable effort on behalf of
American parents in similar situations. ``If Elian's tragedy serves any good
purpose, it would be to point out that irony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As an outgrowth of the case, Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas, who heads a House
group on child abduction, will convene a day-long conference on the subject
Wednesday. Several parents of abducted children have been invited to attend.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Sylvester of Cincinnati, whose Austrian ex-wife fled the United States
for her homeland in 1995 with their daughter Carina, feels Elian should have
been back in Cuba with his father long ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is inappropriate to dilute the family values that we all talk about
with respect to the sacred relationship between parent and child,'' Sylvester
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Johnson and Sylvester have court orders affirming their rights to
custody arrangements with their daughters. But they say the State Department has
not done enough to press the Swedish and Austrian governments to enable them to
have more than intermittent, supervised visits with their daughters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't walk with my child in a park or buy her an ice cream cone,''
Sylvester said. ``I want to be a substantial part of my daughter's life. I am
outraged that we can't get the U.S. government to stand up for her rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress is unhappy about the situation as well. But three hearings on child
abduction in the past two years have come up with no serious suggestions as to a
remedy.

<HEADLINE> Haider Assures Austrians About Gov't  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Right-wing leader Joerg Haider told a deeply divided
Austrian public Saturday not to worry about international isolation, saying the
new governing coalition that includes his Freedom Party would soon prove its
democratic credentials to the world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no need for hysteria,'' Haider told the Austria Press Agency,
calling the European Union's action in freezing high-level contacts with the new
government ``irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's history of remarks against immigration and sympathetic to aspects
of Nazi rule led other nations to warn against his party's inclusion in the
government. Their warning ignored, the EU and Israel have resorted to diplomatic
reprisals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The EU will quickly get used to the fact that the Freedom Party now sits
in the Cabinet, which has good programs, expertise and good manners,'' Haider
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He blamed ``leftists who do not accept democratic decisions'' for the
violence that broke out Friday after the new coalition with the Austrian
People's Party took power.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 50 people, including 43 policemen and 13 demonstrators, were
injured in the clashes. Vienna was quiet Saturday, but hundreds of people
gathered in some of Austria's biggest provincial cities to demonstrate against
the Freedom Party's participation in the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider expressed confidence that ``good work and an aggressive information
policy'' would overcome hostility to his government.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety for statements praising Adolf Hitler's
``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of the Waffen SS as
``decent people of good character'' -- comments for which he has since
apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   The rise to power of Haider's far-right party has polarized a society with
dark memories of defeats in two world wars and an armed civil conflict between
leftists and rightists in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey of 500 Austrian voters taken Thursday by the OGM research institute
found that 43 percent opposed President Thomas Klestil's decision to swear in
the new coalition and 45 supported it. No margin of error was given, but the
institute described the breakdown as a statistical draw, the Austria Press
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   After the new government was sworn in Friday, the 14 other EU nations
reduced their diplomatic ties with Austria as threatened, canceling contracts
and official visits and freezing high-level contacts. U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Ambassador Kathryn Walt-Hall would leave for Washington
to report and then return to Vienna to monitor the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Austrian radio said Klestil conferred Saturday by telephone with Albright as
well as with Romano Prodi, president of the European Commission, and Portuguese
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, whose country now holds the rotating EU
presidency. Klestil ``updated Albright on the current situation'' and appealed
to Prodi and Guterres ``not to have Austria isolated by the European Union,''
the radio said.
</P>
<P>
	   With Austrian public sentiment still volatile, demonstrations took place in
Graz and Salzburg. Hundreds of protesters whistled their contempt and chanted
for resistance to the new government. No violent incidents were reported. Other
protests were planned for Bregenz and Steyr, the Austria Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, more than 150 anti-Freedom Party demonstrators chanted ``Never
Again'' outside Austria's embassy in Oslo, Norway on Saturday. Protesters
disbanded peacefully after an hour.

<HEADLINE> Abortion feuds not just among Republicans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Abortion feuds have been a Republican headache for
years, a divisive, in-party argument Democrats gladly watched. Now there's a
Democratic skirmish. Bill Bradley started it over Al Gore's dissembling on his
early record of opposition, long since changed to support abortion rights.
<P>
	   That's what put a sleepless vice president on the shuttle flight from New
York to Washington the other day. He was going to dramatize his commitment to a
woman's right to choose by standing by in case of a Senate tie on an
abortion-related amendment to a bankruptcy bill.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no tie to break; Republicans would not give Gore the opportunity,
so they did not force the anti-abortion issue on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bradley and Gore defend a woman's right to seek an abortion, just as
the Republican presidential candidates oppose abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP campaign disputes hinge on whose opposition is strongest and on
conservative demands that candidates pledge to nominate only abortion foes to
the Supreme Court. George Bush and John McCain will not commit to that litmus
test.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's challenge on the issue in the waning days of the New Hampshire
primary campaign forced Gore to concede that "my position has changed."
</P>
<P>
	   As a Tennessee congressman, he voted to include unborn children under civil
rights laws, and against the use of public funds for abortions for poor women.
Later, as a senator, he shifted to support of Medicaid coverage for abortions,
his position since.
</P>
<P>
	   He wrote a constituent in 1987 that "abortion is arguably the taking of a
human life," wording he said he would not use today.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley raised the abortion issue in a New Hampshire debate where Gore
insisted he always had been committed to abortion rights. Bradley told him that
was not true.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't. Gore's abortion rights support dates back 12 years.
</P>
<P>
	   So Gore gave him the opening and Bradley took it. "This is the kind of issue
you can't straddle," Bradley said in a campaign television ad. The ad also said
Bradley is the only candidate who has been "pro-choice for everyone all the
time."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Bradley was trying to manufacture a difference because their
positions now are identical. But it could surface again in Republican hands. A
GOP candidate against Gore can point to his conflicted position of the past when
the Democrats campaign on abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   That is what the Democrats did to former President George Bush, who tried to
brush past the issue in the opposite direction, as a one-time abortion rights
supporter who came later to Republican orthodoxy as an opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Steve Forbes already is on the case. "Clearly, Mr. Gore chose to
abandon his compassion for the unborn to climb the greasy pole of liberal
Democratic politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, fading in his second bid for the GOP nomination, has not always been
so ardent on the issue he now advertises as a major difference between him and
the GOP campaign leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not an issue on which you can straddle and wink and nod and hope
that people will give you a bye," he said in a New Hampshire campaign speech.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, Forbes said that while he opposed abortion, the country was not
ready to renounce it. He said then he would work to change that, while seeking
in the meantime to discourage abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   That is about where McCain and Bush stand now - opposed to abortion but
conceding there is not enough support to amend the Constitution. They both have
had problems on the issue, with conservatives bent on hardening the candidates'
positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither has made abortion part of his standard campaign speech, answering
questions but not pressing the issue. When it does come up, Bush makes a point
of saying Republicans should have room for people with differing opinions on the
issue. The ardent anti-abortion Republicans do not think so.
</P>
<P>
	   That is why it is a problem issue for Republican candidates who need to
court conservatives in the primaries without foreclosing the broader support it
takes to win a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
	   Disputes over the abortion plank have become a regular feature of Republican
national convention. The party platform advocates a constitutional amendment to
end legal abortion. GOP dissenters will debate it again this summer in
Philadelphia, and the plank will stay there, as it has since Ronald Reagan's
time.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic platform promises to defend abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Those lines will not change and the issue will not recede in importance
during the 2000 campaign for the White House: The next president's nominations
to an aging Supreme Court could determine whether a majority there upholds or
reopens the abortion question.

<HEADLINE> First coastwide restrictions on horseshoe crab catch considered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - Horseshoe crabs are evolutionary wonders that
have survived for hundreds of millions of years, but they have been considered
the junk of the sea for much of human history.
<P>
	   They were ground for fertilizer from the 1800s through the 1960s and are now
used as bait by conch fishermen.
</P>
<P>
	   But the horseshoe crab is getting some attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities are considering regulations that would limit their catch
along the Atlantic coast, from Florida to Maine. Fishermen, conservationists and
representatives of the biomedical industry are watching closely.
</P>
<P>
	   Conch fishermen use horseshoe crabs for bait, impaling them on spikes in
their traps, and worry that restrictions could hurt their industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservationists worry horseshoe crabs are being overfished and their
population will plunge, which would in turn cause a decline in the migrating
shorebirds that rely on the crabs' eggs for food. The medical industry, which
uses horseshoe crab blood for certain tests, also wants to curtail the harvest
of crabs for bait.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is weighing the arguments as
it prepares to vote Wednesday in Alexandria for the first coastwide cap on the
crab harvest.
</P>
<P>
	   States would have to devise methods to cut their catch and compile data
needed to assess the health of the species.
</P>
<P>
	   "Until recently, horseshoe crabs were considered a nuisance, an ugly
critter, so nobody was collecting data on them," said Tom O'Connell, coordinator
for the crab management plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission may impose a plan that cuts
the crab harvest by about 25 percent - a compromise between the demands of
fishermen and conservationists, O'Connell said. It's a touchy issue because
either side could sue if unhappy with the outcome, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A coastwide plan is needed because the trawlers that scoop up horseshoe
crabs by the thousands simply avoid the few states that have imposed
regulations. The crabs cannot be unloaded in Delaware and New Jersey and are
restricted in Maryland, so the bait industry has shifted to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   "Virginia is the loophole state," said Gerald Winegrad of the American Bird
Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservancy would like to end the harvest but hopes for a 50 percent
reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question that shorebirds are in decline because of the horseshoe
crab harvest," Winegrad said. "It's an utter waste of a resource."
</P>
<P>
	   Horseshoe crab eggs that smear Delaware Bay beaches and other coastal points
during spawning season are a primary food source for some migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
	   One species of sandpiper flies nonstop from Brazil to Delaware Bay to fuel
up on the "green caviar" before heading to the Arctic to breed, Winegrad said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fishermen say they can live with a 25 percent reduction in the horseshoe
crab catch but contest the argument that the horseshoe population is suffering.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really unfair to characterize this as a fishery in decline," said Rick
Robins of Chesapeake Bay Packing in Newport News, the largest exporter of conch
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The company exports about $3 million in conch meat annually, mostly to
China, and horseshoe crabs are the most effective bait, he said. Virginia has
about 50 conch boats and the state exports about 80 percent of conch caught in
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't have any alternative bait sources," Robins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others say conch fishermen could cut their bait use in half by putting it in
mesh sacks. Some Virginia conch fishermen have begun using bait sacks as part of
a pilot program.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years the medical industry has found horseshoe crab blood a
valuable tool in medical experiments. Blood is extracted and shipped to labs and
then the crabs are released.
</P>
<P>
	   Horseshoe crabs have no claws and resemble horror movie aliens because of
their multiple legs, pointed tail and round, helmet-like shell. They live 20
years or more and it takes females 10 years to reach sexual maturity.
</P>
<P>
	   Their slow sexual maturity means it could take years for their population to
bounce back if overfished.

<HEADLINE> Not all inspection woes tied to emissions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - For months, politicians and state officials have
said the federal government's insistence on installing a tougher auto emissions
test is a key reason for New Jersey's long lines at centralized auto inspection
centers.
<P>
	   Federal officials did want the state to make good on a long-stalled promise
to test for asthma-causing smog compounds, and threatened the loss of highway
aid for not complying. And private contractor Parsons Infrastructure and
Technology had problems with new emissions equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   But not all of New Jersey's inspection problems are directly tied to the
federal government's auto emissions mandate.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials also installed a revamped safety inspection with the
emissions test. The new safety inspections, not required by the federal
government, have posed some problems, including early troubles with a new brake
test.
</P>
<P>
	   Division of Motor Vehicles director Richard Kamin says the key "choke point"
clogging the inspection process is a computer system designed to gather
information about cars in order to determine how tough an emissions test is
required. Parsons says the state ignored its request to delay implementing the
inspection program to work out the computer software. State officials say
Parsons vowed the system would operate smoothly.
</P>
<P>
	   But getting the computer system to work isn't the only problem. Time on the
lines is also being lost because of how much information technicians must type
into the computers - some related to emissions, some not.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials and Parsons are looking into ways to reduce technicians'
time at the keyboard. Officials say they're also trying to streamline a process
where technicians now have nearly 500 different choices to describe why a car is
flunking because of safety violations or improper paperwork.
</P>
<P>
	   Parsons and DMV must clear up these problems by June 30, when New Jersey
could once again face sanctions from the federal government. Gov. Christie
Whitman last week suspended the tougher emissions test and the more involved
computer system at the 15 most troublesome inspection stations to buy time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we're on the same page on this," said Kamin. "They're telling us
it's a relatively easy fix, not a show-stopper. We're confident we can get it
fixed."
</P>
<P>
	   While the emissions test - called a dynamometer - gains much of the
attention, it is just one part of an entirely new inspection process. State
officials also instituted a new brake test, and installed a third test designed
to test a car's suspension. The more involved safety inspections take longer
than the old safety tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Installation of the new safety equipment cost about $7.5 million in the
state inspection facilities, about half the cost of the new emissions equipment,
according to Carl Golden, spokesman for Parsons. It also figures into the cost
of inspections. Parsons signed a seven-year, $400 million contract to operate
the centralized lanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Kamin said the state had long wanted to replace the old brake test. When the
contract with Parsons was designed after a decade-long debate over emissions,
new safety testing was part of the requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   "The old brake test, that stuff was made in the 1930s," Kamin said. "Brakes
have changed. It was time for an upgrade."
</P>
<P>
	   Some familiar with the process privately said state officials wanted to
toughen the safety inspection process in response to garage owner complaints
that moving from an annual inspection to an inspection every two years
compromises motorist safety. State officials deny this but they rejected a
suggestion to install safety inspections once a year, and test for emissions
once every two years.
</P>
<P>
	   "You wonder if this does anything for safety," said Assemblyman Neil Cohen,
D-Union, a critic of the new inspection process. "Going to once every two years
for inspections was a political gesture, but you still run the risk of having
safety problems possibly go undetected for a longer period of time. And this has
nothing to do with what the EPA ordered."
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Mears, spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, said the
federal government did not mandate upgrades to the safety tests but EPA "is not
discouraging safety inspections."
</P>
<P>
	   The new safety test also gives technicians a new computer menu to choose
from when there are problems. It's quite an offering: nearly 500 categories,
including 37 different ways to describe what's wrong with brakes, 14 different
categories for bad insurance cards, and 20 different ways to list window woes.
This menu is accessed for at least one in five cars, based on the safety and
paperwork failure rate.
</P>
<P>
	   The old system had far more general categories on punch cards.
</P>
<P>
	   Kamin said Parsons needs to improve how it organizes the categories. He said
the firm wanted more choices "because they didn't want to make judgment calls.
They wanted to automate, and we wanted to automate."
</P>
<P>
	   Golden said Parsons was following state orders.
</P>
<P>
	   "Parsons took the lead in trying to get that stuff reduced," Golden said.
"This document of 400, 500 items was given to Parsons by the state and they said
this is data they want analyzed."
</P>
<P>
	   When asked why there are 20 categories for windshield problems, Kamin said
officials are attempting to trim the list.
</P>
<P>
	   The DMV director stressed the biggest time problem in the system is with
gathering information to be fed to the emissions test. Officials say the actual
dynamometer only takes a few minutes longer than the old tailpipe test. Problems
with computers gum up the works.
</P>
<P>
	   Kamin said all kinds of things needs to be entered into the computers,
including the make, model, and year of the car, the vehicle identification
numbers, engine sizes, license plate numbers, and insurance information.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of this is related to emissions requirements. For example, a 1986 car
is not tested to the same emissions standard as a 1999 car. Thus, the computer
needs to be told what kind of car is being tested so the dynamometer can decide
how stringent a test it will perform. This information is collected in a
database to help New Jersey prove it is performing an accurate test - and gain
credits from the EPA to help meet Clean Air Act goals.
</P>
<P>
	   Kamin said this data collection process is too slow. Bar codes on
registrations - where technicians swipe the document much like items are swiped
at a grocery story to grab information - don't always work.
</P>
<P>
	   When this happens, information needs to be typed in. Kamin said some of this
information is lost by the time the car is ready for the emissions test -
forcing technicians to go through the whole process again. Parsons is attempting
to find the gremlins robbing the data, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kamin said time is also lost because the emissions test is taking too long
to rid itself of the fumes from each car. This is like a cola taste test, where
you drink a Coke, eat some crackers to clear your palate, and then drink a
Pepsi. Right now the emissions test isn't automatically clearing its palate
after each test, preferring to wait until a new car arrives. Changing this could
shave about three minutes off each test, Kamin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some garage owners stress time is lost simply because of the way computers
are configured.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of it is redundant," said James T. Kenney, a Trenton garage owner.
"The reason it takes so long is that you have to enter it twice, sometimes three
times, to verify things. You're doing three screens when you can do one. It can
be streamlined."

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Year Has Rocky Start  </HEADLINE>
   By KARIN LAUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- For what was supposed to be the year of Mideast peace,
with promises of Israeli pacts with Syria and Palestinians and an end to battles
in Lebanon, it's been a rocky start.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's talks with Syria are frozen, negotiations with the Palestinians are
bogged down and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who needs broad support at
home to give up land to old enemies, has seen his approval rating drop over a
campaign financing scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   At first glance, it looks like an across-the-board failure for Barak, who
promised peace with Syria within months, an end to Israel's bloody guerrilla war
in Lebanon by July and a treaty with the Palestinians by September.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, many in Israel believe their prime minister, known for his sharp
analytical skills, is proceeding according to a hidden strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Most agree Barak prefers to settle first with the Syrians. The outlines of
an agreement have long been apparent -- a return of the Golan Heights in
exchange for security guarantees for Israel and normalization of relations.
Peace in Lebanon would follow any agreement with Syria, which controls its
neighbor's military, politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Barak has locked onto the Syrian track like a laser beam. It's a clean
deal that's doable,'' says Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United
Nations. ``The Palestinian track is murky, with issues that are very difficult
to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ever since Israeli-Syrian talks resumed in December, after a four-year
hiatus, Barak has made little effort to hide his preference, and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat is deeply worried about being sidelined, even though
Israeli-Syrian contacts broke off in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension appears temporary.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is working hard to get talks resumed, and Barak last week
sent a senior negotiator, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the tourism minister and a former
army chief, to a secret meeting with Syrian officials in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian President Hafez Assad assured the Israeli envoy he is interested in
returning to the talks, the Haaretz daily said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The low point in Israeli-Palestinian talks came Thursday when Arafat angrily
walked out of a meeting with Barak, ostensibly over Israel's refusal to hand
over Jerusalem suburbs in the West Bank in a partial troop pullback due next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   But the relatively minor issue was simply the most immediate one Arafat
could lock on to. His advisers complained that Israel has not been fully engaged
in negotiations on the terms of Palestinian statehood, despite a pressing Feb.
13 deadline for a peace treaty outline.
</P>
<P>
	   If Barak is indeed playing for time to cut a deal with Syria first, he may
eventually have to pay a higher price for a treaty with the Palestinians, says
Menachem Klein, a political scientist at Bar Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israeli withdrawal from all of the Golan Heights, the apparent price of
peace with Syria, would reinforce the expectation that Israel is ready to hand
back all the land it captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Under such circumstances,
it would be very difficult for Arafat to accept a lesser deal in the West Bank,
Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, Klein says.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, a deal with the Palestinians is key to ending the broader Israeli-Arab
and Muslim-Jewish conflicts whose heart is Jerusalem, a city sacred to Judaism,
Islam and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan will convince Saudi
Arabia to send an ambassador to Tel Aviv,'' Klein says.
</P>
<P>
	   Others, however, believe Arafat is procrastinating just as much as Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   Ehud Yaari, Israel TV's political analyst, says the Palestinian leader is
very apprehensive about making any concessions on Jerusalem or the fate of the
millions of Palestinian refugees now scattered across the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wants a state without ending the conflict,'' Yaari says. ``He does not
want to be the undertaker (who buries) Palestinian rights.''

<HEADLINE> No-stakes, no-frills contest where volunteers buy own buttons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - Delaware Democrats chose between Al Gore and
Bill Bradley on Saturday in a no-stakes presidential primary so neglected by
both sides that volunteers had to buy their own campaign buttons.
<P>
	   The two national campaigns said they would get serious when Delaware does
and begins choosing its presidential nominating delegates in party caucuses late
next month. By then, after the major state primaries the first two weeks in
March, the race could be settled anyhow.
</P>
<P>
	   The primary was scheduled near the start of the campaign season in an effort
to gain influence in the nominating contest, but Democrats could not select
their 22 delegates this soon without violating party rules.
</P>
<P>
	   So the primary was a popularity vote, a state-run straw poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Gore nor Bradley made a stop in Delaware, and the volunteers who did
what campaigning there was did it without national help. The candidates had said
they would stay away, wary of friction with New Hampshire, when the leadoff
primary state was defending its status against calendar encroachment.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore won the opening Democratic contests, swamping Bradley in the Iowa
caucuses and beating him 52 percent to 47 percent in the New Hampshire primary
Tuesday. Under Democratic rules, only those starting-point states could choose
delegates before March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans have no such restriction. Gov. George W. Bush and Steve
Forbes are campaigning for Delaware's GOP primary on Tuesday. Sen. John McCain,
the big winner in New Hampshire, skipped it to aim at later targets.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a conflict with New Hampshire, which demands a full week to itself,
the Republicans opted out of the state-run primary on Saturday to vote in one of
their own three days later. The contest offers 12 nominating votes, a pittance
in the national campaign, but a stake to go with the win-lose rating Delaware
will deliver.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' self-financed campaign has been shaken by defeat in Iowa and a
far-back third place in New Hampshire. He rolled around the second smallest
state on a bus tour, saying the McCain victory in New Hampshire proved there
would be no coronation of Bush. "There's nothing inevitable now," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaigned in Dover on Thursday and planned to return Monday. He
criticized the absent McCain, saying, "You don't see me skipping anything," he
said. McCain's strategy is to concentrate on campaigning for South Carolina
primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley flew from New Hampshire into what they both see as a
national campaign now, both with stops in New York and then California before
their weekend break.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley did seek support one state away, in College Park, Md., on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Gore stands for the old politics, for a win-by-any means kind of
campaigning. "It's relentlessly negative, attack a day, charge a day," he told
about 500 people at the University of Maryland. Then he flew home to New Jersey
for a brief break.
</P>
<P>
	   Benjamin J. Matwey of Wilmington, volunteer campaign chief for Bradley in
Delaware, said his operation was on its own, short of money, and lacking even
for literature to pass out to potential voters. He said his workers paid for
their own "Bradley 2000" buttons, and he brought back some campaign flyers after
a stint in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The volunteer chairman for Gore, Chris Coons, said it was hard to organize
for the primary without support, not even a wink or a nod, from the national
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Delaware primary left its imprint on the 2000 campaign. Because
the state tried to get in early, New Hampshire moved up its date and held the
earliest primary ever. That lead Iowa to move, up, too, so the voting began
earlier than ever before.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Calls for More Defense Money  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen told European allies on
Saturday they must spend more and make a sustained political commitment in order
to achieve their goal of closing the technological gap with U.S. military
forces.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You cannot continue to cut budgets,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to the Munich Conference on Security Policy, Cohen used NATO's
war over Kosovo as an illustration of that gap. He said the United States flew
half of all the combat missions and two-thirds of all air support missions
during the 78-day war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You cannot have a situation in which one country bears a disproportionate
burden,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Echoing that sentiment was Lord Robertson, the former British defense
minister who now is NATO's secretary general.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is neither fair nor politically sustainable to ask the United States to
continue to assume a disproportionate share of the costs and the burdens of
addressing security challenges in Europe,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said the Clinton administration supports the Europeans' new push for a
common defense policy but wonders whether the individual European governments
are prepared to spend the money it will take to achieve this.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My fear is that we will see European nations constructing a new
bureaucracy'' without achieving truly integrated military forces, he told the
gathering of international diplomats, military officers and defense leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen noted that many European governments have said for years they wanted
to modernize their militaries, but have been satisfied instead to let the United
States take the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My question is, `Where are the resources to match the rhetoric?''' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Munich conference also examined ``lessons learned'' from the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said
he worried that the problems now dogging the U.N.'s efforts to rebuild Kosovo --
most notably a failure by many NATO countries to provide the civilian police
that they had promised -- could undermine NATO solidarity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The unity we forged in combat in Kosovo must not be lost now in keeping
the peace there,'' said Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union party of
Germany and a member of parliament, said the Kosovo experience showed the
importance of Russia in European security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia will continue to be a difficult partner for the foreseeable
future,'' Schauble said. ``But when European security is at stake, there is no
alternative to Russia's diplomatic integration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen used the Munich forum to make a pitch for the Pentagon's national
missile defense project, which seeks to develop a network of radars and missile
interceptors that could defend all 50 U.S. states against a limited attack by
ballistic missiles. Cohen noted that some Europeans are cool to the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You should really look at the facts'' regarding the potential threat of
long-range missile attacks on the United States -- and possibly also Europe --
from such hostile nations as Iraq, North Korea, Iran and Libya, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a written statement submitted to the conference, Cohen said the United
States believes that in the next five to 10 years, those hostile nations will be
able to ``hold all of NATO at risk with the missile forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the United States, we have concluded that we cannot wait to begin to
deal with this threat until we are in the midst of a crisis in which one of
these rogue states attempts to blackmail the United States from carrying out its
alliance obligations and protecting its interests,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   During a break in the conference, Cohen and British Defense Minister
Geoffrey Hoon signed a ``declaration of principles'' meant to establish the
basis for improving U.S.-British cooperation in defense trade. Washington is
working on similar arrangements with France, Germany and Australia.

<HEADLINE> Russia Bombs Chechen Villages  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALKHAN-KALA, Russia (AP) -- Going after rebels who broke out of the Chechen
capital, Russian forces bombed and shelled Chechnya's western villages Saturday
in an assault residents said was largely causing civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Militants say many of the 3,000 rebels who have filtered through the Russian
blockade of Grozny since Monday are moving south, toward the breakaway
republic's rugged mountains, where thousands of their comrades are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
	   However, some of the injured and exhausted rebels stayed behind in muddy,
rubble-strewn villages in western Chechnya, stumbling into civilians' homes and
saying they needed to rest, residents said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian forces tried to close in on the scattered groups, surrounding some
villages with convoys and hammering them with shells and bombs. Fierce air and
artillery attacks hit the villages of Zakan-Yurt, Lermontovo, Katyr-Yurt,
Valerik and Gekhi on Saturday, Chechen field commander Akhmed Basnukayev said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian military claimed Saturday that more than 600 rebels were still
holed up in Zakan-Yurt, Alkhan-Yurt and Alkhan-Kala.
</P>
<P>
	   But refugees from the villages said most rebels had already broken through
Russian lines and fled, and that only injured fighters remained.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops who entered the village of Samashki on Friday after an
intense round of bombing and shelling found streets littered with the bodies of
dead civilians, said a refugee from there, Aset Gairbiyeva.
</P>
<P>
	   Soldiers loaded the bodies on trucks and carried them away, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The few rebels still hiding in the embattled villages did not return the
Russians' fire, residents said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian military said larger groups of rebels were still roaming western
Chechnya and clashing with federal troops. The military said up to 1,000 rebels
attacked Russian troops near Katyr-Yurt on Saturday, killing three officers,
injuring six, and forcing the rest to flee, according to Russian news reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian command also said militants tried to break into the Russian
region of Ingushetia on Chechnya's western border.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Only small groups of rebels remained in Grozny. Russian artillery fired at
the city at long intervals Saturday -- a sharp contrast to the relentless
shelling of previous days.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops were advancing further into the city Saturday, but despite
the constant rattle of automatic rifles, Russian commanders conceded there was
no major rebel resistance. Mined buildings were the main obstacle to the Russian
advance.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels insist their retreat from Grozny strengthened their position by
freeing them from the Russian blockade and allowing them more mobility to wage a
guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians claim that the rebels' exodus, and the death of several Chechen
commanders in a minefield, signals that federal forces now have the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
	   The deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov,
said on Russia's NTV television Saturday that as soon as federal troops seize
Grozny, the main Russian forces will head to Chechnya's southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian airplanes were dropping fliers over the mountains Saturday, urging
the militants to surrender, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops entered Chechnya in September after an invasion by
Chechen-based militants into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan, and
deadly apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that were blamed on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Year Has Rocky Start  </HEADLINE>
   By KARIN LAUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- For what was supposed to be the year of Mideast peace,
with promises of Israeli pacts with Syria and Palestinians and an end to battles
in Lebanon, it's been a rocky start.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's talks with Syria are frozen, negotiations with the Palestinians are
bogged down and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who needs broad support at
home to give up land to old enemies, has seen his approval rating drop over a
campaign financing scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   At first glance, it looks like an across-the-board failure for Barak, who
promised peace with Syria within months, an end to Israel's bloody guerrilla war
in Lebanon by July and a treaty with the Palestinians by September.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, many in Israel believe their prime minister, known for his sharp
analytical skills, is proceeding according to a hidden strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Most agree Barak prefers to settle first with the Syrians. The outlines of
an agreement have long been apparent -- a return of the Golan Heights in
exchange for security guarantees for Israel and normalization of relations.
Peace in Lebanon would follow any agreement with Syria, which controls its
neighbor's military, politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Barak has locked onto the Syrian track like a laser beam. It's a clean
deal that's doable,'' says Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United
Nations. ``The Palestinian track is murky, with issues that are very difficult
to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ever since Israeli-Syrian talks resumed in December, after a four-year
hiatus, Barak has made little effort to hide his preference, and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat is deeply worried about being sidelined, even though
Israeli-Syrian contacts broke off in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension appears temporary.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is working hard to get talks resumed, and Barak last week
sent a senior negotiator, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the tourism minister and a former
army chief, to a secret meeting with Syrian officials in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian President Hafez Assad assured the Israeli envoy he is interested in
returning to the talks, the Haaretz daily said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The low point in Israeli-Palestinian talks came Thursday when Arafat angrily
walked out of a meeting with Barak, ostensibly over Israel's refusal to hand
over Jerusalem suburbs in the West Bank in a partial troop pullback due next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   But the relatively minor issue was simply the most immediate one Arafat
could lock on to. His advisers complained that Israel has not been fully engaged
in negotiations on the terms of Palestinian statehood, despite a pressing Feb.
13 deadline for a peace treaty outline.
</P>
<P>
	   If Barak is indeed playing for time to cut a deal with Syria first, he may
eventually have to pay a higher price for a treaty with the Palestinians, warned
former Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Laureate Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be very difficult to make a deal with the Palestinians after the
Syrians,'' said Peres, a government minister who is not part of Barak's
peacemaking team. A complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan -- the expected
price of peace with Syria -- would reinforce the expectation that Israel should
hand back all the land it captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the end, Jordan, Egypt, Syria -- everyone will have gotten
everything,'' Peres said. It would then be difficult for Arafat to accept a
lesser deal in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A deal with the Palestinians is also key to ending the broader Israeli-Arab
and Muslim-Jewish conflicts whose heart is Jerusalem, a city sacred to Judaism,
Islam and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without the Palestinians, there won't be peace in the Middle East,'' Peres
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others, however, believe Arafat is procrastinating just as much as Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   Ehud Yaari, Israel TV's political analyst, says the Palestinian leader is
very apprehensive about making any concessions on Jerusalem or the fate of the
millions of Palestinian refugees now scattered across the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wants a state without ending the conflict,'' Yaari says. ``He does not
want to be the undertaker (who buries) Palestinian rights.''

<HEADLINE> French, Albanians Clash in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- French peacekeepers clashed with
ethnic Albanians in northwestern Kosovo on Saturday, using clubs and tear gas to
force back hundreds who tried to push their way across a bridge to the
Serb-controlled side of a divided town.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second straight day of confrontations between peacekeeping troops
and ethnic Albanians in Kosovska Mitrovica, and the fourth day of violence since
a rocket attack on a U.N. bus killed two elderly Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-six people, including six French soldiers, were injured in Saturday's
clash. Ethnic Albanian doctors said one boy suffered a gunshot wound, possibly
from a sniper on the Serb side of the Ibar River that divides the city. Five
soldiers were injured in a similar clash Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, two ethnic Albanians wounded earlier this week died, raising the
death toll from the violence to 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest clash broke out after hundreds of ethnic Albanians gathered at
the bridge, first taunting French troops, then throwing stones. As the crowd
surged forward, the French responded with tear gas, stun grenades and
nightsticks to drive the protesters back.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO-led peacekeepers were struggling to restore order in Kosovo's most
multiethnic -- and most ethnically troubled -- city. A German unit was sent to
reinforce the French if the crowd tries to cross the bridge again.
</P>
<P>
	   About 9,000 Serbs control the north bank and 90,000 ethnic Albanians live on
the south side of the town, 30 miles north of the province's capital, Pristina.
The bridge separates the sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Tensions escalated sharply after the Wednesday rocket attack on the bus,
part of a U.N. service to ferry Serbs through predominantly ethnic Albanian
areas of the province. In apparent retaliation, two ethnic Albanian men were
shot to death Thursday night in the Serb-controlled section of Kosovska
Mitrovica. Shortly afterward, grenades were hurled at two Serb cafes, injuring
up to 25 Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest of the dead were killed in a series of clashes and shootings that
swept the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the province, violence was on the rise. Serbian media reported
an elderly Serb was shot dead late Friday by a masked gunman in the
American-controlled town of Gnjilane.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the presence of NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo, violence is still
common. Ethnic Albanians often attack Serbs as revenge for the 18-month
crackdown Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched against separatists in
the province.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's ultranationalist information minister, Aleksandar
Vucic, blamed the United Nations and NATO for the recent bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They allow the (ethnic) Albanians to kill the Serbs just because of their
ethnicity,'' Vucic said.
</P>
<P>
	   The leader of the Serb community here, Oliver Ivanovic, called for a Serb
protest rally Monday. Ivanovic said he told the NATO and U.N. missions after the
bus attack that it was still possible to prevent an escalation of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But after the first grenade was thrown into the Serb cafe, there was no
force that could stop the masses,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> US, Namibia OK Aviation Treaty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has reached agreement with Namibia on an
aviation treaty that opens the way for unrestricted commercial air service
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``open skies'' agreement, following two days of meetings in Windhoek,
Namibia, was signed Friday by F.W. Poolman, Namibia's under secretary for
transportation, and Thomas J. White, acting deputy assistant secretary of state
for transportation affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although Namibia is a developing country, it has a strong economy, a
well-maintained domestic transportation infrastructure and abundant natural
attractions and resources,'' White said in a statement. ``It could become an
attractive option for American tourists and business in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Namibia, which gained independence in 1990, is a sparsely populated nation
of less than 2 million people in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Air Namibia, the country's national carrier, has expressed interest in
joining with a major international carrier to provide service to the United
States. One U.S. carrier, United Airlines, already offers some service to
Namibia via Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   An open skies agreement allows unrestricted air service by airlines of both
countries, eliminating restrictions on how often carriers can fly, the kind of
aircraft they use and the prices they can charge.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has 42 such agreements with partners in Africa, Asia, the
Pacific, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> James Coburn Stars in TV Drama  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB THOMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- According to legend, an Academy Award is supposed to
bring an actor a wealth of movie roles to choose from and riches beyond measure.
Not in the case of James Coburn.
</P>
<P>
	   Last March, the veteran actor was selected best supporting actor of 1998 for
his performance as Nick Nolte's vitriolic father in "Affliction."
</P>
<P>
	   "And I haven't made a movie since," Coburn comments with a baritone chuckle.
"I changed agents: I'm with CAA now. But that hasn't made a difference yet."
</P>
<P>
	   It's not that he didn't have scripts offered to him. But the roles were "a
lot of nasty old guys," he said, and he'd been there with "Affliction" -- and
also with "Payback," a Mel Gibson film made before "Affliction," in which he has
an unbilled cameo as a not-so-nice guy. His only other exposure on the big
screen was a cameo in "Shake, Rattle and Roll," which he did at the request of
his pal James Garner, who had to drop out because of a schedule conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Coburn is making up for lost time with the starring role in "Missing
Pieces," a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation on NBC Sunday, Feb. 6, at 9 p.m.
EST. He plays a Colorado rancher who receives news that his son (Paul Kersey)
has died in a small town in Mexico under ambiguous circumstances. Coburn goes
there in an attempt to unravel the mystery.
</P>
<P>
	   You would expect "Missing Pieces" to be filmed in Mexico, or even Vancouver
or Toronto, like most TV movies. But no, this one was shot in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of places in Santa Barbara that can be made to look like
the Yucatan, which is where the story takes place," Coburn explained.
</P>
<P>
	   It sounded like an actor's dream: a location two hours from home. But
wearing tropical clothes in the cold night shooting led to a severe sinus
infection. "I got all bloated up; in some scenes I looked like Santa Claus," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Then came the Academy nomination, which meant that he had to make a presence
in Hollywood every weekend to bolster his chances -- it's the sort of thing
nominees are expected to do.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you're nominated for an Oscar, you have to go to all the various
affairs," he recalled. "You're nominated for a Golden Globe, so you go there. I
presented something at the Directors Guild. The Writers Guild, the Actors Guild,
Independent Spirit Award.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never had a chance to rest. I'd finish shooting in Santa Barbara, come
back and do something Friday night, things on Saturday and Sunday, interviews in
between. Then I drove back to Santa Barbara on Sunday night. I didn't have a
chance to lie down."
</P>
<P>
	   Coburn, 71, was born in Laurel, Neb. He studied acting at Los Angeles
colleges and with Stella Adler in New York City and made his movie debut in
"High Lonesome" in 1959. He played sidekicks and villains until the late 1960s
when he cashed in on the James Bond mania with "Our Man Flint" and "In Like
Flint."
</P>
<P>
	   He enjoyed a busy career as a character actor until the 1980s when he
suffered from a painful, disabling arthritis. He did little work for 10 years
until he treated himself with pills with a sulfur base. His knuckles remain
gnarled, but he says the pain is gone.
</P>
<P>
	   Coburn and his wife Paula live in the upper Beverly Hills in what was best
described by awestruck director Mark Rydell: "This is a movie star's house!"
</P>
<P>
	   The place occupies five stories on a narrow, dead-end street lined with what
might be described as middle-class houses. The Coburns' house looks like Old
Hollywood, but it isn't. A contractor built it in 1989, then ran out of money in
the falling market.
</P>
<P>
	   "We picked it up for a song," said Coburn happily. "The house was about
two-thirds complete. It looked good, but the doors were made out of green
lumber, and they were bowing and bending. We had to fix all that. Then we put
$500,000 into furnishing."
</P>
<P>
	   The result contains just about everything you might need for comfortable
living: a three-car garage, massive library, gym, a catchall room full of Asian
objects including a $20,000 Chinese wedding bed, formal dining room, offices,
television room and ballroom. The Coburns were hosts of a dance over the
holidays, and their movie friends tangoed and cha Chad past midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   With such a palace to maintain, you'd think the actor would be more
concerned about working. Instead, he and his wife were leaving for a Caribbean
cruise.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been reading a lot of stuff," he remarked. "I want to go to work. It's
what I do best; it's the only thing I can really do.
</P>
<P>
	   "Actors are boring when they're not working. It's a natural condition,
because they don't have anything to do. They just lay around, and that's why so
many of them get drunk. They really get to be boring people. My wife will attest
to that."
</P>
<P>
	   A hearty laugh.

<HEADLINE> Detained Tanker Heads to Oman  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- A Russian tanker detained in the Gulf of Oman on
suspicion of carrying Iraqi oil ignored U.S. Navy demands that it stop, so armed
Navy SEALs were dispatched by helicopter to board and seize the vessel, a
Pentagon official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Bacon, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen,
confirmed a published report that a team of 10 commandos descended ropes from a
helicopter hovering above the suspect tanker.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials have said the Russian crew offered no resistance to being
boarded Wednesday and cooperated with U.S. Navy personnel involved. In
Washington, a senior State Department official said again Saturday: ``It was not
a hostile boarding. It was not contested. It went smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon, in Germany with Cohen for a European security conference, said that
when the guided missile cruiser USS Monterey signaled for the Volga-Neft-147 to
halt, the Russian tanker kept going. In line with standard procedure for
maritime interception operations, he said, the commandos were then dispatched by
helicopter to ``fast rope'' aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the SEALs got on board, Bacon said, the Russian crew cooperated, and no
shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
	   The spokesman also confirmed a report in The Washington Times that the SEALs
determined from the ship's logs and other documents that it had taken on its
cargo from a terminal in Iraqi waters. The Russians have consistently insisted
the oil is Iranian and therefore not taken on in violation of a U.N. embargo
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon would not discuss some other aspects of the Times' account, including
its report that the Navy ``back-read'' the Russian vessel's Global Positioning
System satellite navigation records to determine that it had been at the Iraqi
terminal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times reported that the Navy SEALs got conflicting stories from the
tanker's crew about where they had been. The crew also had erased navigation
charts to cover their tracks, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times also said a Pentagon official, not identified in the story, said
overhead intelligence photos had captured the Volga-Neft and another Russian
ship, the Afat, taking on oil in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   The tanker was being escorted Saturday to a port in Oman, although the
Russian government has demanded that it be released. U.S. officials said if the
oil is proved to have been obtained in Iraq, the cargo will be confiscated and
sold, a portion of the proceeds used to pay for the U.N. sanctions monitoring
operation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Cancer Coverage  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed helping states eliminate the
barriers poor women face in fighting breast or cervical cancer, saying Saturday
he wants them to have access to the ``medical miracles of our time.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his weekly radio address, Clinton proposed a $220 million, five-year
program, to allow state to provide full Medicaid benefits to women whose cancers
are detected through federally funded screening programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Too often uninsured women face a patchwork of care, inadequate care or no
care at all,'' the president. ``Many are denied new or better forms of
treatment, or wait months to see a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This initiative will help women get comprehensive treatment and get it
right away,'' he said. ``It will make state-of-the-art therapies available to
women who need them, not just those who can afford them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said breast and cervical cancer can be cured if caught early and
treated aggressively. But he said that of the 180,000 women diagnosed with such
cancers each year, more than 40,000 die.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, an estimated 2 million women will be diagnosed with either breast
or cervical cancer this decade, and about 500,000 will die from the diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At a time when we know more about cancer than ever and can fight it better
than ever, we must not leave women to face cancer alone,'' Clinton said.
``Together, we can save lives and bring medical miracles of our time within the
reach of every American.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's proposal, uninsured women would receive Medicaid coverage
for the duration of their treatment, meaning radiation treatment, chemotherapy
and other services.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-year survival rate is 97 percent when the diseases are diagnosed
early, but that rate falls to 21 percent after the cancer has spread.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is especially troubling, given the stunning progress scientists are
making in the fight against cancer,'' Clinton said. ``New drugs and new
combinations of drugs will bring hope to those whose cancer has spread.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton urged Congress to act quickly, saying his proposal has significant
bipartisan support because it ``transcends political boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
	   Similar legislation has been proposed by Sens. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Reps. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., and Rick Lazio, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio, in a statement, applauded Clinton's proposal, said his own bill is
ready for House action, and predicted Congress will pass it this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a fight that transcends party lines and partisan bickering,'' added
Rep. J.C. Watts Jr, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   John R. Seffrin, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society,
called for quick action on the proposal and said: ``The bottom line is that this
proposal can be a lifesaver for many women.''

<HEADLINE> Crack, Cocaine Prison Terms Debated  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a dispute that has engulfed the drug debate for
years: how best to end the disparity between mandatory prison sentences for
possession of crack and powder cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   The law requires a five-year prison term for anyone convicted of possessing
5 grams or more of crack. But a person has to be found guilty of holding at
least 500 grams of powder cocaine to fall under the same mandate.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contend that 100-fold difference targets minorities and the poor for
jail while allowing more upscale users of the costlier powder cocaine to go
free. Defenders of the current thresholds say crack is more addictive and is
associated more with violent crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate grew thornier last week: A provision the Senate tucked into a
bankruptcy bill would lower the threshold at which powder cocaine offenders
would go behind bars.
</P>
<P>
	   The fate of the Senate-passed bill, as well as that of the cocaine measure,
is uncertain. The House has passed its own version of bankruptcy legislation but
has not addressed the cocaine issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate language is drawing its share of criticism and praise. Supporters
say it would end the sentencing disparity, remain tough on crime and silence
allegations of racism. Opponents say it only will further crowd prisons.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rather than reduce the disparity, this would just increase the number of
minority offenders going to prison,'' said Marc Mauer, assistant director of The
Sentencing Project, a Washington-based advocacy group. ``Two-thirds of powder
cocaine offenders who would now go to prison under this amendment are Hispanic
whites.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the solution is ``locking up fewer crack offenders, not locking up
more powder offenders.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many judges, including several conservatives on the federal bench, also have
criticized Congress' practice of mandating sentences. They say it removes their
discretion to weigh a person's role in a crime, the circumstances and other
mitigating factors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This lock 'em up and throw away the key approach to sentencing has done
nothing more than fill our prisons with low- level drug offenders,'' said Monica
Pratt, a spokeswoman for Families Against Mandatory Minimums, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the cocaine measure by Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., counter
that drugs are illegal regardless. Getting tougher is the answer, they argue,
not getting more lenient.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact of the matter remains if you're dealing drugs you're committing a
crime,'' said Joe Davis, a spokesman for Abraham. ``We're not going to go easy
on anybody that deals drugs to our kids. We don't care if it's crack. We don't
care if it's powder. These dangerous drugs, no matter what form they are in, are
on the streets and we want to take them off.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate measure would narrow the disparity by reducing the incarceration
threshold for powder cocaine possession from 500 grams to 50 grams.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has sought to narrow the disparity by raising the
threshold for crack cocaine to 25 grams and lowering it to 250 grams for power
cocaine
</P>
<P>
	   ``The position of the administration has been that the Abraham proposal
accomplishes a very different and not necessarily positive objective than the
administration proposal,'' said Bob Weiner, spokesman for White House drug
policy director Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul H. Robinson, a Northwestern University law school professor and former
member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, said the public has been misled about
the reasoning for the disparity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is probably the most irresponsible public discussion I have ever
heard,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said there are three significant differences between crack and powder
cocaine: how quickly a person becomes addicted, the amount of violence
associated with each and the number of doses or potency of the amount seized.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Treating crack and powder cocaine the same, that would be a distortion,''
he said. ``The same weight of powder and crack represents more doses of crack
than it does powder. I think as a general principle, changing our sentencing
policy because it has a disparate impact on one community or another -- whether
racial, sexual, religious or anything -- that doesn't make sense.''

<HEADLINE> Blasts Reported Near Iran Parliament  </HEADLINE>
   By HASAN SARBAKHSHIAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Five explosions went off Saturday evening near the
Iranian president's office, parliament and other key government buildings,
Iranian media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said authorities did not believe
there were any casualties from what it described as a ``terrorist attack.''
Witnesses told The Associated Press they saw mortar fragments littering the
intersection and a few ambulances sped away soon after the blasts.
</P>
<P>
	   Roads in the area were closed off and journalists were not allowed near.
</P>
<P>
	   IRNA did not provide details about the number or nature of the blasts;
Tehran television said there were five explosions but did not say what sort.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosions were the work of ``the hypocrites,'' Tehran television said
in a reference to the Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group. The Iraq-based group
seeks the overthrow of Iran's Islamic government. It has more than 30,000 men
and women with military training in camps near the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Government offices near the intersection of Vali-Asr and Imam Khomeini
avenues, where IRNA's Persian-language service said the explosions were heard,
include those of President Mohammad Khatami, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the parliament, the judiciary and the expediency council, a
policy-making body headed by former president Hashemi Rafsanjani.

<HEADLINE> Britain Mulls Asylum for Pilot  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BARR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- British authorities are considering an asylum plea from an
EgyptAir pilot who claims to have information about the airline's fatal crash
last year off the coast of Massachusetts, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Home Office has confirmed only that an Egyptian national ``has sought
entry into the U.K. and his application is being considered by the immigration
services.'' The Egyptian Embassy in London, however, said pilot Hamdi Hanafi
Taha, 49, was staying at an Immigration Service facility at Heathrow airport
while his case was considered.
</P>
<P>
	   The Middle East News Agency had quoted an EgyptAir statement Friday as
saying Taha asked for asylum after piloting an EgyptAir flight to London.
</P>
<P>
	   But airline officials said Taha had no special knowledge about the cause of
the Oct. 31 crash near the island of Nantucket that killed all 217 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   A team of American and Egyptian investigators has yet to release any
official findings on the cause of the crash. Some U.S. sources have said the
National Transportation Safety Board is working on the theory the plane was
brought down deliberately by a co-pilot who died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Egyptian authorities hotly dispute that theory. They say the most likely
cause is an unexplained problem in the plane's tail section.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Egyptian government and public have condemned as outrageous and
insulting any speculation that an Egyptian pilot may have committed suicide and
killed innocent people. If Taha has information contradicting that, he may fear
being ostracized -- or worse -- in a country where human rights activists have
been jailed for speech considered harmful to the national interest.
</P>
<P>
	   EgyptAir's statement did not elaborate on whether Taha claimed to have
information about the co-pilot on the ill-fated jet.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cairo, Taha's wife, Hoda Abdel-Rahman Youssef, told The Associated Press
she did not believe her husband was seeking asylum. ``He is scheduled to arrive
tomorrow and we're waiting for him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Youssef told reporters earlier her husband was ``very sad'' after the crash,
but added: ``He didn't tell me anything about the reason behind its plunge.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said her husband had suffered anxiety recently, but seemed normal when
he left for work Friday morning. The two have been married 19 years and have six
children.
</P>
<P>
	   Taha has worked for EgyptAir since 1984, Egypt's Al Gomhuria newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His relationship with his colleagues was good, but he had some problems
with the (airline) administration,'' said Mohammed Salama, the pilot who flew
Taha's plane back to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
	   The state-run airline's head of operations, Capt. Hassan Misharfa, said
Taha's move was ``very strange.'' Misharfa, who took part in the crash
investigation, told the pro-government newspaper Al-Ahram that Taha could not
have had information about the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Egyptian government spokesman Nabil Osman refused to comment on Taha's
motives, saying ``it is premature to speculate.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Celebrate Year of the Dragon  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM FOREMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Eye-stinging clouds of incense wafted through
Taiwanese temples Saturday, as waves of bowing worshippers welcomed in the
Dragon Year -- one of the luckiest in the 12-year Chinese zodiac.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese in major cities throughout Asia celebrated the Lunar New Year with
crackling fireworks, dragon dances, acrobats and parades.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the day, thousands of celebrants carrying incense sticks and
plates of oranges, sticky rice cakes and other offerings, shuffled slowly into
the smoky Hsingtien Temple in northwest Taipei.
</P>
<P>
	   The red-tile roofed temple is dedicated to Kuangkung, the god of war and
martial arts and the patron saint of business people. Dressed in gold and green
robes, the red-faced, bearded god sits on a throne inside the temple.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My family comes here every year. We come to pray for wealth, good fortune
and peace. Peace is the most important,'' said teacher Steve Lin as he inched
into the temple among a river of people.
</P>
<P>
	   In Indonesia, the ethnic Chinese minority held New Year celebrations in
public for the first time since they were blamed for a bloody, but abortive,
communist coup in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, Chinese houses and businesses have been wrecked and burned
by Indonesians angry at the business success of the community, which accounts
for only 3.5 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds burned incense offerings Saturday at the 450-year-old Vihara Dharma
Bhakti temple in Jakarta, and dragon dances and Beijing opera performances were
held in other parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are not afraid anymore. They are happy,'' said temple caretaker Lau
Xian Sing, who, like many frightened Chinese, adopted an Indonesian-sounding
name, Solihan, in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong celebrated with a parade that included a dozen vintage Rolls-Royce
and Bentleys and a mainland Chinese float -- the first one to join the annual
display since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The mainland float, with streamers bearing the Chinese characters of
``luck'' and ``abundance,'' received cheers from the crowd of more than 20,000
that watched the parade roll through the central business district.
</P>
<P>
	   The parade also included a police band playing bagpipes, an Indian wedding
ceremonial float, fashion models in dresses with beaded dragon patterns, martial
arts practitioners and 10 sets of dragon dancers -- one more than 300 yards
long.
</P>
<P>
	   With an economic recession well behind them, many in Hong Kong wanted to
celebrate and renew their wishes for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For me, I wish for more money,'' parade helper Ken Yeung said amid
saffron-robed Buddhist monks burning incense before a makeshift gold-colored
altar.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dragon Year is special for Chinese, many of whom call themselves the
``dragon's descendants.'' In ancient times, emperors regarded themselves as
reincarnations of dragons, and children born during the year are considered
blessed.
</P>
<P>
	   With statues of eight fierce dragons decorating its roof, the Hsingtien
Temple seemed an appropriate place to celebrate for many.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside the temple's walls, men distributed smoking incense sticks to the
mass of worshippers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the large courtyard, long lines of people from all generations waited to
pray before Kuangkung, who could barely be seen through the clouds of incense.
</P>
<P>
	   Young mothers gripped their toddlers' hands. Teen-agers in faded jeans
giggled. Elderly grandmothers with bent backs stared straight ahead, moving
their lips in inaudible prayers.
</P>
<P>
	   When they reached the front of the line, they held the incense in both hands
or pressed their palms together tightly and bowed slightly in prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   In China, Beijing's normally bustling streets were empty and quiet, as many
who had welcomed the New Year with fireworks, spent Saturday at home or visiting
close relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   In Pingyao, a historic walled town in central Shanxi province, residents
ambled out of their homes later in the afternoon to watch acrobats tumble and
ride horses. Local hawkers sold balloons and candied hawthorn berry.
</P>
<P>
	   Celebrations were held in other parts of the world as well.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, thousands of revelers crowded Chinatown on Saturday as dancing
dragons snaked through the streets and staccato percussion pulsated.
</P>
<P>
	   The Empire State Building was bathed in red and gold lights Friday night for
the holiday and a swirling 50-foot long, red and yellow dragon snaked its way
around the famed New York monolith's observatory Friday to the oohs and aahs of
tourists and children.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: Political spouse enters political spotlight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - She's spent 20 years in the shadow of her husband's
ambitions, as a sometimes admired and sometimes reviled first lady in Arkansas
and Washington, D.C.
<P>
	   But on Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton will officially make the transition
from political spouse to political spotlight when she formally announces her
candidacy for the U.S. Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a transition her supporters - including President Clinton - see as the
long-overdue attainment of a dream deferred.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am so grateful that now my wife has a chance to do what I thought she
ought to do 26 years ago, when we finished law school," President Clinton said
at a birthday bash for his wife in October. He'll be there Sunday when she kicks
off her campaign, just as she's stood by him all these years, waiting her turn.
</P>
<P>
	   The transition has changed her: From an off-limits celebrity who never waded
into the crowd or acknowledged a reporter's question, to an eager candidate,
shaking every hand in sight and holding press conferences.
</P>
<P>
	   But the evolution from first lady to Senate candidate has not been easy.
She's taken heat for sitting silently while Yassir Arafat's wife criticized the
Israelis; she upset Puerto Rican officials by failing to tell them she would
oppose clemency for jailed FALN members; and just a day after condemning the
military's "Don't ask, don't tell" policy, she puzzled gay supporters by
pledging to march in a St. Patrick's Day parade that excludes homosexuals.
Perhaps the furor she's faced over so many of her pronouncements explains her
claim to have no opinion on the fate of the Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite surviving all these controversies, she faces a much bigger task
between now and the Nov. 7 election. "There is a question that haunts many
people," acknowledges her campaign adviser, Harold Ickes. "Why is she doing
this? And who is she?"
</P>
<P>
	   Who she is - a Bible-quoting intellectual who graduated from Wellesley and
Yale; a woman who describes her 1950s childhood as idyllic but rejected the
stay-at-home mom route herself; and an advocate for women's rights who stays
with a philandering husband - is deeply rooted in her childhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in 1947, the eldest of three, she was raised in the Chicago suburb of
Park Ridge. "I grew up in a family that looked like it was straight out of the
1950s television sitcom 'Father Knows Best,"' she wrote in "It Takes a Village
and Other Lessons Children Teach Us."
</P>
<P>
	   Her mother was there every day when she came home for lunch; her father, who
owned a drapery business, prayed kneeling by the side of his bed every night. To
this day, when Hillary Clinton talks about the pressures working families face
and the help government can provide in the form of maternity leave, after-school
and the like, she sounds just a little nostalgic for that simpler time.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet she has always been committed to her own career - keeping her job at a
law firm while serving as Arkansas' first lady, and taking just four months off
from work when daughter Chelsea - now 19 - was born. She's also said her
objections to divorce stem from her mother's life: she came from a broken home
and was shipped off to uncaring relatives at a tender age.
</P>
<P>
	   That same mother instilled in her the steely poise Americans so admired
during the impeachment struggle. If young Bill Clinton's defining moment was
standing up to his violent stepfather, little Hillary's was when she ran home in
tears to escape a neighborhood bully. Her mother sent her back out the door,
saying: "There's no room for cowards in this house."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, a church youth group introduced her "to the world beyond our
all-white middle-class suburb." A teen-age Hillary baby-sat for migrant farm
workers' families and even shook hands with Martin Luther King Jr. - not long
after her future husband's fabled meeting, as a young man, with President
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   This early faith-based activism had a lifelong impact. "Be ye doers and not
just hearers of the word," Mrs. Clinton intoned at several recent appearances,
prompting one of her hosts to respond: "Thank you, Rev. Clinton!"
</P>
<P>
	   At Wellesley, she was a campus leader who made front-page news in the Boston
Globe with her commencement speech - a strident rebuttal to another speaker who
derided '60s activism. It would not be the last time her outspokenness made
headlines:
</P>
<P>
	   The "vast right-wing conspiracy" that she first blamed for the Monica
Lewinsky scandal has become one of her most mocked pronouncements. But her brave
condemnation of female infanticide, delivered at the risk of offending her hosts
during a U.N. conference in China, won her high marks around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   At Yale Law School, she added a year to her studies to learn about child
development, then worked as a staff attorney for the Children's Defense Fund.
Children's issues, education and health remain her priorities and are themes of
her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   She spent 1974 working for the House Judiciary Committee researching the
constitutional grounds for impeaching President Nixon. She then rejected a
promising legal career in the Capitol and moved to Arkansas to join Bill
Clinton, whom she'd met at Yale and soon married. She worked for a prominent
Little Rock law firm, keeping her job and maiden name even after he was elected
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   But when he lost his first re-election bid, her image was deemed part of the
problem. From then on, she used her married name.
</P>
<P>
	   Her biggest achievement as first lady in Arkansas was reforming the state's
schools, including raising salaries and per-pupil spending, and instituting
performance tests for teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
	   Her biggest failure as first lady in Washington was the slow death of the
comprehensive health reform plan that her husband placed in her care. "I come
from the school of smaller steps now," she said humbly at a New York event last
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Her years in Washington have been marked by adversity. After records from
the Whitewater scandal mysteriously appeared in the White House, Hillary Clinton
became the first president's wife to testify before a grand jury. But her
popularity soared during the impeachment struggle, with two-thirds of Americans
saying they approved of her brave smile and the way she soldiered on.
</P>
<P>
	   She visited New York four times during that fall of '98, to help Chuck
Schumer in his run for U.S. Senate. Audiences roared at the sight of her, giving
endless ovations. Early last winter, as rumors of her Senate run surfaced, polls
showed her 10 points ahead of her likely Republican opponent, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the wounded wife image faded and the Senate candidate emerged, she
has lost support. The rock-star treatment she once received from crowds has
turned into polite applause. Polls now have her almost neck and neck with
Giuliani, and he's winning among white women.
</P>
<P>
	   "This race is a very tough race," says Ickes. "And nobody understands that
better than Hillary. She understands that this is not going to be given to her.
She's going to have to work for the trust of the people of New York."

<HEADLINE> US Increases Role in Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United States stepped into a dispute between Israel
and the Palestinians on Saturday, amid hints from the Palestinians that the
crisis could suspend or even halt peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was meeting with officials from both sides to
try to bridge the gaps over the location of an Israeli withdrawal from 6.1
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, describing an ``unprecedented crisis,''
sent envoys to consult with officials in Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   An aide to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Gadi Baltiansky, said Saturday
that Israel had no intention of changing the location of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh told The Associated Press that the
Palestinian leadership's course of action will depend on the outcome of U.S.
mediation. Ross was to meet with Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and his
Israeli counterpart, Oded Eran, together later Saturday to hear their positions,
officials from both sides said.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the meeting at U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk's house near Tel Aviv,
Ross was then to report back to the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are round-the-clock consultations and efforts,'' Abourdeneh said.
``The next 24 hours are critical, after which we will assess what steps to take
next.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abourdeneh would not elaborate on the options being considered, but
Palestinian Cabinet Minister Ziad Abu Zayyad said the Palestinians would take
public opinion into account in deciding whether to continue talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For now, negotiations are our choice, but if Israel keeps dragging on the
peace process, we will go back to our people and ask what should be the
option,'' Abu Zayyad said. He would not specify what form the popular
consultation would take.
</P>
<P>
	   A summit between Arafat and Barak on Thursday ended in sharp disagreement
over the location of the West Bank territory Israel is to hand over.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians want the land to include heavily populated suburbs of
Jerusalem, a request that Israel rejected, saying it has the sole right to
decide the location of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Erekat said Israel also proposed including another troop redeployment, the
last under interim peace agreements, in a final peace treaty slated for
September. A framework agreement for that treaty is due by Feb. 13, Baltiansky
said that deadline clearly would not be met.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Barak told Arafat he was committed to trying to reach a framework
agreement as soon as possible, and stood by the September target date for the
treaty. Negotiators would meet Sunday to work on the framework, Baltiansky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who was not given a role on Barak's
peacemaking team, said Israel needs to put peace with the Palestinians ahead of
negotiations with Syria that are currently on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be very difficult to make a deal with the Palestinians after the
Syrians,'' Peres said, because the Syrians will be given a ``very generous map''
returning land Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War -- making it hard for the
Palestinians to accept less.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria is demanding that Israel agree to return all of the strategic Golan
Heights. Barak has indicated his willingness to do so, but has refused
preconditions to resuming the talks.

<HEADLINE> Haider Means Change in Austria Govt  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- With sanctions from abroad and riots at home,
Austria has seen dramatic change since Joerg Haider's anti-immigrant party
became half of the government Friday. More -- and different -- change than
Haider's voters expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Gone are the staid and cozy leaderships formed since the end of World War II
by establishment parties that brought Austrians from postwar hardship to
prosperous democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   In came Haider's Freedom Party, empowered by an electorate eager to clean
Austrian politics of inertia and cronyism and embracing its view that foreigners
clamoring at the borders were threatening each Austrian's well-being.
</P>
<P>
	   But other changes are less welcome. The party's anti-foreigner stance and
Haider's past praise of the Nazi era have left Austria under political
quarantine and rent by internal dissent.
</P>
<P>
	   Average Austrians remain alternately worried and defiant, their national
pride replaced by anxiety as governments reduce relations or withdraw
ambassadors and foreign tourists begin canceling trips.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We needed change, but not turmoil,'' Andreas Kuehrer, a waiter, said as he
watched a televised clash between riot police and anti-Haider demonstrators --
not in Indonesia, South Korea or any of ``those places over there,'' but in ``my
Vienna, the city where nothing like this ever happens.''
</P>
<P>
	   But things have changed since the Oct. 3 elections, when many Austrians
rejected the political parties they had supported for decades, the ones that
gave them Europe's second-highest living standard, one of the lowest crime rates
anywhere and restored respectability after finally facing their Nazi legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we hoped for was renewal, new faces and new ideas,'' said pensioner
Michael Rudolf, whose vote helped catapult the Freedom Party into second place.
``We wanted a better Austria for Austrians, but the others are not going to let
it happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Others'' -- the belief that outsiders are responsible for Austria's
problems -- permeates the country's recent history.
</P>
<P>
	   Austrians fervently supported Adolf Hitler, their native son. According to
the Vienna-based Jewish Documentation Center, headed by Nazi hunter Simon
Wiesenthal, Austrians were accountable in some way for the death of 3 million
Jews -- about half those killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
	   That was quickly forgotten after the war. Austrian statesmen negotiating
with Allies for their independence insisted Austria was a Nazi victim, not a
perpetrator. Anxious to prevent a future union between Austria and Germany, the
allies agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Although more than 99 percent of Austrians voted for their country's
annexation by Germany in 1938, the postwar Austrian constitution endorsed by the
Allies recognizes ``that Hitler's Germany ... annexed Austria by force.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Austrians seldom face up to unpleasant aspects of their past,'' the late
psychologist Erwin Ringel said in a 1989 interview. Ringel, whose book ``The
Austrian Soul'' looks at his countrymen's ability to sublimate responsibility,
said the tendency to blame others was a widespread Austrian characteristic.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Waldheim won Austria's presidency by claiming he was a victim, first of
the Nazis who ruled his country and later of the international community, which
called him to task for hiding his wartime past as a lieutenant in a German unit
associated with atrocities. Other officials associated with the Hitler era held
high postwar government posts.
</P>
<P>
	   The allies also allowed the formation of a new party -- the WDU -- despite
its ``German nationalist'' program and a membership list permeated by former
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1986, by then called the Freedom Party, it elected Haider its leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Under his predecessors, the Freedom Party was marginal, seemingly trapped in
the opposition. Except for Freedom's brief stint as the Socialists' junior
coalition partner, Austria's postwar government had been ruled by either the
Socialists or the centrist People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the two major parties were rewarded with state jobs and other
benefits. By the time Haider took over his party, political affiliation and good
connections generally meant more than qualifications for even prospective school
principals and hospital doctors. Unions and other employee groups created by the
two parties ensured that membership meant professional advancement.
</P>
<P>
	   The line between the two parties blurred further after 1987. Too weak to
rule alone, they formed a coalition government, leaving a vacuum in the
opposition that Haider's party quickly filled.
</P>
<P>
	   Though prosperity grew, so did unease about big government. The perception
that those without connections did not have a chance mixed with outrage over
reports of corruption and secret deals by a government seemingly unaccountable
to the electorate
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's party stepped in as the advocate of the little people, attacking
the ruling parties and their leaders, often in the street language of their
growing camp of supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   A natural orator, Haider also knew how to exploit lingering pro-Nazi
sentiment and growing fears that Austria, an island of prosperity, was in
growing danger of being overrun by foreigners -- either in the form of cheap
labor or criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the government owned up to Austria's role under Hitler and enacted
restitution laws, and critics condemned Haider's praise of the Nazi era and his
party's racism-tinged stance on foreigners, the Freedom Party gained strength in
each election.
</P>
<P>
	   The balance finally tipped on Oct. 3. The Freedom Party narrowly outpolled
the People's Party, setting the stage for the months of torturous negotiations
that ended with Haider's party sharing power.
</P>
<P>
	   But the resulting sanctions, riots, strike threats and canceled vacations is
change that most Austrians can do without.
</P>
<P>
	   Worse is yet to come, warn analysts, predicting political polarization,
growing labor and civil unrest -- and isolation for Austria far beyond that of
the Waldheim era.
</P>
<P>
	   ``During the time of Kurt Waldheim, we had a lonely man'' as president,
writes Kristoph Kotanko of the Kurier daily. ``Now, we have a lonely
government.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton to talk about role as "trailblazing woman"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to use her time in the
spotlight of her Senate campaign announcement "to talk about her own personal
experiences as a trailblazing woman," a top aide said Saturday.
<P>
	   Clinton is to make her announcement Sunday afternoon in a gymnasium at the
State University of New York campus in Purchase, not far from her recently
purchased $1.7 million home in suburban Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has never before lived or worked in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, her expected Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, appeared ready to steal at least some of Clinton's thunder. The mayor
was scheduled to appear on virtually every nationally broadcast Sunday morning
news show to discuss the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was to arrive from Washington at her home just north of New York
City on Saturday. President Clinton, daughter Chelsea and the candidate's
mother, Dorothy Rodham, were to be on hand for Sunday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hillary will tell New Yorkers that she's running to make a difference for
children and families, as she has for the last 30 years," campaign spokesman
Howard Wolfson said Saturday. "She wants to serve in the Senate to continue her
fight for better schools and quality health care."
</P>
<P>
	   Those are issues she and her advisers believe can be particularly effective
against Giuliani, who has built a reputation as being a tough crime-fighter who
has made his city a safer place, but has come under fire for what critics claim
is a lack of compassion on social issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's going to talk about some of the things she's for, and some of the
things she's against," Wolfson added.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost 2,000 people are expected at the announcement event, including many
of the state's top Democrats. They will be welcomed by choirs, bands and a red,
white and blue "Hillary for U.S. Senate" banner at the back of the stage. There
will be more than 500 simultaneous house parties across the state for supporters
who the first lady plans to speak to via a telephone conference call after her
announcement speech.
</P>
<P>
	   One highlight of the announcement event is expected to be a biographical
video of the new candidate prepared by Hollywood producer Harry Thomason.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomason was the driving force behind the production of "The Man from Hope"
video on Bill Clinton shown at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. Thomason
has been a confidant to the president and the first lady throughout their time
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Following her announcement, Senate candidate Clinton was to head for Buffalo
on Monday to begin a four-day campaign swing across the state.

<HEADLINE> For Spot movement Sat. Feb. 5 for Sun. Feb. 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York should allow no further expansion of
gambling until it weighs the costs and benefits of the Lottery, casinos and the
other forms of gambling it already has, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall said
Saturday.
<P>
	   The state needs to "take a breath" to make an accounting of compulsive
gambling and other downsides before contemplating adding more lottery games or
casinos, McCall said.
</P>
<P>
	   "A moratorium will give the state a chance to focus attention and to educate
the public about the choices government is making," the comptroller said. "The
state shouldn't be introducing any new gaming until all the issues are
addressed."
</P>
<P>
	   McCall released a study Saturday in which he urged Gov. George Pataki and
the state Legislature to agree on procedures for the establishment of Indian
casinos and to increase funding for programs to help compulsive gamblers.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the comptroller said the state has to study the implications of
new forms of technology-driven gambling. He questioned, for instance, the
implications of the Albany region's Off-Track Betting Corp.'s plans to allow
non-New Yorkers to bet on horse races over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, a Republican, has renewed his call this year for the state to enter
the multi-state compact which operates the big-jackpot Powerball lottery game.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the possibility of Mohawk Indians establishing a casino in the
Catskills is believed to be one of the topics the Pataki administration and
Indian tribes are discussing along with Indian land claims and the payment of
state tobacco and gasoline taxes by Indian vendors.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall, a Democrat, cited a study from the state Council on Problem Gambling
which estimated that compulsive gambling increased by 74 percent from 1986-96.
He said enough is simply not known about the effects of Quick Draw and other
forms of state-sponsored gaming on compulsive gambling to create even more games
to wager money on.
</P>
<P>
	   "For most New Yorkers, gambling is an enjoyable form of entertainment,"
McCall said. "For others, gambling is a problem that can destroy families and
bankrupt lives. Research shows that if you increase gambling opportunities, you
increase problem gambling."
</P>
<P>
	   McCall also said there are too many underaged gamblers in New York and that
the state has done little to investigate the more than 1,000 gambling sites on
the Internet and the effect they're having on New Yorkers, especially young
ones.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said his call for a moratorium on new forms of gambling is consistent
with the findings and recommendations released last year by the National
Commission on Gambling.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's office said it had not seen the McCall report and didn't have any
interest in seeing it.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it's from H. Carl, it's the same old-same old," Pataki spokeswoman
Suzanne Morris said. "Long on rhetoric and short on facts."
</P>
<P>
	   McCall is a potential rival of Pataki's for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Patricia Lynch, spokeswoman for state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, said
Assembly Democrats would look at McCall's study. She said Silver has favored an
expansion of non-Indian casinos in economically depressed areas of the state and
has "concerns" about Powerball, but is not necessarily opposed to New York
getting into the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The executive director of the state Council on Problem Gambling, Laura
Letson, said her group has long been saying many of the same things McCall
advocated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that the comptroller's recommendations have substantial merit
and are something that is certainly worthy of consideration by the governor and
the Legislature," she said.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Investigator Has Probe Doubts  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- A parliamentary inquiry is unlikely to pin down the full
truth about slush funds that flowered under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl
because key players are contradicting each other, the top investigator said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Volker Neumann, chairman of a parliamentary committee examining whether
decisions were bought during Kohl's 16 years in power, told the Berliner Zeitung
newspaper that the Christian Democratic party's inability to clear up the
growing finance scandal is ``disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm tending to give up hope that we can ever get all of our questions
answered,'' said Neumann, a member of the governing Social Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl, meanwhile, faced a new round of condemnation from his Christian
Democrat party and German commentators. He has been sharply criticized for
brushing off demands that he name those who illegally gave him secret political
donations at least as far back as 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   The former chancellor has acknowledged receiving $1 million in secret
donations. But in a combative TV interview Friday, he bristled at suggestions
that he repaid campaign money with political favors. He also denied knowing of
Swiss accounts the party said it had discovered.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl reiterated his pledge to keep his word and not reveal the donors. He
said he has done all he could -- short of breaking his word to those who gave
money -- to help the Christian Democrats untangle the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have served this party as no one else has, and I have served this
country,'' Kohl said on ZDF television.
</P>
<P>
	   Disappointed Christian Democratic leaders said after a meeting in Bonn on
Friday that interviews with key players failed to establish who gave Kohl the $1
million he said he received from 1993-98. The party also said Kohl admitted for
the first time that he also received funds in 1989-92.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kohl said he knew nothing of secret funds that the party said were held
in Swiss accounts stretching back at least to 1971.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I knew absolutely nothing about secret accounts, I had nothing to do with
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations that money went to influence decisions -- including a tank
sale to Saudi Arabia, or French oil concern Elf Aquitaine's acquisition of the
Leuna refinery -- are ``unbelievable, shameless lies,'' Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
	   His refusal to identify donors after the scandal broke late last year has
put him into growing conflict with party leaders trying to clear up the mess.
Party general secretary Angela Merkel, once a Cabinet minister under Kohl,
lashed out Saturday at her former boss.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My opinion is very clear: in a democracy, you can't put a personal word of
honor above the law,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: Political spouse enters political spotlight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - She's spent 20 years in the shadow of her husband's
ambitions, as a sometimes admired and sometimes reviled first lady in Arkansas
and Washington, D.C.
<P>
	   But on Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton will officially make the transition
from political spouse to political spotlight when she formally announces her
candidacy for the U.S. Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a transition her supporters - including President Clinton - see as the
long-overdue attainment of a dream deferred.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am so grateful that now my wife has a chance to do what I thought she
ought to do 26 years ago, when we finished law school," President Clinton said
at a birthday bash for his wife in October. He'll be there Sunday when she kicks
off her campaign, just as she's stood by him all these years, waiting her turn.
</P>
<P>
	   The transition has changed her: From an off-limits celebrity who never waded
into the crowd or acknowledged a reporter's question, to an eager candidate,
shaking every hand in sight and holding press conferences.
</P>
<P>
	   But the evolution from first lady to Senate candidate has not been easy.
She's taken heat for sitting silently while Yassir Arafat's wife criticized the
Israelis; she upset Puerto Rican officials by failing to tell them she would
oppose clemency for jailed FALN members; and just a day after condemning the
military's "Don't ask, don't tell" policy, she puzzled gay supporters by
pledging to march in a St. Patrick's Day parade that excludes homosexuals.
Perhaps the furor she's faced over so many of her pronouncements explains her
claim to have no opinion on the fate of the Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite surviving all these controversies, she faces a much bigger task
between now and the Nov. 7 election. "There is a question that haunts many
people," acknowledges her campaign adviser, Harold Ickes. "Why is she doing
this? And who is she?"
</P>
<P>
	   Who she is - a Bible-quoting intellectual who graduated from Wellesley and
Yale; a woman who describes her 1950s childhood as idyllic but rejected the
stay-at-home mom route herself; and an advocate for women's rights who stays
with a philandering husband - is deeply rooted in her childhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in 1947, the eldest of three, she was raised in the Chicago suburb of
Park Ridge. "I grew up in a family that looked like it was straight out of the
1950s television sitcom 'Father Knows Best,"' she wrote in "It Takes a Village
and Other Lessons Children Teach Us."
</P>
<P>
	   Her mother was there every day when she came home for lunch; her father, who
owned a drapery business, prayed kneeling by the side of his bed every night. To
this day, when Hillary Clinton talks about the pressures working families face
and the help government can provide in the form of maternity leave, after-school
and the like, she sounds just a little nostalgic for that simpler time.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet she has always been committed to her own career - keeping her job at a
law firm while serving as Arkansas' first lady, and taking just four months off
from work when daughter Chelsea - now 19 - was born. She's also said her
objections to divorce stem from her mother's life: she came from a broken home
and was shipped off to uncaring relatives at a tender age.
</P>
<P>
	   That same mother instilled in her the steely poise Americans so admired
during the impeachment struggle. If young Bill Clinton's defining moment was
standing up to his violent stepfather, little Hillary's was when she ran home in
tears to escape a neighborhood bully. Her mother sent her back out the door,
saying: "There's no room for cowards in this house."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, a church youth group introduced her "to the world beyond our
all-white middle-class suburb." A teen-age Hillary baby-sat for migrant farm
workers' families and even shook hands with Martin Luther King Jr. - not long
after her future husband's fabled meeting, as a young man, with President
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   This early faith-based activism had a lifelong impact. "Be ye doers and not
just hearers of the word," Mrs. Clinton intoned at several recent appearances,
prompting one of her hosts to respond: "Thank you, Rev. Clinton!"
</P>
<P>
	   At Wellesley, she was a campus leader who made front-page news in the Boston
Globe with her commencement speech - a strident rebuttal to another speaker who
derided '60s activism. It would not be the last time her outspokenness made
headlines:
</P>
<P>
	   The "vast right-wing conspiracy" that she first blamed for the Monica
Lewinsky scandal has become one of her most mocked pronouncements. But her brave
condemnation of female infanticide, delivered at the risk of offending her hosts
during a U.N. conference in China, won her high marks around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   At Yale Law School, she added a year to her studies to learn about child
development, then worked as a staff attorney for the Children's Defense Fund.
Children's issues, education and health remain her priorities and are themes of
her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   She spent 1974 working for the House Judiciary Committee researching the
constitutional grounds for impeaching President Nixon. She then rejected a
promising legal career in the Capitol and moved to Arkansas to join Bill
Clinton, whom she'd met at Yale and soon married. She worked for a prominent
Little Rock law firm, keeping her job and maiden name even after he was elected
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   But when he lost his first re-election bid, her image was deemed part of the
problem. From then on, she used her married name.
</P>
<P>
	   Her biggest achievement as first lady in Arkansas was reforming the state's
schools, including raising salaries and per-pupil spending, and instituting
performance tests for teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
	   Her biggest failure as first lady in Washington was the slow death of the
comprehensive health reform plan that her husband placed in her care. "I come
from the school of smaller steps now," she said humbly at a New York event last
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Her years in Washington have been marked by adversity. After records from
the Whitewater scandal mysteriously appeared in the White House, Hillary Clinton
became the first president's wife to testify before a grand jury. But her
popularity soared during the impeachment struggle, with two-thirds of Americans
saying they approved of her brave smile and the way she soldiered on.
</P>
<P>
	   She visited New York four times during that fall of '98, to help Chuck
Schumer in his run for U.S. Senate. Audiences roared at the sight of her, giving
endless ovations. Early last winter, as rumors of her Senate run surfaced, polls
showed her 10 points ahead of her likely Republican opponent, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the wounded wife image faded and the Senate candidate emerged, she
has lost support. The rock-star treatment she once received from crowds has
turned into polite applause. Polls now have her almost neck and neck with
Giuliani, and he's winning among white women.
</P>
<P>
	   "This race is a very tough race," says Ickes. "And nobody understands that
better than Hillary. She understands that this is not going to be given to her.
She's going to have to work for the trust of the people of New York."

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton to talk about role as "trailblazing woman"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to use her time in the
spotlight of her Senate campaign announcement "to talk about her own personal
experiences as a trailblazing woman," a top aide said Saturday.
<P>
	   Clinton is to make her announcement Sunday afternoon in a gymnasium at the
State University of New York campus in Purchase, not far from her recently
purchased $1.7 million home in suburban Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has never before lived or worked in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, her expected Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, appeared ready to steal at least some of Clinton's thunder. The mayor
was scheduled to appear on virtually every nationally broadcast Sunday morning
news show to discuss the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was to arrive from Washington at her home just north of New York
City on Saturday. President Clinton, daughter Chelsea and the candidate's
mother, Dorothy Rodham, were to be on hand for Sunday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hillary will tell New Yorkers that she's running to make a difference for
children and families, as she has for the last 30 years," campaign spokesman
Howard Wolfson said Saturday. "She wants to serve in the Senate to continue her
fight for better schools and quality health care."
</P>
<P>
	   Those are issues she and her advisers believe can be particularly effective
against Giuliani, who has built a reputation as being a tough crime-fighter who
has made his city a safer place, but has come under fire for what critics claim
is a lack of compassion on social issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's going to talk about some of the things she's for, and some of the
things she's against," Wolfson added.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost 2,000 people are expected at the announcement event, including many
of the state's top Democrats. They will be welcomed by choirs, bands and a red,
white and blue "Hillary for U.S. Senate" banner at the back of the stage. There
will be more than 500 simultaneous house parties across the state for supporters
who the first lady plans to speak to via a telephone conference call after her
announcement speech.
</P>
<P>
	   One highlight of the announcement event is expected to be a biographical
video of the new candidate prepared by Hollywood producer Harry Thomason.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomason was the driving force behind the production of "The Man from Hope"
video on Bill Clinton shown at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. Thomason
has been a confidant to the president and the first lady throughout their time
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Following her announcement, Senate candidate Clinton was to head for Buffalo
on Monday to begin a four-day campaign swing across the state.

<HEADLINE> IRA Says It Will Not Disarm  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republican Army said Saturday it
will not disarm in response to British government or Protestant demands -- and
emphasized that it had never pledged to give up its arms at all.
</P>
<P>
	   The outlawed group's statement left the centerpiece of Northern Ireland's
peace accord, the Protestant-Catholic government, in continued peril.
</P>
<P>
	   The British government says it intends to strip the 9-week-old coalition
Cabinet of its powers on Friday if the IRA doesn't promise to disarm. The IRA's
response Saturday fell far short of that, mixing optimistic-sounding rhetoric
with a determination to resist political pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   In its statement, the IRA emphasized its willingness to ``support efforts to
secure the resolution of the arms issue.'' But it didn't directly say whether it
would begin scrapping its weapons dumps in cooperation with a disarmament
commission, as the 1998 Good Friday peace accord envisaged.
</P>
<P>
	   Any solution ``will not be on British or (Protestant) unionist terms, nor
will it be advanced by British legislative threats,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA statement came as Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-linked Sinn Fein
party, met with David Trimble, who leads Northern Ireland's major Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, and holds the top post in the four-party Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither leader would discuss the content of their meeting, which lasted only
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Trimble said the IRA statement had nothing new to say and was ``most
unfortunate.'' Adams said it reflected anger over the British government's
``threat and ultimatum.''
</P>
<P>
	   The province's Cabinet was formed two months ago following a Sinn
Fein-Ulster Unionist deal brokered by American mediator George Mitchell. The
Ulster Unionists agreed to form a Cabinet with Sinn Fein. But in exchange, the
Ulster Unionists expected the IRA to begin disarming in January.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA then opened discussions with the province's long-stymied disarmament
commission. But the commission reported Jan. 31 that its talks with IRA leaders
had produced no concrete gains, triggering an Ulster Unionist threat to withdraw
from the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   The British government's first priority is to discourage Trimble and his
colleagues from resigning. With Protestant opinion split down the middle on the
merits of sharing power with Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionists might not have
sufficient support to win re-election if they resign. That would make it
impossible to start the Cabinet up again.
</P>
<P>
	   Rendering the Cabinet powerless but intact would avoid that scenario. It
would allow for powers to be returned from London to Belfast if the deadlock is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   But to rising British and Ulster Unionist annoyance, the Sinn Fein-IRA
movement insists it isn't violating the letter of the Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The accord required Sinn Fein leaders -- among them prominent ex-IRA figures
-- to use ``whatever influence they may have'' to try to achieve IRA disarmament
by May 2000. As an outlawed group, the IRA couldn't be directly represented in
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA has never entered into any agreement, undertaking or understanding
at any time with anyone on any aspect of decommissioning. We have not broken our
commitment or betrayed anyone,'' the IRA said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cabinet's senior Catholic politician, Seamus Mallon, said Saturday that
the Sinn Fein-IRA position is deliberately misleading.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein and the IRA are wrong to characterize disarmament as ``some
amorphous thing that somehow or another was an addendum to the Good Friday
agreement. It isn't,'' said Mallon, deputy leader of the main Catholic-supported
party, the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party. ``It's central to it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the vast majority of people in Ireland expected the IRA ``to answer
two questions: Will it disarm? And if so, when?''

<HEADLINE> Deutch Still Has Security Clearance  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite evidence he kept government secrets on unsecured
computers at home, former CIA Director John Deutch maintains a Pentagon
clearance that allows him access to classified defense information, a senior
defense official confirmed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   George Tenet, Deutch's successor as CIA director, revoked Deutch's CIA
clearance last summer after investigators discovered he kept classified
documents on home computers that were connected to the Internet and unprotected
by security devices.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon also suspended his security clearance from the Defense
Intelligence Agency, the nation's main military intelligence service. Before
becoming CIA director, Deutch served as deputy secretary of defense from 1994 to
1995.
</P>
<P>
	   But he never lost his industrial security clearance -- a status that, to
this day, allows him to serve as a paid consultant on defense contracts with the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, SAIC Corp. and Raytheon Corp., said the
Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The type of information that would relate to industrial clearances relate
to specific programs in the institutions within which he is working, as opposed
to if you have a high-level security clearance, you have access to a broad range
of intelligence information,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Industrial clearances are more limited,'' the official continued. ``If any
information were compromised, it poses less of a threat to national security.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch's industrial security clearance was first reported Saturday by The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, now a professor at MIT, is one of thousands of people, mainly
defense contractors, who hold industrial clearances, the official said, adding
there is no evidence at this point to warrant revoking Deutch's clearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, an industrial security clearance is harder to revoke because a
person's livelihood may depend on it, the official said.

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Explosions in Iran  </HEADLINE>
   By HASAN SARBAKHSHIAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Mortars struck a publishing house Saturday evening in
central Tehran, near key government offices including the Iranian president's
office and Parliament. One person was killed and four were injured, Tehran
television reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Windows of the Golbang publishing house, located across the street from the
Judiciary building and top policy-making offices, were shattered and its walls
pocked and broken in areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Two cars parked out front were destroyed in the attack, claimed by an
Iranian opposition group trying to overthrow the Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We heard several explosions and it was just like the war,'' said
publishing house manager Abolghasem Hosseini, referring to the 1980-88 war
between Iran and Iraq. ``And the next thing I remember, everything was
upside-down.''
</P>
<P>
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency did not provide details about the
number or nature of the blasts, which it described as a ``terrorist attack.''
Tehran television said there were five explosions. Mortar debris was visible in
the area.
</P>
<P>
	   The only official building damaged was the headquarters of the office that
coordinates Friday prayers. Some windows were shattered and shrapnel slightly
damaged a wall.
</P>
<P>
	   One man, Mohammad Alijani, a 29-year-old employee at the publishing house,
died in the explosions and four people were injured, Tehran television said.
IRNA had earlier said that authorities did not believe there were any
casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   A witness told The Associated Press that paramedics carried away a woman
with abdominal wounds. Further information on the injured was not available.
</P>
<P>
	   Tehran television said the explosions were the work of ``the hypocrites,'' a
reference to the Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group. The Iraq-based group seeks
the overthrow of Iran's Islamic government and has more than 30,000 men and
women with military training in camps near the Iranian border.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt, the group
claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said targeted the home and
office of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
	   Other government offices in the area include those of President Mohammad
Khatami, the parliament, the judiciary and the expediency council, a
policy-making body led by former president Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
	   Within three hours of the explosions, a dozen municipal workers had swept
away the broken glass and debris and the closed-off streets were reopened.

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast Diver Dies on Mission  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL J. WAKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- The Kenya Airways disaster that killed 169
people claimed another life Saturday when a Kenyan navy diver died trying to
recover the bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   Divers working for a sixth day pulled up nine more victims of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Kenyan divers were working Saturday in about 50 yards of strong
currents, when one began running out of air. His partner, preparing to give him
oxygen from his own tank, tugged on a safety rope to signal distress, said Sgt.
Jean Jacques Kacou, an Ivorian fire department diver.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescuers on the ship immediately began pulling the safety rope, dragging the
diver away from his distressed partner, Kacou said. Two other Kenyan divers who
went down to assist suffered pressure problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The dead diver was not identified because his relatives had yet to be told.
</P>
<P>
	   But a colleague, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was a crack
rescue worker who trained in the United States and had responded to the August
1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
	   The rescue and recovery effort has been dogged by confusion, delay and lack
of resources since Flight 431 smacked into the Atlantic one minute after takeoff
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in this former French colony, saying they do not have enough
trained manpower and proper equipment, are relying on French military frogmen,
Kenyan navy divers and an amateur diving club of French expatriates. Some 95
bodies have been recovered so far. Ten people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   The flight data recorder was recovered Friday, but the cockpit voice
recorder had yet to be pinpointed.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways has contracted with a South African oil exploration company to
bring its vessels and sophisticated tracking and recovery equipment to help,
said Commandant Alia Gomis Akako, an Ivorian navy official coordinating the
operation. The company should begin work Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The divers face a macabre scene underwater, with bodies strewn among pieces
of wreckage on the ocean floor. Some remained belted into their seats, clutching
armrests, Akako said.

<HEADLINE> Haider Assures Austrians on Panic  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Right-wing leader Joerg Haider told a deeply divided
Austrian public Saturday not to worry about international isolation, saying the
new governing coalition that includes his Freedom Party would soon prove its
democratic credentials to the world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no need for hysteria,'' Haider told the Austria Press Agency,
calling the European Union's action in freezing high-level contacts with the new
government ``irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's history of remarks against immigration and sympathetic to aspects
of Nazi rule led other nations to warn against his party's inclusion in the
government. Their warning ignored, the EU and Israel have resorted to diplomatic
reprisals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The EU will quickly get used to the fact that the Freedom Party now sits
in the Cabinet, which has good programs, expertise and good manners,'' Haider
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He blamed ``leftists who do not accept democratic decisions'' for the
violence that broke out Friday after the new coalition with the Austrian
People's Party took power.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 50 people, including 43 policemen and 13 demonstrators, were
injured in the clashes. About 1,500 people protested against the new government
in Vienna again Saturday, and hundreds of demonstrators also gathered in some of
Austria's biggest provincial cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider expressed confidence that ``good work and an aggressive information
policy'' would overcome hostility to his government.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety for statements praising Adolf Hitler's
``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of the Waffen SS as
``decent people of good character'' -- comments for which he has since
apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   The rise to power of Haider's far-right party has polarized a society with
dark memories of defeats in two world wars and an armed civil conflict between
leftists and rightists in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey of 500 Austrian voters taken Thursday by the OGM research institute
found that 43 percent opposed President Thomas Klestil's decision to swear in
the new coalition and 45 supported it. No margin of error was given, but the
institute described the breakdown as a statistical draw, the Austria Press
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   After the new government was sworn in Friday, the 14 other EU nations
reduced their diplomatic ties with Austria as threatened, canceling contracts
and official visits and freezing high-level contacts. U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Ambassador Kathryn Walt-Hall would leave for Washington
to report and then return to Vienna to monitor the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Austrian radio said Klestil conferred Saturday by telephone with Albright as
well as with Romano Prodi, president of the European Commission, and Portuguese
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, whose country now holds the rotating EU
presidency. Klestil ``updated Albright on the current situation'' and appealed
to Prodi and Guterres ``not to have Austria isolated by the European Union,''
the radio said.
</P>
<P>
	   In downtown Vienna, a crowd of anti-Haider demonstrators had grown to around
1,500 late Saturday. Authorities sealed off the headquarters of Haider's party.
Police, who intervened with water cannons to break up the violent demonstrations
Friday night, said on Saturday there were only isolated incidents of
egg-throwing and firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrations also took place in Graz and Salzburg. Elsewhere, hundreds of
people protested Austria's new government in London and Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P>
	   In Paris, meanwhile, Haider supporters had their say. Hundreds of
demonstrators, mostly members of France's far right, gathered outside the
Austrian embassy to protest the EU's moves to isolate Austria. The demonstrators
carried French flags and signs reading ``Save Europe from the gulag'' and
``Joerg, we love you.''

<HEADLINE> Ukraine To Shut Chernobyl in 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said Saturday that
the Chernobyl nuclear plant will be shut down this year, as Western countries
have long demanded.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kuchma reiterated to U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson that the
plant will close only after American, Ukrainian and international experts work
out an aid deal to help compensate Ukraine for the loss of the energy Chernobyl
provides, a presidential spokesman said. Kuchma did not give a specific date for
the closure.
</P>
<P>
	   Chernobyl's reactor No. 4 exploded in 1986 and covered much of Europe with a
radioactive cloud in the world's worst nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Ukraine promised in 1995 to close the plant by 2000 in exchange for
international aid. But Ukrainian officials have delayed preparations for the
closure, saying foreign lenders have lagged on funding for two new nuclear
reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson arrived in Ukraine's capital, Kiev, on Saturday for a two-day
visit. He is meeting with Kuchma and his newly-appointed government to discuss
the energy sector and privatization in the former Soviet republic.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Attack Congo Gov't Positions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Rebels have launched attacks on Congolese army
positions in new violations of a shaky cease-fire agreement, the government said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Government soldiers were occupying ``defensive positions'' in the town of
Likwelo in northwestern Equateur province when they came under attack Thursday,
Defense Ministry official Col. David Kokolo Longo said. Fighting continued
Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels were advancing on the Wenga region in an attempt to capture the
strategic town of Mbandaka, the administrative center of Equateur province,
Longo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Independent confirmation of the government's claims was not available and
the rebels did not immediately comment.
</P>
<P>
	   A cease-fire agreement was signed July 10 by President Laurent Kabila and
his allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- and by Rwanda and Uganda, who are
backing the rebels. The main rebel factions signed on in the following weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The accord calls for a cease-fire, an eventual deployment of U.N.
peacekeepers, the withdrawal of foreign forces and the start of a national
dialogue to create a broad-based government in Africa's third-largest nation.
</P>
<P>
	   But fighting has persisted in northwestern and southeastern Congo, and both
sides regularly accuse each other of cease-fire violations.
</P>
<P>
	   To prevent a total collapse of the accord, the U.N. Security Council is
preparing to dispatch 500 U.N. military observers and 3,400 troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels, who launched their campaign in mid-1998, accuse Kabila of
mismanagement, corruption and warmongering.

<HEADLINE> Parents defend Diallo's character at Harlem memorial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The parents of Amadou Diallo defended their son's
behavior and the reputation of his adopted Bronx neighborhood Saturday against
criticism from lawyers for the four police officers on trial for gunning him
down.
<P>
	   "I'd like him to be a symbol of justice, a symbol of unity for everyone
around the world," Kadiatou Diallo said at a Harlem rally a day after the
one-year anniversary of her son's death. "Let's not remember the pain. Let's
call for change in a positive way."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the four patrolmen facing murder charges in the Diallo shooting
told an Albany jury this week that the unarmed immigrant helped cause his own
death in a hail of 41 bullets by lurking around the front door of his home, then
ignoring police orders to halt.
</P>
<P>
	   His father, Saikou Diallo, told supporters gathered at the Rev. Al
Sharpton's National Action Network that that characterization maligned his son's
memory and did not justify his death.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was not a wild child," the father said. "This is just an excuse, or just
pretending."
</P>
<P>
	   Saikou Diallo also tried to bolster the reputation of Soundview, the Bronx
neighborhood where his son lived while working as a vendor. Defense lawyers have
characterized it as one of the city's worst areas, although it is actually a
working-class neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a quiet, nice, decent area," Saikou Diallo said. "This is not a
wild jungle where you can hunt a young child because of their color."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton, who has led months of protests over the shooting and attended the
trial with the Diallo family, was sharply critical of the defense lawyers'
arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys "stood up in front of this father and this mother and tried in no
uncertain terms to castigate the reputation of Amadou Diallo," the preacher
said. "They said that Amadou was not a saint. They don't know what saints are.
... A saint is someone God uses for a higher purpose. ... God has taken this
young man and made him more than anyone could have imagined."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the four officers - who pleaded innocent - have said Diallo
ducked into his apartment building's vestibule and failed to stop on the
officers' command, then pointed a dark object which they believed was a gun. It
turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorneys said the cops are extremely remorseful and disputed
contentions that Diallo's race - he was black - had anything to do with the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's mother said she hoped to see justice done. But despite a public
crusade, for the victim's family, the private anguish is as fresh as ever.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have the same feeling," Kadiatou Diallo said. "Nothing can erase the
pain of losing a son. Since then, the time has passed, but it is like
yesterday."

<HEADLINE> French, Albanians Clash in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- French peacekeepers clashed with
ethnic Albanians in northwestern Kosovo on Saturday, using clubs and tear gas to
force back hundreds who tried to push their way across a bridge to the
Serb-controlled side of a divided town.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second straight day of confrontations between peacekeeping troops
and ethnic Albanians in Kosovska Mitrovica, and the fourth day of violence since
a rocket attack on a U.N. bus killed two elderly Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-one people, including 11 French soldiers, were injured in Saturday's
clash. Ethnic Albanian doctors said one boy suffered a gunshot wound, possibly
from a sniper on the Serb side of the Ibar River that divides the city. Three
French peacekeepers were hospitalized, but their injuries were not serious, said
Lt. Mathieu Mabin, a spokesman for the French troops. Five soldiers were injured
in a similar clash Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, two ethnic Albanians wounded earlier this week died, raising the
death toll from the violence to 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest clash broke out after hundreds of ethnic Albanians gathered at
the bridge, first taunting French troops, then throwing stones. As the crowd
surged forward, the French responded with tear gas, stun grenades and
nightsticks to drive the protesters back.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO-led peacekeepers were struggling to restore order in Kosovo's most
multiethnic -- and most ethnically troubled -- city. A German unit was sent to
reinforce the French if the crowd tries to cross the bridge again.
</P>
<P>
	   About 9,000 Serbs control the north bank and 90,000 ethnic Albanians live on
the south side of the town, 30 miles north of the province's capital, Pristina.
The bridge separates the sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Tensions escalated sharply after the Wednesday rocket attack on the bus,
part of a U.N. service to ferry Serbs through predominantly ethnic Albanian
areas of the province. In apparent retaliation, two ethnic Albanian men were
shot to death Thursday night in the Serb-controlled section of Kosovska
Mitrovica. Shortly afterward, grenades were hurled at two Serb cafes, injuring
up to 25 Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest of the dead were killed in a series of clashes and shootings that
swept the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the province, violence was on the rise. Serbian media reported
an elderly Serb was shot dead late Friday by a masked gunman in the
American-controlled town of Gnjilane.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the presence of NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo, violence is still
common. Ethnic Albanians often attack Serbs as revenge for the 18-month
crackdown Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched against separatists in
the province.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's ultranationalist information minister, Aleksandar
Vucic, blamed the United Nations and NATO for the recent bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They allow the (ethnic) Albanians to kill the Serbs just because of their
ethnicity,'' Vucic said.
</P>
<P>
	   The leader of the Serb community here, Oliver Ivanovic, called for a Serb
protest rally Monday. Ivanovic said he told the NATO and U.N. missions after the
bus attack that it was still possible to prevent an escalation of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But after the first grenade was thrown into the Serb cafe, there was no
force that could stop the masses,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Presidential Campaign Over  </HEADLINE>
   By EUGENE BRCIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- The two presidential candidates vying to succeed
late Croatian leader Franjo Tudjman on Saturday wound down a campaign that has
been long on style and short on issues.
</P>
<P>
	   For most Croats, the country's key political issues were settled with
Tudjman's death on Dec. 10 and the subsequent defeat of his nationalistic
Croatian Democratic Union -- in power for nearly a decade -- in parliamentary
elections Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
	   The victorious center-left governing coalition has pledged to overhaul the
autocratic system Tudjman left behind by reducing presidential power and
strengthening parliament. Broad support for that policy left little room for big
promises during the run-off presidential campaign, so candidates Stipe Mesic and
Drazen Budisa have concentrated on presentation.
</P>
<P>
	   One local columnist referred to the election as a contest to become the
``Anti-Tudjman Hero,'' saying the candidate who proves most dissimilar to the
late statesman will win in Monday's voting.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic, a witty and cheerful 65-year-old who seems like Tudjman's opposite,
leads most opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Budisa, 51, who trailed Mesic by more than 13 percentage points in the first
round of voting Jan. 24, may be slightly more serious, but he is still a far cry
from Tudjman. He invited the public to join him for lunch by an artificial lake
on Saturday, the last day of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Mesic and Budisa have endorsed radical economic reforms, refugee
returns and the need to mend ties with the international community --
particularly with the international war crimes tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia. They also have guaranteed a shift in relations with neighboring
Bosnia, where the previous government harbored territorial aspirations towards
lands dominated by Bosnian Croats.

<HEADLINE> Finland Focuses on Austrian Problem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- A heated debate on Austrian politics took center
stage Saturday on the eve of Finland's presidential election, with candidates
disagreeing about the European Union's measures against Vienna.
</P>
<P>
	   The two main candidates in Sunday's balloting staked out opposite stances on
the issue -- one saying the EU was right to cut government ties to Austria for
allowing a far-right party into the governing coalition, the other saying the EU
had no right to interfere.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a question that has come to the forefront of the election debate,''
candidate and Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen said Saturday at a news conference
in Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle, 515 miles north of Helsinki. Halonen is
hoping to become Finland's first female president.
</P>
<P>
	   Halonen, a Social Democrat, and former Prime Minister Esko Aho of the
opposition Center Party, clashed late Friday in a television debate over
Austrian right-wing leader Joerg Haider's politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Aho said he disagreed with Haider's Freedom Party but added that ``the EU
has no right to interfere in member countries' domestic politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   EU countries, including Finland, announced measures to politically isolate
Austria after the far-right, anti-immigration party joined Austria's new
coalition government on Friday. Haider has praised Adolf Hitler's ``orderly
employment'' policies and lauded veterans of the Waffen SS as ``decent people of
good character,'' although he later apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   Halonen defended the policy of cutting government ties with Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We wanted to distance ourselves from the party whose leader has publicly
played down the crimes of the Nazis,'' Halonen said in the debate on MTV3.
</P>
<P>
	   EU-Austrian relations provided the first major point of disagreement in
months of campaigning. The candidates have similar stances on most issues, and
observers had expected their race to turn into a battle of the sexes.
</P>
<P>
	   The race has heated up in recent days. Surveys show Aho has gradually caught
up to Halonen, who previously had a double-digit lead. Turnout on Sunday was
expected to be high, with 37 percent of the 4.2 million person electorate having
already cast ballots in a week of advance voting.

<HEADLINE> Grandmother charged with endangerment for taking nude photos of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) - A 65-year-old grandmother has been charged with
three counts of endangering the welfare of a child for taking nude photos of her
two young granddaughters, police said.
<P>
	   Marian Rubin of Montclair was arrested Thursday night when she arrived at a
photo store in Upper Montclair to pick up her pictures after developing lab
workers there notified police.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin, a school social worker in the Belleville district and published
photographer, allegedly shot photographs of her granddaughters posing in several
positions, many of which showed their private parts, said Montclair Police Chief
Thomas Russo.
</P>
<P>
	   "The poses could be considered provocative in nature," Russo told The
Star-Ledger of Newark in Saturday's editions. The girls are about 4 and 6 years
old, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Mautone, Rubin's attorney, said the charges against his client are
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
	   Mautone said Rubin is a serious portrait photographer and has been taking
pictures for decades which have been exhibited locally. He added Simon &AMP;
Schuster recently agreed to create a book of her work.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin also studied photography at the New School and the International
Center for Photography, both in New York, Mautone said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This woman is a renowned, well-known artist who has spent the major part of
her life taking photos," Mautone said. "These photos are not in any way
prurient, suggestive or sensual. It's the kind of pictures many of my friends
have of kids that age."
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin's work has recently appeared in New Jersey Monthly magazine and in
books by Soho Photo, a publishing company in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge Sally Floria approved a search warrant Thursday night
for Rubin's home, where police found additional photographs, Russo said.
</P>
<P>
	   A second search warrant was granted Friday evening, in which police seized a
computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Additional charges may be filed against Rubin, Russo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin was released on $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Mautone said the children's parents were aware of the photos and were not
concerned.
</P>
<P>
	   "She is as loving a grandmother as I have ever seen, and these are two
well-adjusted young girls," Mautone said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mautone noted that Rubin over the years has focused on portrait work which
included nude subjects.
</P>
<P>
	   "She wound up in this situation because law enforcement overcorrects for
every problem," Mautone said. "It's sort of outrageous that a woman with this
kind of background gets put in this situation."
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin has worked as a social worker in the Belleville district since 1968,
and is part of a team that creates teaching plans for children with learning or
behavioral problems, according to Superintendent Joseph Ciccone.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm surprised," Ciccone said. "There's never been a problem with her here."
</P>
<P>
	   Ciccone added that the school board had not been aware of the arrest, so no
action has been taken.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, another New Jersey photographer faced similar charges. An amateur
photographer from Bernardsville was charged with taking 110 nude photos of his
6-year-old daughter to use in his photography class. He entered a pre-trial
intervention program and the charges were later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   Although artwork is protected under the Constitution as freedom of
expression, law enforcement officials tend to have a narrow definition of what
is considered art, said Deborah Jacobs, executive director for the ACLU of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there were any questions, police and prosecutors would err on the side
of protecting the child," Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
	   The law requires anyone who has evidence of child abuse to report it to
authorities or risk being charged themselves, said Charlotte Smith, a
spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutors Office.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hard-Liners Fight Cartoons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QOM, Iran (AP) -- A political cartoonist who portrayed an Iranian cleric as a
crocodile was arrested Saturday, his colleagues said, and angry clergymen and
theology students demonstrated for a third day against government tolerance of
such comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The cartoonist, Neekahang Kowsar, was imprisoned without bail after Iran's
Press Supervisory Board referred the case against Azad -- the reformist
newspaper that ran the cartoons -- to court, Kowsar's co-workers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The press board also issued a warning reminding newspapers and magazines
that it is illegal to publish ``any insults to Islam, officials, organizations,
institutions and those who are religiously respected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Azad published a notice Saturday saying it was voluntarily suspending
publication for three days ``to soothe tensions.'' It also has published
apologies, saying cartoons that depicted hard-line cleric Ayatollah Mohammad
Taqi Mesbah Yazdi as a fat thug and a crocodile -- a symbol of treachery and
deception -- were not intended to be offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's cartoons were the first time a publication had so pointedly
lampooned the clergy since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Newspapers have been in
the vanguard of Iranian reformists' struggle for greater democracy and fewer
religious constraints.
</P>
<P>
	   Outrage against the cartoons continued Saturday. More than 5,000 theology
students and clergymen demonstrated for a third day in the holy city of Qom, a
bastion of conservative clerics 80 miles south of Tehran. Seminaries throughout
Qom were closed to allow students to join the protests at the Azam Mosque.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters condemned Azad and called for the resignation of Culture Minister
Ayatollah Mohajerani, who is responsible for press licensing. A day earlier,
demonstrators had been demanding Mohajerani's execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the day, state-run television said the protest had ended on the
order of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Kowsar's cartoons showed a fat thug, with dollars inside his stomach,
ready to club a scrawny journalist and demanding: ``Confess immediately. Where
have you hidden the dollars.'' Yazdi has claimed that a former CIA chief
traveled to Iran with a case full of dollars to finance some newspapers -- a
veiled stab at the credibility of reformist journalists. He did not identify the
former CIA chief or the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   The other cartoon portrayed a crocodile shedding false tears to lament the
``cultural invasion'' by foreigners in Iran. Protesters said it alluded to Yazdi
because the Persian word for crocodile -- temsah -- sounds similar to Mesbah.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the 1997 election of reformist President Mohammad Khatami, hard-liners
have closed down several pro-reform newspapers. Last year, they failed in their
effort to impeach Mohajerani for allowing reformist papers to flourish.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The political attack against the culture minister is part of a general
plan against reform just before the elections,'' said the reformist
Peyam-e-Azadi newspaper, referring to Feb. 18 parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine To Shut Chernobyl in 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said Saturday that
the Chernobyl nuclear plant will be shut down this year, as Western countries
have long demanded.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kuchma reiterated to U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson that the
plant will close only after American, Ukrainian and international experts work
out an aid deal to help compensate Ukraine for the loss of the energy Chernobyl
provides, a presidential spokesman said. Kuchma did not give a specific date for
the closure.
</P>
<P>
	   Chernobyl's reactor No. 4 exploded in 1986 and covered much of Europe with a
radioactive cloud in the world's worst nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Ukraine promised in 1995 to close the plant by 2000 in exchange for
international aid. But Ukrainian officials have delayed preparations for the
closure, saying foreign lenders have lagged on funding for two new nuclear
reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson welcomed Kuchma's announcement, and said the United States would
help Ukraine build a thermal power plant and help mobilize funds for the other
nuclear reactors, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson also praised the former Soviet republic's efforts to reform and
privatize its energy sector. He arrived in Ukraine's capital, Kiev, Saturday for
a two-day visit to meet with Kuchma and his newly appointed government.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Threatens Israeli Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah's leader threatened Saturday to fire
rockets at Israel in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes on a southern Lebanon
village that wounded eight people.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah called on his guerrillas to ``be prepared and ready
your Katyushas (rockets), because what happened yesterday calls for retaliation,
and we will retaliate at the appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was referring to an Israeli strike on Barish village, 10 miles south of
the port city of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike was an apparent attempt to assassinate an unidentified guerrilla
commander. A rocket hit the guerrilla commander's car, injuring him. Another
struck a house, wounding seven civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Nasrallah said the strike violated an April 1996 agreement designed to
protect civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Israel wants to go on, then we will have no choice but to use
Katyushas,'' he said, referring to Hezbollah's often-used retaliatory tactic of
firing on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Nasrallah's threat came at a ceremony honoring guerrillas who assassinated
Col. Akl Hashem, second in command of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army
militia, on Jan. 6, and three Israeli soldiers the following day. According to a
Hezbollah statement, Nasrallah warned that ``whoever dares to assume Hashem's
position should dig his own grave and buy his burial shroud.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah is fighting to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen
from a buffer zone Israel established in 1985 to protect its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Bridgewater woman freed after arrest in China for belonging to  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) - A 45-year-old Bridgewater woman imprisoned in
China for her belief in an outlawed spiritual movement has been freed by Chinese
authorities.
<P>
	   Jackie Yu was arrested on Jan. 23 for belonging to Falun Gong, a group that
has been targeted by the Chinese government. She was released from a prison on
Beijing's east side about 4 p.m. Beijing time on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was walking along Tiananmen Square taking pictures," Yu told the Courier
News of Bridgewater in Saturday's editions. "That is a public area. Then I got
arrested."
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after her release, Yu said she went back to the place of her arrest,
and witnessed beatings and arrests of fellow Falun Gong practitioners by Chinese
police. Meanwhile, other Chinese around the world were celebrating the start of
the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 1999, thousands of Falun Gong practitioners protested the Chinese
government in Beijing, alarming Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those who practiced Falun Gong in China have been jailed as a result
of a government crackdown that began in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Published reports have described beatings and torture of Falun Gong
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   Falun Gong combines slow-motion exercises and Buddhist and Taoist ideas
believed to promote health and morality.
</P>
<P>
	   Yu remains free in her Beijing home, but said she could not find her
passport. She also said her phone calls are being monitored by Chinese
authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe people are listening," said Yu, who refused to talk about her
time in prison. "It's a long story," she said. "It's not just a couple of
sentences."
</P>
<P>
	   Yu said her 14-year-old son, David Wei Cui, was safe and was staying with
friends.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she is unsure when she might return to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Yu, a Falun Gong practitioner for the past two years, had planned to visit
China from Jan. 8 to Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Yu's family and friends had appealed to American legislators to have her
released.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, about 100 members of the spiritual sect demonstrated outside
U.N. headquarters in New York, denouncing the government crackdown on the group
in China.
</P>
<P>
	   The group claims to have millions of followers worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Germany Cancels Superfast Train Link  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany announced Saturday it has given up plans to operate a
superfast levitating train between Berlin and Hamburg, leaving the future of the
cutting-edge technology in doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``maglev'' project, debated for two decades, was canceled after the
government balked at rising costs for the 185-mile link and the German railways
complained that it would lose money.
</P>
<P>
	   The futuristic Transrapid was supposed to whisk passengers through the
German countryside at 250 mph using electrically generated magnetic forces to
levitate over its track.
</P>
<P>
	   It was hoped the link would cut traveling time between the two major cities
by two thirds to just under an hour. It would have been the first intercity link
of its kind anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Transport Minister Reinhard Klimmt said on Saturday that Germany would try
to find a shorter alternative route for the Transrapid within two years, but it
was unclear where that might be.
</P>
<P>
	   But Klimmt, announcing the decision after meeting with railway executives
and the train's builders, said the railways had decided the project made no
economic sense. Studies predicting far fewer passengers than originally
estimated bolstered skeptics.

<P>
	   The Transrapid had been doomed since 1998, when a center-left government
opposed to the project came to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government effectively killed the project by
capping spending at the $3.1 billion pledged by the previous administration --
though the total cost was expected to be closer to $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the industrial partners in the project, notably DaimlerChrysler's
rail technology unit Adtranz, also recently backed off.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany has kept up hopes of selling the Transrapid in China and United
States, but the chances of foreign sales appear slim unless the train goes into
regular service somewhere in Germany. Possibilities mentioned by officials
include a city-airport link in Munich or Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, a decision about building such a train has been held up by similar
cost questions as in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists welcomed the demise of the Transrapid, having argued for
years that it would produce deafening sound waves along its route and present a
health hazard with its electromagnetic radiation.

<HEADLINE> IRA Says It Will Not Disarm  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Irish Republican Army commanders said
Saturday that British and Protestant demands will not influence whether or not
they disarm -- and the group emphasized that it had never pledged to give up its
arms at all.
</P>
<P>
	   The outlawed group's statement left the centerpiece of Northern Ireland's
peace accord, the Protestant-Catholic government, in continued peril.
</P>
<P>
	   The British government says it intends to strip the 9-week-old coalition
Cabinet of its powers on Friday if the IRA doesn't promise to disarm. The IRA's
response Saturday fell far short of that, mixing optimistic-sounding rhetoric
with a determination to resist political pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   In its statement, the IRA emphasized its willingness to ``support efforts to
secure the resolution of the arms issue.'' But it didn't directly say whether it
would begin scrapping its weapons dumps in cooperation with a disarmament
commission, as the 1998 Good Friday peace accord envisaged.
</P>
<P>
	   Any solution ``will not be on British or (Protestant) unionist terms, nor
will it be advanced by British legislative threats,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA statement came as Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-linked Sinn Fein
party, met with David Trimble, who leads Northern Ireland's major Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, and holds the top post in the four-party Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither leader would discuss the content of their meeting, which lasted only
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Trimble said the IRA statement had nothing new to say and was ``most
unfortunate.'' Adams said it reflected anger over the British government's
``threat and ultimatum.''
</P>
<P>
	   The province's Cabinet was formed two months ago following a Sinn
Fein-Ulster Unionist deal brokered by American mediator George Mitchell. The
Ulster Unionists agreed to form a Cabinet with Sinn Fein. But in exchange, the
Ulster Unionists expected the IRA to begin disarming in January.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA then opened discussions with the province's long-stymied disarmament
commission. But the commission reported Jan. 31 that its talks with IRA leaders
had produced no concrete gains, triggering an Ulster Unionist threat to withdraw
from the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   The British government's first priority is to discourage Trimble and his
colleagues from resigning. With Protestant opinion split down the middle on the
merits of sharing power with Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionists might not have
sufficient support to win re-election if they resign. That would make it
impossible to start the Cabinet up again.
</P>
<P>
	   Rendering the Cabinet powerless but intact would avoid that scenario. It
would allow for powers to be returned from London to Belfast if the deadlock is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   But to rising British and Ulster Unionist annoyance, the Sinn Fein-IRA
movement insists it isn't violating the letter of the Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The accord required Sinn Fein leaders -- among them prominent ex-IRA figures
-- to use ``whatever influence they may have'' to try to achieve IRA disarmament
by May 2000. As an outlawed group, the IRA couldn't be directly represented in
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA has never entered into any agreement, undertaking or understanding
at any time with anyone on any aspect of decommissioning. We have not broken our
commitment or betrayed anyone,'' the IRA said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cabinet's senior Catholic politician, Seamus Mallon, said Saturday that
the Sinn Fein-IRA position is deliberately misleading.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein and the IRA are wrong to characterize disarmament as ``some
amorphous thing that somehow or another was an addendum to the Good Friday
agreement. It isn't,'' said Mallon, deputy leader of the main Catholic-supported
party, the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party. ``It's central to it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the vast majority of people in Ireland expected the IRA ``to answer
two questions: Will it disarm? And if so, when?''

<HEADLINE> Turkey FM Welcomes Ties With Greece  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- As Turkey's foreign minister toured Athens on
Saturday, Turkish Premier Bulent Ecevit welcomed warming ties with rival Greece,
saying he hoped Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis would visit Turkey soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The establishment of an atmosphere of dialogue between Turkey and Greece
has begun to give positive and hopeful results,'' Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
	   The traditional rivals began efforts last year to ease longstanding tension.
On Friday, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou signed a series of confidence-building agreements in Athens.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Cem toured the Acropolis and expressed support for Greek
efforts to restore the so-called Elgin Marbles, removed from the Parthenon
during Ottoman rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I fully support the Greek government's effort and quest to have their own
properties back, and if there is any way we can be of some assistance, then of
course we shall be,'' Cem told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Parthenon marbles were taken to Great Britain in the early 19th century
by Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
	   Greece has campaigned for their return for decades. Britain maintains the
sculptures were acquired legally.
</P>
<P>
	   Cem ended his three-day visit to Greece on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> 20,000 Protest France Oil Spill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France (AP) -- About 20,000 demonstrators gathered in the northwest
French city of Nantes on Saturday to show their anger over a two-month-old oil
spill that has contaminated the country's Atlantic coastline.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmental activists and ocean specialists were among those protesting
the ecological damage caused after the Maltese-registered ``Erika'' tanker split
in two in rough waters Dec. 12, spilling 3 million gallons of heavy oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of the Franco-Belgian oil company TotalFina, which chartered
the tanker, was a frequent target of the crowd's shouts and slogans.
</P>
<P>
	   TotalFina Chairman Thierry Desmarest has said the company would spend about
$108 million to clean the coasts and pump out the oil remaining in the sunken
tanker.
</P>
<P>
	   The 24-year-old vessel was transporting oil from Rotterdam in the
Netherlands to Leghorn, Italy. The two halves of the ship, still underwater,
contain about 6 million gallons of heavy oil, and some of it has seeped out.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's protests came on the same day the French food safety agency,
AFSSA, said Atlantic seafood on the market was ``without risk,'' lifting
controls put in place after the spill.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 900 shellfish farms have been closed along the coast since the
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary report on the spill by the Bureau of Inquiries into Sea
Accidents said the tanker's structure was probably faulty, causing it to break
apart.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also criticized the tanker's owner, the Italian firm Savarese,
and an Italian company responsible for the ship's safety checkups.

<HEADLINE> French Filmmaker Autant-Lara Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France (AP) -- Claude Autant-Lara, the French director known for his
caustic jabs at bourgeois society and his right-wing political stances late in
life, died early Saturday in a clinic in Antibes, a funeral home said. He was
98.
</P>
<P>
	   One of France's most prolific directors, Autant-Lara directed more than 30
films, many of them classics of 1940s and 1950s French cinema.
</P>
<P>
	   His career reached its height in the 1950s with films such as ``Le Diable au
Corps,'' or ``Devil in the Flesh,'' which scandalized France with its account of
a schoolboy's affair with a woman whose husband was away at war.
</P>
<P>
	   Many attacked the film, calling it pro-adultery and antifamily, but
Autant-Lara had already found his voice as a provocateur.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in 1901 to an architect father and an actress mother, Autant-Lara
discovered the cinema while studying at France's prestigious School of Fine
Arts. He made his first short films in the 1920s before heading to Hollywood in
the 1930s to supervise the French versions of Buster Keaton films, among others.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of his best-known works include ``Le Rouge et le Noir,'' or ``The Red
and the Black,'' based on Stendahl's novel, and ``La Traversee de Paris,'' or
``Four Bags Full,'' an account of two men stealthily crossing Paris at night
during the German occupation.
</P>
<P>
	   Other films include ``Le Comte de Monte Christo,'' and ``En Cas de
Malheur,'' or ``Love is My Profession,'' with Brigitte Bardot and Jean Gabin.
</P>
<P>
	   Autant-Lara was not popular with New Wave filmmakers such as Francois
Truffaut, who criticized his films as outdated and scorned his reliance on the
dialogue and plots of his screenwriters.
</P>
<P>
	   By the 1970s Autant-Lara's career was in decline, and his last film,
``Gloria,'' was largely ignored by critics.
</P>
<P>
	   The filmmaker took the spotlight again during the 1980s when he came out in
support of far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
	   Autant-Lara himself was elected to the European Parliament in 1989 as a
member of the far-right National Front, though he soon resigned after the
monthly magazine ``Globe'' quoted him as saying a French politician who survived
a concentration camp had been ``missed'' by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
	   Autant-Lara, who spent much of his later life in the South of France, died
after a long illness, the funeral home said. His funeral will be held privately
at his family's request.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Sen. Pushes Victims' Rights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Constitution should protect the rights of crime
victims just as it gives defendants the rights to remain silent and to have an
attorney, Sen. John Kyl said Saturday in the weekly Republican radio address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is why victims from all over the country are asking that we allow al
states to vote on a federal constitutional amendment that would establish a
basic floor of crime victims' rights for all Americans,'' the Arizona Republican
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Proposals to amend the Constitution require approval by two-thirds of the
House and Senate, followed by ratification by three-fourths of the states. Few
such proposals survive the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyl said Arizona and 32 other states had passed protections for crime
victims, who under the Constitution have no right to be present at trial or to
be informed of hearings in their case. They also have no right to be heard at
sentencing or parole hearings, and they have no right to challenge delays in
their case.
</P>
<P>
	   A proposed constitutional amendment, due to be voted on in the Senate soon,
would establish these rights and also ensure that victims are notified of their
assailant's release or escape from custody. Victims also would be entitled to
restitution from a convicted offender.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to victims rights, Kyl said the nation should follow Arizona's
lead by enacting a tax credit for teachers, who often pay for classroom
materials out of their own pockets. He said the average teacher, in kindergarten
through high school, spends more than $400 in personal funds every year.

<HEADLINE> Leader: German Army Should Aid Cops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Germany should amend its postwar constitution to let
soldiers help police fight crime, a leader of the main conservative party said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany's 1949 constitution bars the military from domestic law enforcement
because of the Nazi past, though it lets soldiers help in disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfgang Schaeuble, head of the opposition Christian Democrats, said
international terrorism and organized crime demand ``a new understanding of the
cooperation between police and the armed forces.'' Germany's government may need
opposition support to pass plans to open the military to women, and Schaeuble
indicated that a wider domestic role for the army could be his party's price.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble's comments at an international security conference in Munich were
an attempt to regain some political momentum for his party, which is in the
midst of a slush fund scandal centered on former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

<HEADLINE> Bob Marley Legacy Grows  </HEADLINE>
    By MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- In Trench Town, it's as if Bob Marley never died.
</P>
<P>
	   Men and women from around the neighborhood still mingle in the "yard" -- a
park on First Street where the reggae singer began singing with his band, the
Wailers.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, with a resurgence of nostalgia fed by millennial recognition of
Marley's work, they are hard at work turning a few dilapidated buildings in one
of Kingston's poorest neighborhoods into a museum to mark what would have been
the singer's 55th birthday on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Reggae musicians plan a free concert to coincide with the anniversary. And
the island's two major television stations are airing a musical tribute to
Jamaica's most famous musical export -- a national hero whose music embodies
people's hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
	   Marley died of cancer in 1981 at the age of 36.
</P>
<P>
	   The current round of Marley mania began in December when the British
Broadcasting Corp. declared Marley's song "One Love" the anthem of the century
and Time magazine named 1977's "Exodus" the album of the century.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every song is a classic, from the messages of love to the anthems of
revolution," Time wrote of "Exodus." "But more than that, the album is a
political and cultural nexus, drawing inspiration from the Third World and then
giving voice to it the world over."
</P>
<P>
	   "Marley has always been popular here, but that made people proud," said
Kevin Chang O'Brien, author of Reggae Routes, a history of Jamaican music.
"Jamaica's a small country. ... When the rest of the world, countries we tend to
look up to like America and Britain, certify it, we can let our feelings loose."
</P>
<P>
	   Radio Jamaica disc jockey Richard Burgess said the surge in Marley nostalgia
also is fed by growing despair over crime and economic woes in the Caribbean
nation.
</P>
<P>
	   "He spoke to a lot of the suffering that many people are now dealing with,
they find strength in his music," Burgess said. "Much of his music was the cry
of the oppressed, the poor ... but there were also bright songs, messages of
hope and redemption that people find solace in."
</P>
<P>
	   In "the yard," tree trunks are painted the black, yellow, red and green of
Marley's Rastafari faith -- the homegrown religion that reveres Ethiopia's
deceased Emperor Haile Selassie as a god and considers black people living
outside Africa as captives in a foreign land. Though the museum here won't be
completed for some time, the community plans to officially open it on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Marley retained strong links to Trench Town even after becoming wealthy and
internationally famous. Trench Town resident Joel Brown recalled how Marley
would buy food for the people of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   "The pickney (children) never go hungry when Bob was here," said Brown, 44,
his eyes misty and voice filled with reverence.
</P>
<P>
	   He may not be exaggerating. Colin Leslie, the director of a number of
Marley's companies in the 1970s, was once asked if it was true Marley
financially supported 4,000 people in Trench Town.
</P>
<P>
	   Leslie's answer: "It was much more than that!"

<HEADLINE> Haider Means Change in Austria Govt  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- With sanctions from abroad and riots at home,
Austria has seen dramatic change since Joerg Haider's anti-immigrant party
became half of the government Friday. More -- and different -- change than
Haider's voters expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Gone are the staid and cozy leaderships formed since the end of World War II
by establishment parties that brought Austrians from postwar hardship to
prosperous democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   In came Haider's Freedom Party, empowered by an electorate eager to clean
Austrian politics of inertia and cronyism and embracing its view that foreigners
clamoring at the borders were threatening each Austrian's well-being.
</P>
<P>
	   But other changes are less welcome. The party's anti-foreigner stance and
Haider's past praise of the Nazi era have left Austria under political
quarantine and rent by internal dissent.
</P>
<P>
	   Average Austrians remain alternately worried and defiant, their national
pride replaced by anxiety as governments reduce relations or withdraw
ambassadors and foreign tourists begin canceling trips.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We needed change, but not turmoil,'' Andreas Kuehrer, a waiter, said as he
watched a televised clash between riot police and anti-Haider demonstrators --
not in Indonesia, South Korea or any of ``those places over there,'' but in ``my
Vienna, the city where nothing like this ever happens.''
</P>
<P>
	   But things have changed since the Oct. 3 elections, when many Austrians
rejected the political parties they had supported for decades, the ones that
gave them Europe's second-highest living standard, one of the lowest crime rates
anywhere and restored respectability after finally facing their Nazi legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we hoped for was renewal, new faces and new ideas,'' said pensioner
Michael Rudolf, whose vote helped catapult the Freedom Party into second place.
``We wanted a better Austria for Austrians, but the others are not going to let
it happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Others'' -- the belief that outsiders are responsible for Austria's
problems -- permeates the country's recent history.
</P>
<P>
	   Austrians fervently supported Adolf Hitler, their native son. According to
the Vienna-based Jewish Documentation Center, headed by Nazi hunter Simon
Wiesenthal, Austrians were accountable in some way for the death of 3 million
Jews -- about half those killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
	   That was quickly forgotten after the war. Austrian statesmen negotiating
with Allies for their independence insisted Austria was a Nazi victim, not a
perpetrator. Anxious to prevent a future union between Austria and Germany, the
allies agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Although more than 99 percent of Austrians purportedly voted for their
country's annexation by Germany in 1938, the postwar Austrian constitution
endorsed by the Allies recognizes ``that Hitler's Germany ... annexed Austria by
force.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Austrians seldom face up to unpleasant aspects of their past,'' the late
psychologist Erwin Ringel said in a 1989 interview. Ringel, whose book ``The
Austrian Soul'' looks at his countrymen's ability to sublimate responsibility,
said the tendency to blame others was a widespread Austrian characteristic.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Waldheim won Austria's presidency by claiming he was a victim, first of
the Nazis who ruled his country and later of the international community, which
called him to task for hiding his wartime past as a lieutenant in a German unit
associated with atrocities. Other officials associated with the Hitler era held
high postwar government posts.
</P>
<P>
	   The allies also allowed the formation of a new party -- the WDU -- despite
its ``German nationalist'' program and a membership list permeated by former
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1986, by then called the Freedom Party, it elected Haider its leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Under his predecessors, the Freedom Party was marginal, seemingly trapped in
the opposition. Except for Freedom's brief stint as the Socialists' junior
coalition partner, Austria's postwar government had been ruled by either the
Socialists or the centrist People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the two major parties were rewarded with state jobs and other
benefits. By the time Haider took over his party, political affiliation and good
connections generally meant more than qualifications for even prospective school
principals and hospital doctors. Unions and other employee groups created by the
two parties ensured that membership meant professional advancement.
</P>
<P>
	   The line between the two parties blurred further after 1987. Too weak to
rule alone, they formed a coalition government, leaving a vacuum in the
opposition that Haider's party quickly filled.
</P>
<P>
	   Though prosperity grew, so did unease about big government. The perception
that those without connections did not have a chance mixed with outrage over
reports of corruption and secret deals by a government seemingly unaccountable
to the electorate
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's party stepped in as the advocate of the little people, attacking
the ruling parties and their leaders, often in the street language of their
growing camp of supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   A natural orator, Haider also knew how to exploit lingering pro-Nazi
sentiment and growing fears that Austria, an island of prosperity, was in
growing danger of being overrun by foreigners -- either in the form of cheap
labor or criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the government owned up to Austria's role under Hitler and enacted
restitution laws, and critics condemned Haider's praise of the Nazi era and his
party's racism-tinged stance on foreigners, the Freedom Party gained strength in
each election.
</P>
<P>
	   The balance finally tipped on Oct. 3. The Freedom Party narrowly outpolled
the People's Party, setting the stage for the months of torturous negotiations
that ended with Haider's party sharing power.
</P>
<P>
	   But the resulting sanctions, riots, strike threats and canceled vacations is
change that most Austrians can do without.
</P>
<P>
	   Worse is yet to come, warn analysts, predicting political polarization,
growing labor and civil unrest -- and isolation for Austria far beyond that of
the Waldheim era.
</P>
<P>
	   ``During the time of Kurt Waldheim, we had a lonely man'' as president,
writes Kristoph Kotanko of the Kurier daily. ``Now, we have a lonely
government.''

<HEADLINE> 19-year-old dead in Columbia dorm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A 19-year-old woman was found dead, with slash wounds to
her throat, in a Columbia University dormitory Saturday, police said.
<P>
	   The woman's name was not available and it was not immediately clear if she
was a Columbia student, said Suzanne Trimel, a spokeswoman for the university.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were called to Ruggles Hall, an undergraduate dormitory on West 114th
Street, around 2:15 p.m., and found the woman with slash wounds to the throat,
police said. She was declared dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimel said she did not know what the cause of death was and had no other
information. Police also released no details.
</P>
<P>
	   The death occurred a block from the apartment where a 26-year-old Columbia
Law School student, Lynda Hong, was killed in 1998. Police charged an
ex-boyfriend with slashing her throat, but he pleaded innocent and blamed
another of his girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
	   Justin Lappen, 19, a Columbia sophomore, said the eight-floor dorm building
where the body was found Saturday was generally considered safe. He said a
security guard was at the entrance around the clock and electronic keys were

<HEADLINE> French, Kosovars Clash for 2d Day  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- French peacekeepers clashed with
ethnic Albanians in northwestern Kosovo on Saturday, using clubs and tear gas to
force back hundreds who tried to push their way across a bridge to the
Serb-controlled side of a divided town.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second straight day of confrontations between peacekeeping troops
and ethnic Albanians in Kosovska Mitrovica, and the fourth day of violence since
a rocket attack on a U.N. bus killed two elderly Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-one people, including 11 French soldiers, were injured in Saturday's
clash.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethnic Albanian doctors said one boy suffered a gunshot wound, possibly from
a sniper on the Serb side of the Ibar River that divides the city.
</P>
<P>
	   But the boy's father has insisted his son, Adnan Bajrami, was shot by French
troops during the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The French wounded him. They shot him,'' said Idriz Bajrami.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the French peacekeepers, Lt. Col. Patrick Chanliau, said an
investigation was being conducted into the shooting, but that ``it is
technically impossible'' the troops could have shot the boy because they were
only equipped with crowd control equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   The father's allegation could further strain already tense relations between
French peacekeepers and local ethnic Albanians, who have accused the troops of
failing to protect them in the Serb-controlled northern part of Kosovska
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   Three French peacekeepers were hospitalized after the clash, but their
injuries were not serious, said Lt. Mathieu Mabin, a spokesman for the French
troops. Five soldiers were injured in a similar clash Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, two ethnic Albanians wounded earlier this week died, raising the
death toll from the violence to 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest disturbances broke out after hundreds of ethnic Albanians
gathered at the bridge, first taunting French troops, then throwing stones. As
the crowd surged forward, the French responded with tear gas, stun grenades and
nightsticks to drive the protesters back.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO-led peacekeepers were struggling to restore order in Kosovo's most
multiethnic -- and most ethnically troubled -- city. A German unit was sent to
reinforce the French if the crowd tries to cross the bridge again.
</P>
<P>
	   About 9,000 Serbs control the north bank and 90,000 ethnic Albanians live on
the south side of the town, 30 miles north of the province's capital, Pristina.
The bridge separates the sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Tensions escalated sharply after the Wednesday rocket attack on the bus,
part of a U.N. service to ferry Serbs through predominantly ethnic Albanian
areas of the province.
</P>
<P>
	   In apparent retaliation, two ethnic Albanian men were shot to death Thursday
night in the Serb-controlled section of Kosovska Mitrovica. Shortly afterward,
grenades were hurled at two Serb cafes, injuring up to 25 Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest of the dead were killed in a series of clashes and shootings that
swept the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the province, violence was on the rise. Serbian media reported
an elderly Serb was shot dead late Friday by a masked gunman in the
American-controlled town of Gnjilane.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the presence of NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo, violence is still
common. Ethnic Albanians often attack Serbs as revenge for the 18-month
crackdown Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched against separatists in
the province.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's ultranationalist information minister, Aleksandar
Vucic, blamed the United Nations and NATO for the recent bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They allow the (ethnic) Albanians to kill the Serbs just because of their
ethnicity,'' Vucic said.
</P>
<P>
	   The leader of the Serb community here, Oliver Ivanovic, called for a Serb
protest rally Monday. Ivanovic said he told the NATO and U.N. missions after the
bus attack that it was still possible to prevent an escalation of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But after the first grenade was thrown into the Serb cafe, there was no
force that could stop the masses,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> US Increases Role in Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United States stepped into a dispute between Israel
and the Palestinians on Saturday, amid hints from the Palestinians that the
crisis could suspend or even halt peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross met officials from both sides to try to
resolve a disagreement over the location of an Israeli withdrawal from 6.1
percent of the West Bank and a dispute over an additional troop pullout.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, describing an ``unprecedented crisis,''
sent envoys to consult with officials in Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Israeli negotiator Oded Eran
met for almost three hours Saturday and noted their positions in a report to be
presented to President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the meeting at U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk's house near Tel Aviv,
Erekat said the main problem was an Israeli request to fold another troop
redeployment, the last under interim peace agreements, into a final peace treaty
slated for September.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross promised to return to the region ``very soon,'' Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh told The Associated Press that the
Palestinian leadership will decide its course of action within the next 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are round-the-clock consultations and efforts,'' Abourdeneh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian Cabinet Minister Ziad Abu Zayyad said the Palestinians would
take public opinion into account in deciding whether to continue talks with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For now, negotiations are our choice, but if Israel keeps dragging on the
peace process, we will go back to our people and ask what should be the
option,'' Abu Zayyad said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute broke out during a summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on Thursday when the leaders discussed the location of the
West Bank territory Israel is to cede next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians want the land to include heavily populated suburbs of
Jerusalem, a request Israel rejected, saying it had the sole right to decide the
location of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak aide Gadi Baltiansky said Saturday that Israel had no intention of
changing its withdrawal plans. He said that a Feb. 13 deadline for a framework
agreement for a final peace treaty -- the intended focus of Ross' visit -- would
not be met.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, however, remains committed to reaching the framework agreement as
soon as possible, Baltiansky said, and stands by a September target date for the
treaty itself. He said negotiators would meet Sunday to continue working on the
framework deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Erekat, however, cast doubt on the Palestinians' participation, saying it
would be hard to continue meeting until the withdrawal dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's talks with Syria have also hit an impasse and have been on hold
since last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said Barak was to give the United States a document
outlining his revised position on new borders with Syria as a gesture aimed at
renewing the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Baltiansky would say only that Barak is in constant contact with the United
States and that ``he will decide on the border after he gets answers from the
Syrians on other issues,'' including normalization and security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria is demanding Israel agree to return all the strategic Golan Heights.
Barak has indicated his willingness to do so, but has refused preconditions to
resuming the talks.

<HEADLINE> Murder conviction may reopen custody battle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ELIZABETHTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - A father's murder-one conviction could mean a
new custody battle for his children. It's a battle his late wife's family said
they may pursue, but one the children's law guardian said shouldn't happen.
<P>
	   Jeffrey Glanda, 49, of Lake Placid was convicted on Jan. 29 for plotting and
taking part in the death of his wife, Jeannine. An Essex County jury found him
guilty of two counts of first-degree murder. The sentencing phase is expected to
begin Monday. Glanda faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a 1998 domestic-relations law, a parent can lose child custody and
visitation rights if convicted of first- or second-degree murder for killing the
other parent.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Glanda's mother and sister, Mary and Jerri Ratliff, had filed a motion
for custody of Glanda's two children after Glanda was charged for his wife's
death in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   But Acting Supreme Court Justice David Jung dismissed the Ratliffs' petition
in March 1998, saying that Glanda could keep custody of son J. Tyler, now 14,
and daughter Jordan, now 10. Jung ruled that since Glanda had not been convicted
at the time, he was entitled to custody. The State Appellate Division upheld
that decision in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Ratliff, the children's maternal grandmother, has visitation rights.
Mrs. Glanda's family say they want to wait until after Glanda is sentenced
before pursuing custody, according to the Plattsburgh Press-Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to make sure there's closure, that it's really over," James
Ratliff, Mrs. Glanda's brother, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The children now live in Tupper Lake with Glanda's sister, Cheryl
Vaillancourt. She says the children should stay with her.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're happy, and they're here, and it's best we leave it that way,"
Vaillancourt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The children's law guardian, Nancy LeBlanc, said another custody dispute
would be "devastating" to the two children.
</P>
<P>
	   "The verdict was difficult enough on them," LeBlanc said. "They're doing
well, getting excellent marks, they should be left alone."
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Bruce Wagner, who handled the Ratliffs' appeal, says if Glanda
loses custody, then Vaillancourt should also.
</P>
<P>
	   Should Mrs. Glanda's family decide to challenge Glanda's parental rights,
the outcome would again be decided by Jung. A standing court order refers any
custody issues back to Jung, meaning he would preside over any future dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Legal experts say another custody battle could be lengthy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Something with this complexity could go on for six months or more before a
decision is reached," said Barbara Handschu, a family-law attorney and former
chairwoman of the State Bar Association Family Law Section. "Any way you look at
this, the children are the victims in this whole thing."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Budget Bolsters Education  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mindful of his legacy and the fall elections, President
Clinton is proposing a $1.84 trillion budget Monday that would bolster education
and health care in fiscal 2001, cut taxes for the poor and help other Democratic
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's final spending blueprint envisions an activist government using
massive projected surpluses to boost dozens of programs while shoring up Social
Security and Medicare and paying down big portions of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   In an election year in which compromise is unlikely on most issues, the
budget all but dares Republicans to fight over schools, health and other areas
where Democrats traditionally enjoy strong public support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our budget is going to stand for the principles of fiscal discipline and
investing in the future,'' White House budget chief Jack Lew said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposal -- 2.5 percent more than the $1.79 trillion to be
spent this year -- is certain to hit rough waters in Congress, where Republicans
must sign off before a 2001 budget can be enacted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We won't let the agenda of a lame duck president in any way reduce our
commitment to smaller government, saving Social Security, paying down debt and
providing for tax fairness,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the
House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's package projects $746 billion in federal surpluses over the next
decade without counting Social Security's even larger balances, said Democrats
who described the president's plan on condition of anonymity. Both parties have
agreed to use Social Security surpluses only for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Social Security would run surpluses of its own totaling $2.17 trillion for
the period. That would bring Clinton's total estimated budget surpluses to an
enormous $2.92 trillion, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The $746 billion non-Social Security surplus is less than half the $1.9
trillion the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office -- assuming much less
spending than Clinton wants -- projected last month as the surplus' best-case
scenario. That means Clinton would leave far less money available for the tax
cuts wanted by many Republicans, among them GOP presidential hopeful George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton would use much of the surplus to trim the accumulated $5.7 trillion
national debt, saying in the process that he will extend Medicare's solvency to
2025 and Social Security's to 2050, Democratic aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also would spend $168 billion over the next 10 years to create a
prescription drug benefit for the elderly, officials said, a popular idea that
Republicans ignored last year. They are now preparing their own version.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's plan, monthly premiums would start at $26 and rise to $51 by
2009, but be reduced or eliminated for many low-income people.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton would finance the program with $99 billion from the surplus and the
rest from savings extracted from hospitals and other Medicare participants, the
aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House already has released many other proposals, including tax
breaks to help families afford college and sick relatives' long-term care. The
president would spend billions to provide health insurance to the poor, combat
global warming and modernize schools, while boosting defense, farm subsidies and
anti-terrorism activities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He hearkened back to basic Democratic programs,'' Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., said in describing Clinton's remarks to Democratic senators Friday about
his priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Clinton ideas are sure to die or be watered down by Republicans, such
as a plan to expand the earned income tax credit for low-income families.
Already, Republicans are saying Clinton's budget does not cut taxes deeply
enough, should not raise other taxes and spends far too much money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's flavor of the day,'' Kasich said. ``Whatever any interest group
wants, the president is making a promise to them.''
</P>
<P>
	   In one coming clash, the president would let the one-third of the budget
that covers everything but automatically paid benefits like Social Security grow
annually at about the rate of inflation for a decade. Republicans would hold
such spending closer to this year's level of roughly $600 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever its reception, Clinton's budget can be seen as his fiscal farewell
address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no better way to understand what legacy a president wants to
leave in his final year than to look at his budget,'' said Mark Rozell, a
political scientist at Catholic University. ``Clearly, Clinton does not want to
go out with a whimper.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget could help Vice President Al Gore's presidential
aspirations by touting an agenda similar to his own on health care, the
environment and other issues. It might help congressional Democrats by focusing
budget combat on issues the party does well on, like Medicare and education.
</P>
<P>
	   The president would cut taxes by $350 billion over 10 years, largely for
low- and middle-income people. To defray the cost, Clinton would raise other
levies by $100 billion, including a 25-cent per pack boost in cigarette taxes
plus tobacco industry fines if teen smoking is not cut in half by 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also would:
</P>
<P>
	   --Eliminate the publicly held $3.7 trillion portion of the national debt by
2013. The remaining $2 trillion debt is money the government owes its own Social
Security and other trust funds. The total national debt stands at $5.7 trillion.
</P>
<P>
	   --Provide more money for housing vouchers for the poor, cleaner fuels,
biomedical research, military housing, anti-missile defense, gun safety and
uranium cleanups.

<HEADLINE> 19-year-old Columbia sophomore found dead in dorm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Columbia University sophomore was found dead in her
dorm room in an apparent homicide on Saturday, police said.
<P>
	   The 19-year-old victim's name was not immediately released. Police
originally said her throat had been slashed, but then said they were uncertain
how she died.
</P>
<P>
	   A resident assistant in the woman's dormitory, Ruggles Hall on West 114th
Street, called security when she was notified that the victim had failed to show
up for sports practice, said Suzanne Trimel, a Columbia spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   The assistant and security guards found the woman's body and called police
just after 2 p.m., according to Trimel. She was declared dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Anyone entering Ruggles Hall, a dormitory for sophomores and juniors, must
use a card-key to get inside, Trimel said. A security guard patrols the block
from 4 p.m. to midnight, she added.
</P>
<P>
	   No other details were available.
</P>
<P>
	   The death occurred a block from the apartment where a 26-year-old Columbia
Law School student, Lynda Hong, was killed in 1998. Police charged an
ex-boyfriend with slashing her throat, but he pleaded innocent and blamed
another of his girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
	   Justin Lappen, 19, a Columbia sophomore, said the eight-floor dorm building
where the body was found Saturday was generally considered safe.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've never encountered any trouble at all in this area," Lappen said. "This
is very surprising to me."

<HEADLINE> Complaint Filed Over Elian's Grandma  </HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL LA CORTE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Relatives of Elian Gonzalez have filed a complaint with police
over the recent meeting between the 6-year-old and his Cuban grandmothers, a
police source said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatives were outraged after one of the grandmothers described
playfully biting the boy's tongue and unzipping his pants during the reunion.
</P>
<P>
	   The source at the Miami Beach Police Department, who requested anonymity,
said the complaint was filed Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a report filed and there is going to be an investigation made
into the complaint made on that report,'' said the source, who would not provide
further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian played outside of his relatives' home Saturday before leaving for the
weekend with his Miami family to an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, spokesman for the Miami relatives, would not confirm that
the complaint was filed.
</P>
<P>
	   Through Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., Elian's relatives requested a meeting with
Attorney General Janet Reno to discuss unspecified new information about the
case, Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said. The request was being considered.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview on Cuban television Tuesday, Elian's paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, said she had ``played jokes'' with the boy during a U.S.
government-ordered meeting Jan. 26 at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I even opened up his zipper,'' she said. ``I told him, `Let me see, let me
see ... if it has grown.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the family was furious. ``That is not a Cuban custom,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Uva de Aragon of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International
University said Quintana's behavior might seem odd to people in the United
States, but it was probably innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The way the woman said it on national television shows it wasn't something
perverted,'' de Aragon said. ``She was joking with a little kid, trying to get
him to respond, the same as if she were tickling him or trying to see his
muscles.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said in the Cuban culture, fathers, particularly in lower classes, often
boast about the size of their sons' genitals, associating that with bravery and
virility.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued on Thanksgiving after clinging to an inner tube for two
days following a shipwreck that killed his mother. The first-grader has been
living in Miami with his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, and his U.S. relatives
hope to keep him despite an immigration order to send him back.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Cancer Coverage  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed helping states eliminate the
barriers poor women face in fighting breast or cervical cancer, saying Saturday
he wants them to have access to the ``medical miracles of our time.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his weekly radio address, Clinton proposed a $220 million, five-year
program, to allow states to provide full Medicaid benefits to women whose
cancers are detected through federally funded screening programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Too often uninsured women face a patchwork of care, inadequate care or no
care at all,'' the president said. ``Many are denied new or better forms of
treatment, or wait months to see a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This initiative will help women get comprehensive treatment and get it
right away,'' he said. ``It will make state-of-the-art therapies available to
women who need them, not just those who can afford them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said breast and cervical cancer can be cured if caught early and
treated aggressively. But he said that of the 180,000 women diagnosed with such
cancers each year, more than 40,000 die.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, an estimated 2 million women will be diagnosed with either breast
or cervical cancer this decade, and about 500,000 will die from the diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At a time when we know more about cancer than ever and can fight it better
than ever, we must not leave women to face cancer alone,'' Clinton said.
``Together, we can save lives and bring medical miracles of our time within the
reach of every American.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's proposal, uninsured women would receive Medicaid coverage
for the duration of their treatment, meaning radiation treatment, chemotherapy
and other services.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-year survival rate is 97 percent when the diseases are diagnosed
early, but that rate falls to 21 percent after the cancer has spread.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is especially troubling, given the stunning progress scientists are
making in the fight against cancer,'' Clinton said. ``New drugs and new
combinations of drugs will bring hope to those whose cancer has spread.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton urged Congress to act quickly, saying his proposal has significant
bipartisan support because it ``transcends political boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
	   Similar legislation has been proposed by Sens. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Reps. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., and Rick Lazio, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio, in a statement, applauded Clinton's proposal, said his own bill is
ready for House action, and predicted Congress will pass it this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a fight that transcends party lines and partisan bickering,'' added
Rep. J.C. Watts Jr, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   John R. Seffrin, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society,
called for quick action on the proposal and said: ``The bottom line is that this
proposal can be a lifesaver for many women.''

<HEADLINE> McCain-Bush in statistical dead heat in South Carolina  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Coming off a resounding victory in New Hampshire, John
McCain has rallied from a 20-percentage point deficit in South Carolina and now
is in statistical draw with George W. Bush, said a Time/CNN poll released
Saturday.
<P>
	   Nationally, a Newsweek poll showed a major surge by McCain but found he
still was far behind the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   The Time/CNN survey was the fourth of the week to reflect a major bounce in
South Carolina for McCain after Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, which he won
with 48 percent of the vote, compared with 30 percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In January's final Time/CNN South Carolina poll, Bush had the support of 52
percent of the respondents, compared with 32 percent for the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest poll found McCain the choice of 44 percent of likely Republican
voters in the Feb. 19 primary, compared with Bush's 40 percent. Given the poll's
4.5 percent margin of error, the race is statistically even.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain held healthy leads over Bush among moderates, military veterans and
independents, who can vote in the GOP primary. Bush was favored by conservatives
and regular party members.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of Bush's unease about South Carolina, his staff said Saturday the
governor is likely to add a day of campaigning in the state this Friday and may
decide against taking next weekend off, as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor definitely has a fight on his hands," Bush spokesman Ari
Fleicher said. "South Carolina is important, and he is going to campaign there
on a regular basis."
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press also learned that the Bush campaign is trying to find
an appropriate time to stage an event in South Carolina with its senior senator,
Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
	   Thurmond is backing Bush and would likely do an event with the governor
against a backdrop of veterans, a source close to the senator said. Thurmond
served more than 30 years in the Army.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain, a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, are battling
for support from South Carolina's large constituency of armed service members
and veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, Newsweek said Bush is holding a 57 percent to 26 percent lead
over McCain among registered voters in the race for the Republican nomination.
The figures reflect a tightening of 11 percentage points from mid-January, when
Bush led 60 percent to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Newsweek pollsters also asked respondents about hypothetical matchups in
November between the Republican leaders and the Democratic candidates, Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   They found a virtual tie between Bush, 47 percent, and Gore, 45 percent.
Bush's lead over Bradley had narrowed from 20 percentage points in mid-January,
56 percent to 36 percent, to 6 percentage points, 49 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Republican nominee, McCain also was in virtual ties with Gore, 45
percent to 46 percent for the vice president, and Bradley, 44 percent to 42
percent for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the similarity in numbers, however, 73 percent of Republicans chose
Bush as the more likely candidate to defeat the Democratic nominee in November.
Nineteen percent said McCain is.
</P>
<P>
	   The Time/CNN poll, conducted Feb. 4-5, was conducted with 515 likely voters
in the South Carolina Republican primary, with a margin of error of plus or
minus 4.5 percentage points. Newsweek's poll of 754 registered voters, taken
Feb. 3-4, with a 4-percentage-point margin of error for the total sample, 6
percentage points for individual party races.

<HEADLINE> Charges in Russia Journalist Slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian prosecutors have charged five paratroop officers and a
security guard in the 1994 slaying of a Russian journalist, news reports said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The six men are charged with killing Dmitry Kholodov, a 27-year-old
journalist for the outspoken daily Moskovsky Komsomolets. Kholodov was
investiga(AP) -- ting military corruption when a briefcase supposedly provided
by an informant exploded in his hands and killed him. The newspaper said the
explosion was connected to Kholodov's investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing attracted nationwide attention, and the case was taken on by the
Prosecutor General's office, the country's top prosecutor. That office has now
turned the case over to Moscow central military court for trial, the daily
Kommersant and ITAR-Tass news agency reported Saturday. No trial date has been
set.
</P>
<P>
	   The Prosecutor General's office and the military court would not confirm the
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The motive for the killing was ``career advancement,'' Kommersant said.
Russian media have suggested the suspects were trying to protect or impress
superiors accused of corruption. Journalists have criticized prosecutors' delay
in wrapping up the case, saying it reflects the government's inability or
unwillingness to solve Russia's frequent contract killings.
</P>
<P>
	   The five soldiers charged in Kholodov's case are retired Col. Pavel
Popovskhikh, former head of intelligence in the paratroop forces; former
paratroop officer Konstantin Mirzoyants; and paratroop intelligence officers
Vladimir Morozov, Alexander Soroka and one identified only by his last name,
Barkovsky, ITAR-Tass reported. The report did not give the security guard's
name.

<HEADLINE> Complaint Filed Over Elian's Grandma  </HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL LA CORTE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Relatives of Elian Gonzalez have filed a complaint with police
over the recent meeting between the 6-year-old and his Cuban grandmothers, a
police source said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatives were outraged after one of the grandmothers described
playfully biting the boy's tongue and unzipping his pants during the reunion.
</P>
<P>
	   The source at the Miami Beach Police Department, who requested anonymity,
said the complaint was filed Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a report filed and there is going to be an investigation made
into the complaint made on that report,'' said the source, who would not provide
further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian played outside of his relatives' home Saturday before leaving for the
weekend with his Miami family to an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, spokesman for the Miami relatives, would not confirm that
the complaint was filed.
</P>
<P>
	   Through Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., Elian's relatives requested a meeting with
Attorney General Janet Reno to discuss unspecified new information about the
case, Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said. The request was being considered.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview on Cuban television Tuesday, Elian's paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, said she had ``played jokes'' with the boy during a U.S.
government-ordered meeting Jan. 26 at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I even opened up his zipper,'' she said. ``I told him, `Let me see, let me
see ... if it has grown.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the family was furious. ``That is not a Cuban custom,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Cuba, none of several dozen people asked about the incident in recent
days found anything strange about Quintana's behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   Uva de Aragon of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International
University said Quintana's behavior might seem odd to people in the United
States, but it was probably innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The way the woman said it on national television shows it wasn't something
perverted,'' de Aragon said. ``She was joking with a little kid, trying to get
him to respond, the same as if she were tickling him or trying to see his
muscles.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said in the Cuban culture, fathers, particularly in lower classes, often
boast about the size of their sons' genitals, associating that with bravery and
virility.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued on Thanksgiving after clinging to an inner tube for two
days following a shipwreck that killed his mother. The first-grader has been
living in Miami with his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, and his U.S. relatives
hope to keep him despite an immigration order to send him back.

<HEADLINE> Asia Magnate Cited Fund-raising Case  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign fund-raising figure Charlie Trie told the FBI
that some of his illegal donations to the Democratic Party came from a Jakarta
telecommunications magnate seeking a private meeting with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Trie's statements in a 74-page FBI summary include an assertion that the
Indonesian businessman, Tomy Winata, sent Trie $200,000 in travelers checks
during the same period he was requesting a private meeting with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Trie, a former Little Rock restaurateur, has been cooperating in the Justice
Department investigation of illicit fund-raising in the 1996 presidential
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press obtained the FBI summary Saturday after the Los Angeles
Times first reported on its contents in a story on its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   Trie also told the FBI he used false identification for a wealthy Taiwan
businessman to get him into the White House to meet Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Trie told the FBI he used the Arkansas driver's license of his secretary's
husband to get Chich Chong ``Simon'' Chien into a White House dinner after the
fund-raising scandal over foreign donations broke following the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
	   Trie said he used the driver's license of a Filipino-American postal worker
because he did not want people thinking that ``he was bringing another foreigner
into the White House,'' according to the summary, which added that once inside
the White House, Trie apologized to Clinton on the receiving line for
controversy his fund-raising efforts caused, saying ``Sorry for all the
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
	   Trie told the FBI the president responded, ``I'm used to it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``As we have said all along, the president had no knowledge or reason to
believe there was a problem with the fund-raising and every investigation since
that time has borne that out,'' White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Saturday
in response to the latest reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Trie's information adds the latest detail on the role of foreign money in
the 1996 U.S. elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Winata wanted a one-on-one meeting with President Clinton,'' states the
FBI summary, which is based on interviews with Trie last year. There is no
indication in the summary that a Clinton-Winata meeting ever occurred, but Trie
told the FBI that Winata's ``right-hand man'' brought $200,000 in travelers
checks into the United States for Trie after Trie asked Winata if he could
``help out'' with money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
	   At least $50,000 of the travelers checks were used to purchase tickets to a
Democratic Party fund-raiser at the Hay-Adams Hotel in February 1996, according
to the FBI summary.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, several thousand dollars of the checks reimbursed donors to the
Clintons' legal expense fund, the summary added.
</P>
<P>
	   Trie, who has known Clinton since his days as Arkansas governor, told the
FBI that he met Winata in 1994 at an Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting
in Seattle. Trie said Winata was aligned with President Suharto of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Winata wanted Trie to introduce him and many others to the President,''
states the FBI summary. Trie said he was rebuffed on a Clinton-Winata meeting by
someone with access to White House official Mack McLarty.
</P>
<P>
	   Undeterred, Trie said he thought he could seat Winata ``next to the
President'' at the Hay-Adams fund-raiser, but that ``Winata wanted a more
private meeting'' and would send some of his aides to the event instead.
</P>
<P>
	   When Trie asked him if he could help out, ``Winata told him he would send
$200,000 with his people.'' Trie said he doled out the money after stashing it
in a safety deposit box at a bank branch in the Watergate where he lived.

<HEADLINE> Overboard Cruise Passenger Rescued  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- The U.S. Coast Guard rescued a
20-year-old man who fell off a cruise ship Saturday and spent more than two
hours treading water in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   A Coast Guard helicopter rescued Erick Angel of Phoenix at dawn about 12
miles northwest of St. Thomas island after he fell from the Royal Caribbean
International ship Nordic Empress, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They told me it was like he was swimming for his life,'' said Lt. Johnny
Gonzalez, of the Coast Guard station in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear how Angel fell from the ship. Crew members claimed that
they spotted a man in a restricted area of the ship's bow at 3 a.m. local time,
but he had disappeared by the time they approached the area, Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerned that the man fell overboard, the crew woke up the nearly 2,400
passengers and employees on board to conduct a head count to determine if anyone
was missing, said Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Greg Krivdo.
</P>
<P>
	   Angel had a minor injury to his shoulder and was treated at a hospital on
St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Gonzalez said. The ship was headed to the
Virgin Islands from Puerto Rico, according to local radio reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Royal Caribbean officials could not be reached for comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coast Guard marine safety unit began investigating the incident
Saturday, Gonzalez said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Mulls Asylum for Pilot  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BARR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- British authorities are considering an asylum plea from an
EgyptAir pilot who claims to have information about the airline's fatal crash
last year off the coast of Massachusetts, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Home Office has confirmed only that an Egyptian national ``has sought
entry into the U.K. and his application is being considered by the immigration
services.'' The Egyptian Embassy in London, however, said pilot Hamdi Hanafi
Taha, 49, was staying at an Immigration Service facility at Heathrow airport
while his case was considered.
</P>
<P>
	   The Middle East News Agency had quoted an EgyptAir statement Friday as
saying Taha asked for asylum after piloting an EgyptAir flight to London.
</P>
<P>
	   But airline officials said Taha had no special knowledge about the cause of
the Oct. 31 crash near the island of Nantucket that killed all 217 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   Egyptian government spokesman Nabil Osman refused on Saturday to comment on
Taha's motives, saying ``it is premature to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
	   A team of American and Egyptian investigators has yet to release any
official findings on the cause of the crash. Some U.S. sources have said the
National Transportation Safety Board is working on the theory the plane was
brought down deliberately by a co-pilot who died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Egyptian authorities hotly dispute that theory. They say the most likely
cause is an unexplained problem in the plane's tail section.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Egyptian government and public have condemned as outrageous and
insulting any speculation that the pilot may have committed suicide and killed
innocent people. If Taha has information contradicting that, he may fear being
ostracized -- or worse -- in a country where human rights activists have been
jailed for speech considered harmful to the national interest.
</P>
<P>
	   EgyptAir's statement did not elaborate on whether Taha claimed to have
information about the co-pilot on the ill-fated jet.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cairo, Taha's wife, Hoda Abdel-Rahman Youssef, told The Associated Press
she did not believe her husband was seeking asylum. ``He is scheduled to arrive
tomorrow and we're waiting for him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Youssef told reporters earlier her husband was ``very sad'' after the crash,
but added: ``He didn't tell me anything about the reason behind its plunge.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said her husband had suffered anxiety recently, but seemed normal when
he left for work Friday morning. The two have been married 19 years and have six
children.
</P>
<P>
	   Taha has worked for EgyptAir since 1984, Egypt's Al Gomhuria newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His relationship with his colleagues was good, but he had some problems
with the (airline) administration,'' said Mohammed Salama, the pilot who flew
Taha's plane back to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Saturday, the crew that accompanied Taha on the Friday flight to London
returned to Cairo. Co-pilot Ahmed Abu Hashem told reporters that Taha apparently
had contacted authorities at Heathrow and coordinated with them while he was
alone in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   Crew members, he said, only knew what happened after leaving the airport.
But Abu Hashem said they were surprised to see Taha leave the plane before
anyone else, rather than waiting for the passengers to depart.
</P>
<P>
	   A steward on Taha's flight to London, who spoke on condition he not be
identified by name, told reporters that the flight from Cairo to London was
normal and nobody suspected anything unusual was going on.
</P>
<P>
	   EgyptAir Chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan said he has flown aboard planes
piloted by Taha and that his behavior always had been ``very normal.''
</P>
<P>
	   As to suggestions that Taha had problems with the EgyptAir administration,
Rayan said that even if there were work-related problems, that would not justify
what he called Taha's ``strange behavior.''

<HEADLINE> American Indians protest at Peace Bridge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   FORT ERIE, ONTARIO (AP) - More than 200 American Indians crossed the
Peace Bridge into Canada on Saturday, protesting what they say is unfair
treatment of aboriginals on both sides of the border.
<P>
	   Led by a ceremonial drum corps, members of the North American Native
Warriors marched from the FBI building in Buffalo to Fort Erie.
</P>
<P>
	   The group said the protest focused on the case of Leonard Peltier, 55, who
is serving two life sentences for the murders of FBI special agents Ronald
Williams and Jack Coler in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want justice," Grandpa Bear, national director for the group, said in an
interview from the bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   The agents were killed after shooting broke out with a group of native
campers at the troubled Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the climax of months of brutality and conflict between native
factions that had plagued the community for months.
</P>
<P>
	   Peltier was convicted two years later, after Canadian officials allowed his
extradition from Alberta partly based on an affidavit from a woman later shown
to be mentally unfit.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters also say the FBI intimidated witnesses and withheld documents and
that his extradition was unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of issues," said protester Doreen Dagga. "Basically, (we
want) the freedom of Leonard Peltier."
</P>
<P>
	   In October, Justice Minister Anne McLellan said a judicial review had
concluded the extradition was proper.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers said Saturday's protest was also in support of Dudley George, an
American-Indian man shot and killed by an Ontario Provincial Police officer
during a protest occupation of a provincial park in Ipperwash, Ontario, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The officer was convicted of criminal negligence causing death in 1997 and
given a two-year suspended sentence, but is currently appealing the verdict.

<HEADLINE> Sicily School Room Named for Hussein  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA DI LICODIA, Sicily (AP) -- Students in this small Sicilian town
will soon be attending functions at their school's new ``Saddam Hussein
Auditorium'' -- a gift from a group promoting ties between Italy and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   The association agreed to pay for the theater at Don Bosco school at Santa
Maria di Licodia in central Sicily, provided it was named after the Iraqi
leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Local officials agreed, and Saddam's name will be on the 500-seat auditorium
when it opens in April.
</P>
<P>
	   The founder of the group, Salvatore Nicotra, described it as an offer the
Sicilian officials couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicotra, who travels regularly to Iraq on business, says he wants to raise
awareness of what he considers the unjust sanctions that accompanied the 1990-91
military campaign to force Iraq out of Kuwait. Italy was among the nations
taking part in the international effort.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Rome's La Repubblica daily newspaper, in response to the gift,
the school's 350 students are now boning up on Babylonian history. Babylon was
the forerunner to modern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By now, they'll know the Tigris and Euphrates better than the Po and the
Tiber,'' the newspaper predicted.

<HEADLINE> Forbes, McCain competing for 'outsider' label  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BURLINGAME, Calif. (AP) - John McCain and Steve Forbes courted
California Republicans in George Bush's absence Saturday, railing against the
party establishment as they competed for the outsider label.
<P>
	   "Remember, all the establishment is against us. This is an insurgency
campaign!" McCain told supporters before speaking at the state GOP convention.
The state's primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech at the convention, McCain joked that Bush was in Texas
"working on a new book: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to My Coronation" and
continued to paint himself as the anti-establishment candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   He was greeted by a standing-room-only audience what interrupted his speech
again and again with applause.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain touted his campaign finance reform plan and derided Bush's stance on
the issue, saying that in a debate with the Democratic nominee Bush "will have
nothing to say because he is defending the system."
</P>
<P>
	   At same time McCain lashed out at Bush for airing what he characterized as
negative ads recently in South Carolina. "Those are the tactics of (President)
Clinton and (Vice President Al) Gore," said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said in his speech that "a campaign for the great office of the
presidency should be about far bigger things" and invoked former President
Reagan's so-called 11th commandment about Republicans not attacking Republicans
by way of suggesting a 12th: "It's wise to obey the 11th commandment."
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, in a convention speech, cited the results from the New Hampshire
primary on Feb. 1 as an indication that voters are drawn to an "independent
outsider" who is not part of the "Washington establishment."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the Arizona senator who has served in Congress since 1983, won the
primary with 48 percent of the vote, followed by Bush, the Texas governor and
national front-runner, with 30 percent and magazine publisher Forbes at 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes contended many New Hampshire voters supported him but voted for
McCain to send a message that they disapprove of Bush. Forbes did not say why he
thought those voters need to vote for McCain to send that message. But he
predicted the results would prompt voters around the country to take a new look
at him.
</P>
<P>
	   "The McCain momentum came as a way of stopping George Bush," Forbes said
after his speech. "That has been done, and now voters are taking a fresh look,
and that's why I feel that we are going to make very good progress."
</P>
<P>
	   He told state Republicans that "this race is wide open," drawing applause
from about 200 activists who paid $30 each to attend. A half-dozen tables at the

his opposition to abortion a centerpiece of his campaign in conservative Iowa
last month, a majority of Californians support abortion rights.

	   At the state convention, he stressed his commitment to open a dialogue on
the issue with those with those of all points of view.

<P>
	   "I have faith that hearts and minds can be changed," he said.

in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>

<HEADLINE> With AM-NY--Hillary Clinton Profile and AM-NY--New York Senate.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In a new biographical video expected to be part of her
official Senate candidacy announcement, Hillary Rodham Clinton reveals that she
likes to cook and her close friends mention she doesn't have much of a singing
voice.
<P>
	   The video, simply entitled "Hillary," is by documentary filmmaker Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason, who was also involved with the production of "The Man from
Hope" video on Bill Clinton shown at the 1992 Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
	   The video stresses the themes of Clinton's love and hard work on behalf of
children, and her strong connection to her family- particularly her mother
Dorothy Rodham and daughter Chelsea - as Bloodworth-Thomason attempts to paint a
picture of Clinton's compassion and personal appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Using quickly edited interview segments with the first lady's friends and
former colleagues, as well as people she has helped over the years,
Bloodworth-Thomason portrays Clinton as a freethinker who has inspired the
people around her all her life.
</P>
<P>
	   One of those people, husband Bill, does not appear except for a short
segment at minute 14 of the 18-minute biopic. In an endorsement of her
candidacy, President Clinton says that "when you're in the Senate, you need to
bring people together and lift them up and I think she would be very good at
that."
</P>
<P>
	   On the whole, the video seeks to describe Clinton separately from her time
as first lady, a time in which she and her husband found themselves dogged by
scandal over financial dealings and the president's personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
	   Bloodworth-Thomason has been a confidant to the president and the first lady
throughout their time in the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is scheduled to make the official announcement of her Senate
candidacy Sunday at SUNY Purchase.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Republic Debate Opens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Having Britain's monarch as a head of state is
an ``absurd'' notion, and it's only a matter of time before New Zealanders dump
the crown once and for all, the country's prime minister said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Helen Clark made the remarks at the opening of a debate on whether New
Zealand should become a republic.
</P>
<P>
	   Settled as a British colony, New Zealand was granted independence in 1931.
But like many Commonwealth countries such as Canada and Australia, it still
recognizes the British monarch as its head of state.
</P>
<P>
	   In comments published in the Sunday Star Times newspaper, Clark said her own
culture, background and education were British.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But that doesn't stop me seeing objectively that the monarchy is absurd,''
Clark said. ``I mean, we're 12,000 miles away from where the head of state
resides. How does any of that make sense?''
</P>
<P>
	   However Labor leader Clark, who came to power at a general election last
November, said a New Zealand republic would not be on her government's agenda
because ``there are more important things to address.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think in a sense, if it ain't broke, don't fix it and really very few
are screaming that it is broke, so it's not a priority issue on my agenda,''
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
	   But eventually a New Zealand republic was inevitable, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   After a divisive national debate, Australians last November defeated a
referendum on whether they wanted to get rid of the British monarch and instead
establish a republic.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton to talk about role as "trailblazing woman"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to use her time in the
spotlight of her Senate campaign announcement "to talk about her own personal
experiences as a trailblazing woman," a top aide said Saturday.
<P>
	   Clinton is to make her announcement Sunday afternoon in a gymnasium at the
State University of New York campus in Purchase, not far from her recently
purchased $1.7 million home in suburban Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has never before lived or worked in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, her expected Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, appeared ready to steal at least some of Clinton's thunder. The mayor
was scheduled to appear on virtually every nationally broadcast Sunday morning
news show to discuss the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was to arrive from Washington at her home just north of New York
City on Saturday. President Clinton, daughter Chelsea and the candidate's
mother, Dorothy Rodham, were to be on hand for Sunday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hillary will tell New Yorkers that she's running to make a difference for
children and families, as she has for the last 30 years," campaign spokesman
Howard Wolfson said Saturday. "She wants to serve in the Senate to continue her
fight for better schools and quality health care."
</P>
<P>
	   Those are issues she and her advisers believe can be particularly effective
against Giuliani, who has built a reputation as being a tough crime-fighter who
has made his city a safer place, but has come under fire for what critics claim
is a lack of compassion on social issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's going to talk about some of the things she's for, and some of the
things she's against," Wolfson added.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost 2,000 people are expected at the announcement event, including many
of the state's top Democrats. They will be welcomed by choirs, bands and a red,
white and blue "Hillary for U.S. Senate" banner at the back of the stage. There
will be more than 500 simultaneous house parties across the state for supporters
who the first lady plans to speak to via a telephone conference call after her
announcement speech.
</P>
<P>
	   One highlight of the announcement event is expected to be a biographical
video of the new candidate prepared by documentary filmmaker Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason.
</P>
<P>
	   Bloodworth-Thomason was involved in the production of "The Man from Hope"
video on Bill Clinton shown at the 1992 Democratic National Convention.
Bloodworth-Thomason has been a confidant to the president and the first lady
throughout their time in the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Following her announcement, Senate candidate Clinton was to head for Buffalo
on Monday to begin a four-day campaign swing across the state.

<HEADLINE> Forbes, McCain competing for 'outsider' label  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BURLINGAME, Calif. (AP) - John McCain and Steve Forbes courted
California Republicans in George Bush's absence Saturday, railing against the
party establishment as they competed for the outsider label.
<P>
	   "Remember, all the establishment is against us. This is an insurgency
campaign!" McCain told supporters before speaking at the state GOP convention.
The state's primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech at the convention, McCain joked that Bush was in Texas
"working on a new book: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to My Coronation" and
continued to paint himself as the anti-establishment candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   He was greeted by a standing-room-only audience that interrupted his speech
again and again with applause.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain touted his campaign finance reform plan and derided Bush's stance on
the issue, saying that in a debate with the Democratic nominee Bush "will have
nothing to say because he is defending the system."
</P>
<P>
	   At same time McCain lashed out at Bush for airing what he characterized as
negative ads recently in South Carolina. "Those are the tactics of (President)
Clinton and (Vice President Al) Gore," said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said in his speech that "a campaign for the great office of the
presidency should be about far bigger things" and invoked former President
Reagan's so-called 11th commandment about Republicans not attacking Republicans
by way of suggesting a 12th: "It's wise to obey the 11th commandment."
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, in a convention speech, cited the results from the New Hampshire
primary on Feb. 1 as an indication that voters are drawn to an "independent
outsider" who is not part of the "Washington establishment."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the Arizona senator who has served in Congress since 1983, won the
primary with 48 percent of the vote, followed by Bush, the Texas governor and
national front-runner, with 30 percent and magazine publisher Forbes at 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes contended many New Hampshire voters supported him but voted for
McCain to send a message that they disapprove of Bush. Forbes did not say why he
thought those voters need to vote for McCain to send that message. But he
predicted the results would prompt voters around the country to take a new look
at him.
</P>
<P>
	   "The McCain momentum came as a way of stopping George Bush," Forbes said
after his speech. "That has been done, and now voters are taking a fresh look,
and that's why I feel that we are going to make very good progress."
</P>
<P>
	   He told state Republicans that "this race is wide open," drawing applause
from about 200 activists who paid $30 each to attend. A half-dozen tables at the
breakfast event were empty.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said at news conference after Forbes' speech: "I thanked a lot of
people on election night. I forgot to thank Steve."
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview, Forbes said Bush represented the "Washington
establishment," rather than McCain, who has served in Washington for 17 years.
Forbes added that he is not "beholden to anyone from Washington."
</P>
<P>
	   His harshest criticism was aimed at Clinton and Gore for "one of the most

</P>
<P>
	   "That's how (Bill) Bradley got his wind" in his primary challenge to Gore,
Forbes said. "It's not because of a vibrant personality. We're both in the same
boat on that."

<TEXT>
    	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - Vice President Al Gore won the Delaware
presidential primary Saturday, outdistancing Bill Bradley in an election
neglected by the Democratic campaigners, in voting that drew a turnout as sparse
as the stakes.
<P>
	   Gore's victory was projected on the basis of interviews by Voter News
Service as people left the polling precincts. Those interviews suggested a wide
preference for Gore over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The primary was only a popularity vote, a state-run straw poll. Delegates to
the Democratic convention will be chosen later.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al Gore and the Gore campaign appreciate the support of the people of
Delaware today," said spokesman Chris Lehane. "We hope to also earn that support
caucus day."
</P>
<P>
	   That will be March 27, when Delaware Democrats begin choosing their 22
nominating delegates. The state scheduled its primary near the start of the
campaign season in an effort to gain influence, but Democrats could not select
delegates this soon without violating party rules.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time they do, after the major state primaries earlier in March, the
contest may be settled.
</P>
<P>
	   Delaware was Gore's third straight victory, two by landslide margins. Gore
won the New Hampshire primary last Tuesday with a 4-point edge on Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Gore nor Bradley made a stop in Delaware, and the volunteers who
campaigned there did it without national help. The candidates had said they
would stay away, wary of friction with New Hampshire, when the leadoff primary
state was defending its status against calendar encroachment.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore won the Iowa caucuses with a margin of nearly 2-to-1 over Bradley, and
beat him 50 percent to 46 percent in New Hampshire. Under Democratic rules, only
those starting-point states could choose delegates before March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans have no such restriction. George W. Bush and Steve Forbes
are campaigning for Delaware's GOP primary on Tuesday. Sen. John McCain, the big
winner in New Hampshire, skipped it to aim at later targets.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a conflict with New Hampshire, which demands a full week to itself,
the Republicans opted out of the state-run primary on Saturday to vote in one of
their own three days later. The contest offers 12 nominating votes, a pittance
in the national campaign, but a stake to go with the win-lose rating Delaware
will deliver.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' self-financed campaign has been shaken by defeat in Iowa and a
far-back third place in New Hampshire. He rolled around the second smallest
state on a bus tour, saying the McCain victory in New Hampshire proved there
would be no coronation of Bush. "There's nothing inevitable now," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaigned in Dover on Thursday and planned to return Monday. He
criticized the absent McCain, saying, "You don't see me skipping anything," he
said. McCain's strategy is to concentrate on campaigning for South Carolina
primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley flew from New Hampshire into what they both see as a
national campaign now, both with stops in New York and then California before
their weekend break.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley sought support one state away, in College Park, Md., on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Gore stands for the old politics, for a win-by-any means kind of
campaigning. "It's relentlessly negative, attack a day, charge a day," he said.
Then he flew home to New Jersey for a brief break.
</P>
<P>
	   Benjamin J. Matwey of Wilmington, volunteer campaign chief for Bradley in
Delaware, said his operation was on its own, short of money, and lacking even
for literature to pass out to potential voters. He said his workers paid for
their own "Bradley 2000" buttons, and he brought back some campaign flyers after
a stint in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The volunteer chairman for Gore, Chris Coons, said it was hard to organize
for the primary without support, not even a wink or a nod, from the national
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Delaware primary left its imprint on the 2000 campaign. Because
the state tried to get in early, New Hampshire moved up its date and held the
earliest primary ever. That lead Iowa to move, up, too, so the voting began
earlier than ever before.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit polling was conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of the AP
and television networks.

<HEADLINE> 19-year-old Columbia sophomore found dead in dorm, boyfriend kills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Columbia University sophomore lacrosse player from
Long Island was found dead in her dorm room on Saturday, and her boyfriend, a
suspect in her death, died hours later after throwing himself in front of a
subway train, police said.
<P>
	   The body of Kathleen Roskot, 19, of Bayshore, was found by a resident
assistant and campus security in Roskot's dormitory, Ruggles Hall, on West 114th
Street, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roskot was found naked on the floor of her bedroom. She had been stabbed
once in the neck, and authorities said a kitchen knife believed to be the weapon
was found in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   A man in his 20s, believed to be Roskot's boyfriend, died after jumping in
front of a number one train around 3:30 p.m. at the station at 181st street,
said New York Police Assistant Chief William Taylor. The man's name had not been
officially released.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor said the boyfriend had attended Columbia until 1998, and had been
known to stay in Roskot's suite from time to time. The suites have rooms for
four to seven students who share a common living room.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the couple had come home around 12:30 a.m. Saturday, and that
some kind of disturbance had been heard around an hour later. When the man's
body was found, he was carrying Roskot's wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor was unsure when the boyfriend left.
</P>
<P>
	   "The room was a mess," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lashauna Cutts, a Bronx sophomore who shared the suite, said she had heard
something around 1:30 a.m. from her bedroom, but didn't think anything of it
because the suite was often used for parties.
</P>
<P>
	   She didn't know anything was going on until someone told her of the problem
in the afternoon and she saw blood in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it must have been something personal," she said, wiping away tears.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend of Rosket's boyfriend, who wouldn't give his name, said he and his
housemates had kicked him out of their home where he had been living about a
year ago because he was unstable and "strung out on drugs."
</P>
<P>
	   The resident assistant in the woman's dormitory called security when she was
notified that Roskot had failed to show up for lacrosse practice Saturday
morning, said Suzanne Trimel, a Columbia spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   The assistant and security guards found Roskot's body and called police just
after 2 p.m., according to Trimel. She was declared dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   The death occurred a block from the apartment where a 26-year-old Columbia
Law School student, Lynda Hong, was killed in 1998. Police charged an
ex-boyfriend with slashing her throat, but he pleaded innocent and blamed
another of his girlfriends.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Rough seas on Sunday forced rescuers to postpone
the search for a British scuba diver missing off Sydney's Bondi Beach.
</P>
<P>
	   The 24-year-old Londoner, whose name has not been released by authorities,
disappeared on Saturday while diving with 10 others.

<HEADLINE> 5 hurt, several families displaced by fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - A father, his three children and a firefighter
were hurt Saturday afternoon in a three-alarm fire that heavily damaged three
rowhouses and left at least seven families homeless temporarily.
<P>
	   The three children, aged 14 and younger, suffered smoke inhalation and were
taken to Jersey City Medical Center, according to Steve McGill, assistant
director of the city fire department. They lived on the second floor of a
two-story rowhouse on Zabrieski Street, converted into apartments, where the
fire began.
</P>
<P>
	   "The father threw them out the window of the second floor and then he jumped
out," McGill said. "There were residents on the ground floor that caught them."
</P>
<P>
	   No one caught father, however, and he was taken to the same hospital,
suffering from neck and back pains and a possible punctured lung, McGill said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the 55 firefighters who battled the blaze was treated at St. Francis
Hospital for smoke exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
	   McGill said the Red Cross was at the scene helping displaced families,
including residents of a four-story home converted into apartments and a
two-story building housing an apartment over a bar. Both two-story buildings
were heavily damaged and two apartments in the taller building also were left
uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
	   McGill said the fire began about 4:30 p.m. and was extinguished by 7 p.m.
Its cause was under investigation.

	   Gore won comfortably in a primary that was only a popularity contest, a
state-run straw poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president captured 57 percent of the vote, the former senator from
New Jersey, 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, taking a day off in Washington, telephoned a union leader his thanks
for the victory. "He said we took him over the top," said Mike Begatto,
executive director of the AFL-CIO Public Employees Council.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al Gore and the Gore campaign appreciate the support of the people of
Delaware today," said spokesman Chris Lehane. "We hope to also earn that support
caucus day."
</P>
<P>
	   That will be March 27, when Delaware Democrats begin choosing their 22
nominating delegates. The state scheduled its primary near the start of the
campaign season in an effort to gain influence, but Democrats could not select
delegates this soon without violating party rules.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time they do, after the major state primaries earlier in March, the
contest may be settled.
</P>
<P>
	   With the candidates bypassing the state, the primary vote was light, about 5
percent of registered voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Their verdict:
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, 6,349 or 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, 4,465 or 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Perennial fringe candidate Lyndon H. LaRouche got the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore scored heavily with voters who said they were looking for experience.
One in four said that was the quality they wanted in a candidate, and the vice
president got 9 out of 10 of their votes, according to a Voter News Service
poll.
</P>
<P>
	   VNS, a consortium of The Associated Press and the major television networks,
interviewed voters leaving their polling places.
</P>
<P>
	   Those interviews also showed that the vice president won overwhemlingly
among voters from union households.
</P>
<P>
	   "If anyone should get the credit for this Gore win today, it should be the
AFL-CIO," said Chris Coons, a Gore organizer.
</P>
<P>
	   Benjamin J. Matwey, Bradley's volunteer chairman, said the low turnout hurt
his candidate. But he said "they won, we lost, there's no spin on it."
</P>
<P>
	   Delaware was Gore's third straight victory, two by landslide margins. Gore
won the New Hampshire primary last Tuesday with a 4-point edge on Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Gore nor Bradley made a stop in Delaware, and the volunteers who
campaigned there did it without national help. The candidates had said they
would stay away, wary of friction with New Hampshire, when the leadoff primary
state was defending its status against calendar encroachment.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore won the Iowa caucuses with a margin of nearly 2-to-1 over Bradley, and
beat him 50 percent to 46 percent in New Hampshire. Under Democratic rules, only
those starting-point states could choose delegates before March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans have no such restriction. George W. Bush and Steve Forbes
are campaigning for Delaware's GOP primary on Tuesday. Sen. John McCain, the big
winner in New Hampshire, skipped it to aim at later targets.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a conflict with New Hampshire, which demands a full week to itself,
the Republicans opted out of the state-run primary on Saturday to vote in one of
their own three days later. The contest offers 12 nominating votes, a pittance
in the national campaign, but a stake to go with the win-lose rating Delaware
will deliver.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' self-financed campaign has been shaken by defeat in Iowa and a
far-back third place in New Hampshire. He rolled around the second smallest
state on a bus tour, saying the McCain victory in New Hampshire proved there
would be no coronation of Bush. "There's nothing inevitable now," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaigned in Dover on Thursday and planned to return Monday. He
criticized the absent McCain, saying, "You don't see me skipping anything," he
said. McCain's strategy is to concentrate on campaigning for South Carolina
primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley flew from New Hampshire into what they both see as a
national campaign now, both with stops in New York and then California before
their weekend break.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley sought support one state away, in College Park, Md., on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Gore stands for the old politics, for a win-by-any means kind of
campaigning. "It's relentlessly negative, attack a day, charge a day," he said.
Then he flew home to New Jersey for a brief break.
</P>
<P>
	   Matwey said his volunteer operation was on its own, short of money, lacking
even for campaign literature. He said his workers paid for their own "Bradley
2000" buttons, and he brought back some campaign flyers after a stint in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Coons, the Gore campaign leader, said it was hard to organize for the
primary without support, not even a wink or a nod, from the national campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In staying out, Lehane said, the national organization "respected the
Democratic National Commitee rules."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Delaware primary left its imprint on the 2000 campaign. Because
the state tried to get in early, New Hampshire moved up its date and held the
earliest primary ever. That lead Iowa to move, up, too, so the voting began
earlier than ever before.

<HEADLINE> Prada In America's Cup Finals  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- The America's Cup won't be returning to America.
</P>
<P>
	Prada skipper Francesco de Angelis made sure of that Sunday, sailing
brilliantly and beating AmericaOne by 49 seconds in the deciding race of the
challenger finals.
</P>
<P>
	So the shiny silver pitcher that United States boats had held from 1851 through
1983 will stay in Auckland or move to Italy if Prada can beat defending champion
New Zealand in the best-of-9 Cup finals starting Feb. 19. For de Angelis, it was
an improbable victory. In his first America's Cup campaign, he had let a 3-1
lead turn into a 4-3 deficit in the best-of-9 series. Then he won by 37 seconds
Saturday, setting up the winner-take-all race.
</P>
<P>
	For Paul Cayard, skipper of AmericaOne, it was a devastating loss. He was in
his fifth America's Cup campaign and was on a roll after winning three straight
races. Instead, his third turn as a Cup skipper ended like the other two -- in
defeat.
</P>
<P>
	Prada won the start by a second Sunday, a meaningless edge. What was important
was deAngelis' decision to sail up the right side of the 18 1/2-mile Hauraki
Gulf Course. The up-and-back course has six legs -- three into the wind and
three with the wind coming from behind.
</P>
<P>
	During the prestart maneuvering, Prada was concerned it would hit the starting
line too early, forcing it to circle behind and lose precious time.
</P>
<P>
	The stronger wind on the right pushed Prada to a 34-second lead after the first
leg, into the wind. That allowed de Angelis to dictate tactics and he stretched
the advantage to 39 seconds after the second leg and 47 midway through the race.
</P>
<P>
	He kept pushing and flew to the horizon with leads of 52 seconds after the
fourth leg and 1:06 after the fifth.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard had just one leg, a short 3 1/4 miles of blue water, to try to catch the
silver-and-gray leader, a virtually impossible task barring an equipment
catastrophe on Prada.

<P>
	   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Aleah Johnson scored 11 of her 19 points during a
four-minute stretch when ninth-ranked Texas Tech took control and went on to
beat Baylor 65-49 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Baylor beat the Lady Bears for the 35th straight time.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson's breakway layup tied it at 47 with about eight minutes left and
started a game-ending 20-2 run by the Lady Raiders (18-2, 7-2 Big 12).
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson's scoring barrage -- 11 of 12 Tech points during the first part of
the run -- ended with two free throws that made it 57-49 with 4:05 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Baylor (5-14, 0-9) didn't hit another field goal after Mandy Haworth's
15-footer provided a 47-45 lead with 8:51 left.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to having not beaten Texas Tech since 1983, Baylor now has a
nine-game losing streak during which it has lost by an average margin of 19
points. The Lady Raiders, meanwhile, have won seven straight by 20 points a
game.
</P>
<P>
	   Plenette Pierson added 15 points and Katrisa O'Neal 10 for the Lady Raiders.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicole Collins led Baylor with 12 points while Danielle Crockrom had 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Tech led 33-26 at halftime, but Baylor came back to tie the game at 39 on a
basket by Crockrom, which came just seconds after a 3-pointer by Collins. The
teams then traded two-point leads until Tech's decisive run.
</P>
<P>
	   After falling behind 4-0 early and missing it only three shots in the first
four minutes of the game, Texas Tech went ahead with nine straight points. The
Lady Bears got back even at 13 on a 3-pointer by Collins with 9:11 left but
didn't get ahead again until the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Raiders broke the tie with seven straight points, going ahead 20-13
on an inside basket by Pierson, who had 10 of her points in the first half.

<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Reserve Chucky Atkins scored 15 of his 17 points in
the fourth quarter as the Orlando Magic snapped Indiana's four-game winning
streak with a 107-102 victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   John Amaechi had 19 points and Pat Garrity added 18 for the Magic, but it
was Atkins who came through down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   The backup point guard scored seven of Orlando's last nine points, including
a driving one-hand runner that put his team up 103-97 with 49 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Jalen Rose led Indiana with 25 points, however the Pacers only got 13 from
Reggie Miller on 3-for-8 shooting to lose for the fifth straight time on the
road.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana, which has the best record in the Eastern Conference at 30-16, has
won 17 straight at home. But the Pacers haven't won on the road since coming
from behind to beat Orlando 96-89 on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
	   It was another uphill battle this time. Orlando built an early 17-point,
fell behind in the third quarter and regained control early in the fourth
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Mercer, obtained along with Chauncey Billups and Johnny Taylor in a
trade that sent Chris Gatling and Tariq Abdul-Wahad from Orlando to Denver
earlier in the week, was 4-of-12 from the field and scored eight points in his
first game for the Magic.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana trailed 25-8 with three minutes left in the opening quarter and
wiped out the deficit over the next 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose scored 10 in the first four minutes of the second quarter and Austin
Croshere tied it on two occasions before Orlando took a 53-50 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacers led 73-69 going into the fourth quarter, but couldn't stay in
front. Orlando began the last period with a 22-9 run to go up 91-82 with just
under seven minutes left.
</P>
<P>
	   The closest Indiana got the rest of the way was four points twice, the last
time at 101-97 with about a minute to go.

<P>
	   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- It wasn't one for the tape vault, but No. 4
Syracuse is still unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
	   The Orangemen set school records for free throws made and attempted Saturday
night as they rode the 19 points and 14 rebounds of Etan Thomas to a 74-58
victory over Providence.
</P>
<P>
	   The only unbeaten team in Division I, Syracuse (19-0, 9-0 Big East) pulled
away in the second half after Providence (8-14, 1-8) had pulled within 37-33.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas, who was saddled with early foul trouble, had 12 points in the second
half, including six free throws. He finished 9-of-14 from the line.
</P>
<P>
	   Syracuse finished 38-for-51 from the line, breaking the record for free
throws made -- 36 against Pittsburgh in 1969-70 and Connecticut in 1981-82 --
and attempted -- 48 against Siena in 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
	   The 19-game winning streak matches the longest in a season for the
Orangemen, set in 1978-79, and is four short of the multiyear record, set with
the seven games in 1916-17 and the first 16 in 1917-18.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss was the eighth straight for the Friars, their longest since losing
12 in a row in 1948-49.
</P>
<P>
	   Damone Brown and Jason Hart each had 11 points for Syracuse, which led 68-48
with 3:13 left on a basket down low by Hart. The Orangemen shot 34.7 percent
(17-for-49), including 2-for-11 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   Erron Maxey had 18 points for Providence, which shot 28.6 percent
(18-for-63), including 2-for-13 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams combined for 50 fouls, 31 called on Providence.

<HEADLINE> Prada In America's Cup Finals  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- The America's Cup won't be returning to America.
</P>
<P>
	Prada skipper Francesco de Angelis made sure of that Sunday, sailing
brilliantly and beating AmericaOne by 49 seconds in the deciding race of the
challenger finals.
</P>
<P>
	So the shiny silver pitcher that United States boats had held from 1851 through
1983 will stay in Auckland or move to Italy if Prada can beat defending champion
New Zealand in the best-of-9 Cup finals starting Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	For de Angelis, it was an improbable victory. In his first America's Cup
campaign, he had let a 3-1 lead turn into a 4-3 deficit in the best-of-9 series.
Then he won by 37 seconds Saturday, setting up the winner-take-all race.
</P>
<P>
	For Paul Cayard, skipper of AmericaOne, it was a devastating loss. He was in
his fifth America's Cup campaign and was on a roll after winning three straight
races. Instead, his third turn as a Cup skipper ended like the other two -- in
defeat.
</P>
<P>
	Prada won the start by a second Sunday, a meaningless edge. What was important
was deAngelis' decision to sail up the right side of the 18 1/2-mile Hauraki
Gulf Course. The up-and-back course has six legs -- three into the wind and
three with the wind coming from behind.
</P>
<P>
	During the prestart maneuvering, Prada was concerned it would hit the starting
line too early, forcing it to circle behind and lose precious time.
</P>
<P>
	The stronger wind on the right pushed Prada to a 34-second lead after the first
leg, into the wind. That allowed de Angelis to dictate tactics and he stretched
the advantage to 39 seconds after the second leg and 47 midway through the race.
</P>
<P>
	He kept pushing and flew to the horizon with leads of 52 seconds after the
fourth leg and 1:06 after the fifth.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard had just one leg, a short 3 1/4 miles of blue water, to try to catch the
silver-and-gray leader, a virtually impossible task barring an equipment
catastrophe on Prada.
</P>
<P>
	Instead, there was a celebration.
</P>
<P>
	As de Angelis cruised across the finish line, his crew members shook hands and
embraced. A passenger on Prada's tender waved an Italian flag as the boat, which
carries non-sailing team members, pulled alongside.
</P>
<P>
	One Prada sailor shook a huge bottle of champagne, popped the cork and soaked
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
	Patrizio Bertelli, the primary backer of the campaign estimated at about twice
the amount of Cayard's $32 million effort, wore a red vest and a wide smile as
he boarded the yacht and shook hands vigorously with de Angelis.
</P>
<P>
	Then the winning skipper lifted the bottle of champagne and took a long drink.
</P>
<P>
	As hard as he tried, Cayard, sailing for the St. Francis Yacht Club in San
Francisco, could do nothing about it. For the first time in America's Cup
history, an American boat won't be in the finals.
</P>
<P>
	In Cayard's two previous campaigns as helmsman, he lost in the challenger
finals in 1992 and the Cup finals in 1995. But he's also a six-time world
champion in other boats and won the grueling Whitbread Round the World Race in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	Prada had taken a 3-1 lead, but two of those resulted from equipment damage and
a penalty on AmericaOne. Then AmericaOne won the next three races, reinforcing
Cayard's reputation as a skipper who can't be rattled.
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, he was at the helm of an Italian boat, Il Moro di Venezia, that
trailed the challenger finals 3-1. But he won the next four races and went on to
the Cup finals, where he lost 4-1 to Bill Koch's Stars &AMP; Stripes.
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't repeat that comeback this time.
</P>
<P>
	The race began 50 minutes late as officials waited for the fluky winds on the
Hauraki Gulf to pick up. They finally did, blowing from the southwest at 10-14
knots at the start.
</P>
<P>
	About 30 seconds before the start, a Prada crewman warned de Angelis that he
might reach the starting line too early. ``Be careful,'' the sailor said.
</P>
<P>
	De Angelis was.
</P>
<P>
	The United States won the first 25 competitions, starting in 1851 when the
schooner America, representing the New York Yacht Club, beat 14 other boats in
one race around the Isle of Wight in England.
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the trophy presented to the winner was called the 100 Guineas Cup,
the amount it cost. It later was renamed for the first winner.
</P>
<P>
	The first defense came in 1870, a 35-mile race off New York City with 14 NYYC
boats going against England's Cambria, which finished 10th. Magic was the
winner.
</P>
<P>
	There were 11 more successful defenses in New York before the scene shifted to
Newport, R.I., in 1920. American boats won 13 consecutive defenses there. But
the nation's streak of 25 Cup triumphs ended in 1983 in Newport when John
Bertrand's Australia II beat Dennis Conner's Liberty.
</P>
<P>
	Conner regained the Cup in Fremantle, Australia, in 1987 and Americans retained
it in 1988 and 1992 before New Zealand swept Young America, sailed by Cayard,
5-0 in San Diego in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	If Cayard wants to keep trying, he'll have to sail in hostile waters again.

    AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Stacy Frese scored 21 points, including five 3-pointers,

<HEADLINE> No. 22 LSU 93, Alabama 60  </HEADLINE>
    By JENNA FRYER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- No. 22 LSU needed only 15 minutes to convince coach
John Brady it needed a challenge. It took the Tigers half that time to answer
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady was so disgusted by LSU's effort in Friday's practice that he kicked
the entire team out after just 15 minutes. He gathered the Tigers up early
Saturday, and challenged them to pull it together later against Alabama.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven minutes into the game, it was obvious they had.
</P>
<P>
	   Stromile Swift had 21 points and 12 rebounds to help the Tigers win their
first Southeastern Conference road game since 1998, 93-60 over the
injury-ravaged Crimson Tide.
</P>
<P>
	   "Friday's practice, I didn't like the sense of urgency I sensed on our
team," Brady said. "I didn't want to watch that, so I dismissed them."
</P>
<P>
	   He then ran a one-hour practice Saturday morning, where he worked the Tigers
hard and ordered them to pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
	   "It worked because tonight we started the game playing well and continued to
play with intensity through the whole game," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers (17-4, 4-4) had lost 16 straight SEC road games. They ended that
streak by handing Alabama its most-lopsided home loss since 1968.
</P>
<P>
	   LSU won at Alabama (10-10, 3-5) for the first time since 1995. The Tigers
earned their first victory this season on an opponent's home court, where they
were 0-3. They have won five games on neutral sites.
</P>
<P>
	   It's been that way for LSU all season long. The Tigers have won big at home
-- like last Saturday's 86-60 blowout over No. Arizona -- but have struggled
hard on the road. They blew a late 12-point lead Wednesday at Mississippi State
and lost 68-66 on a 3-pointer with 24 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
	   It was never even close at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
	   The Crimson Tide, playing with just 10 players -- two are walk-ons --
because of injuries, couldn't slow the Tigers' fast pace and dominating inside
play. LSU outrebounded the Tide 45-25 and scored 28 points off 21 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   A frustrated Alabama coach Mark Gottfried said he'd had it with the injuries
and would start playing the walk-ons if some of his scholarship players didn't
get tougher.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Haginas missed a week of practice and two games, but leading scorer
Schea Cotton didn't scrimmage at all this week, but still played in both of
Alabama's games.
</P>
<P>
	   Gottfried said that would end.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our biggest problem is we haven't practiced in 10 days, we don't have
enough guys to practice," Gottfried said. "This guy's got an ailment, this guy
is hurt, I've had it. If our players can't practice they can't play."
</P>
<P>
	   Gottfried was so angry, he said he'd force the Tide to practice after the
game if the NCAA would let him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am very disappointed. I'm embarrassed, our players are and I think that
we should be," he said. "There was a point when I think our kids lost the
competitive edge and that's disappointing for me."
</P>
<P>
	   LSU took an early 13-11 lead, then held Alabama scoreless for over seven
minutes in the first half while pulling away for a 46-24 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama tried to run with LSU early in the second half, but poor shooting
prevented the strategy from working in its favor. Swift converted two Alabama
turnovers into sky-high alley-oop dunks, and after a 3-pointer from Cotton,
Jabari Smith sparked a 14-2 run with two spinning jumpers that gave LSU a 68-33
lead with 10:44 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   After Gottfried called a timeout to calm the Tide, Cotton and Erwin Dudley
hit three straight jumpers and Terrance Meade made a free throw to make it
70-40, but the Tide never got any closer than that.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's all about heart and we didn't show any tonight," said Meade.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith had 14 points for LSU. Ronald Dupree scored 12, Brian Beshera and
Collis Temple each had 11 and Lamont Roland added 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Cotton and Dudley scored 16 each for Alabama.

<HEADLINE> No. 9 Arizona 90, Oregon St. 73  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB BAUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- For the past 18 years, there has been one certainty in
Pac-10 basketball: Oregon State always loses at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday night was no exception, not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Loren Woods capped a big week with 15 points and nine rebounds in an
abbreviated appearance as ninth-ranked Wildcats routed Oregon State 90-73 to
remain tied with Stanford for the Pac-10 lead halfway through the conference
season.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a pretty stress-free week," Woods said. "Against Oregon, we got a
tough, physical game but we executed down the stretch. Tonight, we were able to
run away a little bit more, and we were able to get some people some rest."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, who tied an NCAA record with 14 blocked shots in Thursday night's
victory over Oregon, left Saturday's game for good with 8:37 to play and the
Wildcats ahead 64-42. He had only one block this time.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beavers (10-10, 2-7) lost their fourth in a row and are 0-18 at McKale
Center since Lute Olson became the Wildcats coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Wright scored 22 for Arizona (19-4, 8-1 Pac-10), most of them long
after the outcome was decided. Gilbert Arenas and Rick Anderson added 13 points
apiece and Luke Walton had 12 points and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought the best players for us were Rick and Luke," Olson said. "They
did a good job defensively, and they made it very difficult on their wings. We
got good offensive production from them, combining for 25 points, and we also
got 10 boards out of them."
</P>
<P>
	   The success of Walton and Anderson led to Wright's big night, because the
big power forward wasn't double-teamed inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon State struggled against Arizona's quick defense, committing 20
turnovers, 10 by point guard Deaundra Tanner, who also made just two of 10
shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Jackson led Oregon State with 18 points and Justin Heide and Jimmie
Haywood added 12 apiece. All of Heide's points came in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson was recruited intensely by Olson but chose to stay in his home
state. Haywood, who once verbally committed to attend Arizona, was 4-for-4 from
3-point range. Jackson and Haywood both are freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted to do well here because they recruited me," Jackson said. "So, I
tried extra hard to do well."
</P>
<P>
	   Up 40-30 at the break, the Wildcats scored the first 12 points of the second
half to blow out to a 52-30 lead. Arenas scored six during the spurt on a stuff,
a steal and layup and a 10-foot fast-break jumper. Meanwhile, the Beavers
committed five turnovers in the first 4 1/2 minutes of the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon State didn't come closer than 15 again.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lack of consistency on our whole team," Beavers coach Eddie Payne
said. "We need every guy to be on the same page every night. Everyone has to
come to play on the same night."
</P>
<P>
	   The Beavers, who beat Arizona at Corvallis last season, led early but the
Wildcats broke away from a 24-24 tie with a 13-0 run to go ahead 37-24 with 2:52
left in the half. Jason Gardner, just 4-for-27 shooting in his last three games,
started the outburst with a 3-pointer and Anderson ended it with a running
one-hander in the lane.
</P>
<P>
	   A 3-pointer by the Beavers' Ramunas Petraitis with 42 seconds left in the
half cut Arizona's lead to 40-30 at the break.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon State had 12 turnovers in the first half, eight by Tanner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats gave Gardner a rare rest and played walk-on John Ash some in
the second half, but Ash left the game with a strained knee ligament.

<HEADLINE> Kozlov Leads World to Skills Title  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA PODELL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- First-time All-Star Viktor Kozlov overshadowed Al MacInnis
and Ray Bourque on Saturday night to lead the World team to its third straight
victory in the SuperSkills competition, 13-11 over North America.
</P>
<P>
	   The World team is undefeated since the NHL adopted this All-Star format in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "The World team has usually won the skills competition, then the North
Americans win the game," said Mats Sundin, playing at home in front of a
friendly Maple Leafs crowd. "Hopefully we will have a better effort from our
team (Sunday) in the game."
</P>
<P>
	   Kozlov, of the Florida Panthers, knocked out four targets in five attempts
to tie Bourque for the most accurate shot and then scored against Toronto goalie
Curtis Joseph in the breakaway relay.
</P>
<P>
	   Bourque has won or tied for the accuracy shooting title seven times,
including the last four.
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia Flyers captain Eric Lindros missed the competition with the
flu. It was unknown if he would play in the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
	   MacInnis ripped a shot clocked at 100.1 mph to claim the NHL's hardest shot
for the fourth straight year and sixth in nine competitions.
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Louis defenseman, who missed the net on his second attempt, narrowly
defeated North American teammate, John LeClair of Philadelphia, who shot at 100
mph.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously they are closing the gap on me," MacInnis said. "These guys are
getting bigger and stronger and it's getting tougher to win this event every
year."
</P>
<P>
	   It was only the second time MacInnis, who also won in 1991 and 1992, took
the title with a shot topping 100 mph. LeClair was the runnerup a year ago in
Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   MacInnis returned to the Blues lineup Thursday night after missing five
games because of a collapsed right lung. The injury almost kept him out of
All-Star weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was very close," MacInnis said about skipping the event. "If there was
any risk at all playing in Vancouver the other night, and the All-Star game,
obviously I wouldn't have taken that chance."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Richter of the New York Rangers won the goalie competition by stopping
all 10 shots in the rapid fire event and four of six in the breakaway relay.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams split the puck control relay and Carolina forward Sami Kapanen won
the fastest skater event, finishing in 13.649 seconds. The World team also had a
faster average time (14.016).
</P>
<P>
	   "The fastest skate was a lot of fun," Kapanen said. "I got a bit more
relaxed after that and had a good time."
</P>
<P>
	   The World team clinched the night's activities with seven goals in the
breakaway relay, highlighted by Sundin's score against Maple Leafs teammate
Joseph.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's competitive out there," Sundin said. "Everybody wants to do their best
and nobody wants to get embarrassed."
</P>
<P>
	   Before the skills competition, two teams of former Toronto Maple Leafs
defeated a pair of squads made up of Heroes of Hockey 6-1. Frank Mahovlich
scored two goals.
</P>
<P>
	   Over 100 NHL alumni were in attendance, including players from the first
All-Star game in 1947.
</P>
<P>
	   "This experience never gets old for me," said Sundin, a five-time All-Star.
"It's a great time here, meeting all the players, especially for me now in front
of my hometown and home fans.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great town and I am really going to enjoy this weekend."

<HEADLINE> NHL OK's Bettman Olympics Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN ROBINSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- The NHL has not yet signed off on sending players to the
2002 Winter Olympics, but commissioner Gary Bettman was given permission
Saturday by the Board of Governors to wrap up an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The board also extended through the 2000-01 season the aid program that
helps the six heavily taxed Canada teams compensate for the weak Canadian
dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   And, with goaltenders increasingly being bumped and pushed since the
relaxation of the in-the-crease rule, referees are being instructed to make
certain such contact isn't causing goals.
</P>
<P>
	   Meeting with the board a day before the NHL All-Star game, Bettman said
there is strong but not unanimous sentiment to sending players to the Salt Lake
City Olympics in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   "They authorized me to conclude the agreement that might have us go to the
Olympics," Bettman said. "But it is not yet concluded, and we still might not
go. But, if it is all worked out, I have the authority to take the league
through the Olympic process."
</P>
<P>
	   The International Ice Hockey Federation is working with the Salt Lake
Olympic Organizing Committee to finalize a schedule acceptable to the NHL. The
league does not want to shut down again for two weeks, as it did in Nagano in
1998, and instead is looking for a window of 12 days or so.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the NHL wants television exposure for Olympic hockey, which, because
of concerns over low ratings and time zone differences, was relegated in Nagano
mostly to the early morning hours on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to read headlines tomorrow saying we're going," Bettman said.
"But, if we work this out, I don't have to go back to the board for us to go."
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian assistance program was extended in December for five years in
anticipation of a Canadian government bailout worth about $20 million annually.
But, amid a public outcry over using tax dollars to support the privately owned
franchises, the government pulled the plug on the program only a couple days
after approving it last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-year extension of the NHL-backed plan was contingent upon the
Canadian government program going forward. So, for now, the NHL will decide on a
year-to-year basis whether to extend its own plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian teams are at a distinct financial disadvantage because they collect
their revenues mostly in Canadian dollars, but pay salaries in American dollars.
The Calgary Flames currently reap about $3 million annually from the NHL aid
plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ottawa Senators, the team expected to benefit most from the Canadian
government bailout, say they must sell 12,500 season tickets next year and
increase luxury box revenues to survive.
</P>
<P>
	   Bettman criticized the Canadian government pullout, saying, "Others might
have abandoned the Canadian clubs, but we are not about to."
</P>
<P>
	   The greater emphasis on eliminating goaltender obstruction is not a tweaking
of the rules, NHL operations chief Colin Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   But referees were instructed Wednesday in a conference call to make certain
that contact around the goal mouth isn't giving an unintended advantage to the
team with the puck.
</P>
<P>
	   Only days after the Stanley Cup playoffs ended on Brett Hull's disputed
goal, the NHL altered the rule that wiped out goals when even part of a player's
skate was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   But, Campbell said, "Players are finding ways to bump the goaltenders, and
the referees understand the goaltenders need more protection.
</P>
<P>
	   "But we think the changes in the crease rule are great. We wanted to cut
down on the use of video replays, and we have."

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Stanford 67, USC 57  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN NADEL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stanford did it on defense Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Again.
</P>
<P>
	   Reserve Ryan Mendez scored eight of his career-high 24 points in a
two-minute span in the first half, and the second-ranked Cardinal put the clamps
on Southern California in beating the Trojans 67-57.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the toughest defense in the entire nation," said USC's Brian
Scalabrine, a junior who had 20 points and six rebounds in a losing cause.
"Defense wins games, and defense is probably going to win a national
championship for them. This was the most physical game I've ever played in."
</P>
<P>
	   The Trojans, who entered the game shooting 47 percent and averaging 78.4
points, made only 32.8 percent (22-of-67) against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
	   Only four teams have shot over 40 percent against Stanford this season, and
none over 50. Opponents have made less than 34 percent of their shots this
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford also outrebounded USC 50-27.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a lot of pride there," Stanford's David Moseley said of his team's
defense. "You like shutting somebody down."
</P>
<P>
	   Then, looking at the box score, Moseley said, "Granville, 2-for-12. Michael
shut him down, ding-ding."
</P>
<P>
	   Moseley was referring to USC point guard Brandon Granville and his Stanford
counterpart, Michael McDonald.
</P>
<P>
	   Granville was one of several Trojans to have a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's something that's been stressed at Stanford as long as I've been
here," said Mark Madsen, who guarded Scalabrine. "The guys have bought into the
program, that defense wins games."
</P>
<P>
	   Scalabrine called Madsen the toughest defender he's ever faced.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendez, a junior averaging 9.4 points, scored eight in a row to trigger a
15-0 run that began midway through the first half and put Stanford (19-1, 8-1
Pac-10) ahead for good. His previous career high was 18.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll take it. You have to take advantage of your minutes when you're out
there," said Mendez, who played 26 minutes and made 6-of-8 shots, including
4-of-5 from 3-point range, and all eight of his foul shots.
</P>
<P>
	   "The wings were open in this game," Mendez said. "They gambled a little bit.
We always had three or four feet to work with. One through 13, this team can
hurt you. It's really hard to key on anyone."
</P>
<P>
	   Moseley had 13 points and nine rebounds and freshman Casey Jacobsen also
scored 13 points for Stanford -- all in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Trepagnier added 16 points, three steals and three blocked shots for
the Trojans (13-8, 6-3), who lost for the third time in four games after a
seven-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted their big people to beat us inside, but their outside people were
the key factors in the game," USC coach Henry Bibby said. "We held them to 67
points and that's not bad. We need four or five guys playing very good
basketball for us to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford has won seven straight games by an average of 19 points since
losing to No. 9 Arizona 68-65 on Jan. 8, and is 26-4 in road games during the
last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was two teams playing hard on defense," Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "Had we not boarded well with our 13 turnovers (in the first half), we
would have been in trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   "Defensively, we did gut it out. We were out-toughed a little in the first
half, so we talked about not giving in to their pressure and we did a better job
in the second half."
</P>
<P>
	   Trepagnier scored five points to spark a 7-2 USC run early in the second
half, cutting Stanford's lead to four points.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford scored the next seven points to lead 41-30, and the Trojans weren't
closer than eight thereafter. USC scored the game's last five points.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford endured a five-minute scoring drought early in the game but, thanks
to defense, trailed by just four points when it ended.
</P>
<P>
	   The Trojans extended the lead to 15-9 on Nate Hair's 3-pointer 10:40 before
halftime. USC went cold at that stage, failing to score for 6 1/2 minutes and
going without a field goal for nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   After Mendez made two 3-pointers and two free throws, Madsen scored two
straight baskets and Moseley added a 3-pointer for a 24-15 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Scalabrine ended the USC drought with two foul shots with 4:09 left before
halftime, triggering an 8-4 run that cut Stanford's lead to 28-23 at halftime.

    MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Vince Carter scored 30 points and Dell Curry tormented his
former team with four 3-pointers as the Toronto Raptors beat the Milwaukee Bucks
98-95 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, who also had 11 rebounds and five assists, scored 12 points in the
first quarter, and the Raptors built their lead to 48-34 at halftime by holding
the Bucks to 30-percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Curry finished with 16 points and Anthony Davis had 12 for the Raptors.
Glenn Robinson led Milwaukee with 29 points, Sam Cassell had 25 and Ray Allen
12.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee used a 17-4 run to get within six in the final minute of the third
quarter. A field goal by Carter and a running 3-pointer at the buzzer by Muggsy
Bogues gave Toronto a 70-59 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Bogues slapped the ball away from unsuspecting Cassell, who was going up for
a layup, before running at full speed to get off a desperation shot. It banged
on the rim and fell through.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter dominated early in the final quarter, scoring Toronto's first eight
points. But the Bucks made things interesting by closing within five at 85-80
with 3:44 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Curry's fourth 3-pointer gave the Raptors an 89-85 lead with 58 seconds to
play. Milwaukee's Tim Thomas and Cassell, who rebounded a missed free throw by
Thomas, made field goals in a three-second span to make it 92-89 with 50 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter was fouled on his baseline drive and made two free throws for a
five-point lead with 33 seconds left. Allen's dunk was offset by two free throws
by Bogues, who made two more following a field goal by Robinson for a 98-93
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucks had one chance to tie. After Robinson made two free throws, he
missed a running 3-pointer after a turnover on a long inbounds pass.

<HEADLINE> Six Dead in German Train Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- An express train derailed in western Germany early
Sunday morning, killing at least six people and injuring more than 100.
</P>
<P>
	   Cologne police spokesman Peter Massen said 30 rescue vehicles were on the
scene of the crash that occurred at 12:13 a.m. south of Cologne. Four
helicopters were also dispatched to the scene to transport the injured,
including 20 with critical injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The train, which had started its trip in Amsterdam, had nine cars, but
Massen said the number of actual passengers on the train was not immediately
known. The train, which was on its way to Basel, Switzerland, derailed with at
least one car flipping on its side, railways spokesman Manfred Ziegerath said.

<HEADLINE> No. 4 Syracuse 74, Providence 58  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM O'CONNELL AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Syracuse's latest win won't make any highlight
reels. It just keeps the perfect season going.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-ranked Orangemen set school records for free throws made and
attempted Saturday night in a 74-58 victory over Providence, one that kept them
the only unbeaten team in Division I.
</P>
<P>
	   Etan Thomas had 19 points and 14 rebounds for Syracuse (19-0, 9-0 Big East)
in the game that seemed to be stopped by a whistle every few seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you don't make shots you have to find another way to win. We hung in
there and Etan had a good game inside," Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. "Our
defense was active. We didn't give them anything easy. You have to find a way to
win these games and we did."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas, who was saddled with early foul trouble, had 12 points in the second
half, including six free throws. He finished 9-of-14 from the line.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was a lot of free throws," Thomas said. "It was a real chippy type
game the whole night. When one aspect isn't working you have to find another."
</P>
<P>
	   Syracuse finished 38-for-51 from the line, breaking the record for free
throws made -- 36 against Pittsburgh in 1969-70 and Connecticut in 1981-82 --
and attempted -- 48 against Siena in 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're a pressing, trapping team trying to create turnovers," Boeheim
said. "They're going to come at you. They're going to foul you."
</P>
<P>
	   The 19-game winning streak matches the longest in a season for the
Orangemen, set in 1978-79, and is four short of the multiyear record, set with
the last seven games in 1916-17 and the first 16 in 1917-18.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a ton of difficult games ahead of us," Boeheim said. "There are a
lot of tests left on the schedule."
</P>
<P>
	   Providence (8-14, 1-8) was within 37-33 early in the second half only to see
Syracuse pull away.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss was the eighth straight for the Friars, their longest streak since
losing 12 in a row in 1948-49.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not easy. I'm trying to hold my character high and keep the kids
pumped up," Providence coach Tim Welsh said. "My insides and outside are a lot
different but you can't feel sorry for yourself or you're going in the wrong
direction."
</P>
<P>
	   Damone Brown and Jason Hart each had 11 points for Syracuse, which led 68-48
with 3:13 left on a basket down low by Hart. The Orangemen shot 34.7 percent
(17-for-49), including 2-for-11 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   Erron Maxey had 18 points for Providence, which shot 28.6 percent
(18-for-63), including 2-for-13 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams combined for 50 fouls, 31 called on Providence.
</P>
<P>
	   "It had a lot to do with our inexperience but they had a lot to do with it
too," Welsh said. "They make it very difficult for you to get a second shot.
They're a great team. We hung around for a while but couldn't make any shots
against their zone.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fifty-one free throws was because they're an aggressive team. Period. End."

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Set To Defend  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Team New Zealand tinkered with its equipment,
sailed its boats and had plenty of time to wonder just how good it would be in
its first America's Cup defense.
</P>
<P>
	It's about to find out.
</P>
<P>
	Sunday marked the end of the intense, best-of-9 challenger finals in which
Prada of Italy beat AmericaOne by 49 seconds for a 5-4 win. That signaled the
start of the next phase of the Kiwis' campaign, the best-of-9 series for
sailing's top prize -- an ornate silver pitcher with no bottom.
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to go racing,'' New Zealand skipper Russell Coutts said before
Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
	The challenger trials began on Oct. 18 with 11 boats from seven countries. Team
New Zealand chose not to have a defender series so it missed the competitive
racing that would sharpen its sailing.
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it took its own two boats out on the Hauraki Gulf, and did what it
could to improve in preparation for the finals starting Feb. 19 on that same
body of water.
</P>
<P>
	``In match racing, you can't practice all the moves. There are a lot of moves
that are unexpected. There are a lot of moves that you're reacting to the other
boat,'' Coutts said in a local television interview. ``We would have liked to
have had an outside competition but didn't this time and I think it is an
advantage for the challengers.''
</P>
<P>
	But with a small nation of about 4 million people, New Zealand syndicate head
Sir Peter Blake didn't think there would be enough financial support for two
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	When Blake won the Cup in San Diego in 1995, with Coutts at the helm, they had
plenty of practice since they were challenging and participated in the trials.
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand's boat that year, Black Magic, was the fastest by far. It swept the
finals 5-0 over Young America, skippered by Paul Cayard, who was driving
AmericaOne this time. The victory margins were huge -- 2 minutes, 45 seconds,
4:14, 1:51, 3:37 and 1:50.
</P>
<P>
	The differences probably won't be that great again, but the Kiwis will have to
wait until the first race of the Cup finals to see how they match up.
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say I'm really worried about any aspect,'' Coutts said. ``Across the
board, we're well prepared. I guess it's the unknown that you always worry about
and being surprised and we've done our best to not be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
	There is some suspicion that New Zealand might be weaker in light air than
strong wind, but all Coutts would say was, ``we're working on all aspects of our
program.''
</P>
<P>
	Starting with a race in 1851 around the Isle of Wight in England that the
schooner America won, U.S. boats won all 25 competitions until Australia won in
1983 in Newport, R.I., the 13th consecutive time the Cup was contested there.
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand's first participation was in 1987 off Fremantle, Australia, where
it lost the challenger finals to Dennis Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes. It lost the
next year in San Diego to Conner's catamaran. In 1992, the Kiwis' boat -- the
Red Sled -- lost the challenger finals to Il Moro di Venezia, skippered by
Cayard.
</P>
<P>
	Now, they are the defenders.
</P>
<P>
	The Auckland waterfront was transformed into a bustling mix of chic sidewalk
cafes with street entertainers, a maritime museum and retail shops. Modern
facilities were built for all the syndicates, side by side.
</P>
<P>
	Coutts would like to use them again to defend the Cup.
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to keep it for a long time,'' he said. ``It's difficult but it's
definitely doable, and we would like to eventually have a similar situation to
what Newport, R.I. had.''
