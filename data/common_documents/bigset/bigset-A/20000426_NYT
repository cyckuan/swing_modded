<P>
   OJAI, Calif. _ Those who know the long and storied history of
the Ojai Valley Tennis Tournament likely are aware that William
Thacher founded in 1896 what is now the country's largest amateur
annual tennis event.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps what gets lost is just how, exactly, did Thacher
jump-start the tradition, which will serve up its 100th tournament
beginning today and running through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Before one can look at the humble and unassuming beginnings of
what is better known in tennis circles as ''The Ojai'', the present
needs to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   A total of about 1,600 players (100 of which hail from the San
Gabriel Valley), 600 volunteers, and countless coaches and fans
will descend upon this quiant, friendly town _ and others within a
25-mile radius _ to watch the likes of USC's Andrew Park and Cal's
John Paul Fruttero (both San Marino High products) compete in the
Pac-10 singles and doubles tournament. That is the featured event
held annually here at Libbey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Others will venture into Ventura, or, perhaps, Port Hueneme, to
watch independent and community college players compete in
early-round matches today and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some also will head to private homes _ complete with tennis
courts, obviously _ to watch boys and girls junior events and the
CIF-Southern Section boys singles and doubles early rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The list of champions and participants is a who's who of the
greats of the game. You name it, with the exception of John McEnroe
and Andre Agassi, and they have played here.
</P>
<P>
   Alhambra High's Claude A. Wayne was a two-time Boys CIF champion
here _ in 1902 and 1903. Pasadena High's Ellsworth Vines Jr., won
the same event in 1928. So did fellow Bulldog Stan Smith in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kramer was a Boys' CIF champ representing Montebello High
in 1937. Talk about history! Who won the event in the three
previous years prior to Kramer? The answer: A fellow named Robert
Riggs of Franklin High. . . . Yes, that Bobby Riggs!
</P>
<P>
   The history of the ''The Ojai'' is mind-boggling. One look at
the past winners brings to life a truly vivid stroll down memory
lane to tennis fans of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   So where did it all start?
</P>
<P>
   The answer appears to lay with Thacher's older brother, Edward,
who settled in Ojai as a citrus grower in the late 1880's. Another
Thacher, brother, Sherman, later founded the renowed Thacher
School, a prep school whose list of alumni includes one Howard
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Ojai Valley News' Patricia L. Fry in 1983,
Sherman told his brother William prior to an 1890 visit, ''William,
if you have brought white tennis trousers, tennis shoes, and a
racquet and white hat in your trunk, please, please keep them
there. We here do not play tennis at all. We work and play with
horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, William Thacher fell in love with Ojai, became a
headmaster at Thacher School, and organized the Ojai Athletic Club
to promote sports, including tennis.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1895, the Ojai Valley Tennis Club was formed and
the following year, a tennis tournament was held pitting champions
from Ventura. That was the inauguaral version of ''The Ojai.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1897, players from Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Pasadena
were invited to play here as well. A year later, players from all
over the state descended upon the town. In 1899, 500 players
competing in Men's singles and Boys' high school singles and
doubles played and the tournament was off and running.
</P>
<P>
   The only shutdowns in the annual event came during the four
years of World War II and earlier in 1924, when the Ojai Valey was
closed due to Hoof and Mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
   What has kept ''The Ojai'' going strong as ever is a subtle
combination of elite tennis and a community that opens its
collective arms to the outside world for four days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the two things that absolutely stick out in my
mind,'' said Pasadena Poly High School tennis coach Howie Farer.
''The quality of tennis is fabulous and the people who help run the
tournament are just incredibily friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   And Farer, perhaps more than any other San Gabriel Valley tennis
enthusiast, speaks from experience. He will be making what he
believes is ''about my 50th trip to Ojai'' as both a former player
at Whittier College and the past 35 years as Poly's coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''While so many things have changed, ''The Ojai has remained so
consistently the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that seems to stick out to those included in the
Ojai alumni is their stay in town during the event. . . . Or,
actually, where, they stayed. Tennis results often get lost in
discussion's of one's Ojai experience.
</P>
<P>
   Binney Moss, a 70-year-old Ojai resident who played doubles in
the event here in 1945, is one of a number of locals who open up
their homes and backyards to players during the four-day event. She
also has housed players as well since 1977, and this year, former
champion and pro player Pam Teeguarden will be an occupant of the
Moss' family guest house.
</P>
<P>
   Moss twice watched a young Michael Chang play a early-round
match in her backyard in the mid 1980's. ''I remember him more than
others, perhaps, because he became famous,'' Moss said. ''He always
stayed very focused and he was very gentlemanly on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the action here centers around Libbey Park, located at
the center of town. The Pac-10 competition - men and women -
annually draw the biggest crowds. As a player in an event other
than the Pac-10's, the goal is to, ''make it to Libbey,'' which
means you're likely a semifinalist or a finalist competing in front
of packed-park crowds on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Ojai'' also is tradition-rich, much in the same fashion as
Wimbledon. Fresh orange juice is served _ free _ during the morning
hours and afternoon tea is served at Libbey Park as well during the
afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   ''This tournament is a very big deal to this town, we all take a
great deal of pride in it and what we do as individuals,'' said
Gerry Roe, a tournament volunteer who annually handles those within
the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me that everyone in town has a story, a tennis
story. The players, the same thing. And you know what's funny? The
stories aren't usually about matches, but rather, where people
stayed, what they did in town, who they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ''And every story is different, new, and, yes, I find them
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Farer and his Poly girls strolled to an Ojai
private residence to watch a Prep League friend and rival play
during the 1990 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the girls were friends with Lindsay when she played
for Chadwick,'' Farer said. ''And yeah, she won her match.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport has won a few more matches since her Ojai
triumph 10 years ago as a high school student at Rancho Palos
Verdes' Chadwick School. Take one peek at the women's singles
rankings, you'll find Davenport at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ojai has a little tradition going for it.

HOME RUNS NOT SPECIAL ANYMORE
</HEADLINE>
 ... CORRECTS NEWSPAPER WITH(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; The home run used to be a thing of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   A deep fly or cannon shot lifted 375 feet or further away from
home plate once was awe-inspiring, a lightning moment in time that
often defined a game.
</P>
<P>
   When a slugger like Willie Star gell, Hank Aaron or Reg gie
Jackson came to the plate at a crucial time, the hum of
anticipation by fans over the prospect of a game-winning home run
was palpable. These rare intersections were part of baseball's
passionate appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But not anymore. The home run has become baseball's cockroach.
</P>
<P>
   It is everywhere, and it is multiplying. Once the purview of a
few hitters, the home run now infests the game. A game born of
nuance now plays like pinball.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, a record 5,528 home runs were hit in Major League
Baseball, a 10 percent jump over 1998 (5,064 home runs), which held
the previous major league record. In 1999, 44 different players hit
30 or more home runs. In the entire decade of the '70s, 30-plus
homers were reached a mere 100 times.
</P>
<P>
   To put those numbers in an easy-to-understand form, imagine Fox
Sports' Keith Olbermann saying, ``It's deep and I don't think it's
playable'' 5,528 consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
   Chicks dig the long ball, of course, and fans aren't exactly
registering dissatisfaction at the box office. It has its place in
the game whether you're old school or new school. Earl Weaver, the
former sage of Baltimore, prayed at the temple of the three-run
jack.
</P>
<P>
   But Weaver never stopped managing games while waiting for his
deity to show. He sacrificed. He used the hit-and-run. He juggled
his lineup and used all 25 players on his bench. He did all this
because home runs were scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball now is on autopilot. The only managing left in baseball
is guessing which middle reliever is least likely to be taken yard,
and the number of pitchers who truly are masters of their craft a
Pedro Martinez or Greg Maddux would fit in an egg box.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-0 game the Dodgers and Mets played Monday was an anomaly,
and it had less to do with good pitching than it did being a makeup
game played on a Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for Mark McGwire to hit 70 in 1998 and have a
record four straight 50-plus seasons, but something else to scan
the totals of players with much smaller biceps. Members of the
20-homer club of 1999 include Rich Aurilia, David Bell, Brian
Daubach, Damian Easley, Rusty Greer, Butch Huskey, Ruben Rivera,
Lee Stevens and Miguel Tejada.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have already hit an NL-record 44 home runs in
April, with McGwire idle much of the month with a bad back. Among
the league home run leaders, you will find Shane Andrews, Geoff
Jenkins, Tony Batista, Jermaine Dye and Mike Sweeney. And there
have already been 14 walk-off, game-winning home runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was born in the '20s, when baseball cashiered the
dead ball and Babe Ruth moved from the Red Sox mound to right field
in Yankee Stadium. But even then, the home run was limited to the
few.
</P>
<P>
   In the American League between 1920 and 1939, there were 34
occasions when a player hit 35 homers or more in a season, but 25
of those seasons were accomplished by three men, Ruth, Lou Gehrig
and Jimmie Foxx.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four seasons (1996-99), there have been 77 30-plus
home run seasons in the National League, or more than the combined
total of any full decade in N.L. history. The previous decade high
was 66, in 1950-59.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials like commis sioner Bud Selig believe the
offen sive explosion has been good for baseball. Attendance in
1998, dur ing the McGwire-Sammy Sosa show, was a record 70,372,221.
But baseball was already enjoying an uptick in '90s. It drew a
record 70,256,459 fans in 1993, the year before the strike.
</P>
<P>
   More than one power trend is at work.
</P>
<P>
   __ Parks are smaller. Balls are flying out of two of the three
new parks for 2000, Houston's Enron and San Francisco's Pac Bell.
Last year, only 118 home runs were hit in the Houston Astrodome;
Enron figures to pass that total by the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, Cleveland, Texas, To ronto, Atlanta and Colorado all
introduced new, homer-cozy parks in the '90s, and renovations in
Anaheim, Oakland and San Diego also increased scoring. More proof:
Boston's Fenway Park, long consid ered a haven for right-handed
power hitters, yielded an A.L.-low 152 home runs last season.
</P>
<P>
   __ The strike zone has shrunk. The high strike has been dead for
a long time and umpires have been told to stop expanding the plate
to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   Bats are lighter and players are stronger. Some bats are so
light they seem to be made out of balsa wood. Heavy lifting is of
no use to pitchers but a boon to hitters, as are muscle-making
supplements. Baseball's new formula: Mass + Bat Speed  &QC;  Dinger.
</P>
<P>
   __ Pitching is thin. Two new expansion teams created 24 new jobs
when pitching was already undernourished. Scouting puts all of its
emphasis on the radar gun, too, forgetting that a 90 mph fastball
is of no use if it's flat and straight.
</P>
<P>
   __ The ball is juiced. It has been for some time now, but
hitters and pitchers already have detected dif ferences in the 2000
baseball. The seams are lower and ESPN com mentator Harold Reynolds
says the new blue baseball logo on the ball allows hitters to pick
up rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wanting to chart the rise of the home run only has to go
back to 1968. That season, Denny McLain won 31 games, Bob Gibson
posted a 1.12 earned run average, the major-league average was
.237, and Carl Yastrzemski won the A.L. batting crown at .301. The
next season, the height of the pitching mound was lowered from 15
inches to 10 inches. Four years later, the A.L. adopted the DH.
</P>
<P>
   More than one old-timer has suggested baseball should go retro
and raise the mound a few inches and can the DH. But who can hear
them above the din? Because what the '90s and '00s offer that can't
be changed is the sports media cul ture.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 5,528 home runs hit last year, I'd guess 5,000 of them
were replayed on videotape by ESPN, Fox Sports or your local TV
station. Just as today's 14-year-old basketball player tries to
drive the lane like Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant, today's young
baseball player wants to go deep.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's enough for some fans. But it would be nice if there
was room for the well-pitched game, for a team nursing a run via
bunts and stolen bases, for all of the good things that can happen
when the ball doesn't leave the park.

IN PROTEST, CUBAN-AMERICAN PLAYERS SIT OUT TUESDAY GAMES

<P>
   The growing presence of Cubans in the major leagues took a
political turn on Tuesday when more than a dozen players and
coaches missed games in support for the one-day work stoppage by
Cuban-Americans in the Miami area over the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, where the Florida Marlins played San Francisco on
Tuesday night, 10 members of the Marlins, including six players, as
well as two Giants players and a coach, did not dress for the game
at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose the spiritual well-being of our employees ahead of
tonight's game,'' Marlins Manager John Boles said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more prominent Cuban-born players, Jose Canseco,
elected not to play in Tampa Bay's game against the Royals on
Tuesday night in Kansas City, Mo. Canseco was originally scheduled
to start as the designated hitter for the Devil Rays, batting
fourth. But about 30 minutes before the game, it was announced that
he had been replaced by Bubba Trammell.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the boycott seeped into New York as well. At Shea
Stadium, where the Mets played the Cincinnati Reds, Mets shortstop
Rey Ordonez and the third-base coach Cookie Rojas were given the
day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tend not to want baseball to be a political forum,''
General Manager Steve Phillips said, ``but I understand both Rey's
and Cookie's position on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez, who was not scheduled to pitch on Tuesday
night and who defected from Cuba three years ago, met with Manager
Joe Torre at Yankee Stadium about three hours before Tuesday
night's game with Minnesota and asked for permission to remain out
of uniform and not sit in the dugout. Torre consulted with General
Manager Brian Cashman, Cashman spoke to Hernandez and the Yankees
obliged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're honoring him following his conscience,'' said Cashman,
who said that Hernandez would be paid because he was not refusing
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Marlins players given the day off with pay was third
baseman Mike Lowell, who has a team-leading 19 runs batted and is
batting .300. Lowell has a Cuban-born mother and a father of German
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Other Marlins players absent were pitchers Alex Fernandez (who
dedicated his 3-1 victory over Philadelphia on Monday to Elian),
Vladimir Nunez, Jesus Sanchez and Antonio Alfonseca, and outfielder
Danny Bautista.
</P>
<P>
   Nonplayers sitting out were the infield coach Tony Taylor, the
first-base coach Fredi Gonzalez, the bullpen coach Luis Perez, and
Tony Perez, the special assistant to Marlins President Dave
Dombrowski.
</P>
<P>
   All are of Cuban descent except for Sanchez, Alfonseca and
Bautista, who are Dominican. None of the pitchers was scheduled to
participate on Tuesday night, including the closer Alfonseca, who
had worked three games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants, pitcher Livan Hernandez, catcher Bobby Estalella
and Carlos Alfonzo, a coach, sat out the game. San Francisco
Manager Dusty Baker said once he heard of the passionate feelings
of Miami's Cuban-American community on the issue, he recommended to
the two players and the coach not to go to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on the coast, we're not really abreast of the racial
tension that's here as much as people who live here,'' Baker said.
``We don't live here, but these guys have to come back here and
live and their families are here and you don't know what kind of
repercussions would have happened if they had played. We decided it
was in the interest for them not to come.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked later whether this represented a capitulation on the
Giants' part, Baker said he did not force anybody to sit out the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just thought it would be wise to follow suit with the
Marlins,'' he said. ``The Marlins are here. We're leaving in two
days not to come back until next year or the playoffs. You've got a
potential situation that will last who knows how long a period of
time? Since we're fortunate or not fortunate enough to be here,
we've got to do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Boles said the Marlins, who have been in Miami since 1993,
talked about the issue at length.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what people have to keep in mind is that we're not
making a value judgment here,'' he said. ``We're being sensitive to
our employees. I don't know if it's setting a precedent. We're not
setting world-wide policy here. We just did it for our employees.
This is a humanity issue, not an athletic issue.''
</P>
<P>
   No signs of protest were evident among the modest turnout of
9,072.

LITTLE HAVANA HEEDS CALL FOR ONE DAY WORK-STOPPAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs top of story for updating, rewriting) (With CUBAN-BOY-RDP) 
 By JUAN FORERO

<P>
   MIAMI _ Little Havana's shops, restaurants, cafes and markets
were shuttered on Tuesday as thousands of Cuban-Americans
infuriated by the federal removal of Elian Gonzalez heeded a call
by exile leaders for a one-day work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of Miami-Dade County workers, 2,580 people, and
10 percent of nonessential City of Miami workers, another 260
people, used their personal days to stay home. About 3,900 of
20,000 public school teachers stayed home, as did 115,000 students,
nearly a third of enrollment. Schools remained open. Essential
services continued to be provided, government officials said,
noting that buses and Metro Rail operated and the Port of Miami and
area airports were open. The stoppage affected Little Havana most;
in much of the city it was business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear from the deserted streets in Little Havana _
and from the eased traffic flow on normally congested highways _
that untold numbers of people in the 800,000-strong Cuban exile
community had not gone to work. Many businesses in the
neighborhood, from Versailles restaurant to Sedano's Supermarkets
to L.P. Evans used car lot, were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Ten members of the Florida Marlins baseball team, including six
players, sat out the evening home game with the San Francisco
Giants. About a half-dozen other major league players and coaches
skipped evening games as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Dade County Commission called off Tuesday's meeting
because 6 of 13 commissioners said they would not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents took to the streets, waving Cuban flags on
corners or driving in honking caravans that grew late into the
evening in Hialeah and Westchester, two neighborhoods west of
Miami. At the Freedom Tower, a former Customs house in downtown
Miami where many Cubans entered the United States, about 130
protesters chanted ``Libertad!'' as basketball fans arrived for a
Miami Heat basketball game at the American Airlines Arena. And in
Miami Beach, hundreds of Cuban-Americans silently walked to the
Holocaust Museum in a quiet show of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a large segment of this community that is indignant
right now,'' said Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, who went to
work. ``They're offended by what happened in Miami on Saturday.
Their reaction has been a very peaceful reaction. Some people may
not like what's happened today, but it's peaceful, it's calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the tranquility of Little Havana on Tuesday stood in
stark contrast to the protests of Saturday, when hundreds of
Cuban-Americans, most of them young men, burned tires and taunted
police after the federal government forcibly removed 6-year-old
Elian from the home where he had been staying.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Saturday's unrest, Cuban exile leaders from
various organizations urged businesses to close and workers to stay
home. Talk of the stoppage dominated radio airwaves, and some exile
groups even sent vans, outfitted with megaphones, through the Cuban
enclave on Monday to remind people about the strike. The idea, said
many, was to leave Miami ``a dead city'' and send a message of
outrage to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Little Havana, however, the effects were not as
visible. Although business closings were reported throughout the
region, stores in downtown Miami bustled with shoppers, and the
restaurants and clubs of Miami Beach were crowded with tourists.
Some non-Cubans expressed annoyance with the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is stupid,'' said Aaron Evans, 27, a parking
attendant in downtown Miami. ``The city isn't shut down at all.
Everybody's at work. It's just like every other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Watts, 30, a manager at a telecommunications company
downtown, saw the bright side. ``Traffic is better, finding parking
spots is easier,'' he said. ``The only thing that I noticed was
closed today was a McDonald's. I was upset because I did want a
biscuit for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This probably wasn't the most effective way of
sending a message to the city and the government, because life has
just carried on.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Cubans, however, viewed the day as a solemn one and saw a
work stoppage as the community's duty. ``This work stoppage today
might not be that successful, but it sends a message; it is
symbolism,'' said Maria Gonzalez, 32, a beauty salon worker who
spent part of her day waving a Cuban flag on a Little Havana
corner. ``We needed to do this because we lost a member of our
community unfairly. It's about mourning. It's more a day of
mourning than a day of protest.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Castro, a sociologist at the University of Miami who studies
the Cuban-American community, said he thought ``a very significant
percentage'' of Cuban-Americans took part. He said the work
stoppage was a positive way for the community to show its anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there's not a corrosive aspect to it, as long as
people who choose not to observe it are not intimidated,'' said
Castro, a senior researcher at the university's North-South Center,
``then it seems like a good way to channel the anger and rage that
many Cubans have had since Elian was taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Osmel Lugo, 29, a construction worker who left Cuba last year,
was among those who said he was glad to take part. Lugo's employer,
an exile-owned construction company, closed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people needed, they wanted, to be part of the stoppage,''
Lugo said. ``The people were pleased to have the chance. They were
worried that companies would not let them off, but that hasn't been
the case. People were allowed to take off.''

<P>
   Thousand Oaks, Calif. _ The U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust
Division is investigating the online realty industry for possible
anti-competitive practices and has requested information from
Homestore.com Inc., officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same government entity that is prosecuting Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Thousand Oaks-based home portal has complied with the
request for information about its business practices and the
dynamics of the industry, Chief Financial Officer John Giesecke
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government sought basic information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe we've done anything that would violate any
law or regulation,'' Giesecke said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not been told about the specific focus of the
investigation, nor does it know whether other companies have been
asked for similar information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Jennifer Rose confirmed that the
government is investigating the industry and declined further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Giesecke said that Homestore.com's partner, the National
Association of Realtors, was also asked for information.
</P>
<P>
   Homestore.com has built a group of 11 related Internet sites -
organized as categories under the Homestore.com portal - that offer
information and services related to real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The company's business strategy has been to cover the full range
of home and real estate-related offerings: new and existing home
sales, apartment rentals, home improvement, home financing and
information about moving.
</P>
<P>
   It has formed partnerships with the National Association of
Realtors; General Motors Acceptance Corp.; HomePortfolio.com, a
home design Web site; Sundial.com, a wireless products seller; and
Champion Enterprises, the nation's largest home builder.
</P>
<P>
   Giesecke said Homestore.com has relationships with most of the
nation's 800 multiple listing services, and provides access to 95
percent of the listed homes in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   An undisclosed percentage of those homes are available through
exclusive agreements with the listing services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Homestore.com has some agreements that make it the only
national Internet service with access to home listings, its
business practices are not harmful to the consumer, Giesecke said.
</P>
<P>
   Homestore.com's competitors include some of the largest names in
the Internet and real estate, among them Microsoft, Yahoo! and
Cendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard-pressed for anybody to declare we have a
monopoly,'' Giesecke said. ``Having exclusive contracts (is) not
against the law. We're not restricting access, we're not tracking
for data, we're not harming the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders in the Internet economy - including Yahoo!, eBay
and advertising clearinghouse Doubleclick - also have been asked by
the Justice Department to provide information.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're certainly getting very interested in what's happening
on the Internet, and it's just very difficult to tell how long it
will take for these things to run their course,'' Giesecke said.
``Our strategy is to cooperate fully and completely and be as
helpful as we can.''

WESTPHAL HAS FINGERS ON ALL THE WRONG BUTTONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ To be honest, there has been an air of smugness in
Paul Westphal's voice these past few months, every time he talks
about how the Sonics have exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Quick to point out that some prognosticators did not pick the
Sonics to make the playoffs, Westphal has had the ammunition, or so
it seemed, to shoot down the naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   (begin italic)
</P>
<P>
   We made the playoffs. We did better than people said we would.
End of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   (end italic)
</P>
<P>
   Granted, defensiveness or paranoia are nothing new to NBA
coaches. But what if that sort of attitude does not end with
Westphal's interactions with the media?
</P>
<P>
   These days, down 0-2 in the playoffs against a Jazz team that is
picking apart Westphal's completely inept team, the Sonics are in a
torpor.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Sonics goes deeper than Vin Baker failing
to live up to his All-Star days. It has been extremely convenient
to paint the power forward's disastrous free fall as the main
reason why the Sonics have no identity, no energy, no cohesion, no
hope.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Sonics may even go back to owner Barry
Ackerley's unwillingness to pay for Phil Jackson to come in and
take charge.
</P>
<P>
   It might even be a little bit about general manager Wally
Walker's decision last summer to not forfeit winning in exchange
for tearing up this team and starting over, younger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of signing Baker to a seven-year, $87 million contract
last August, instead of trading away a first-round draft pick for
warhorse Horace Grant, instead of signing Vernon Maxwell to a
three-year deal, the Sonics could have started over.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been a tough decision, a bold one, but looking
around, some NBA teams realize they have to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Or, another scenario: The Sonics' problems might be about how
Walker chose Westphal over Paul Silas, who was hired by Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Silas is not only winning in the playoffs, he got a
not-so-terribly talented team to work hard, win and, most
important, overcome a terrible midseason tragedy in the death of
guard Bobby Phills.
</P>
<P>
   Silas, whose Hornets ended the regular-season on a seven-game
win streak, was named the NBA's top coach for April. His players
are listening, working.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no going back at this point. Silas has done his job
coaxing good games out of Derrick Coleman, a near-miracle
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, here in Seattle, Baker is signed through the 2006
season. Someone has to resurrect him.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton is the biggest asset the Sonics have. But at age 31,
he is too old to wait for a major rebuilding in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If you were Ackerley, whose ownership of the Sonics is as much
about the bottom-line value of the franchise as it is about
winning, would you consider trading your biggest commodity?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, whenever this first-round series against the Jazz
is over, Payton will once again ask for a meeting with the Sonics'
owner and make his point that something must be done.
</P>
<P>
   And that something will go like this: (begin italic) Either
Westphal goes or trade me. Sacramento. L.A. Portland. Somewhere
with a prayer. (end italic).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his previous post-season blow-ups, this time Payton will
have good reason to make such a demand. And this time, he might
have more than his own interests in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's body language on the bench in the fourth quarter of
Game 2 Monday told the whole, sorry story. He was stewing. He was
defeated _ a rare sight.
</P>
<P>
   But Payton is not the first one _ nor is he the only one _ to
wonder what Westphal is doing. From Brent Barry to Ruben Patterson
to Greg Foster to Horace Grant to Vernon Maxwell, questions are
rampant. However, it will be Payton's query that starts to shake
this thing out.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for Westphal to have failed to establish
rotation and substitution patterns for his players.
</P>
<P>
   And it is one thing to have created a free-for-all system that
makes every Sonics player believe he is a starter.
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing to try and let the Sonics ``just roll the ball
out there and play hard,'' as a hands-off Westphal did in the first
half of the season. Later, though, when that no longer worked,
Westphal seemed exposed for not having technical defensive schemes
to use against better opponents.
</P>
<P>
   All those things are big. But the final straw has to be when,
out of the blue, he takes the ball out of Payton's hands at the
start of the playoffs and turns him into a pick-setting,
screen-running shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime of Monday's 101-87 disaster in Salt Lake, Payton was
so incensed, he demanded to know from Westphal why Patterson hadn't
played a minute and why he (Payton) had been relegated to setting
picks and running off screens.
</P>
<P>
   This is Gary Payton, after all. Not Jeff Hornacek.
</P>
<P>
   Payton is not alone, however, in his disgust over Westphal's
decisions and seeming inability to communicate effectively with his
players.
</P>
<P>
   Top to bottom, Westphal has lost the respect of his players, and
we haven't even addressed the suspicion Sonics players have about
why Maxwell isn't on the playoff roster.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, however, that once a player fails to meet Westphal's
expectation or crosses him or, worse, openly challenges him,
Westphal exerts ``my way or the highway'' sort of control.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it is nothing new for coaches to battle with players, to
have run-ins and disagreements. But the good ones find a way to not
lose the confidence or kill the fire in their players.
</P>
<P>
   It's called knowing how to push the right buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Judging how the Sonics have careened to the end of this season,
the only buttons Westphal seems to have pushed are the wrong ones.

SPARKS CHOOSE NEBRASKA GUARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After a last-ditch effort to trade for Cleveland's
No. 1 pick fell through, the Los Angeles Sparks waited patiently
for the next-best option in the WNBA draft on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They started small and got bigger.
</P>
<P>
   With the No. 15 pick, the Sparks selected Nebraska guard Nicole
Kubick, who they hope will fill the gap left behind by Gordana
Grubin, who was lost in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks then went for size, picking 6-foot-4 center Paige
Sauer from the University of Connecticut and 6-4 center Marte
Alexander, a 1998 graduate of Arizona who played in Italy the past
two seasons. They wrapped up the day by selecting former USC guard
Nicky McCrimmon, who played briefly for the former Long Beach
StingRays of the defunct American Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks coach Michael Cooper was satisfied with the selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a happy day for the Sparks organization,'' Cooper
said. ``As you know, we lost two great players . . . in Gordana
Grubin and Nina Bjedov last year in the expansion draft, but I felt
we kept the core of our team. But I think today we (rejuvenated)
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks general manager Penny Toler, who retired as a Sparks
player last year, said the team's needs were addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The huge difference from the past and this year is we had a
high draft pick (before),'' Toler said. ``This year we're picking
15th. We're so excited about getting Kubick and Paige Sauer. We
didn't want to duplicate what we have. We have slashers. It's the
role players that are going to make a difference in the big game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's initial plan was to start drafting big to get some
reserve help for centers Lisa Leslie and DeLisha Milton, and then
work his way down. But when Cleveland held onto its pick and
selected Ann Wauters, a 20-year-old 6-4 center from Belgium, as the
first choice in the WNBA's fourth draft, Cooper had to change his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered Cleveland a trade and they turned us down,'' Cooper
said. He declined to name the two players he offered to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper feels Kubick is the answer to the team's vacancy at the
point-guard position, which was created after Indiana selected
Grubin as the top pick in the expansion draft. At 5-9, Kubick can
make the switch between the point and shooting guard. She averaged
14.6 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really mind where I went, I just wanted to get
drafted,'' said Kubick, who was born and raised in Cambridge, Neb.
``It's going to be a little bit of an adjustment for me coming from
a small town in Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, UCLA 6-2 center Maylana Martin was chosen in the
first round at the 10th spot by Minnesota, and 6-4 USC center
Adrian Williams was the 21st pick by Phoenix, which is coached by
former Trojan Cheryl Miller.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a name change that goes far beyond just a
name.
</P>
<P>
   Today marks the first celebration of Administrative
Professionals Day, an annual event that until this year bore the
moniker Professional Secretaries Day.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the name change by the International Association
of Administrative Professionals - the event's nonprofit sponsor -
reflects the shifting nature of work performed by secretaries and
other office professionals.
</P>
<P>
   And for many of the people whose contributions are being
acknowledged, the new name is a belated recognition of changing
times in general.
</P>
<P>
   Even traditional secretaries agree that today's commemoration,
changed name and all, is still an important reminder of their role
in keeping business moving.
</P>
<P>
   The recognition is needed for a simple reason, said Carol
Fernandez, a secretary in the admitting department of Providence
Holy Cross Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offices would cease to function without us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoko Senga, an administrative assistant at NetZero Inc.,
said the very word ``secretary'' evokes images and stereotypes that
run counter to what she and thousands of other workers do in the
modern work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear the word `secretary' I think of the '50s and women
with crisp, ironed dresses answering phones and typing on a
typewriter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Senga said her current title better captures the range of her
work and responsibilities, including completing independent
projects and acting as chief liaison to NetZero's chief marketing
officer.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps more importantly, she said the term
``administrative assistant'' doesn't carry the stigma of being a
job that only a woman would have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's androgynous. It doesn't mean `woman' to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The job has also shifted for traditional secretaries, according
to Rick Stroud, a spokesman for the IAAP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretaries have realized for 25 years now that the days of
just being a typist are over,'' Stroud said. ``What this profession
has really evolved to be is an information manager for the
information age.''
</P>
<P>
   That evolution mirrored technological changes, including the
advent of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from typewriters to computers eliminated the need
for some skills, emphasized more active work and helped secretaries
branch off into other areas, said Samuel Culbert, a professor of
management at UCLA's Anderson School and author of ``Kill the
Bosses,'' a book due to be released next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the computer, the whole nature of the job changed,''
Culbert said. ``It took a different kind of human being to work a
computer. The person had to start thinking a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Doreen Wilson, an administrative assistant to the vice president
of sales for Los Angeles-based Princess Cruises, has seen that
change firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   After a major reorganization at her company, Wilson said, her
responsibilities expanded greatly. She said she often has to learn
complex computer programs just to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because everything is changing so quickly, sometimes you don't
have time for the classes, so you have to be self-taught,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much information that's coming in,'' she said.
``It's important for us to filter out that information and pass it
on to our bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's boss, John Molinaro, said his assistant's role is now
key to the running of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my right arm - and my left arm,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES _ It's a name change that goes far beyond just a
name.
</P>
<P>
   Today marks the first celebration of Administrative
Professionals Day, an annual event that until this year bore the
moniker Professional Secretaries Day.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the name change by the International Association
of Administrative Professionals - the event's nonprofit sponsor -
reflects the shifting nature of work performed by secretaries and
other office professionals.
</P>
<P>
   And for many of the people whose contributions are being
acknowledged, the new name is a belated recognition of changing

RESEARCH WILL STUDY LAUGHTER'S EFFECT ON HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Their last names are the first names in comedy -
Marx, Costello, Fields - and on Tuesday, the children and
grandchildren of comic legends took part in a singular tribute.
</P>
<P>
   A half dozen celebrity children, themselves now in middle age,
and the writers who made ``I Love Lucy'' a comedy classic toured
the Mattel Children's Hospital at UCLA where a study of the
therapeutic effects of laughter on healthy and ill children will
begin next month.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers there will show Abbott and Costello and Marx
Brothers movies as well as famous television comedies to children
whose parents might not have been born at the zenith of such films.
Chris Costello, daughter of Lou Costello, believes, though, that
time will be no barrier to the Simpsons and South Park generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's timeless. It's universal,'' said Costello, a Burbank
resident who still gets mail from young viewers of her father's
slapstick comedies. After seeing colorized versions of his movies,
some adolescents have concluded he is still alive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year project, Rx Laughter, is aided by a $75,000 grant
from Comedy Central, the cable television network. It will be the
first to specifically study cardiac and immune system responses of
children exposed to comedy. The study begins next month when
healthy schoolchildren at Seeds University Elementary School,
located on the UCLA campus, will help determine what still works
comedically and what doesn't by watching classic film and TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   About eight months later, researchers Lonnie Zeltzer and
Margaret Stuber will show comedy videos to ill children. If
researchers find a therapeutic value, cartoons, TV shows and films
could be used in the care of ill children during frightening
treatments like blood draws and chemotherapy to help ease stress,
fear and promote faster healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really creating models that can diffuse out of UCLA to
other children's hospitals that can be used around the country,''
said Dr. Edward McCabe, physician-in-chief of Mattel Children's
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Costello and Bill Marx, son of Harpo Marx, and Melissa Talmadge
Cox, granddaughter of Buster Keaton, are members of an advisory
board to the project. The researchers showed them the sites at the
UCLA Medical Center where their parents' videos will be shown.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative slate of videos stresses comedies with physical
humor to which children can relate. It doesn't yet include any of
Comedy Central's current offerings. The network's line-up includes
the news spoof ``The Daily Show'' and ``Kids in the Hall'' as well
as ``South Park.'' Chris Costello said some newer comedies are
riskier when it comes to showing them to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern-day comedy, you really have to be careful. A lot of it
is good but a lot of it is off-color,'' Costello said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the network couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Carroll Jr. said he has no doubt that ``I Love Lucy''
will have benefits. If his name might ring a bell to viewers of the
1950s' show, it's because he was one of its writers. He accompanied
fellow ``Lucy'' writer Madelyn Pugh Davis on Tuesday's tour.
Through generations of reruns, Carroll, a fan of the sitcoms
``Becker'' and ``Frasier,'' said he still hears from fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helped (people) get through the day. If you're laughing,
you won't cry so much,'' the 81-year-old Laurel Canyon resident
said.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Los Angeles Dodgers aren't happy with a pair of
trips east to start the season, nor are they pleased about playing
16 of their first 21 games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's what the organization asked for when Major League
Baseball was setting up the 2000 schedule. The Dodgers wanted the
extra time in case the $50 million renovation project ran behind
schedule, so upper management requested it.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano said it was a
one-time deal, and the club has already told baseball officials
they'd prefer to open at home next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We requested to be on the road, and it's the only time we
requested to do that,'' Graziano said. ``You put in your
preferences for next season. (Baseball) will ask what our
preferences are, and we put in we would prefer to open at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The topic of the Dodgers' schedule became hot when the club had
to travel to New York to make up an April 9 snowout. Instead of h
off Monday in Atlanta, the Dodgers traveled from Cincinnati to New
York for an afternoon game, then hopped on a plane to Atlanta to
open the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fairness to the Mets and fairness to Major League Baseball
_ and we did it with the Houston Astros _ you try to pick the
soonest possible date (to play a makeup),'' Graziano said. ``We
don't go to New York anymore, so we had to find the next available
date.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot spot of the early-season travel was Monday's trip to
play the Mets. Those things happen, but the Dodgers began the
season with a 12-game road trip to Montreal, New York and San
Francisco, preceded by two exhibition games in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't get much better in the coming weeks. The Dodgers
return home after the three-game series with the Braves for a
nine-game homestand but then embark on a four-city, 12-game road
trip to Arizona, St. Louis, Chicago and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When it's all done, the Dodgers will have played 28 of their
first 42 games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   __ Off his Mark: Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek had a four-hit
game in Cincinnati, but he's far from feeling good at the plate. He
went 0 for 4 against the Braves and his average dipped to .207.
</P>
<P>
   It's a slump that has existed since the first weekend of the
season. He began with six hits in 16 at-bats, only to go 11 for 66
(.167) since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my selection of pitches is good right now,''
said Grudzielanek, who called it the worst slump of his career.
``I'm putting myself in bad situations. It seems like I'm always
behind in the count and trying to keep battling. I have to stay
positive and try not to hit any walls.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Right-hander Chan Ho Park tested the blister
on the middle finger of his right hand with a bullpen session and
said he would make his start Thursday. . . . Pitcher Jeff Williams
was sent down before the game, leaving the Dodgers without a
left-handed reliever. . . . Angel Pena, considered the catcher of
the future, was placed on the disabled list at Triple-A Albuquerque
with soreness in his lower back. . . . Atlanta's Reggie Sanders
went 0 for 3 to extend his hitless streak to 27 at-bats.

DOCTOR GETS 5 YEARS' PROBATION FOR CARVING HIS INITIALS INTO
PATIENT'S BELLY
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the blessing of his victim, a Manhattan
obstetrician was granted a plea bargain on Tuesday that sentences
him to five years' probation for carving his initials into the
belly of one of his patients after delivering her child. The
doctor, Allan Zarkin, 62, will not go to jail, but will be barred
from applying for a medical license for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Dr. Liana Gedz, the victim, called the
agreement a just end to a tragic case. Gedz, 31, a dentist who was
close to Zarkin before the incident, has said she did not want him
to go to prison and opposed his criminal prosecution. In February,
Gedz settled a lawsuit she had filed against Zarkin for $1.75
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right result,'' said the lawyer, Robert Sullivan.
``She has a healthy, beautiful baby, and she does not want to
envision the doctor going to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   After successfully performing a Caesarean section on Gedz at
Beth Israel Medical Center in September, Zarkin stunned nurses by
carving his initials into Gedz's belly. He was indicted in February
and faced up to 25 years in prison if convicted of the most serious
charge he faced, first-degree assault.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and the judge in the case, Justice Renee White of
State Supreme Court in Manhattan, cited Gedz's desires and Zarkin's
lack of a criminal record as reasons for agreeing to the plea
bargain. The prosecutor, Martha Bashford, an assistant district
attorney in Manhattan, said that an investigation of other
complaints against the doctor uncovered numerous examples of
``inappropriate behavior and comments,'' but none that rose to the
level of criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Immaculately dressed in a cashmere turtleneck, Ferragamo loafers
and a brown suit, the silver-haired obstetrician calmly pleaded
guilty to second-degree assault in a crowded courtroom in the
Manhattan Criminal Courts Building on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by White what he had done, Zarkin responded in a
steady, almost soothing tone, ``Using the scalpel, I scratched my
initials into her.''
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea brought an end to a bizarre incident that
resulted in one of the harshest rebukes of a local hospital in
years. In February, the State Department of Health fined Beth
Israel $14,000 and ordered it to improve its oversight of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department officials said Beth Israel failed to file
proper reports with the state after the carving incident, and did
not sufficiently monitor Zarkin, despite earlier complaints by
hospital workers that his behavior had been erratic. The
department, which is responsible for licensing doctors, did not
suspend Zarkin's license until January. His license was revoked in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department officials also temporarily closed all
operating rooms at a Queens clinic, Choices Women's Medical Center,
where Zarkin worked as medical director after the incident. In
February, the state fined the clinic $20,000 for performing hasty
abortions, lacking proper equipment and infection control, not
having enough nurses and improperly screening and monitoring
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The state also cited the clinic for not thoroughly checking
Zarkin's credentials and for allowing him to perform surgery
unsupervised even though a psychiatrist had told clinic officials
that Zarkin had a brain disorder. The state is investigating a new
complaint filed against the clinic after it reopened in late
February.
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin declined to speak with reporters after his guilty plea on
Tuesday. One of his lawyers, Barry Fallick, blamed Pick's disease,
an Alzheimer's-like illness, for the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe his physical and mental disorders caused this,''
Fallick said. ``We are not aware of the other incidents the
prosecutor talked about.'' He said Zarkin never intends to practice
medicine again.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors declined to discuss the details of the other
allegations but said they largely involved improper comments and
behavior, not deficient treatment. They said they did not agree
with the defense lawyers' contention that Zarkin is suffering from
Pick's disease or that an illness caused his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Gedz plans to undergo plastic surgery to obscure the carved
initials, her lawyer said. He said the incident should be viewed as
tragic, not malevolent. ``It's the right ending to a sad case,''
Sullivan said. ``One of the reasons it's sad is that he was a good
doctor, and he will never be able to practice again.''

AFTER 8TH KILLING OF A NEW YORK CABBY, MORE PROTECTION DEVICES
URGED
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 3rd graf for updating and rewriting) By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a livery cab driven by Jose R. Olivares veered
out of control and slammed into a building in the Bronx late
Monday, it contained all the elements of a string of crimes that
has confounded the police.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares was dying, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the right
side of his head. With him in the cab, a silver Lincoln Town Car
that had no bulletproof partition and no security camera, were four
teenagers who the police said had tried to rob him after he picked
them up on the street. He had let one of the passengers get in the
front seat beside him. A loaded .380 semiautomatic pistol that the
authorities said was used to kill him was found tucked behind
Olivares' back.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares, 37, was the eighth livery cabby to be slain this year,
the latest in series of crimes that have mobilized the Police
Department and drawn condemnation from community leaders and city
officials. The four teen-agers were charged in the killing on
Tuesday night. But in the details surrounding Oliveares' death is
an illustration of just how hard these crimes are for the police to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Police Department has deployed hundreds of
officers each night on cabby-protection assignments, the officers
remain frustrated enough that Police Commissioner Howard Safir
faced a bank of television cameras on Tuesday and appealed to the
drivers to take steps to protect themselves. ``If you don't have a
partition, please do not pick up hails because you put yourself in
great danger,'' Safir said. ``And certainly do not let anybody in
the front seat of your automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the authorities said Tuesday, Olivares' death shows
that no single response can protect the cabbies from those who
stalk them.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the police have increased the number of decoy
cabs and have begun using the Street Crime Units to make random
stops of livery cabs, in the hopes of deterring the killers. But
the authorities said Tuesday that two elements were still needed to
complement their efforts: more safety equipment in the cabs, and
changes in cabby behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Olivares, the authorities said, underscored the
importance of both.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike yellow medallion cabs, livery cabs are prohibited by city
regulations from picking up passengers on the street, and police
data show that more than 80 percent of the robberies this year and
six of the eight killings occurred after drivers broke the rules.
And yet, in addition to picking up passengers assigned by
dispatchers, as they are allowed, drivers like Olivares have
continued to stop for fares at the curb, even at night, and even as
the homicide tally has been rising.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission
passed a regulation last week requiring livery drivers to outfit
their cars with partitions or security cameras by the middle of
May, local glass shops are backlogged by as much as four weeks to
meet the sudden demand. Olivares had a bulletproof partition on
order, but even if it had been installed, it would not have
protected him from a passenger he had allowed to ride shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department's message, however, must contend with the
realities of transportation in poor neighborhoods and the economics
of the livery-cab industry, which all but assure that the drivers
will continue to defy the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drivers are serving under-served minority neighborhoods,''
said Fernando A. Mateo, president of the New York State Federation
of Taxi Drivers. ``They are minorities serving their own people
because yellow cabs won't go into these neighborhoods, and because
they need the money to put food on their families' tables. When
they see someone who wants a ride, they are going to pull over and
pick them up. It's going to continue happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Given these circumstances, and given the fact that the police
have already stepped up their efforts, Mateo and city officials are
holding out hope that the partitions, once installed in the roughly
46,000 livery cabs operating in the city, will slow the rate of
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Crime data suggest they might. In 1994, the Taxi and Limousine
Commission passed a regulation requiring the fleets of yellow
medallion cabs to install approved partitions in their vehicles.
Since then, the yellow-cab homicides have virtually stopped. There
were nine in 1993, none in 1994, and then one each year through
January 1997. Since then there have been none. Yellow cab robberies
have also plummeted, from 723 in 1994 to 181 last year.

BROWN AWES; BATS DON'T
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There were a few fleeting moments when Kevin Brown's
control was lacking, but there was no way to tell he missed the
past 16 days because of a broken right pinkie.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers' right-hander was superb in his return,
pitching seven innings. But for the second straight day, the
Dodgers hitters couldn't solve their opponent, this time Atlanta
lefty Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine pitched a three-hit complete game as the Braves beat the
Dodgers 1-0 in the first of a three-game series Tuesday at Turner
Field. Glavine's 19th career shutout was his first since blanking
Arizona Sept.19, 1998, and it pushed Atlanta's winning streak to
eight.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, the Dodgers and Brown were pleased that he didn't
have any overwhelming problem with his pinkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the next time will be a little sharper, a little
bit better,'' said Brown, who kept the pinkie off the bat when he
hit. ``You know (the finger) is there. Normally, you don't think
about your fingers. It's just there. I could tell. I know it's
there. I kind of sticks out and from your mind. But again, I was
able to do well with it, so maybe in five days it'll be that much
better. It made a lot of progress in the last five days.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome mirrored what the Dodgers did the day before in New
York, where they lost 1-0 to the Mets and had just three hits. It's
the first time the Dodgers lost back-to-back games 1-0 since June
29-30, 1937, against the Boston Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the second inning, I made a conscious effort to pitch
inside a little more and keep them honest in there, in hopes it
would open up the outside part of the plate for me a little bit,''
Glavine said. ``I think it did. I felt like in the middle part of
the game and the end of the game, my pitches away, they weren't
quite attacking them as much as they were earlier in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive ineptitude the past two games contrasts what the
Dodgers did at the start of the road trip. They battered Cincinnati
pitching for 36 runs in a three-game sweep. Now, the Dodgers have
been shut out in back-to-back games for the first time since San
Francisco did it to them July 13-14, 1996. The Dodgers are 3-5 in
one-run games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brownie was outstanding and I tried really to hook him after
five; he hadn't pitched in two weeks, but he said, `You don't have
to worry about me hitting. I'm fine. I'm fine,' '' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said.``I thought (Glavine) threw a lot of quality
pitches, and it hasn't been an easy travel start. But he's a heck
of a pitcher. It's not the first time he's done that, but that's a
heck of a job on Brownie's part.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time the Dodgers got a runner to second base was when
Shawn Green led off the seventh with a double. Gary Sheffield
struck out, Eric Karros singled to through the hole into left
field, Green holding at third. Adrian Beltre ended the inning by
grounding into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre had the other hit and was the only other baserunner when
he walked with two outs in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept hitting his spots,'' Sheffield said. ``He wasn't
making any mistakes over the plate, and when you hit the spots all
day it's tough to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' run came in the fifth when Quilvio Veras, who's 11
for 20 lifetime against Brown, singled to center with two outs to
score Walk Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   And while Brown had minor struggles during the night, including
a walk to Glavine, it was an outing that left many Dodgers in awe.
After all, Brown returned from two weeks of inactivity to throw to
bullpen sessions, then held one of the National League's top
lineups to one run on five hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really more than impressive,'' Sheffield said. ``For
a guy that goes down and really doesn't throw at all, and then to
throw a couple bullpens and then go in a game and shut down a
lineup like this in unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   With Brown out, the Dodgers (11-8) were 8-4. The talk when he
went down was the starting pitchers needed to pick up the slack,
and they did. Including a seven-run, 1-inning performance from Orel
Hershiser, the starters went 6-2 with a 3.88 ERA.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's a bloody shame. Mark Davids simply wanted
to donate some blood at his friendly neighborhood bloodletting
shop, Blood Centers of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But they sniffed and gave him the old ``fee-fi-fo-fum'' business
about the blood of an Englishman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently,'' Davids says, ``an unsuspecting American
neurosurgeon was fixing a British brain (good luck) and contracted
mad cow disease.''
</P>
<P>
   So as of April 15, by FDA rule, if your blood is British,
Americans are skittish.

   Six bucks for a brewski, $22 for a cognac. That could cause

 CIVIL UNIONS FOR GAYS, LESBIANS OKD BY HOUSE IN VERMONT  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ With both sides acutely aware that their vote
might forever change American society, the Vermont Legislature gave
final approval Tuesday to homosexual civil unions, conferring on
gays and lesbians every right of marriage short of the name itself.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Howard Dean promised to sign the legislation as early as
Thursday, making Vermont on July 1 the first state in the union to
extend the privileges, benefits and responsibilities of marriage to
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-to-68 vote in the packed state House chamber came after
nearly three hours of often raw debate that mirrored the bitter
chasm gay civil unions have opened in this rural state of quaint
hamlets and fierce independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was by far the most difficult bill I have ever seen in
the Legislature,'' Dean said afterward, as opponents wearing white
ribbons vowed retaliation and supporters wearing pink buttons
hugged in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was very little politics in these votes,'' said
Dean, a Democrat. ``I think people had to reach deep in their
hearts to do what they felt was right.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote _ both last week in the state Senate and Tuesday in its
lower house _ was divided largely along party lines in the
Democrat-dominated Legislature. But many of those who crossed party
lines insisted that either Vermont was taking a courageous step
toward universal civil rights or abandoning the will of its own
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad, dark day for the state of Vermont, and God help
us all,'' declared Democrat George Allard of the town of St.
Albans.
</P>
<P>
   The action followed a unanimous ruling by the Vermont Supreme
Court in December that the state's exclusion of homosexuals from
the state-conferred benefits of marriage _ including everything
from inheritance and probate rights to hospital visitation _
violated the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The court instructed the Legislature either to allow homosexuals
to marry or to grant them all the benefits of marriage under
another name. Two attempts were made in the state Senate to amend
the constitution to thwart the ruling, but both were soundly
defeated in committee.
</P>
<P>
   While polls have shown significant public opposition in Vermont
to gay civil unions, the state does not have a referendum system
like California that would allow voters to decide the question
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents predicted a voter backlash in November. ``I think it
stinks,'' said Steven Davis, a citizen who came to watch. ``The
voices of the people of Vermont haven't been listened to. I think
next November there are going to be some legislators who aren't
going to be there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the one significant change the state Senate made to the
original house bill was to move up the implementation date from
September to July, so as to put as more distance between the
expected flurry of publicity when the law takes effect and the
elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have said they'll not vote for me because of
this,'' Republican Marion Milne said after the vote, noting that an
opponent has already announced a challenge for her seat.
</P>
<P>
   Milne said the vote caused her great anguish. ``A lot of my
constituents and people I know and respect urged me to vote no,''
she said, but she voted yes ``because I listened with an open mind
and felt from everything I heard that this was the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear to what extent Vermont's action will affect
other states. The new law could be challenged as an inadequate
parallel system of ``separate but equal'' marriage rights that
continues to deny homosexuals the full stature of marriage, much
like segregated public education in the South for black Americans
that was found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has gone down the path of so-called separate but
equal before, and I think most of us agree that was a bad idea,''
said Evan Wolfson, director of the Marriage Project for the Lambda
Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``Likewise here, the right answer
is to treat gay people and nongay people equally, and that includes
the freedom to marry, rather than trying to set up two lines at the
clerk's office.''
</P>
<P>
   The two lesbian couples and one gay male couple who brought the
original lawsuit _ all of whom witnessed Tuesday's vote _ said they
did not yet know if they would take their case any further, but
preferred simply to celebrate the day as a great victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed at this process, and I'm so proud of this state,''
said Peter Harrigan, one of the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier with the results,'' added Bill Lippert,
the only openly gay Vermont legislator. The words civil union,
Lippert said, while short of marriage, ``carry a significance and
symbolism that is very appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's action ``has already reverberated nationally,''
Lippert said. ``Civil union creates a model that some other
jurisdictions can now look at to grant the dignity of a legal
relationship to gay and lesbian families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights lawyers said the most immediate question was whether
or how other states will acknowledge Vermont's civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely unprecedented,'' said Jennifer Levi, a staff
attorney with the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, or GLAD,
which served as co-counsel in the Vermont case. ``There are a lot
of open questions that nobody knows the answers to at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay lawyers agreed, however, that because Vermont's civil union
is not marriage, it will provide no basis to challenge the federal
Defense of Marriage Act, signed by President Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That law restricts all federal benefits and rights conferred by
marriage _ including immigration status and Social Security
benefits _ to unions between a man and a woman. The same holds for
the 30 similar state laws, including California's recently enacted
Proposition 22, or Knight Initiative, that voters approved in
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go into court and say your marriage is being
discriminated against until you have one, and as of today, in all
50 states, gay people are denied the freedom to marry,'' Wolfson
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolfson made clear that any effort by other states to deny
Vermont civil unions is likely to invite a challenge. ``The
question of how Vermont families who undertake the legal commitment
of civil union will be treated as they travel or as they deal with
the federal government remains to be seen,'' Wolfson said.
``Certainly they will have a need for protection, much as other
couples, and they should not be forced to play, `Now you're
recognized, now you're not,' depending on which border they've
crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Marriage Is the Goal
</P>
<P>
   For many, marriage remains the ultimate goal. ``Any individual
with self-respect and self-esteem is not going to stop until they
have achieved full and equal status in society, and that includes
equal marriage rights,'' said David Smith, spokesman for the Human
Rights Campaign, a national gay lobby.
</P>
<P>
   But civil union already goes way too far for many Vermonters. A
small group gathered on the statehouse steps Tuesday morning,
praying that members who committed to vote yes would change their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remove from him his desire to be compassionate by believing
that which is in fact not true,'' the group prayed. ``Prevent this
unrighteousness from coming into Vermont.''
</P>
<P>
   Several legislators who spoke in opposition to civil unions
Tuesday compared homosexuality to alcoholism and called it a
``perversion'' that is ``against the law of nature.'' The notion of
gay marriage corrupts the meaning of language, others said, to
where ``depravity is virtue'' and ``moral values are ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   The most heated opposition came from Assemblywoman Nancy
Sheltra, who charged that granting civil unions would condone
conduct that spreads AIDS and other diseases. Several legislators
walked out of the chamber when Sheltra began reading from a tract
vowing that homosexuals would foist sodomy on the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Little, a Republican who helped shepherd the civil union
bill to passage, told the assembly that it is ``clear the state is
divided, and it will take time to become less divided.''
Recriminations on both sides, he said, point to ``the power of this
issue and how deep it goes into our own personal experiences and
psyches.''

DEVIL IN DETAILS OF PLAN TO SWAP STATE, U.S. LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JEFF BARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   interior secretary bruce babbitt and Arizona Gov. Jane Hull are
privately considering a series of massive land swaps that could
mean hundreds of thousands of acres changing hands between Arizona
and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, which at times have been marked by intrigue,
reached a critical point this week. To protect open space from
urban sprawl, Babbitt said, he proposed redrawing state and federal
boundaries to preserve 79,000 acres of wild country around Lake
Pleasant and an additional 24,000 acres in the Silverbell Mountains
region near Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about a really rare opportunity to effect some large
and really important land exchanges which will protect the scenic
part of Arizona,'' Babbitt said in an interview. ``This is really
wild country north and west from Lake Pleasant. It's not land that
should ever be developed.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for assuming possession of the state trust land, the
federal government would allow Arizona to select land of roughly
the same value from among 900,000 U.S.-owned acres spread around
the state, from Safford to Wickenburg to Bullhead City.
</P>
<P>
   State land taken by the federal government would be protected
from development, while federal acreage absorbed into the state
land trust would be eligible, eventually, for sale to developers or
other private parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the deals are far from struck. Hull told The Republic on
Tuesday that the state is still analyzing the proposal and that
there is concern that it does not provide fair value for Arizona's
lands and likely will need to be modified. The state estimates the
value of the federal land offered in the swap at less than
one-tenth the value of the state land Babbitt wants to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very hesitant in going forth when you look at the
difference with these appraisals,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the negotiations have been marked by intrigue.
At one point, a Babbitt aide inadvertently left behind her private
notes after a meeting in Phoenix about the land talks. The two
pages were picked up by a state employee, copied and given by a
governor's aide to the news media because the notes seemed to
illustrate a point the Governor's Office was trying to make about
fair value. The incident raised the question of whether some
members of Hull's own staff wanted to scuttle the deal, a scenario
Hull denied Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheltering land from development in the Phoenix and Tucson areas
could be a significant part of Babbitt's legacy as secretary of
Interior. The former Arizona governor expects to step down in
January 2001 after two terms as President Clinton's chief land
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt made his proposal in a private meeting with the governor
on Monday in Phoenix. Hull told The Republic of her reservations
about the proposal Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The State Land Department believes the United States is offering
lands worth a total of only $66 million, compared with $700 million
for the state properties that would be swapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, obviously, have to protect the best interests of the state,
and (Babbitt) has been in my shoes, and I believe he would agree
that we both have to come out winners, and certainly the people of
Arizona have to come out winners,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt could be running out of time to put the finishing
touches on his legacy. The land swaps would need congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``These opportunities, when the stars are aligned by virtue of
public awareness and interest, and when the right balance of
bipartisan leadership exists in both Arizona and Washington, come
once in a lifetime,'' Babbitt told Hull in his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But the state has several times appeared to balk over the
proposed swaps. State negotiators, worried about getting
shortchanged, have variously asked Babbitt for more, including
water rights, an unspecified amount of cash, relief from their debt
from the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, and even the
land under the federal courthouse in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Under the courthouse scenario, the state would have leased the
building back to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, for various reasons, has not agreed to any of those
proposals by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that we will be able to agree on approximate equal
values for these land transfers, and we should not let the
difficulty in achieving that general balance deter us from the task
at hand,'' Babbitt told Hull in his written proposal, delivered
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt and his staff did make a significant concession,
dropping from his proposal a chunk of state lands known as
Empire-Cienega in Pima County. The state simply did not want to
trade those lands because of expectations of future appreciation,
and Babbitt dropped them from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the proposed swaps are a ``win-win'' because it
would not only conserve scenic land, it would allow the state to
unload about 78,000 acres of limited value because it is encircled
by federal land.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called state inholdings are located within the Grand
Canyon-Parashant National Monument, Lake Mead National Recreation
Area, national parks and other federal domains or Indian
reservations. Under Babbitt's proposal, those lands would be
exchanged for U.S. property ``more suitable for development or
other revenue generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another section of Babbitt's proposal would provide Arizona with
15,234 acres of federal land that the state was owed for various
reasons, some of it land that could not be delivered as promised
when Arizona joined the Union. The state would be able to
cherry-pick from the 900,000 acres of U.S. Bureau of Land
Management property made available for the other exchanges. &QL;

panel, Satcher rattled off statistics documenting the enormous toll
of alcohol abuse and said the wine industry's quest to add new
labels to their product would almost certainly exacerbate the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned (such labels) could wrongly lead consumers to
conclude that consumption of wine would reduce health risks,''
Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
   California winemakers, encouraged by studies showing a reduction
of heart disease from moderate alcohol consumption, have been
seeking permission for years to use a label that would extol the
health benefits of drinking as outlined in the federal government's
dietary guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   John De Luca, president of the San Francisco-based Wine
Institute, which represents more than 500 vintners, insists the
labels are not intended to promote wine sales but to educate
consumers and counter any mischaracterization of wine as a ``sin
industry or a gateway drug.''
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, the ATF approved the use of two labels that
encouraged consumers interested in learning about the ``health
effects of wine consumption'' to refer to the guidelines or consult
their family doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives heralded the development as nothing
less than a ``defining new chapter'' in the government's attitude
toward wine.
</P>
<P>
   The chapter did not last long.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to political pressure _ including threats by Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., to block appointments to the Treasury
Department, which oversees the ATF _ the bureau in October imposed
a moratorium on the new labels and scheduled a series of public
hearings on the matter. The 17 companies that received permission
during that period continue to use the labels, but no more have
been approved.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF will continue its hearings in San Francisco May 23 and
24.
</P>
<P>
   As the hearings began in Washington, the first speaker was
Thurmond, whose crusade against excessive drinking preceded a 1993
accident in which his 22-year-old daughter was killed by a drunken
driver. Five years earlier, Thurmond wrote legislation that
required health warnings on all alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond said Tuesday that the label proposed by the wine
industry is ``inherently misleading'' and testified that ``the
First Amendment cannot be used as a scapegoat to mislead the public
for a commercial gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers vigorously deny that they are trying to boost sales
with the labels, presenting their efforts as a well-meaning
campaign to promote the responsible use of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to sell wine as health food or medicine,''
De Luca testified before the ATF panel. ``We are referring to the
science _ not polemics, not politics. And I think that's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Wine Institute is so committed to disseminating the
latest findings on alcohol consumption that it pledged Tuesday to
work with the National Stroke Institute to distribute tens of
thousands of copies of new federal dietary guidelines to doctors,
clinics and individuals when they become available this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The current guidelines, approved in 1995 by the USDA and the
Department of Health and Human Services, note that alcoholic
beverages supply no nutrients and that heavy drinking can lead to
strokes, heart disease, cancer, violence and cirrhosis of the
liver.
</P>
<P>
   But the guidelines also note that alcoholic beverages have been
used ``to enhance the enjoyment of meals by many societies
throughout human history'' and that current evidence suggests that
``moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk for coronary
heart disease in some individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines characterize moderate drinking as no more than
one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for
men, with a drink defined as either 12 ounces of beer, 11/2 ounces
of liquor or 5 ounces of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Drafts of the updated guidelines reportedly place more emphasis
on the adverse effects of excessive drinking and point out that the
benefits of moderate drinking on the heart are confined to men over
45 years old and women older than 55.
</P>
<P>
   However, the wine industry is encouraged by the early draft's
suggestion that drinking be accompanied by food and done in
moderation. Those are behaviors that they believe are most
associated with wine.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher, and several other health experts who testified,
expressed skepticism that labels would lead consumers to seek out
such information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming number of people are not going to read the
guidelines, they are not going to consult their physicians,''
Satcher said after his testimony. ``They are going to assume that
(the label) means that (drinking) this is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Satcher said that more than 100,000 Americans die prematurely
each year due to alcohol, and that the economic toll on the nation
was $180 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts do not dispute the wine industry's claim that
moderate drinking is beneficial to some individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carlos Camargo, a researcher at Harvard Medical School,
testified that he would recommend moderate consumption to certain
patients _ such as a women who have high cholesterol, a family
history of heart disease and no history of alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But Camargo, who opposes the labels, warned that for many other
individuals, even moderate drinking is unhealthy. He described the
wine industry's efforts as ``a campaign that focuses too much on
the cardiac benefits of moderate drinking in an obvious and
self-serving attempt to promote alcohol sales.''

 STATE BILLS WOULD ALLOW BABY ABANDONMENT AT HOSPITALS  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Legislation allowing mothers to anonymously abandon
newborn babies at hospital emergency rooms without fear of criminal
prosecution easily cleared its first hurdles at the California
Capitol Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With bipartisan support in the Legislature _ and bringing
together adversaries such as Planned Parenthood and the National
Right to Life Committee _ the proposals to decriminalize baby
abandonment appear to be headed for the governor's desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is for the life of these babies that we need to offer their
mothers another option _ one that will offer them hope,'' said Debi
Faris, founder of Garden of Angels, the primary sponsor of one of
two similar bills that began moving through the Legislature
Tuesday. ``We need to encourage this particular mother to take
their baby to a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   The bills, one in the Senate and one in the Assembly, were
modeled after a law signed last year by Texas Gov. George W. Bush
that allows mothers to abandon their newborns at an emergency room
without fear of criminal prosecution. The author of one of the
bills, Republican Sen. Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, is one of
Bush's key supporters in California for the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The California versions are different from the Texas law,
however, because they allow mothers to change their minds and come
back for their babies within 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   Brulte's bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee 8 to 0 and
goes to the Senate Public Safety Committee. The other bill, by
Assemblyman Ken Maddox, R-Garden Grove, passed the Assembly
Judiciary Committee 13 to 0 and goes to the Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bills will be merged before going to Democratic Gov. Gray
Davis, who has not yet taken a position on the legislation, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Garden of Angels
</P>
<P>
   Faris, a mother of three from Yucaipa (San Bernardino County),
started the Garden of Angels in 1996 after hearing on the radio
about a baby boy found on the side the road. She took charge of
burying the boy and two others who were also at the coroner's
office awaiting cremation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In just over three years, we now have 41 children, with two
more girls at the coroner's office waiting to come to the garden,''
said Faris, who breaks down often while talking about the children.
The garden is a small cemetery in Calimesa (Riverside County).
</P>
<P>
   Doyle Tobert of the Los Angeles County coroner's office said
babies have been buried alive in shallow graves, thrown on the side
of the highway or even thrown alive to two pit bulls, which tore
the child apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we back these women into a corner,'' he said. ``If
they were raising the child, and then abandoned it, that would be
different. But if they were too afraid to share their pregnancy
with anyone, than what else can they do?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposals, mothers _ or someone else who has legal
rights to the child _ could turn in the baby to a hospital
emergency room within 72 hours of the birth and would be immune
from criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The child would be given any necessary medical treatment and
then would be turned over to the child welfare agency. The mother
or other legal guardian could return to the agency within 14 days
with positive identification and reclaim the baby.
</P>
<P>
   One of the details still to be worked out is how to create an
anonymous system and still ensure the identity of the mother if she
returns to claim the child. While identification numbers have been
proposed, some legislators are worried that someone other than the
mother might use a number to try to claim an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Other sticking points include the rights of the father and the
possibility of someone other than the mother _ for example, her
parents _ bringing in the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Faris said the law now leaves no other choice for mothers who
have hidden their pregnancies from everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should a woman be penalized for putting their child in a
safe place when they can put it in a trash can and nothing
happens,'' she said. ``In addition to saving the child, we will
save the mother from a lifetime of guilt and anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   No records are kept on how many babies are abandoned, but some
estimates are as high as 57 a day nationwide. In a program in
Alabama similar to the one proposed in California, five babies have
been taken to hospitals to be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Brulte emphasized that abandoned babies represent a tiny
fraction of births nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who don't want to be parents use the legal route
and put the baby up for adoption,'' he said. ``But for the small
percentage who abandon their child, this provides the child the
right to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no money will be included in the bill for outreach,
Faris said, she has many people who want to support the efforts. If
the bill passes, a Los Angeles trash removal company that found a
newborn has agreed to place bumper stickers on all its bins,
telling mothers that they have another choice, Faris said.

 McCOLL PAY FAILS TO RILE BofA SHAREHOLDERS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Hugh
McColl didn't have to break a sweat to swat away criticism of his
$76 million pay package at the bank's annual meeting in Charlotte,
N.C., Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of the nation's second-largest banking company
overwhelmingly voted for all 18 director candidates, including four
members of the board's compensation committee, which approved
McColl's 1999 paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   A union-sponsored proposal to reform the bank's procedures for
setting senior executive pay was soundly defeated.
</P>
<P>
   McColl ran the parlay with military precision, fielding only a
handful of questions from shareholders, according to people who
attended. The entire affair took only an hour and 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That defied predictions that McColl would face a grilling from
shareholders over pay and corporate governance issues.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that the meeting could turn unruly had been prompted
by criticism from the California Public Employees Retirement
System, one of the bank's biggest shareholders. CalPERS disclosed
recently that, to protest McColl's pay package, it would not cast
its 9.6 million votes for members of the compensation committee.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS, the nation's largest public pension fund, often
influences other big investors on shareholder issues.
</P>
<P>
   BofA did not release vote totals for individual directors. But
it said that each candidate received at least 87.6 percent of the
1.36 billion proxy votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   A measure proposed by the pension fund of the AFL-CIO, the giant
labor confederation, to have executive pay packages vetted by
independent compensation consultants lost by a similar margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like there was a protest vote of about 10 percent,''
said AFL-CIO representative Brandon Rees. ``We're very satisfied
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions from Rees, McColl said his pay package
hadn't hurt employee morale, a point he said was proved by the
success the bank is having in building its business in California.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina bank, formerly known as NationsBank, entered
California in 1998 when it bought San Francisco's BofA and took its
name.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon Trujillo, chair of the board's compensation committee,
told shareholders that directors had set McColl's pay based on what
CEOs of similar companies got, measured over a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   McColl's critics say he didn't deserve his paycheck, which
included $72 million in stock and options, because the bank's stock
performance and financial results had lagged peers in recent years.

GROW A BUSINESS: CAMPUS COMPETITIONS HELP VC FIRMS FIND TALENT  &HT;     BY PETER SINTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ College athletes are not the only students under
the gaze of professional scouts these days. Companies, which have
long visited campuses for annual recruiting drives, are now finding
ways to reach more directly into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital firms are sponsoring dozens of business plan
competitions at graduate engineering and business schools, but it's
not entirely out of the goodness of their hearts or because they
have so much free time. The VCs want to be first in line to spot
hot ideas and new talent.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the more prestigious contests don't even have to
win to attract venture capital investments. Take Akamai
Technologies, for example. Two years ago, the team developing
technology to speed Internet content delivery was a mere finalist
in the MIT $50K Entrepreneurship Competition, the granddaddy of
business plan competitions. Akamai went on to win venture capital,
go public and have a market value of nearly $7 billion, even after
losing nearly 80 percent of its value in the recent Internet stock
sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   A new Los Angeles company called Information Technology
University (ITU) plans to get to student entrepreneurs even earlier
than annual awards competitions. It has hired student
representatives at graduate business and engineering schools
including the University of California at Berkeley, Columbia,
Harvard and MIT. Their job is to help student entrepreneurs turn
business ideas into viable businesses with $100,000 to $400,000 of
seed capital and critical support services such as public relations
and marketing, cash management, accounting and administration.
</P>
<P>
   The venture capital arm of Pacific Capital Group, a Beverly
Hills, Calif., merchant bank, has invested $6.6 million in ITU, and
managing partner Adam Winnick says the company is about to sign up
a campus partner at Stanford. ITU should have representatives on 15
campuses by year's end. Scouts like former Hewlett-Packard engineer
and current UC Berkeley graduate student Kai Xu receive a monthly
retainer plus equity stakes in portfolio companies as well as ITU.
</P>
<P>
   ITU CEO Jonah Schnel figures that ``intellectual capital at the
leading graduate schools will continually translate into the next
great commercially adaptable and scalable technologies.'' And his
company should be quicker than long and bureaucratic business plan
contests in finding fortune in ivory towers.
</P>
<P>
   VC STILL FLOWING: Many high-tech stocks have plummeted and
plenty of IPO investors are POd. A new Index of Investor Optimism
monthly survey by PaineWebber and the Gallup Organization shows
that following Bleak Friday, April 14, investor optimism fell a
whopping 12 percentage points, to 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But a torrent of so-called smart money is still flowing into
venture capital funds and chasing trendy startups.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield Fund on Thursday became the latest VC firm to announce
a billion-dollar fund to focus on communications and the Internet.
The Menlo Park firm, which has invested in more than 386 companies
and helped take 109 of them public since 1969, is specifically
targeting ``mobile Internet'' applications that capitalize on the
boom in wireless connections worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion Mayfield XI fund, with investments from Stanford,
Harvard, MIT and other endowment funds and institutional investors,
is more than double the size of the previous $450 million fund
raised in June. Despite the current unsettled market, the fund has
already invested in a a dozen companies.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield General Partner Kevin Fong acknowledges that stock
valuations are going down, but he says much of the selling ``has
been indiscriminate.'' He figures, ``even if e-tailers have hard
times, Internet infrastructure companies are changing the way
people do business and are a force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Another local VC firm, Woodside Fund, closed its fourth and
largest early stage technology fund at $135 million on Friday. It
is focusing on business-to-business services and Internet
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Officers of San Francisco investment bank Robertson Stephens
have a new venture capital fund, too. Called Bayview 2000,
Robertson Stephens just joined with Amerindo Investment Advisors,
Dell Computer, Harrah's Entertainment and others to invest a total
of $50 million in Zoho Corp. The Sunnyvale company's Zoho
Hospitality Marketplace is an Internet marketplace designed to let
hotels and restaurants procure goods and services.

 NETWORTH: INTERNET INDEX FUNDS STRETCH THE CONCEPT OF INDEXING  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When people think of index funds, they think of
words like cheap, predictable and straightforward. Internet index
funds are anything but.
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine months, at least six mutual funds replicating
four different Internet indexes have begun clamoring for investors'
money.
</P>
<P>
   These funds resemble index funds as much as I resemble Catherine
Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Index funds replicate a stock index, usually a well-known one
like the the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. They are ``passively'' managed,
which means the managers don't predict where the market or
individual stocks are headed. Instead, they buy the same stocks in
the index, in the same proportions they exist in the index. Because
the funds are cheap to operate, the expenses charged to
shareholders are low, typically less than 0.5 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how they usually work. The Internet index funds
differ in many respects:
</P>
<P>
   -- They are based on relatively new and obscure indexes that are
aren't always well defined _ or easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   The de Leon Internet 100 fund is based on the de Leon Internet
100 index, developed by fund manager Paul de Leon. Right now, de
Leon is the only person following the de Leon index, which is not
published anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   -- The fund managers don't always hew closely to the index.
</P>
<P>
   De Leon can actively manage 20 percent of the fund's assets.
That's partly so he can put initial public offerings into the fund
before he puts them in his 100-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   And although the fund is market-cap weighted _ meaning it owns
stocks in the same percentage in which they appear in the index _
no single stock can represent more than 4 percent of the portfolio.
As a result, America Online represents 17 percent of the de Leon
index, but only 4 percent of the de Leon fund.
</P>
<P>
   Another fund that follows a ``modified market cap'' strategy is
Guinness Flight Internet.com, which limits any single stock to an
amount no more than 10 percent of fund assets.
</P>
<P>
   -- As if Internet stocks weren't dicey enough, some funds take
on additional risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Potomac Internet Plus fund borrows money so that returns are
25 percent greater _ on the upside and the downside _ than the Dow
Jones Internet index, which it replicates.
</P>
<P>
   That use of leverage helped the fund last year, when Net stocks
were soaring, but has made it one of the worst-performing funds
this year, with a 50 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   -- The funds aren't always simple or straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   A companion to the Potomac Internet Plus fund is the Potomac
Internet Short fund.
</P>
<P>
   This fund attempts to give a return exactly opposite the Dow
Jones Internet index, says manager Dan O'Neill. But you cannot
short that index or many of the stocks it contains. So the fund
shorts derivative securities, such as HOLDRs, which are
exchange-traded baskets of Internet stocks packaged by Merrill
Lynch. (More on HOLDRs below.)
</P>
<P>
   This fund is so complex _ and potentially dangerous _ that the
Potomac group doesn't actively market it.
</P>
<P>
   -- The funds are not cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The average expense ratio is 1 to 1.5 percent. That's in line
with actively managed funds, but high for index funds. The fund
managers say their expenses are high because the funds are so small
_ Guinness Flight is the largest, with about $45 million in assets
_ and that expenses will fall as the funds grow.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher Traulsen, who follows Internet funds for
Morningstar, doesn't buy it. ``They're charging far too much for
what they do,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue for investors is whether an index fund with a
passive investment strategy is the right way to play an industry as
dynamic and fast-changing as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Traulsen thinks it's not. ``You want a portfolio with some
flexibility to get you out of things that are going to get cut in
half,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That's why de Leon says his index fund is ``more fluid than some
others.''
</P>
<P>
   But other index fund managers say that the Internet's
unpredictable nature is what makes it perfect for indexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the hype about the Internet doesn't come close to
describing what we're going to go through over the next 10 or 20
years,'' says Jim Atkinson, managing director of Investec Guinness
Flight. ``We know the industry's going to be terribly successful,
but the technological changes are so rapid, it's difficult to
predict who's going to be the big winner. With an index fund,
you're buying the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET HOLDRS: Another way to invest passively in Internet
stocks is with the aforementioned Merrill Lynch HOLDRs.
</P>
<P>
   Like closed-end funds, these are fixed baskets of securitiesthat trade like stocks on the American Stock Exchange. Unlike
closed-end funds, which often trade at a premium or discount to the
underlying value of the stocks, HOLDRs are designed to trade at
exactly net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders can buy and sell HOLDRs just like stocks through a
broker. For a small fee, they can also turn in HOLDRs at any time
and get their portion of the underlying stocks. They can continue
to hold these stocks or sell them in bits and pieces. This lets
them control their taxes because they decide when to realize
capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   With regular mutual funds, the managers decide when to sell
stocks, and fund shareholders are often socked with capital gains
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Each HOLDR contains 20 stocks in a particular sector, such as
broadband or telecom. Unlike the Internet index funds discussed
above. HOLDRs are never ``rebalanced'' to keep up with changes in a
stock index. If one of the companies in the HOLDR is acquired, the
HOLDR will be down to 19 companies.
</P>
<P>
   HOLDRs are cheaper than mutual funds. Management fees are less
than 0.10 percent annually and are paid out of dividends. If
dividends don't cover the fees, they are waived.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Johnson, a Palo Alto financial planner, recommends
HOLDRs for clients who want exposure to the Internet but want to
avoid the risk of owning individual stocks. ``They're
tax-efficient. And they give us the opportunity to exploit intraday
trading opportunities,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The original Internet HOLDRs (HHH) are up 21 percent since they
premiered in September.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom HOLDRs (TTH), launched February 1, are down about 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Three other HOLDRs launched in late February aren't doing as
well: B2B Internet HOLDRs (BHH) are down 59 percent, Internet
Infrastructure HOLDRs (IIH) are down 48 percent and Internet
Architecture HOLDRs (IAH) have lost 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband HOLDRs (BDH) are off 13.5 percent since they were
launched April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Other HOLDRs include Pharmaceutical (PPH) and Biotech (BBH).
More are on the way.

SPARKS CHOOSE NEBRASKA GUARD
</HEADLINE>
 ... CORRECTS SPELLING OF KUBIK (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After a last-ditch effort to trade for Cleveland's
No. 1 pick fell through, the Los Angeles Sparks waited patiently
for the next-best option in the WNBA draft on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They started small and got bigger.
</P>
<P>
   With the No. 15 pick, the Sparks selected Nebraska guard Nicole
Kubik, who they hope will fill the gap left behind by Gordana
Grubin, who was lost in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks then went for size, picking 6-foot-4 center Paige
Sauer from the University of Connecticut and 6-4 center Marte
Alexander, a 1998 graduate of Arizona who played in Italy the past
two seasons. They wrapped up the day by selecting former USC guard
Nicky McCrimmon, who played briefly for the former Long Beach
StingRays of the defunct American Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks coach Michael Cooper was satisfied with the selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a happy day for the Sparks organization,'' Cooper
said. ``As you know, we lost two great players . . . in Gordana
Grubin and Nina Bjedov last year in the expansion draft, but I felt
we kept the core of our team. But I think today we (rejuvenated)
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks general manager Penny Toler, who retired as a Sparks
player last year, said the team's needs were addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The huge difference from the past and this year is we had a
high draft pick (before),'' Toler said. ``This year we're picking
15th. We're so excited about getting Kubik and Paige Sauer. We
didn't want to duplicate what we have. We have slashers. It's the
role players that are going to make a difference in the big game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's initial plan was to start drafting big to get some
reserve help for centers Lisa Leslie and DeLisha Milton, and then
work his way down. But when Cleveland held onto its pick and
selected Ann Wauters, a 20-year-old 6-4 center from Belgium, as the
first choice in the WNBA's fourth draft, Cooper had to change his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered Cleveland a trade and they turned us down,'' Cooper
said. He declined to name the two players he offered to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper feels Kubik is the answer to the team's vacancy at the
point-guard position, which was created after Indiana selected
Grubin as the top pick in the expansion draft. At 5-9, Kubik can
make the switch between the point and shooting guard. She averaged
14.6 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really mind where I went, I just wanted to get
drafted,'' said Kubik, who was born and raised in Cambridge, Neb.
``It's going to be a little bit of an adjustment for me coming from
a small town in Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, UCLA 6-2 center Maylana Martin was chosen in the
first round at the 10th spot by Minnesota, and 6-4 USC center
Adrian Williams was the 21st pick by Phoenix, which is coached by
former Trojan Cheryl Miller.

 ROTTEN TOMATOES SITE HELPS MOVIEGOERS DECIDE WHAT TO SEE  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are some people, of course, who are
perfectly comfortable picking a movie to watch by whether it gets a
thumbs-up or a thumbs-down, or by the body language of a little man
in a little chair.
</P>
<P>
   But others may want a broader sampling of critical opinion
before deciding to shell out $8 on the latest from Hollywood. And
that's where Rotten Tomatoes comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically make it easy for people to decide what movies
they want to see,'' said Paul Lee, who heads up marketing for this
small Internet startup in Emeryville, Calif. ``When you have a
snapshot of 50 or 60 reviews, it's a pretty good resource.''
</P>
<P>
   What Rotten Tomatoes ( &LR; www.rottentomatoes.com &LR; ) does is gather
reviews from dozens of different print and online critics and
divide their opinions into two camps: ``fresh'' and ``rotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with brief excerpts from each review and links to the full
text, the site also uses its ``Tomatometer'' to come up with a
consensus ranking of how the critical winds are blowing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Julia Roberts hit ``Erin Brockovich'' scored a
``fresh reading'' of 85 percent _ meaning that most of the reviews
surveyed found it a winner _ while the Brian De Palma dud ``Mission
to Mars'' produced a fresh reading of just 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A pretty cool idea. But whether this idea can translate into a
profitable business _ as the young University of California at
Berkeley college chums behind the venture are hoping _ may be
another matter altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Rotten Tomatoes began as a hobby for Senh Duong, 26, who had
recently launched a Web-design firm called Design Reactor with two
UC Berkeley pals _ Patrick Lee, 26, and Stephen Wang, 24.
</P>
<P>
   Between moneymaking gigs producing ``official'' Web sites for
movies and TV shows, Duong would indulge his passion for film by
prowling around the Web in search of new reviews.
</P>
<P>
   It was while hunting for word of Jackie Chan's latest movie that
he realized how much easier it would be if reviews from multiple
sources could be compiled in a single location.
</P>
<P>
   After working during off-hours sometimes until 4 a.m., Duong
took the wraps off Rotten Tomatoes in August 1998. Within days, the
site was spotlighted by both Yahoo and Netscape as a must-see
destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately,'' Duong recalled, ``traffic went up to a thousand
hits a day.''
</P>
<P>
   This only encouraged him to put more energy into his pet
project, which did not go over big with his colleagues at Design
Reactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had plenty of discussions,'' said Wang. ``I mean, we all
had hobby sites, but Senh was spending a lot of time with his.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Duong left the firm to pursue film classes at a
community college in Sacramento. But he still kept Rotten Tomatoes
going, and the site continued to draw a growing number of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ``Star Wars'' movie boosted traffic considerably last
summer, as Web surfers flocked to Rotten Tomatoes to see what
critics were saying. The same thing happened with ``The Blair Witch
Project.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By this time,'' Duong said, ``it went from 10,000 users every
day to 30,000.''
</P>
<P>
   This success wasn't lost on his buddies back at Design Reactor.
Because Rotten Tomatoes was being hosted on their computer servers,
they couldn't help but notice that traffic was surging at their
friend's little upstart of a movie site.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the other Design Reactor founders, Wang and Lee,
were by this time growing a little bored with their
bread-and-butter business designing Web sites for the likes of
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and Hong Kong action star Jet Li.
They were looking for new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the partners to realize how much fun it
could be for them to pool their talents and really make Duong's
Rotten Tomatoes take off.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Duong liked the idea. ``We did Design Reactor
together,'' he said. ``I knew how well we could execute.''
</P>
<P>
   As a first step, the partners contacted a small San Jose design
firm called Smart Medium and cut a deal in January for the latter
to take on Design Reactor's name and existing client base. To
maintain continuity with their former customers, the Rotten
Tomatoes crew purchased a 40-percent stake in Smart Medium.
</P>
<P>
   With their design customers taken care of, the guys put all
their creative energy into the movie site. They launched their new
business on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum was clearly on their side. Under Duong, Rotten Tomatoes
was attracting 1 million visitors a month by December. In January,
that total doubled to 2.1 million and jumped to 3.7 million in
February. By last month, the site was drawing 7 million monthly
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This month,'' said Patrick Lee, ``we expect to break 10
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the tough part: How does Rotten Tomatoes turn all that
traffic into nice, tidy profit?
</P>
<P>
   ``For a site like this, an entertainment content site, it's not
clear what the business model is,'' said David Card, an analyst
with Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The guys at Rotten Tomatoes don't seem sure, either. But Patrick
Lee, the company's chief executive, hopes revenues can be found in
any of three ways:
</P>
<P>
   -- Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   -- Commissions from related e-commerce deals.
</P>
<P>
   -- Licensing of the Tomatometer and other Rotten Tomatoes
features.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's Card was quick to point out that few online operations
can support themselves solely from ads or licensing.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't sure if Rotten Tomatoes would be able to cut deals
with sellers of videos and other movie-related goods whereby the
site would get a piece of the action for helping users make
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Online ticket sales would be a natural extension, Card noted,
but that market is already dominated by major players like
Ticketmaster and Moviefone. ``I don't think they can crack that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Andrew Hoppin, chief executive of New York's
Sports Futures, an online gaming venture, said he invested $100,000
in Rotten Tomatoes just this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of faith in Patrick and his team,'' he said.
``They did some design work for us, and they really seem to get
what will be appealing to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoppin isn't too bothered by questions of how Rotten Tomatoes
will turn a buck. Perhaps the fact that his own company is nowhere
near being profitable has something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume there will be subsequent rounds of capital that will
be required'' for Rotten Tomatoes, he said. ``I haven't dug into
their financial model in great depth.''
</P>
<P>
   However they do it, the Rotten Tomatoes crew will have to come
up with something soon. Patrick Lee estimated that it costs the
20-employee company about $100,000 a month to operate.
</P>
<P>
   With $1 million in initial funding from investors, he said
Rotten Tomatoes essentially now has six months to live before
running out of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not that an air of urgency hangs over the firm. The mood in the
office is decidedly laid-back, and a clubhouse atmosphere prevails.
``Star Wars'' and ``Godzilla'' toys adorn cubicles, and when the
gang needs to blow off steam, they get together for networked
computer games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone has any fear,'' Patrick Lee said. ``When
we started Design Reactor, nobody was really worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, considering that just about everyone in the office is
still under 30, it's not as though this is the end of the line for
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worst-case scenario,'' Patrick Lee said with a cocky smile,
``we just start another company.''

 FAST DSL IS SLOW TO INSTALL  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ SBC Communications, which owns Pacific Bell,
reported yesterday that it has been flooded with orders for
digital-subscriber lines, straining the company's ability to
install the lines quickly and field calls from customers.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications company said it had signed up 301,000 DSL
customers by the end of March, up from 169,000 by the end of last
year. About two-thirds are in California. DSL offers Internet
access over traditional phone lines at speeds dozens of times
faster than a traditional dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   But SBC said it has only installed 201,000 lines and has a
backlog of 100,000 orders. As of yesterday, SBC said, it could only
install 3,000 lines a day _ meaning it would take more than a month
just to clear the backlog if it received no new orders.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell, however, says it has hired hundreds more technicians,
started using outside contractors and plans to soon let customers
install DSL themselves in the San Francisco Bay Area to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell spokesman John Britton said the company has already
slashed the waiting time this month to 16 business days (or three
weeks) from 28 business days (or nearly six weeks).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pac Bell has been plagued by complaints about
frequent DSL outages, slow e-mail and long waits on hold for
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are the leader, you are bound to hit some speed
bumps,'' Britton said. SBC has more residential DSL customers than
any other company in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At least twice in recent months, Pac Bell acknowledged that
e-mail was delayed for hours or days when messages started backing
up in the company's mail computers. But Britton said the company
thinks it fixed the problem by adding more hardware and coming up
with better formulas to forecast future demand.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, including Covad Communications, Northpoint
Communications and Rhythms NetConnections, also provide DSL service
(using Pac Bell lines) in the Bay Area. But Pac Bell has signed up
far more customers and drawn more complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pavek, who lives on a houseboat in Sausalito, Calif.,
said it took Pac Bell six weeks to install his DSL line, and it's
been plagued by glitches ever since. First, it ran painfully slow.
Then, for the past week, it didn't work at all. Pavek said he
waited on hold for technical assistance for 35 minutes three times,
only to be routed to a voice-mail box. At least once, the mailbox
was full and not accepting new messages.
</P>
<P>
   Pavek said his problems have been especially infuriating because
Pac Bell has been running television commercials and special
promotions to attract new customers. In recent months, Pac Bell has
offered to waive the installation and equipment fees (about $200)
and shave the monthly price to $40 from $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got no business soliciting new business when they
can't handle the business that they've got,'' fumed Pavek, who
teaches people how to run alternative health practices. Pavek said
a technician finally returned one of his messages yesterday
afternoon, promising to dispatch someone to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Heritage, who has had a Pac Bell DSL line in San
Francisco for nine months, said outages appear to be occurring more
frequently. ``Pac Bell seems to be overextending themselves, and I
... am tired of their shoddy service,'' he wrote in an e-mail to
The Chronicle.

   Jupiter's Card was quick to point out that few online operations
can support themselves solely from ads or licensing.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't sure if Rotten Tomatoes would be able to cut deals
with sellers of videos and other movie-related goods whereby the
site would get a piece of the action for helping users make
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Online ticket sales would be a natural extension, Card noted,
but that market is already dominated by major players like
Ticketmaster and Moviefone. ``I don't think they can crack that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Andrew Hoppin, chief executive of New York's
Sports Futures, an online gaming venture, said he invested $100,000
in Rotten Tomatoes just this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of faith in Patrick and his team,'' he said.
``They did some design work for us, and they really seem to get
what will be appealing to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoppin isn't too bothered by questions of how Rotten Tomatoes
will turn a buck. Perhaps the fact that his own company is nowhere
near being profitable has something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume there will be subsequent rounds of capital that will
be required'' for Rotten Tomatoes, he said. ``I haven't dug into
their financial model in great depth.''
</P>
<P>
   However they do it, the Rotten Tomatoes crew will have to come
up with something soon. Patrick Lee estimated that it costs the
20-employee company about $100,000 a month to operate.
</P>
<P>
   With $1 million in initial funding from investors, he said
Rotten Tomatoes essentially now has six months to live before
running out of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not that an air of urgency hangs over the firm. The mood in the
office is decidedly laid-back, and a clubhouse atmosphere prevails.
``Star Wars'' and ``Godzilla'' toys adorn cubicles, and when the
gang needs to blow off steam, they get together for networked
computer games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone has any fear,'' Patrick Lee said. ``When
we started Design Reactor, nobody was really worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, considering that just about everyone in the office is
still under 30, it's not as though this is the end of the line for
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worst-case scenario,'' Patrick Lee said with a cocky smile,
``we just start another company.''

 NETWORTH: INTERNET INDEX FUNDS STRETCH THE CONCEPT OF INDEXING  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When people think of index funds, they think of
words like cheap, predictable and straightforward. Internet index
funds are anything but.
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine months, at least six mutual funds replicating
four different Internet indexes have begun clamoring for investors'
money.
</P>
<P>
   These funds resemble index funds as much as I resemble Catherine
Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Index funds replicate a stock index, usually a well-known one
like the the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. They are ``passively'' managed,
which means the managers don't predict where the market or
individual stocks are headed. Instead, they buy the same stocks in
the index, in the same proportions they exist in the index. Because
the funds are cheap to operate, the expenses charged to
shareholders are low, typically less than 0.5 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how they usually work. The Internet index funds
differ in many respects:
</P>
<P>
   -- They are based on relatively new and obscure indexes that are
aren't always well defined _ or easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   The de Leon Internet 100 fund is based on the de Leon Internet
100 index, developed by fund manager Paul de Leon. Right now, de
Leon is the only person following the de Leon index, which is not
published anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   -- The fund managers don't always hew closely to the index.
</P>
<P>
   De Leon can actively manage 20 percent of the fund's assets.
That's partly so he can put initial public offerings into the fund
before he puts them in his 100-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   And although the fund is market-cap weighted _ meaning it owns
stocks in the same percentage in which they appear in the index _
no single stock can represent more than 4 percent of the portfolio.
As a result, America Online represents 17 percent of the de Leon
index, but only 4 percent of the de Leon fund.
</P>
<P>
   Another fund that follows a ``modified market cap'' strategy is
Guinness Flight Internet.com, which limits any single stock to an
amount no more than 10 percent of fund assets.
</P>
<P>
   -- As if Internet stocks weren't dicey enough, some funds take
on additional risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Potomac Internet Plus fund borrows money so that returns are
25 percent greater _ on the upside and the downside _ than the Dow
Jones Internet index, which it replicates.
</P>
<P>
   That use of leverage helped the fund last year, when Net stocks
were soaring, but has made it one of the worst-performing funds
this year, with a 50 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   -- The funds aren't always simple or straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   A companion to the Potomac Internet Plus fund is the Potomac
Internet Short fund.
</P>
<P>
   This fund attempts to give a return exactly opposite the Dow
Jones Internet index, says manager Dan O'Neill. But you cannot
short that index or many of the stocks it contains. So the fund
shorts derivative securities, such as HOLDRs, which are
exchange-traded baskets of Internet stocks packaged by Merrill
Lynch. (More on HOLDRs below.)
</P>
<P>
   This fund is so complex _ and potentially dangerous _ that the
Potomac group doesn't actively market it.
</P>
<P>
   -- The funds are not cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The average expense ratio is 1 to 1.5 percent. That's in line
with actively managed funds, but high for index funds. The fund
managers say their expenses are high because the funds are so small
_ Guinness Flight is the largest, with about $45 million in assets
_ and that expenses will fall as the funds grow.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher Traulsen, who follows Internet funds for
Morningstar, doesn't buy it. ``They're charging far too much for
what they do,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue for investors is whether an index fund with a
passive investment strategy is the right way to play an industry as
dynamic and fast-changing as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Traulsen thinks it's not. ``You want a portfolio with some
flexibility to get you out of things that are going to get cut in
half,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That's why de Leon says his index fund is ``more fluid than some
others.''
</P>
<P>
   But other index fund managers say that the Internet's
unpredictable nature is what makes it perfect for indexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the hype about the Internet doesn't come close to
describing what we're going to go through over the next 10 or 20
years,'' says Jim Atkinson, managing director of Investec Guinness
Flight. ``We know the industry's going to be terribly successful,
but the technological changes are so rapid, it's difficult to
predict who's going to be the big winner. With an index fund,
you're buying the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET HOLDRS: Another way to invest passively in Internet
stocks is with the aforementioned Merrill Lynch HOLDRs.
</P>
<P>
   Like closed-end funds, these are fixed baskets of securities
that trade like stocks on the American Stock Exchange. Unlike
closed-end funds, which often trade at a premium or discount to the
underlying value of the stocks, HOLDRs are designed to trade at
exactly net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders can buy and sell HOLDRs just like stocks through a
broker. For a small fee, they can also turn in HOLDRs at any time
and get their portion of the underlying stocks. They can continue
to hold these stocks or sell them in bits and pieces. This lets
them control their taxes because they decide when to realize
capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   With regular mutual funds, the managers decide when to sell
stocks, and fund shareholders are often socked with capital gains
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Each HOLDR contains 20 stocks in a particular sector, such as
broadband or telecom. Unlike the Internet index funds discussed
above. HOLDRs are never ``rebalanced'' to keep up with changes in a
stock index. If one of the companies in the HOLDR is acquired, the
HOLDR will be down to 19 companies.
</P>
<P>
   HOLDRs are cheaper than mutual funds. Management fees are less
than 0.10 percent annually and are paid out of dividends. If
dividends don't cover the fees, they are waived.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Johnson, a Palo Alto financial planner, recommends
HOLDRs for clients who want exposure to the Internet but want to
avoid the risk of owning individual stocks. ``They're
tax-efficient. And they give us the opportunity to exploit intraday
trading opportunities,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The original Internet HOLDRs (HHH) are up 21 percent since they
premiered in September.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom HOLDRs (TTH), launched February 1, are down about 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Three other HOLDRs launched in late February aren't doing as
well: B2B Internet HOLDRs (BHH) are down 59 percent, Internet
Infrastructure HOLDRs (IIH) are down 48 percent and Internet
Architecture HOLDRs (IAH) have lost 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband HOLDRs (BDH) are off 13.5 percent since they were
launched April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Other HOLDRs include Pharmaceutical (PPH) and Biotech (BBH).
More are on the way.

TWO FAMILIES, JOINED BY A DEATH AND QUESTIONS OF WHY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-CABBY-SLAIN) 
 By AMY WALDMAN and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Rivera struggled on Tuesday afternoon to
understand how his son could have crossed over from hanging out
with the wrong people to becoming one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, at 10:15 p.m. Monday, yet another livery-cab
driver _ the eighth in the city this year _ had been killed, just
blocks from Rivera's Bronx home.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Rivera's son, who was a passenger in the cab, was
in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   While each of the driver slayings, this one included, offered
its own poignant tale of a life violently snatched, this one also
may tell of a life indifferently given away.
</P>
<P>
   The police said John Rivera Jr., 19, the son of working-class
parents who pushed him toward rectitude, was one of four people
involved in the slaying of the driver, 37-year-old Jose R.
Olivares.
</P>
<P>
   His father said he hoped it could not be true. ``He's not like
that; he's not that kind of person,'' Rivera said before his son
had been officially charged. ``I hope he didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rivera worried on Tuesday, another Bronx family grieved
for Olivares, including his sister Gladys, 34, and his three sons:
Felix Jose, 9; Jose Renaldo, 12; and Jose, 18.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olivares, one of the dead man's nine siblings, said in an
interview at her Bronx home that her brother had lived with her for
the last three months because he had separated from his common-law
wife, Maritza.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares, a driver for Excellent Car Service, always told people
that he was taking extra precautions, his sister said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pick up hails, I don't load more than two people in a
car, and if I do there has to be a child involved,'' she remembered
him saying.
</P>
<P>
   But Olivares apparently broke his rule against picking up people
who hailed his cab on the street. Just blocks from his home about
10 p.m. Monday, he stopped his car at East 170th Street and the
Grand Concourse to let in a young woman and three young men.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, the police said, as Olivares was headed west
on East 150th Street, one of the passengers shot him in the back of
the head with a .380-caliber pistol. The silver 1996 Lincoln Town
Car jumped the sidewalk and slammed into an apartment building,
injuring all of the passengers, the police said. The car hit the
side of 255 Morris Avenue with such force that it crashed through
part of a brick and cinder-block wall and knocked in a large heavy
red metal door.
</P>
<P>
   The gun was found behind Olivares' back.
</P>
<P>
   All the passengers were trapped in the car, allowing the police
to detain them for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday night, the younger Rivera, his girlfriend, Jasmin
Valentin, 16, and two of his neighbors at 3050 Park Avenue _
Norberto Hernandez, 16, and Ramon Anaya, 18 _ were charged with
second-degree murder, attempted robbery and weapons possession,
said Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Anaya and Hernandez were critically injured in the crash, and
were in stable but guarded condition at Lincoln Hospital on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares drove a cab only in the winter, and was set to switch
to his summer job driving a beer truck in a few weeks, his sister
said, adding that their mother had called from the Dominican
Republic on Monday to say that she had had an odd feeling and was
worried about him.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando A. Mateo, the president of the New York State
Federation of Taxi Drivers, said on Tuesday that Olivares had
emigrated from the Dominican Republic a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that the family is asking themselves today
is why him, a man that worked 15 hours a day, a man that worked to
support his children, support his family, support his mother back
home?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know how they're going to tell their mother that
her son is going back in a box, in a wooden box, as if he was
freight,'' said Mateo, who held a news conference at the accident
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo praised the recent efforts by the Giuliani administration
and the Police Department to respond to the recent spate of livery
killings, by financing partitions and security cameras for some of
the city's 41,000 livery drivers, and by setting up a police task
force to prevent robberies and killings. But he called on the
police to do more, particularly to increase patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares' car, which he had rented for about three years from
the owner, Ramon Brito, 45, had no bulletproof partition to protect
the driver. Brito said on Tuesday that he was scheduled to have one
installed on May 30, the earliest date he could get.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Rivera said that he and his wife, Nydia, had seen
their son on Monday night around 9, in the building's lobby. He
told them he was going to play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was laid off from his job overseeing the loading dock at
Salomon Smith Barney in February. So Tuesday, while his wife went
to her job as an administrative assistant in Manhattan, using work
to distract her from worry, he sat at home, watching the news and
awaiting word from the police. He had not yet been able to speak to
his son.
</P>
<P>
   It was not, he said, that his son had never been in trouble: he
had been arrested twice for smoking marijuana in the back of the
building. But as the father saw it, his son was a good kid
influenced by bad peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows right from wrong,'' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   After learning at 10:30 on Tuesday night that his son had been
charged with murder, Rivera seemed to be in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to talk to them,'' he said haltingly, referring to the
authorities. ``I don't know what to say right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Rivera was unemployed, and he had dropped out of the
High School for Graphic Arts in Manhattan. But he had artistic
talent, as evidenced by a scrap of graffiti his father showed, and
he planned to start classes toward his general equivalency diploma
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Rivera had reached the age where a firm voice and a daily
lecture could no longer corral him, his father said, but that did
not stop the elder Rivera from trying.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, Rivera said, he would lecture his son about hanging
out with the wrong people. Each day, including Monday, he said, his
son answered, ``They're just my friends; they're not going to do
anything.''

PALMDALE AIRPORT PROJECT SLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Intent on building regional aviation capacity and
easing the burden on Los Angeles International Airport, city and
county leaders accused airport officials Tuesday of foot-dragging
on Palmdale Regional Airport marketing and expansion efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not thinking big enough,'' Los Angeles Councilwoman
Ruth Galanter, whose district encompasses LAX, told airport
department officials who presented an expansion progress report to
the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand in Southern California is enormous and growing,''
Galanter said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of cities and community groups have criticized Los
Angeles' plans to vastly expand LAX, complaining about the
predicted increases in traffic, noise and other effects. Critics
have called for a regional approach to accommodate the growth in
passengers and cargo.
</P>
<P>
   County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich issued a statement
accusing the city's airport department of delivering ``little more
than lip-service to the work that would be involved in truly making
Palmdale a thriving airport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Palmdale Airport is a competitive existing facility that is
vital to the economic prosperity of the city of Los Angeles and the
entire county,'' Antonovich wrote in a letter to the council.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ritchie, deputy executive director of Los Angeles World
Airports, told the council that the department has made strides -
including landing a foreign aerospace contract - and is close to an
agreement with a major airline that he declined to name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as far as we want to be, but we're going to get
further with the energy behind this program,'' Ritchie said.
</P>
<P>
   He outlined for the council a February report on the status of
air transportation in the five-county area surrounding Los Angeles.
The report said that region could lose its status as the principal
U.S. gateway for Asia and Pacific Rim commerce if smaller airports
don't modernize and expand to shoulder some of the growing demand.
</P>
<P>
   The airport department has worked with Palmdale officials to
lure SR Technics - a subsidiary of Swiss Air that officials say
will inject some $44 million into the Antelope Valley economy,
Ritchie said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the department is pouring $255,000 into a marketing
campaign focused outside the Antelope Valley and plans to increase
the Palmdale terminal's capacity from 800,000 passengers a year to
8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said the city is eager to create a
functional airport, and that residents support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be a contributor to a regional solution for airport
development in Los Angeles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the city airports department agreed to develop the
Palmdale air facilities as part of a regional plan to absorb
growing air traffic to the area. The agreement included plans to
aggressively market the airport, and plans for Los Angeles to
provide right of way and easements to enable Palmdale to improve
access to the airport and build a new cargo ramp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we ought to be a whole lot farther along,''
Galanter said. And, she said, the Palmdale program needs to have a
wider scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketing or promoting the airport just in the Antelope Valley
is not going to bring the demand and attention to make this airport
really work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Hal Bernson agreed, saying Palmdale also should
consider ways to improve transportation routes to the airport,
possibly levying landing fees to build better highway connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make provisions for the future and I think Palmdale
is the ideal site,'' Bernson said.

GROW A BUSINESS: CAMPUS COMPETITIONS HELP VC FIRMS FIND TALENT  &HT;     BY PETER SINTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ College athletes are not the only students under
the gaze of professional scouts these days. Companies, which have
long visited campuses for annual recruiting drives, are now finding
ways to reach more directly into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital firms are sponsoring dozens of business plan
competitions at graduate engineering and business schools, but it's
not entirely out of the goodness of their hearts or because they
have so much free time. The VCs want to be first in line to spot
hot ideas and new talent.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the more prestigious contests don't even have to
win to attract venture capital investments. Take Akamai
Technologies, for example. Two years ago, the team developing
technology to speed Internet content delivery was a mere finalist
in the MIT $50K Entrepreneurship Competition, the granddaddy of
business plan competitions. Akamai went on to win venture capital,
go public and have a market value of nearly $7 billion, even after
losing nearly 80 percent of its value in the recent Internet stock
sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   A new Los Angeles company called Information Technology
University (ITU) plans to get to student entrepreneurs even earlier
than annual awards competitions. It has hired student
representatives at graduate business and engineering schools
including the University of California at Berkeley, Columbia,
Harvard and MIT. Their job is to help student entrepreneurs turn
business ideas into viable businesses with $100,000 to $400,000 of
seed capital and critical support services such as public relations
and marketing, cash management, accounting and administration.
</P>
<P>
   The venture capital arm of Pacific Capital Group, a Beverly
Hills, Calif., merchant bank, has invested $6.6 million in ITU, and
managing partner Adam Winnick says the company is about to sign up
a campus partner at Stanford. ITU should have representatives on 15
campuses by year's end. Scouts like former Hewlett-Packard engineer
and current UC Berkeley graduate student Kai Xu receive a monthly
retainer plus equity stakes in portfolio companies as well as ITU.
</P>
<P>
   ITU CEO Jonah Schnel figures that ``intellectual capital at the
leading graduate schools will continually translate into the next
great commercially adaptable and scalable technologies.'' And his
company should be quicker than long and bureaucratic business plan
contests in finding fortune in ivory towers.
</P>
<P>
   VC STILL FLOWING: Many high-tech stocks have plummeted and
plenty of IPO investors are POd. A new Index of Investor Optimism
monthly survey by PaineWebber and the Gallup Organization shows
that following Bleak Friday, April 14, investor optimism fell a
whopping 12 percentage points, to 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But a torrent of so-called smart money is still flowing into
venture capital funds and chasing trendy startups.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield Fund on Thursday became the latest VC firm to announce
a billion-dollar fund to focus on communications and the Internet.
The Menlo Park firm, which has invested in more than 386 companies
and helped take 109 of them public since 1969, is specifically
targeting ``mobile Internet'' applications that capitalize on the
boom in wireless connections worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion Mayfield XI fund, with investments from Stanford,
Harvard, MIT and other endowment funds and institutional investors,
is more than double the size of the previous $450 million fund
raised in June. Despite the current unsettled market, the fund has
already invested in a a dozen companies.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield General Partner Kevin Fong acknowledges that stock
valuations are going down, but he says much of the selling ``has
been indiscriminate.'' He figures, ``even if e-tailers have hard
times, Internet infrastructure companies are changing the way
people do business and are a force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Another local VC firm, Woodside Fund, closed its fourth and
largest early stage technology fund at $135 million on Friday. It
is focusing on business-to-business services and Internet
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Officers of San Francisco investment bank Robertson Stephens
have a new venture capital fund, too. Called Bayview 2000,
Robertson Stephens just joined with Amerindo Investment Advisors,
Dell Computer, Harrah's Entertainment and others to invest a total
of $50 million in Zoho Corp. The Sunnyvale company's Zoho
Hospitality Marketplace is an Internet marketplace designed to let
hotels and restaurants procure goods and services.

 McCOLL PAY FAILS TO RILE BofA SHAREHOLDERS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Hugh
McColl didn't have to break a sweat to swat away criticism of his
$76 million pay package at the bank's annual meeting in Charlotte,
N.C., Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of the nation's second-largest banking company
overwhelmingly voted for all 18 director candidates, including four
members of the board's compensation committee, which approved
McColl's 1999 paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   A union-sponsored proposal to reform the bank's procedures for
setting senior executive pay was soundly defeated.
</P>
<P>
   McColl ran the parlay with military precision, fielding only a
handful of questions from shareholders, according to people who
attended. The entire affair took only an hour and 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That defied predictions that McColl would face a grilling from
shareholders over pay and corporate governance issues.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that the meeting could turn unruly had been prompted
by criticism from the California Public Employees Retirement
System, one of the bank's biggest shareholders. CalPERS disclosed
recently that, to protest McColl's pay package, it would not cast
its 9.6 million votes for members of the compensation committee.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS, the nation's largest public pension fund, often
influences other big investors on shareholder issues.
</P>
<P>
   BofA did not release vote totals for individual directors. But
it said that each candidate received at least 87.6 percent of the
1.36 billion proxy votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   A measure proposed by the pension fund of the AFL-CIO, the giant
labor confederation, to have executive pay packages vetted by
independent compensation consultants lost by a similar margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like there was a protest vote of about 10 percent,''
said AFL-CIO representative Brandon Rees. ``We're very satisfied
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions from Rees, McColl said his pay package
hadn't hurt employee morale, a point he said was proved by the
success the bank is having in building its business in California.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina bank, formerly known as NationsBank, entered
California in 1998 when it bought San Francisco's BofA and took its
name.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon Trujillo, chair of the board's compensation committee,
told shareholders that directors had set McColl's pay based on what
CEOs of similar companies got, measured over a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   McColl's critics say he didn't deserve his paycheck, which
included $72 million in stock and options, because the bank's stock
performance and financial results had lagged peers in recent years.

ANDRE JARROT, FRENCH RESISTANCE HERO, IS DEAD AT AT 90 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andre Jarrot, a hero of the French Resistance against the
occupying Germans in World War II who became a Cabinet minister in
the 1970s, died on Friday at his home in the Burgundy region of
France. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   His death was announced by the office of President Jacques
Chirac, who declared that Jarrot was a ``legend in the Free French
movement for his courage.'' He was repeatedly flown from Britain
across the Channel and parachuted into occupied France on sabotage
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Charles de Gaulle awarded him the Cross of the Liberation
and recalled that his brave deeds had ``seriously harmed German
industries on French soil.''
</P>
<P>
   A mechanic and electrician by trade, Jarrot was a co-leader of a
group of saboteurs who had been trained in Britain, the
Basset-Jarrot team, that carried out a mission called Armada I. The
team parachuted into east-central France in August 1943, with the
target of Le Creusot, an important industrial center. The products
included armaments and railroad engines.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to keep the German war effort from exploiting the
center, 75 Allied warplanes bombed it in 1942. But they failed to
inflict grave damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Basset-Jarrot team fared better. It made its way to an
electrical power center at Chalon-sur-Saone, which was furnishing
much power to Germany and 20 percent of its output to Le Creusot.
One historian of the period, Jean-Louis Cremieux-Brilhac, wrote
that the team destroyed five transformers and five pylons. As a
result, it ``was paralyzed for six months,'' Cremieux-Brilhac
recounted.
</P>
<P>
   On the same night, he wrote, other members of the group
destroyed equipment that provided power to steel mills in Le
Creusot, which is in a coal-mining region. That damage, he added,
was ``irreparable for the rest of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrot is also said to have helped organize escape routes that
helped make it possible for 4,000 Allied airmen whose planes had
been shot down and who had become prisoners of the Germans to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   A son of a railroad worker, he was born in Burgundy. Jarrot
worked for a power and gas company and became a mechanic who
specialized in heavy vehicles. He also took up motorcycle racing
and was the French national champion in one motorcycle category in
1937.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1940, when France suffered its humiliating
defeat, German soldiers captured Jarrot. But he broke free and made
his way back to Burgundy by bicycle. It was there that he began
organizing the escape routes. He also played a role in the secret
dropping of consignments of weapons for the Resistance by Britain's
Special Operations Executive. The Germans arrested him early in
1942, but let him go for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Then he walked through the Pyrenees into Spain. After five
months of internment there, he made his way to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   He was also awarded American, British and Belgian decorations
for his Resistance work.
</P>
<P>
   His two brothers were also active in the Resistance but were
captured by the Germans and sent to concentration camps. One was
among many prisoners who were inadvertently killed just before the
war's end, when the Royal Air Force mistakenly raided German prison
vessels off the German coast.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Jarrot was a garage owner and became active in
Gaullist politics. He was elected and re-elected to the French
Parliament and also was a member of the European Parliament. He was
Quality of Life Minister from 1974 to 1976 and was a member of the
French Senate from 1986 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He married Odette Boulanger in 1946, and they had two children.

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 26:
</P>
<P>
   A fateful struggle is now going on in Iran between the reform
forces allied with President Mohammad Khatami and the religious
conservatives who control the country's most powerful institutions.
The outcome, still in doubt, will be crucial to realizing the hopes
of most Iranians for greater tolerance, respect for the rule of law
and more openness to the outside world. The conservatives may
succeed in their efforts to thwart the will of the electorate. But
they cannot prevail for long against the millions of young Iranians
who increasingly demand a better, freer life.
</P>
<P>
   In about five weeks, a newly elected Parliament is scheduled to
take office, dominated by the reform elements that won a decisive
victory in elections two months ago. But conservative clerics are
now striking back to dilute the scope of the reformers' victory and
weaken the new Parliament's authority. Such shortsighted
manipulations will only make the repressive religious authorities
even more unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives have used their control of the electoral
machinery and the outgoing Parliament to overturn some election
results, tighten censorship and shield the clerically controlled
judiciary and military from future legislative scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Acting through the courts, they have virtually shut down the
pro-reform press. Iran's journalists have grown increasingly daring
in their exposure of corruption and investigation into killings
linked to government intelligence agencies. In recent weeks
prosecutors and courts have jailed prominent publishers, editors
and investigative reporters on charges of insulting Islamic values
or defaming the 1979 Islamic revolution. This week the courts
ordered the closing of 13 of the country's most liberal newspapers.
That may deprive their substantial readership of up-to-date
information on the latest scandals but is hardly likely to quiet
popular suspicions of official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Most chillingly, some of the most militant religious
conservatives have threatened physical violence to overturn the
election results. Leading reform politicians are responding to the
latest clerical offensive cautiously, eager to avoid a showdown
with the powerful religious establishment. Many reformers, like
Khatami, are clerics themselves. Their goal is to liberalize
Islamic rule, not overturn it.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most enthusiastic backers of reform, like
university students, are growing understandably impatient with the
continued setbacks to Iran's tentative new freedoms. There is also
mounting discontent with Iran's anemic economy, which has limited
opportunities for a younger generation that would like to share in
the rising prosperity in other parts of the world. Eventually,
Iranians will have to choose between two dramatically different
visions of their nation's future, one based on democracy and the
rule of law, the other premised on arbitrary religious authority.
If the conservative clerics were wise, they would bow to the reform
movement instead of forcing events toward a confrontation.

   (UNDATED) _ In this age of a sole and overweening superpower, a
younger generation will find it impossible to believe. But just 25
years ago the USA was on its knees, its presidency disgraced, its
allies falling prey to Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate crowds clawing to attach themselves to the final
helicopter out of Dha Trang, the last Marines humiliatingly plucked
from the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon as a mob prepared to
sack the building _ the images are true, but today seem like a
dream.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century ago, however, Vietnam was a reality that
none of us, even non-Americans, could escape.
</P>
<P>
   Few who were young at the time will forget the violence in front
of the U.S. Embassy in London's Grosvenor Square in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Today's anti-capitalist demonstrations against the World Trade

fury and the frustration catalyzed by Vietnam, a crusade against
the U.S. and all the evils of racism and imperialism, consumerism
and war in general.

Richard Nixon that he had to find a solution that would extricate
the U.S. from the war with as much honor as possible.

   Students across Europe took up the anti-war, anti-imperialist

</P>
<P>
   All of us who lived through the war have our own memories.
Vietnam brushed me twice, first personally, and then as a tiny
fragment of history.
</P>
<P>
   The first occasion was in 1970, when Alec Hottell, a West Point
graduate and Rhodes-scholar friend and contemporary at Oxford, was
killed on service there in a helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
   The second was an early February day, decades later, in
Washington, when news broke about the maneuverings of a far more
famous Rhodes scholar to avoid the Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal published its story in the midst of the
extraordinary campaign for the 1992 New Hampshire primary, when
candidate Bill Clinton was already struggling to cope with the
revelation of his affair with the nightclub singer Gennifer
Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   That same evening I had been invited to dinner by yet another
former Rhodes scholar, Strobe Talbott, who became a close friend of
Clinton's when they shared digs in north Oxford in the late 1960s,
and today is his deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   On the late news we watched the Governor of Arkansas trying to
explain his behavior: not least why, at the age of 22, he was
already agonizing about how to preserve his ``future political
viability'' if he failed to serve in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Strobe was depressed, sure that this second blow would finish
Clinton's candidacy. Almost 17 years after its end, the war, it
seemed, was still a bitter enough memory to deprive American
politics of someone he believed could become a truly great
president.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott wasn't alone. Every talk-show pundit in the land
declared Clinton finished. Americans might be more relaxed about
extramarital adventures by their politicians, it was held, but they
still regarded attempts to wriggle out of military service as
deeply unpatriotic. Clinton, to borrow their charming phrase, was
``dead meat.''
</P>
<P>
   We were all wrong. One reason was Clinton's superhuman
resilience as a candidate. But there was another, more profound
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Vietnam no longer mattered. It had been a war of its
time, born, like most conflicts, from a mixture of pragmatism and
idealism, but very much a product of the global struggle with the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   It was fought in the ostensibly impeccable cause of halting
Communism, of stopping dominoes in Southeast Asia from falling, and
preserving ``freedom.'' &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,275) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was an unmitigated disaster, the only war the U.S. has
ever lost. It took the lives of 58,000 Americans and an estimated
2.5 million Vietnamese. It cost untold treasure, destroyed a
president, and fired the protest of a generation at home and around
the world as no event since.
</P>
<P>
   And for what? Vietnam fell, but the dominoes didn't. Today,
Communism survives in a few pockets such as Cuba, North Korea and
Vietnam itself, but the American way has triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's survival and ultimate victory in 1992 was a first
sign that the U.S. was getting Vietnam out of its system. In a
sense, the 2000 campaign has rounded off the process.
</P>
<P>
   With his candidacy, John McCain, a U.S. Navy pilot in the war
and a prisoner in Vietnam for five-and-a-half years, sealed the
rehabilitation of the war's last outcasts, the soldiers who had
returned, only to be shunned and forgotten by an ungrateful
country.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain was in the end soundly beaten for the Republican
nomination by George Bush, Jr., whose record in Vietnam consisted
of sitting it out in the Texas National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crucial primary in South Carolina was instructive.
The state was brimming with Republican-voting war veterans, yet
McCain's compelling record as a military hero was no match for the
hostility of the religious right, whom he had grievously offended.
</P>
<P>
   As for the U.S.'s early baby-boomers of my own generation, who
variously accepted, manipulated or dodged the draft, many are now
only a few years short of retirement, ensconced in a prosperity
generated by the longest boom since the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is history _ history in some respects more remote than
the Korean War that predated it. Handling North Korea is still a
daily torment for U.S. policymakers. But there is no ball and chain
attached to the U.S.'s collective political psyche marked ``the
Legacy of Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   If such a shackle exists, it is in the Pentagon. The new
doctrine, exemplified by the war against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, has three parts: the use of overwhelming force, no body
bags and no ``mission creep.''
</P>
<P>
   Never again will the U.S. allow itself to be sucked into an
open-ended and unwinnable foreign war, in which American boys die
even when the country's national security is not directly at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The real world naturally does not respect such paradigms. You
can send cruise missiles smashing into targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan _ but ``mission creep'' is precisely what confronts the
thousands of U.S. troops stationed in Bosnia and Kosovo, and likely
to remain there for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as the body-bag count stays at zero, the
post-Vietnam theory holds.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam remains a one-party Communist state, one of the 25
poorest countries in the world. An economic deal offered by the
U.S. is on ice. But Clinton presses on.
</P>
<P>
   He lifted the U.S. trade embargo in 1994 and established
diplomatic relations in 1995. Later this year he may become the
first U.S. president to set foot on Vietnamese soil since 1969,
when Richard Nixon dropped by to give the troops a pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Legacy of Vietnam'' may yet end up as part of the legacy
of Bill Clinton. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the picture that went around the world, which will be
remembered long after most people have forgotten what the dispute
over Elian Gonzalez was about.
</P>
<P>
   Except that it was about the elemental question of how to
enforce the rule of law in matters as sensitive and untidy as the
custody of a six-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we would not have done it like that, most Britons
would say. The aim of reuniting Elian with his father was clearly
right, but to have used a squad of masked men (and a
Spanish-speaking woman with a blanket) to achieve it, brandishing
machine-guns within inches of the terrified child's face, that
would not happen here.
</P>
<P>
   Before we are too smug, however, we should pause. How should it
have been done?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an unarmed constable should have dismounted his bicycle,
knocked on the door and asked for the boy, sternly but politely.
Not that he could have reached the door through the hundreds of
anti-Castro Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was the prominence of the guns which was most offensive
to European sensibilities: the use of surprise, speed and minimal
force would have been needed in any case.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the guns up front were unnecessary. But this was
America. Who was to say that not one of Elian's self-appointed
custodians would be armed, and would not, in the emotional and
ideological heat of the moment, start shooting?
</P>
<P>
   Not George W. Bush, anyway, first out of the hypocritical blocks
to criticize the action as ``defying the values of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate for the presidency opposes gun control
and is not well placed to argue that law enforcement agencies
should use only truncheons and whistles on delicate missions.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader scheme, the mission was successful. The U.S.
courts can now assess the claim made on Elian's behalf for refugee
status without the distraction of his being held illegally by his
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The claim must stand little chance of success, however, even if
the courts allow Elian to apply for asylum against his father's
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers would have to show that the boy had a well-founded fear
of persecution if he returned to Cuba, whereas the truth is that he
can only have a well-founded fear of canonization.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro has already proclaimed the action of the U.S.
authorities to be a victory for the Cuban nation.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the longer-term significance of Saturday's snatch.
It is clear that Presidents Clinton and Castro are working
together, against the Cuban-exile political bloc in Florida, which
exerts such a disproportionate and malign influence on U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of the impasse was only made possible by the
arrival in Washington earlier this month of Elian's father, by
arrangement with the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   This changed the story from one of the boy orphaned in a heroic
escape from wicked communist tyrant to another narrative equally
familiar to an American audience, that of the father-son bond.
</P>
<P>
   It also holds out the hope that the ending of this story could
be one of reconciliation on a larger stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, freed from the need to grub for votes among the
virulent leaders of Miami's anti-Castro Cubans, could use the Elian
affair to normalize relations with Havana.
</P>
<P>
   And if Elian's too-eventful life could contribute to the ending
of America's counterproductive isolation of Cuba, the shock he
endured at five o'clock last Saturday morning may have heralded a
larger accomplishment. &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 26:
</P>
<P>
   There were encouraging signs on Tuesday that a majority of
Supreme Court justices are prepared to defend women's health and
reproductive freedom against the proliferating bans on a vaguely
defined surgical procedure dubbed partial birth abortion. But it
was hard to tell from comments by the justices how far the court
will go to discourage further attempts by Congress and the states
to ban particular abortion procedures or tinker with the
still-sound architecture of Roe vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   The court was hearing Nebraska's appeal of a lower federal court
ruling last year. That ruling tossed out the state's partial birth
ban on grounds that it placed an ``undue burden'' on a woman's
exercise of her constitutional right to abortion _ the standard the
court set the last time it plunged into the abortion wars eight
years ago. The undue burden arose, the lower court said, because
the state criminalized a procedure that ``has no fixed medical or
legal content'' and was so ill defined that it was potentially
applicable to common techniques used for abortions early in
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the comments of a number of the justices on Tuesday,
including a key swing justice, Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's
decision in June is likely to agree with that conclusion. The
court's challenge is to frame a ruling that will discourage further
attempts to criminalize certain abortion methods before viability
and will recognize the threat to women's health and bodily
integrity when politicians try to circumscribe medical choices.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the court will turn to another question that has
galvanized the religious right _ the effort by a gay Eagle Scout
and exemplary scoutmaster named James Dale to regain his place in a
New Jersey troop. In a unanimous decision last year, New Jersey's
highest court declared that the Boy Scouts violated New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law in ousting Dale solely because he is gay.
The Boy Scouts' appeal declares that the organization has a right,
under the First Amendment's protection for freedom of association,
to define its own ``expressive character'' by excluding gay youths
and adults from membership.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster that position, the Scouts cite the Supreme Court's
1995 decision that the St. Patrick's Day parade in Boston could not
be required to include a group marching under a gay-rights banner.
That was a sound ruling, but it does not fit this case. The Boy
Scouts is not a parade. It is a major civic group that says it is
``open to all boys'' and guided by virtues like honesty and respect
for others. Its essential message and purpose are not changed
because gay people happen to participate.
</P>
<P>
   A more apt analogy is the string of civil rights cases in which
the court rejected similarly overwrought free-speech claims raised
to justify keeping women out of various all-male bastions, like
Rotary Clubs, and to justify discrimination against blacks in
public accommodations. This is a chance for the court to send a
strong message about tolerance and the continued vitality of some
proud civil rights precedents. The justices should not pass it up.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the picture that went around the world, which will be
remembered long after most people have forgotten what the dispute
over Elian Gonzalez was about.
</P>
<P>
   Except that it was about the elemental question of how to
enforce the rule of law in matters as sensitive and untidy as the
custody of a six-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we would not have done it like that, most Britons
would say. The aim of reuniting Elian with his father was clearly
right, but to have used a squad of masked men (and a
Spanish-speaking woman with a blanket) to achieve it, brandishing
machine-guns within inches of the terrified child's face, that
would not happen here.
</P>
<P>
   Before we are too smug, however, we should pause. How should it
have been done?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an unarmed constable should have dismounted his bicycle,
knocked on the door and asked for the boy, sternly but politely.
Not that he could have reached the door through the hundreds of
anti-Castro Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was the prominence of the guns which was most offensive
to European sensibilities: the use of surprise, speed and minimal
force would have been needed in any case.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the guns up front were unnecessary. But this was
America. Who was to say that not one of Elian's self-appointed
custodians would be armed, and would not, in the emotional and
ideological heat of the moment, start shooting?
</P>
<P>
   Not George W. Bush, anyway, first out of the hypocritical blocks
to criticize the action as ``defying the values of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate for the presidency opposes gun control
and is not well placed to argue that law enforcement agencies
should use only truncheons and whistles on delicate missions.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader scheme, the mission was successful. The U.S.
courts can now assess the claim made on Elian's behalf for refugee
status without the distraction of his being held illegally by his
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The claim must stand little chance of success, however, even if
the courts allow Elian to apply for asylum against his father's
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers would have to show that the boy had a well-founded fear
of persecution if he returned to Cuba, whereas the truth is that he
can only have a well-founded fear of canonization.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro has already proclaimed the action of the U.S.
authorities to be a victory for the Cuban nation.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the longer-term significance of Saturday's snatch.
It is clear that Presidents Clinton and Castro are working
together, against the Cuban-exile political bloc in Florida, which
exerts such a disproportionate and malign influence on U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of the impasse was only made possible by the
arrival in Washington earlier this month of Elian's father, by
arrangement with the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   This changed the story from one of the boy orphaned in a heroic
escape from wicked communist tyrant to another narrative equally
familiar to an American audience, that of the father-son bond.
</P>
<P>
   It also holds out the hope that the ending of this story could
be one of reconciliation on a larger stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, freed from the need to grub for votes among the
virulent leaders of Miami's anti-Castro Cubans, could use the Elian
affair to normalize relations with Havana.
</P>
<P>
   And if Elian's too-eventful life could contribute to the ending
of America's counterproductive isolation of Cuba, the shock he
endured at five o'clock last Saturday morning may have heralded a
larger accomplishment. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The high drama of Saturday's pre-dawn raid on the
Miami house of Lazaro Gonzalez lasted a bare three minutes: just as
long as it took to break down the door, snatch six-year-old Elian
from the arms of his fisherman-rescuer and rush him out to the
waiting cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the political and diplomatic reverberations of what happened
are likely to be felt for decades, and many lives have been
changed, probably forever.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate controversy, and the one that may be
shortest-lived, is the degree of force used to recover the child.
Earlier government pledges not to raid the house by night or use
force of arms were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney-general, Janet Reno, said that no guns were
pointed at the child and no fingers were on triggers _ a close
examination of the pictures shows this to be true _ and that
adequate precautions had to be taken because of reports that there
were guns in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the people involved in the case, Reno had the most
responsibility and the most to lose, professionally and personally.
</P>
<P>
   It was she who conducted negotiations with the Miami relatives
at crucial junctures and it was up to her to decide whether and
when to authorize the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   After the disastrous storming of the Branch Davidian compound at
Waco seven years ago, her reputation as someone able to take
decisions under extreme pressure was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   She insisted throughout that the law and morality demanded the
reunion of Elian with his father. In retrospect, the success of
Saturday's operation and the lengths to which she went to negotiate
a settlement will probably vindicate her judgment.
</P>
<P>
   On the personal front, however, she has lost a great deal. A
native of Miami, where she was elected state attorney four times,
Reno had hoped for a peaceful retirement in her family house there.
The wrath of the city's 800,000 Cuban emigres may make that
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand Cubans poured on to the streets of their Little
Havana quarter of Miami Saturday after news of the raid spread, in
mostly peaceful protests. The Elian saga, however, has polarized
Miami, and could well have dissipated their national influence.
</P>
<P>
   The view of the majority of emigre Cubans, that the child's
right to live in American freedom superseded the parental rights of
his father, was not shared in the rest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And the anger with which they defended their view only added to
the impression of an immigrant group that placed itself above U.S.
law.
</P>
<P>
   Some Miami Cuban leaders fear that Congress, having seen Little
Havana flout U.S. law, could now move to lift the trade embargo on
Cuba despite their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the enforced return of Elian to his father will
improve the climate of U.S.-Cuban relations; but they could sour
again if the legal processes drag on too long.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over Elian Gonzalez, and the manner in which he was
removed from his Miami relatives, not only split mainstream opinion
away from that of the Cuban emigres, it divided families and
destroyed friendships.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and Elian's
uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, can ever be reconciled is remote; Juan
Miguel believes Lazaro ``kidnapped'' his child and then poisoned
his mind with a constant stream of new toys and anti-Cuba
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential nominee, George W. Bush, whose
brother Jeb is Florida governor, took the side of the anti-Castro
emigres from the start.
</P>
<P>
   In what may have been a political misjudgment, the Democratic
nominee, Vice President Al Gore, broke with President Bill Clinton
and called at one point for Elian to be given permanent residence
in the U.S. He then restricted himself to calling for the law to
take its course.
</P>
<P>
   In taking a view similar to that of George W. Bush, he prevented
the issue becoming an issue in the presidential race _ except in
his own party. Many Democratic congressmen and most American blacks
believed that Elian belonged with his father and accused Gore of
``pandering'' to Florida's Cuban voters.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty for Gore is that his stand may have cost him
votes outside southern Florida and he may not be able to recoup
sufficient votes from the strongly Republican emigre Cubans to
compensate.
</P>
<P>
   In a close presidential race, Florida's electoral college votes
could swing the election. The forcible snatching of the child makes
it even less likely that Gore will win Florida, and could even cost
him the presidency. &QL;

SCIOSCIA DISCOUNTS EXPERIENCE FACTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mike Scioscia had just one full season of
managerial experience _ last year at Triple-A Albuquerque _ before
landing in the big leagues as the Angels skipper.
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem, he insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing,'' he said, ``I did manage in the instructional
league and in the fall league. So it's more than just Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, you've got to do it, and you never know when
that opportunity is going to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you're an astronaut,'' Scioscia continued. ``You can train
all you want. But you're never going to know how good an astronaut
you are until you're out there in outer space.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Caution: Scioscia gave shortstop Gary DiSarcina Tuesday night
off _ just one game after he returned from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work him in slowly,'' Scioscia said. ``He's such a
huge piece of this whole thing, we're going to need him the whole
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia's plan is for DiSarcina to play again tonight, then see
about Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia is treating reliever Troy Percival, who had shoulder
surgery in October, the same way. No matter how tempting, Scioscia
insists he won't use Percival in a ``maybe'' situation, such as a
tie game on the road, or for more than one inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might get you a win or two in April,'' Scioscia said of
Percival, ``but it might get you 12 losses in August. It's not
worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The Elian debate: No one among the Angels asked Scioscia for
the day off to protest the way the government handled the Elian
Gonzalez matter, as a number of players with various clubs did. But
if anyone had, Scioscia said:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be sympathetic to a player's personal wishes. He'd
have to go through (general manager) Bill Stoneman. He's the one
who would have to sign off on it. But, yes, there are things that
transcend baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia then laughed and asked, ``Now that you mention it, Tim
Salmon's not Cuban, is he?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Around the horn: Doug Mansolino, Detroit's third-base coach
who was thrown out of Monday night's game in the third inning,
attended Long Beach State and is a close friend of former Dodgers
coach Mark Cresse, who is expected to return to the major leagues
soon as an instructor with the Angels. . . . The Tigers activated
second baseman Damion Easley from the 15-day disabled list and put
him in the starting lineup. He was sidelined with a bone fracture
in his right hand. To make room on the roster, outfielder Karim
Garcia, a former Dodger, was outrighted to Triple-A Toledo. . . .
The Tigers are expecting word today regarding suspensions and fines
stemming from last Saturday's on-field brawls with the Chicago
White Sox. . . . Angels right-hander Tim Belcher, in his third
rehab assignment, allowed one run and five hits in five innings
Tuesday night for Triple-A Edmonton at Calgary.

   JERUSALEM _ It was James Carville, the gritty Cajun genius
behind Bill Clinton's campaign war room, who came up with the
slogan which turned Ehud Barak from old soldier into new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuck. Stuck. Stuck,'' it said, indicting Benjamin Netanyahu's
performance on almost every front. Towards the end of the election
trial, it was running on television almost hourly.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year later, the same staccato mantra could now be used
against the man for whom it helped secure a rare landslide victory.
The wave of giddy optimism that flooded Israel with Ehud Barak's
election last May has melted away.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-general is also stuck, stuck, stuck. And _ against all
odds _ Netanyahu is beginning once again to make a serious showing
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by persistent corruption allegations against
Netanyahu and his wife, 37 percent of Israelis surveyed by Gallup
this month said that they want the right-wing ``Bibi'' back in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more importantly, only three percent more _ 40 percent _
declared support for the premier.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months earlier, when Barak first took over, the same poll
gave him 59 percent, a margin of 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The honeymoon is over. The neat V-shaped smile that permanently
adorns the prime minister's face is no longer assumed to be one of
confidence but of misplaced smugness.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis seem to be losing faith that Barak, who entered office
with more support than any Israeli prime minister since the 1960s,
can solve their chronic concerns _ war, peace, internal social
strains, the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford-educated prime minister, with his 180 IQ and aloof
style, is increasingly being seen as too arrogant, and too inclined
to view himself as an expert in everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ehud Barak has become an increasing source of disappointment
for the Israeli people,'' wrote Yoel Marcus, a columnist in the
respected Ha'aretz newspaper, this week.
</P>
<P>
   His task is not made easy by the fact that the government is
built on an insecure parliamentary coalition. It has also been
distracted by scandal _ over campaign financing and now sex (police
say that Yitzhak Mordechai, a cabinet minister and Barak confidant,
should be charged after complaints from three women).
</P>
<P>
   But the central problem is that he has so far failed to produce
tangible results to feed to Israel's restless electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, ever the methodical military man, carries a laminated
card in his wallet on which his campaign promises are written. It
is beginning to look as if the only one of these that he will
fulfill is to withdraw Israel's troops from its mini-Vietnam of
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As the prospects of a peace deal with Syria have again collapsed
_ building has begun anew on the occupied Golan Heights _ this will
almost certainly be unilateral.
</P>
<P>
   Although Israel will loudly claim credit for finally fulfilling
U.N. Resolution 425, which calls for its withdrawal, it will surely
feel like a defeat _ even though there will be relief that the
boys, at last, have come home and there is no further need for them
to be dispatched to the killing fields.
</P>
<P>
   The cries of victory from Hezbollah guerrillas, who have been
fighting the Israeli occupation for years, will be hard to drown
out. And they will find plenty of echoes around the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Two months before the pullout deadline, nerves are setting in
about the possibility that it will flare into a wider conflict;
Hezbollah have sharply stepped up their hostilities in the last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Three Israeli soldiers were injured by a bomb on Thursday, and
Katyusha rockets _ albeit so far harmlessly _ have landed across
the northern border.
</P>
<P>
   There are mutterings from the Israel military that Barak _ who
has, by Israeli standards, shown restraint in the last couple of
days, not least because it is Passover and Israel's north is
crowded with tourists _ must strike back soon.
</P>
<P>
   Other fronts look no more encouraging. For all President Bill
Clinton's expressions of optimism after a White House fish supper
with Yasser Arafat last Thursday, a final peace settlement between
Israel and the Palestinians remains remote.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Monday that
she intended to travel to the region to assess progress and
predicted ``very intensive work'' in the next six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Under their timetable, both sides are supposed to have a peace
treaty framework ready by next month.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentals _ such as the status of Jerusalem, the fate of
Palestinian refugees, the still-expanding Jewish settlements on
Palestinian land, and the amount of occupied land to be returned to
the Palestinians _ continue to represent a huge gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding its record of expanding Jewish settlements on
occupied Arab land, its flat refusal to budge on Jerusalem, and
Palestinian public opinion, Israel last week demanded more
flexibility from Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The reply had a weary ring. ``We have nothing new to add,'' said
Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian cabinet minister. ``There is no more
room for flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Barak is a victim of his own image. Unlike
Netanyahu, he has done much to convince the West that he is
sincerely intent on peace. It tends to forget that he is also a
single-minded general, who specializes in hard ball.
</P>
<P>
   He wants peace, but on Israel's terms _ and that's one reason
why he is stuck. &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE MURDEROUS ERA OF GEORGE C. WALLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWELL RAINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The calculated racism and financial corruption of the George
Wallace regime in Alabama has been amply recorded in Dan Carter's
1995 biography, ``The Politics of Rage,'' and in a new two-part
television documentary, ``George Wallace: Settin' the Woods on
Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, broadcast earlier this week as part of the
Public Broadcasting Service's ``American Experience'' series, is
particularly good on Wallace's decision to abandon the progressive
racial views he espoused in a 1958 campaign for governor and to
re-invent himself as a segregationist in time for his successful
candidacy in 1962. Wallace's own daughter, Peggy Wallace Kennedy,
even provides an explanation for this cold sacrifice of principle:
``He loved the power.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Wallace was not the first politician to trade core
principle for power. What sets him apart is the price in blood that
other citizens paid for what was, to him, a simple matter of
narcissistic political gamesmanship. For many of us who came of age
in Alabama during his heyday, that part of Wallace's legacy
deserves continuing emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   George Wallace should not be allowed to walk into history as an
unusually gifted regional demagogue who helped usher in a new
conservative era in American politics. He was also a chief law
enforcement officer whose public comments incited violence and
whose years in office produced a string of political murders _ many
of them unsolved and unprosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Wallace always had a ready answer for the murder
epidemic that hit Alabama after his election. He personally did not
condone violence. But as civil rights leaders pointed out, that
begged the question of the impact Wallace's rhetorical violence had
on the gross and simple minds of back-alley racists.
</P>
<P>
   In a personal meeting in 1965, the Rev. Joseph L. Lowery of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference reminded Wallace of their
shared Methodist religion and warned the governor that his defiant
demand that Alabamians ``stand up for segregation'' gave moral
permission for thugs to use their pistols, lead pipes and dynamite.
Wallace responded to such preachments with what Dan Carter
correctly labeled a ``reckless disregard'' for the impact of his
words on public safety in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   It was a point that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. made repeatedly.
In ``George Wallace: Settin' the Woods on Fire,'' we see King on
Sept. 16, 1963, one day after the church bombing that killed four
black girls in Birmingham. ``The governor said things and did
things which caused these people to feel that they were aided and
abetted by the highest officer in the state,'' King said. ``The
murders of yesterday stand as blood on the hands of Governor
Wallace.''
</P>
<P>
   After 37 years, there may be a tendency to regard King's words
as hyperbolic. But the statistics bear him out. Non-fatal beatings
and bombings were common during the terms of Wallace's
predecessors, but investigations of Klan perpetrators went forward
energetically under Wallace's mentor, Gov. James E. Folsom.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed when Wallace came in. By my count, 12 people died
in Alabama in civil rights slayings in Wallace's first term between
1963 and 1966. There were only five state trials resulting from
these deaths and only two convictions. After compiling this
remarkable record of inability to prevent mayhem on the public
roads, Wallace then offered himself for the presidency as a
law-and-order candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The incompetence of law enforcement in Alabama under Wallace was
mind-boggling. District attorneys, many of whom owed their election
or appointment to him, felt little pressure to prosecute civil
rights murders. When forced to do so by national opinion, they
often favored manslaughter over murder indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Most tellingly, Wallace turned the highway patrol over to Albert
J. Lingo, whose lack of law enforcement expertise made him a
laughingstock even among segregationists within his own department.
Lingo was famously close to many violent citizens. In one notorious
incident, a segregationist gunman reportedly called Lingo directly
from a Black Belt town to say, ``I just shot two preachers. You
better get on down here.'' The shooter was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1963 church bombing, Lingo destroyed the promising
investigations being conducted by two seasoned homicide detectives,
Ben Allen and James Hancock, by ordering the premature arrest of
their chief suspect, Robert (Dynamite Bob) Chambliss. It would be
13 years before Chambliss could be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   All this is simply to say that there is a part of the Wallace
legacy that needs to be remembered alongside his colorful oratory,
his racial pandering and his impact on the national political
scene. He was also a lawyer who fomented a lawless environment with
regard to the Constitution and a governor whose failure to demand
enforcement of basic criminal law in highly publicized capital
cases will not, one hopes, be matched again by any future state
executive.

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are the ``angry old men,'' the ``senior
shooters,'' the perpetrators of ``grey rage'' _ call them what you
like.
</P>
<P>
   But in the week that the United States commemorated the first
anniversary of its most murderous school shootings, at Columbine
High School in Colorado, another scourge loomed: it was pensioners
who were toting guns to deadly effect.
</P>
<P>
   A total of four people were killed and nine injured in two
shootings at housing complexes for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   To call them old-age homes would be a misnomer: the first was
Lincoln Park Senior Tower, a high-rise block in a suburb of Detroit
occupied by lower-income pensioners.
</P>
<P>
   The second was on the other side of the country at Ventana Lakes
near Peoria, Ariz., the sort of landscaped complex of detached
houses, tennis courts, swimming pools and clubhouses much favored
by middle- and upper-income Americans when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from geography and economics, however, the two incidents
had much in common.
</P>
<P>
   In Lincoln Park, Ken Miller, 56, was threatened with eviction
after accusations from residents that he used bad language. On
Tuesday, after several warnings, he was called to a meeting with
the administrator to be given notice to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Reports said that he stormed out of the meeting saying: ``You're
not going to assassinate my character and you haven't heard the
last from me.'' He returned later with a rifle, firing at his
accusers and anyone else who got in the way. Two elderly women were
killed and six other people were taken to hospital.
</P>
<P>
   After rampaging through the building, he was found locked in an
apartment, suffering the effects of an overdose of painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   His son said that his father had been adamant that the charges
against him were unfounded and that he was the victim of a
vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   At Ventana Lakes, the pensioner gunman was Richard Glassel, 61,
who had been engaged in something akin to a running battle with the
management on the subject of landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Glassel, fellow residents said, wanted the bushes around his
house to be allowed to grow full and luxuriant. The estate rules,
though, dictated that they be cut back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ordered the landscape committee not to take care of his
yard, and you're not allowed to do that,'' a fellow resident said,
noting that Glassel would have signed up to the rules before he
moved into his house.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Glassel had apparently defaulted on his
mortgage, and the house had been repossessed. But before he left,
he had comprehensively vandalized it inside, sawing the bath and
kitchen cabinets, cutting the wiring, and removing appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said that they had not seen him for months when he
suddenly turned up again last week, stormed into a meeting of the
residents' association and opened fire with a rifle and two
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Two women were killed and three others injured. He was stopped
only when his rifle jammed and half a dozen residents tackled him.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the gunmen were white, suburban and hitherto
law-abiding citizens who seem to have stored up their anger for
years before they finally snapped.
</P>
<P>
   But they were also known to turn to anger quickly and were
viewed by their peers as antisocial misfits _ just like their much
younger counterparts in the rash of school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of firearms made their rage deadly. In both
cases, too, what they were railing against was the pressure applied
by their peers to conform.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, they had signed up to the rules and the majority
clearly complied. But the pettiness of rules that allowed a dirty
joke or a preference for shaggy bushes to be grounds for eviction
is predicated on the communities being completely homogeneous or
run as mini-dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   The trend for Americans, especially older white Americans, to
move into private housing complexes cuts them off from the
diversity of life outside.
</P>
<P>
   Often called ``adult'' communities, these complexes are
restricted by age to the point of excluding all children, except as
very temporary visitors.
</P>
<P>
   They set income requirements that have the effect of excluding
those of a different economic group. And the disparity in life
expectancy means that men find themselves, perhaps for the first
time, in a minority _ and one that is organized and led by women.
</P>
<P>
   For many residents, this is the first time they have ever had
leisure on their hands and they apply the same zeal for
organization to their retirement that they applied to their working
lives.
</P>
<P>
   There are classes and committees and participation is expected.
Space for the loner is limited.
</P>
<P>
   As the baby-boomers start to collect their pensions, simple
demography dictates that there will be more and more angry old men
to vent their resentment. ``Grey rage'' is at hand. &QL;

PLANS FOR VALLEY CITY UNVEILED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Showing how they think a San Fernando Valley city
will succeed where Los Angeles has failed, leaders of the secession
movement on Tuesday released the first portrait of a new Valley
city and the framework for creating it.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-page document offers very specific recommendations on
some points, from the composition of a Valley city council (one
member per 100,000 constituents) to the election of a Valley mayor
(by Valley-wide vote).
</P>
<P>
   It also lists nine specific points - the group's ``vision of a
new city'' - that many people would say are exactly what Los
Angeles lacks. Among them: ``Improved basic services ... safe and
clean neighborhoods ... (and) government that is accessible,
accountable and responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to see a city where there is local control, where
the residents of the Valley control the government,'' said Richard
Close, chairman of Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment, or
Valley VOTE.
</P>
<P>
   The vision statement, as it is known, was created at the request
of the agency that must study the possible breakup of the city of
Los Angeles. It will be used as the basis for a study by
consultants of the Local Agency Formation Commission on the nuts
and bolts of how secession would work and what its effect would be
on Los Angeles and the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The document - a preliminary version subject to future changes
as the study progresses - is due to be submitted to LAFCO on
Friday. It was released Tuesday and posted on Valley VOTE's Web
site - www.valleyvote.org - for public review and feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Calling secession a ``win-win'' for Valley residents as well as
other parts of Los Angeles, the statement envisions a Valley city
with a proportional share of the city of Los Angeles' departments.
Close said the group's intent is to leave decisions on any major
changes in services up to the new city council and mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But Valley VOTE believes that by having the departments
headquartered in the Valley, with their employees more accessible
to local citizens, the Valley's residents will have a greater say
in decisions that affect their community.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most noticeable changes would be to the city council.
Seven of the Los Angeles City Council's 15 full-time council
members have districts that include at least a portion of the
Valley, including three whose districts are entirely within the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But Valley VOTE's vision statement calls for a Valley city's
council members to be part time, and says they should ``be
compensated fairly but nominally in such a way as to attract people
sincerely interested in serving their community and neighbors, and
not to attract career politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE is working with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg,
D-Van Nuys, to draft legislation that would allow the new city to
have one council member per 100,000 people, or roughly a 13-member
council. That would be more representative, the group said, than
Los Angeles' current council, which represents 3.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, however, said she believes that
full-time council members are necessary because of the many
responsibilities constituents expect of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the sense that at least those communities that I serve
have expected and believe that a full-time city council person
helping to make sure those services are delivered in those
communities is important,'' said Miscikowski, whose mostly Westside
district includes Encino and Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the issue of not attracting career politicians
was already taken care of by the state's voters when they approved
term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan's office declined comment late Tuesday,
saying he had not yet seen the vision statement.
</P>
<P>
   Close said one of the other changes would be to have the new
city try to attract more business to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the parts of the vision statement is the concept of
making the Valley business-friendly, encouraging people to operate
businesses in the Valley, rather than going to Burbank or the San
Gabriel Valley,'' Close said. ``The current business license tax in
Los Angeles is a detriment to the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   The vision statement also seeks to divide the city's services
based on population and geography, depending on which is most
appropriate. It says the Valley has 1.34 million people, or 36
percent of the city's total population, and takes up 222 square
miles, or 47.7 percent of the city's land.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also says that physical assets now belonging to
Los Angeles but located in the Valley, such as buildings, land,
parks, libraries, equipment and vehicles, should remain in the
Valley and become the property of the new city. If the value of
those assets is different than what is calculated as the Valley's
proportional share - based on the 36 percent-of-population
statistic - then an adjustment or credit will be made to make up
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' financial obligations - including debts, pension
benefits and current employee contracts - would also be retained on
a proportional basis by a new Valley city, the document says.
</P>
<P>
   The vision statement argues that the Valley is entitled to its
share of ``independent and proprietary'' departments, ones that
happen to hold considerable assets and revenue sources outside the
Valley, such as the Department of Airports, the Harbor Department,
and the Department of Water and Power. They do not necessarily have
to be split up if an alternative can be reached, the statement
says.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE board members discussed the plan Tuesday night in
closed session. They expect to submit it to LAFCO by Friday.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are the ``angry old men,'' the ``senior
shooters,'' the perpetrators of ``grey rage'' _ call them what you
like.
</P>
<P>
   But in the week that the United States commemorated the first
anniversary of its most murderous school shootings, at Columbine
High School in Colorado, another scourge loomed: it was pensioners
who were toting guns to deadly effect.
</P>
<P>
   A total of four people were killed and nine injured in two
shootings at housing complexes for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   To call them old-age homes would be a misnomer: the first was
Lincoln Park Senior Tower, a high-rise block in a suburb of Detroit
occupied by lower-income pensioners.
</P>
<P>
   The second was on the other side of the country at Ventana Lakes
near Peoria, Ariz., the sort of landscaped complex of detached
houses, tennis courts, swimming pools and clubhouses much favored
by middle- and upper-income Americans when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from geography and economics, however, the two incidents
had much in common.
</P>
<P>
   In Lincoln Park, Ken Miller, 56, was threatened with eviction
after accusations from residents that he used bad language. On
Tuesday, after several warnings, he was called to a meeting with
the administrator to be given notice to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Reports said that he stormed out of the meeting saying: ``You're
not going to assassinate my character and you haven't heard the
last from me.'' He returned later with a rifle, firing at his
accusers and anyone else who got in the way. Two elderly women were
killed and six other people were taken to hospital.
</P>
<P>
   After rampaging through the building, he was found locked in an
apartment, suffering the effects of an overdose of painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   His son said that his father had been adamant that the charges
against him were unfounded and that he was the victim of a
vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   At Ventana Lakes, the pensioner gunman was Richard Glassel, 61,
who had been engaged in something akin to a running battle with the
management on the subject of landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Glassel, fellow residents said, wanted the bushes around his
house to be allowed to grow full and luxuriant. The estate rules,
though, dictated that they be cut back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ordered the landscape committee not to take care of his
yard, and you're not allowed to do that,'' a fellow resident said,
noting that Glassel would have signed up to the rules before he
moved into his house.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Glassel had apparently defaulted on his
mortgage, and the house had been repossessed. But before he left,
he had comprehensively vandalized it inside, sawing the bath and
kitchen cabinets, cutting the wiring, and removing appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said that they had not seen him for months when he
suddenly turned up again last week, stormed into a meeting of the
residents' association and opened fire with a rifle and two
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Two women were killed and three others injured. He was stopped
only when his rifle jammed and half a dozen residents tackled him.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the gunmen were white, suburban and hitherto
law-abiding citizens who seem to have stored up their anger for
years before they finally snapped.
</P>
<P>
   But they were also known to turn to anger quickly and were
viewed by their peers as antisocial misfits _ just like their much
younger counterparts in the rash of school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of firearms made their rage deadly. In both
cases, too, what they were railing against was the pressure applied
by their peers to conform.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, they had signed up to the rules and the majority
clearly complied. But the pettiness of rules that allowed a dirty
joke or a preference for shaggy bushes to be grounds for eviction
is predicated on the communities being completely homogeneous or
run as mini-dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   The trend for Americans, especially older white Americans, to
move into private housing complexes cuts them off from the
diversity of life outside.
</P>
<P>
   Often called ``adult'' communities, these complexes are
restricted by age to the point of excluding all children, except as
very temporary visitors.
</P>
<P>
   They set income requirements that have the effect of excluding
those of a different economic group. And the disparity in life
expectancy means that men find themselves, perhaps for the first
time, in a minority _ and one that is organized and led by women.
</P>
<P>
   For many residents, this is the first time they have ever had
leisure on their hands and they apply the same zeal for
organization to their retirement that they applied to their working
lives.
</P>
<P>
   There are classes and committees and participation is expected.
Space for the loner is limited.
</P>
<P>
   As the baby-boomers start to collect their pensions, simple
demography dictates that there will be more and more angry old men
to vent their resentment. ``Grey rage'' is at hand. &QL;

<P>
   DELHI _ India's most catastrophic drought for a century is
threatening the lives of 50 million people, as a cruel heat wave
scorches the bone-dry earth and has already destroyed farmers'
livestock by the thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Two months before the monsoon is even due, the situation in the
arid northwestern states of Gujarat and Rajasthan is already
critical.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has appealed to the
nation for contributions to alleviate the crisis, ``no matter how
small the amount.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In village after village, hunger stalks men, women and
children,'' he said on Sunday. ``More than 50 million people have
been affected by the drought. They can only stare at the parched
earth and hope that this year the monsoons will not elude them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of cows are dying of starvation while their owners
survive on the brackish, contaminated water of shallow wells. More
than two-thirds of Gujarat's dams and reservoirs are empty, others
have just enough water for a two weeks at most.
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis is not confined to the north of the country.
Other states, including Orissa in the east _ savaged last autumn by
a ``super-cyclone'' that left thousands dead _ and the central
states of Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh are also stricken after
two years of inadequate monsoon rains.
</P>
<P>
   The southern Pakistani provinces of Sindh and Baluchistan have
been badly hit as well.
</P>
<P>
   Summer has arrived in the subcontinent with brutal suddenness
this year, pushing April temperatures some 13 degrees Fahrenheit (7
degrees Celsius) above the average, with the mercury touching 108
degrees (42 degrees Celsius) in Delhi this week.
</P>
<P>
   The scorching heat has suddenly brought the long-feared water
shortage to a head, as wells and aquifers run dry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hundreds of villages struggle to make do with a water
supply that functions for only half an hour every two weeks. The
lucky places get their water for between 15 and 30 minutes on
alternate days.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of thirsty people are resorting to drinking polluted
water, which leaves them with diarrhea and other stomach problems,
sapping their vitality.
</P>
<P>
   This is the desperate face of India that the ``green
revolution'' and a decade of good monsoons persuaded the world to
believe was a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   But wiser heads knew that Internet billionaires and a stock
market that was booming until very recently did not tell the whole
story.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's super-cyclone in the eastern state of Orissa exposed
a familiar story of political and administrative frailty, as
vicious storms lashed the coast, killing thousands.
</P>
<P>
   This year's drought _ provoking a famine, too, across most of
Rajasthan, the foreign tourists' favorite Indian state _ shows up
an equally weary tale of fecklessness and sluggish responses.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Gujarat, the coastal state that produced Mahatma Gandhi,
has roasting, bone-dry summers most years. But this year's drought
is claimed to be its worst in 100 years. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One image from Gujarat tells the story more vividly than words.
In the village of Rajpar, in the scrubby, arid flatlands near the
heart of the drought, there is a single big well on which the
villagers depend.
</P>
<P>
   In Rajpar they get their water the old-fashioned way, throwing
down pots and buckets on ropes and hauling them up full. But now
the water has dwindled to a puddle of liquid faintly discernible
200 feet below ground level.
</P>
<P>
   So a brave volunteer _ usually a woman _ straps a bicycle inner
tube around her waist and the other villagers lower her all the way
down to that enticing spot of liquid. Once she gets to it she fills
the vessels that are thrown down. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 925) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In both Gujarat and Rajasthan, the authorities are resorting to
transporting water by road, in tanker trucks and even by train to
stave off disaster. But given the biblical scale of India's
calamity, these are token gestures.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the drought are being multiplied by a spreading
famine in Rajasthan. Like Gujarat, is a chronically arid state,
whose climatic fragility has been forgotten during the years of
abundant rain. But now the ground realities are becoming too stark
to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Desiccated by a second year of drought, much farmland has given
up the ghost. Many farmers can no longer feed themselves. The
ration shops where they could buy food grains at less than cost
have nothing for sale except paraffin and sugar. So the farmers
must buy what little grain they can afford in the market, at market
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Such a crisis has been anticipated. A Rajasthan state government
``food for work'' scheme offers starving farmers the opportunity of
laboring on government projects in return for food.
</P>
<P>
   There is said to be enough grain stored in government godowns
(warehouses) to keep them afloat. The hitch, horribly familiar in
India: the state awaits the green light from central government.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the impending disaster more rich in ironies than in
the small town of Pokhran in Rajasthan's Thar Desert. India's
nuclear test site lies nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Damage caused two years ago by the nuclear tests that thrust
India (quickly followed by Pakistan) into the ranks of the nuclear
powers brought compensation. In Khetolai village, only less than
three miles from the test site, a primary school has been built;
the Dalits (formerly ``Untouchables'') have even been provided with
a library.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst this improbable plenty, the farmers watch their milk
cattle die: there is neither water nor food to spare for them. The
people, too, go hungry. Only the vultures are glutted. &QL;

is claimed to be its worst in 100 years. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   One image from Gujarat tells the story more vividly than words.
In the village of Rajpar, in the scrubby, arid flatlands near the
heart of the drought, there is a single big well on which the
villagers depend.
</P>
<P>
   In Rajpar they get their water the old-fashioned way, throwing
down pots and buckets on ropes and hauling them up full. But now
the water has dwindled to a puddle of liquid faintly discernible
200 feet below ground level.
</P>
<P>
   So a brave volunteer _ usually a woman _ straps a bicycle inner
tube around her waist and the other villagers lower her all the way
down to that enticing spot of liquid. Once she gets to it she fills
the vessels that are thrown down. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 925) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In both Gujarat and Rajasthan, the authorities are resorting to
transporting water by road, in tanker trucks and even by train to
stave off disaster. But given the biblical scale of India's
calamity, these are token gestures.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the drought are being multiplied by a spreading
famine in Rajasthan. Like Gujarat, is a chronically arid state,
whose climatic fragility has been forgotten during the years of
abundant rain. But now the ground realities are becoming too stark
to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Desiccated by a second year of drought, much farmland has given
up the ghost. Many farmers can no longer feed themselves. The
ration shops where they could buy food grains at less than cost
have nothing for sale except paraffin and sugar. So the farmers
must buy what little grain they can afford in the market, at market
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Such a crisis has been anticipated. A Rajasthan state government
``food for work'' scheme offers starving farmers the opportunity of
laboring on government projects in return for food.
</P>
<P>
   There is said to be enough grain stored in government godowns
(warehouses) to keep them afloat. The hitch, horribly familiar in
India: the state awaits the green light from central government.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the impending disaster more rich in ironies than in
the small town of Pokhran in Rajasthan's Thar Desert. India's
nuclear test site lies nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Damage caused two years ago by the nuclear tests that thrust
India (quickly followed by Pakistan) into the ranks of the nuclear
powers brought compensation. In Khetolai village, only less than
three miles from the test site, a primary school has been built;
the Dalits (formerly ``Untouchables'') have even been provided with
a library.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst this improbable plenty, the farmers watch their milk
cattle die: there is neither water nor food to spare for them. The
people, too, go hungry. Only the vultures are glutted. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jennifer is Jewish, a member of the local, liberal
_ and brave _ little Jewish community in Madison, Wis. She had
helped to arrange my lecture on Iraq and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer mentioned a young Palestinian who always sought her
thoughts and those of her colleagues. Hassan was his name. He
joined us for dinner one night.
</P>
<P>
   It began politely enough. There was a plot, he explained, to
create Israeli hegemony over the West Bank. He had read that Yassir
Arafat's father had been involved in land deals in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to know the truth?'' he suddenly asked. ``Arafat
is a Jew. It is the Israelis who put him there.'' Jennifer groaned.
Who could blame her?
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, in Boston, I spoke at a conference on the
``Right of Return'' of Palestinians to go back to their homes in
pre-Israel Palestine, enshrined _ for the Palestinians _ in U.N.
General Assembly Resolution 194.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Said, the greatest and most courageous Arab scholar,
spoke for 45 minutes. But he was terribly ill _ his leukemia is
taking dreadful hold _ and the organizers hadn't bothered to put
his slides in the right order.
</P>
<P>
   I watched Said, obviously in great pain, angrily demanding to
know why his lecture illustrations could not be shown correctly,
his fury tangled up with his denunciations of Jewish settlement
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Noam Chomsky, the Greatest American Liberal of them all,
linguist, philosopher, activist, excoriator of U.S. governments
from Kennedy to Clinton _ and thus of course deprived of a regular
column in the American press _ spoke with passion of the injustices
visited upon the Palestinians, the worthlessness of the Middle East
``peace process'' and America's total control over the region.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the audience were talking to each other. When Jabour
Sleiman droned on about the ``Bantustan'' of the West Bank, the
Arabs read newspapers and pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   When I told the audience that I thought they were out of touch
with the realities of the Middle East, that their lobby groups were
self-satisfied and often lazy, there was uproar in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be so sarcastic,'' one young man shouted at me. Arabs
cannot _ must not _ be criticized.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before setting off for the United States, I walked
again through the ruins of the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian
refugee camp in Beirut in which up to 2,000 civilians were
massacred by Israel's Lebanese Christian allies in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   I've been there perhaps a hundred times since the slaughter. And
the place never ceases to horrify me; the football-size rats that
plunge through the garbage heaps, the mass grave used as a trash
dump, the concrete huts containing the survivors and their
memories, the stench of sewers.
</P>
<P>
   If I lived there, I always think, I'd go mad.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston, the conference organizers saw fit to offer drinks
in the Harvard Faculty Club, a place of fine wines, oil paintings,
expensive carpets and attentive waiters.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that a young, highly educated Palestinian told me
she had never been to Palestine because she had young children and
``travelling with children is not pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   And she compared a journey to Palestine with her recent family
expedition to Disney World. ``Can you imagine,'' she asked me,
``travelling to Palestine with children?'' So much, I thought, for
the Right of Return.
</P>
<P>
   Lecturing about the Middle East on the American East Coast is
always a bizarre experience: from the heat and danger of Lebanon to
the trillion dollar economy of the world's only superpower with its
lobby groups and its policy analysis institutes and its chic little
dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   There is no end to WASP do-gooders, anxious to make up for their
sins in power. Take the ex-State Department man who piped up at the
end of a Washington talk I gave on Palestinians in Lebanon. ``You
shouldn't blame the State Department so much, Bob,'' he said.
``They don't make policy. The Near East Department's job is to put
a gloss on things.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience did not gasp with astonishment. They merely asked
safe questions which used the language of the State Department _
about the ``peace process,'' whether it could be put ``back on
track,'' whether U.S. ``leverage'' _ one of the great Middle East
myths _ might be applied to, of all countries, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   No one asked where this language _ process, track, leverage _
comes from. Even Said and Chomsky used it, albeit with cynicism. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Georgetown, after I had spoken of the dangers of a war in
southern Lebanon this spring, I was pursued by a pleasant American
lady who offered me copies of the Arab Studies Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Securitization Toward Consociation?'' one article was
entitled (this about the PLO and Islamism) and ``Contending with
Middle East Exceptionalism.'' Tell that to the people of Sabra and
Chatila, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe had greeted the Said/Chomsky-led conference
with an editorial which told us that Palestinian refugees were not
refugees at all _ they were ``displaced.'' Again, say that in Sabra
and Chatila.
</P>
<P>
   And I was asked _ mercifully in vain _ to talk about ``Arab
Regional Positions on the Palestinian Right of Return,'' as if Arab
states had ever formulated a policy on the one issue which lies at
the center of the 3.6 million Palestinian diaspora. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 150-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, just before I spoke to an audience of
ex-ambassadors and liberal-left Americans, I found an anonymous
letter on my seat.
</P>
<P>
   It was from an Arab-American who complained bitterly about the
lack of democracy in her lobby group. ``The President makes all the
decisions, often without even consulting the board... the board
members are too afraid or lazy to question the president's words,''
she wrote. ``...it is a weakness of character and a gross deference
to those in power.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded to me like a typical Arab regime _ despite the
U.S. pressure group's bylaws which are supposed to ensure democracy
within the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder, I asked myself, that the Arabs lose the Middle
East war of words? That American liberals fail to understand the
real dangers of their hopelessly biased policy in the region?
</P>
<P>
   Or that America and the Sabra and Chatila refugee camp are a
million miles apart? &QL;

plunge through the garbage heaps, the mass grave used as a trash
dump, the concrete huts containing the survivors and their
memories, the stench of sewers.
</P>
<P>
   If I lived there, I always think, I'd go mad.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston, the conference organizers saw fit to offer drinks
in the Harvard Faculty Club, a place of fine wines, oil paintings,
expensive carpets and attentive waiters.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that a young, highly educated Palestinian told me
she had never been to Palestine because she had young children and
``travelling with children is not pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   And she compared a journey to Palestine with her recent family
expedition to Disney World. ``Can you imagine,'' she asked me,
``travelling to Palestine with children?'' So much, I thought, for
the Right of Return.
</P>
<P>
   Lecturing about the Middle East on the American East Coast is
always a bizarre experience: from the heat and danger of Lebanon to
the trillion dollar economy of the world's only superpower with its
lobby groups and its policy analysis institutes and its chic little
dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   There is no end to WASP do-gooders, anxious to make up for their
sins in power. Take the ex-State Department man who piped up at the
end of a Washington talk I gave on Palestinians in Lebanon. ``You
shouldn't blame the State Department so much, Bob,'' he said.
``They don't make policy. The Near East Department's job is to put
a gloss on things.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience did not gasp with astonishment. They merely asked
safe questions which used the language of the State Department _
about the ``peace process,'' whether it could be put ``back on
track,'' whether U.S. ``leverage'' _ one of the great Middle East
myths _ might be applied to, of all countries, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   No one asked where this language _ process, track, leverage _
comes from. Even Said and Chomsky used it, albeit with cynicism. &QL;

   At Georgetown, after I had spoken of the dangers of a war in
southern Lebanon this spring, I was pursued by a pleasant American
lady who offered me copies of the Arab Studies Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Securitization Toward Consociation?'' one article was
entitled (this about the PLO and Islamism) and ``Contending with
Middle East Exceptionalism.'' Tell that to the people of Sabra and
Chatila, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe had greeted the Said/Chomsky-led conference
with an editorial which told us that Palestinian refugees were not
refugees at all _ they were ``displaced.'' Again, say that in Sabra
and Chatila.
</P>
<P>
   And I was asked _ mercifully in vain _ to talk about ``Arab
Regional Positions on the Palestinian Right of Return,'' as if Arab
states had ever formulated a policy on the one issue which lies at
the center of the 3.6 million Palestinian diaspora. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In Washington, just before I spoke to an audience of
ex-ambassadors and liberal-left Americans, I found an anonymous
letter on my seat.
</P>
<P>
   It was from an Arab-American who complained bitterly about the
lack of democracy in her lobby group. ``The President makes all the
decisions, often without even consulting the board... the board
members are too afraid or lazy to question the president's words,''
she wrote. ``...it is a weakness of character and a gross deference
to those in power.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded to me like a typical Arab regime _ despite the
U.S. pressure group's bylaws which are supposed to ensure democracy
within the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder, I asked myself, that the Arabs lose the Middle
East war of words? That American liberals fail to understand the
real dangers of their hopelessly biased policy in the region?
</P>
<P>
   Or that America and the Sabra and Chatila refugee camp are a
million miles apart? &QL;

ANGELS PROVIDE CURE FOR TIGERS' TROUBLES

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Hard to say which needed the boost the most,
Nomomania or the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Where there used to be as many as four dozen media members
chasing down everything Hideo Nomo said, threw, ate or drank, now
there is one. And that fellow splits his time with one or two other
Japanese players in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers?
</P>
<P>
   They haven't been deserving of that much attention.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday night at Edison Field, where Nomo bedeviled the
Anaheim Angels with his now-familiar twisting, deceptive style, and
the Tigers ended their agonizing losing streak at eight games with
a 4-2 victory before 17,086 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked beforehand what he hoped to get out of Nomo, Detroit
manager Phil Garner went for it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shutout,'' he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of a stretch. Nomo's last shutout was his no-hitter, the
one he pitched for the Dodgers at Denver's Coors Field on Sept. 17,
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm looking for,'' Garner added, smiling, ``is a savior.
I might even bat him fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   Garner didn't bat Nomo fourth and he didn't get the shutout he
wanted, either. What he did get was the Tigers' best-pitched game
since . . . well, since Nomo blanked Seattle for six innings two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo didn't get the win. That went to reliever Jim Poole (1-0),
who replaced Nomo in the seventh, then benefited when the Tigers
broke a 2-2 tie in the top of the eighth on a two-out, run-scoring
single by Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   But Nomo did what nobody else on the Tigers' staff has been able
to do lately: He kept them in the game.
</P>
<P>
   During the Tigers' eight-game losing streak, they'd allowed the
staggering sum of at least seven runs in each loss. Not on this
night. The Angels managed just eight hits off Nomo and three
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' Ken Bottenfield (1-3) pitched well enough,
scattering eight hits over 7 innings, the longest he's gone this
year. But one was a homer by Damion Easley, who was activated from
the disabled list just before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers jumped on Bottenfield immediately, their first three
batters _ Luis Polonia, Brad Ausmus and Juan Encarnacion _
stringing together a double and two singles for a run. It was just
the third time all season the Tigers managed three successive hits,
but the second time in as many nights.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-0 lead lasted until the third. Nomo had whistled through
the first five batters, then walked two in the second but escaped
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Darin Erstad, who had three of the Angels' hits to
jump his major-league-leading average to .465, lined a one-out
single over Easley's glove at second, the Angels' first hit. And
Adam Kennedy (Cal State Northridge) followed with a drive into the
seats beyond the right-field scoreboard, his second homer, for a
2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels went on to load the bases on singles by Mo Vaughn and
Tim Salmon and a two-out walk to Troy Glaus. Nomo's immediate
future was clearly shaky, but the Angels couldn't apply the
knockout punch. Nomo escaped by striking out Scott Spiezio, who had
slugged two home runs the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, meantime, got out of the first-inning jam OK, and
he held the Tigers hitless the next three innings, at one point
retiring nine consecutive batters. Then, with one out in the fifth,
Easley homered into the bullpen in left. It was his first homer of
the season _ and only his third hit _ and it tied the score 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers broke the tie in the top of the eighth. A throwing
error by shortstop Benji Gil, one of his two errors, a one-out walk
to Encarnacion and a two-out single to center by Higginson _ who
had been 0 for 10 in his career against Bottenfield _ nudged the
Tigers in front, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   It also finished Bottenfield, who clearly rebounded well from
his previous start: nine earned runs in 3 innings in a 12-11 loss
at Toronto last Thursday. Bottenfield worked 7 innings, the longest
of his five starts so far, and was charged with three runs, only
two of which were earned.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers added an unearned run in the top of the ninth, and
the Angels supplied some drama in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Erstad beat out an infield single to short, then
Kennedy walked. But closer Todd Jones ended it by getting Vaughn on
a fly to deep center.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jennifer is Jewish, a member of the local, liberal
_ and brave _ little Jewish community in Madison, Wis. She had
helped to arrange my lecture on Iraq and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer mentioned a young Palestinian who always sought her
thoughts and those of her colleagues. Hassan was his name. He
joined us for dinner one night.
</P>
<P>
   It began politely enough. There was a plot, he explained, to
create Israeli hegemony over the West Bank. He had read that Yassir
Arafat's father had been involved in land deals in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to know the truth?'' he suddenly asked. ``Arafat
is a Jew. It is the Israelis who put him there.'' Jennifer groaned.
Who could blame her?
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, in Boston, I spoke at a conference on the
``Right of Return'' of Palestinians to go back to their homes in
pre-Israel Palestine, enshrined _ for the Palestinians _ in U.N.
General Assembly Resolution 194.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Said, the greatest and most courageous Arab scholar,
spoke for 45 minutes. But he was terribly ill _ his leukemia is
taking dreadful hold _ and the organizers hadn't bothered to put
his slides in the right order.
</P>
<P>
   I watched Said, obviously in great pain, angrily demanding to
know why his lecture illustrations could not be shown correctly,
his fury tangled up with his denunciations of Jewish settlement
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Noam Chomsky, the Greatest American Liberal of them all,
linguist, philosopher, activist, excoriator of U.S. governments
from Kennedy to Clinton _ and thus of course deprived of a regular
column in the American press _ spoke with passion of the injustices
visited upon the Palestinians, the worthlessness of the Middle East
``peace process'' and America's total control over the region.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the audience were talking to each other. When Jabour
Sleiman droned on about the ``Bantustan'' of the West Bank, the
Arabs read newspapers and pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   When I told the audience that I thought they were out of touch
with the realities of the Middle East, that their lobby groups were
self-satisfied and often lazy, there was uproar in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be so sarcastic,'' one young man shouted at me. Arabs
cannot _ must not _ be criticized.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before setting off for the United States, I walked
again through the ruins of the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian
refugee camp in Beirut in which up to 2,000 civilians were
massacred by Israel's Lebanese Christian allies in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   I've been there perhaps a hundred times since the slaughter. And
the place never ceases to horrify me; the football-size rats that
plunge through the garbage heaps, the mass grave used as a trash
dump, the concrete huts containing the survivors and their
memories, the stench of sewers.
</P>
<P>
   If I lived there, I always think, I'd go mad.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston, the conference organizers saw fit to offer drinks
in the Harvard Faculty Club, a place of fine wines, oil paintings,
expensive carpets and attentive waiters.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that a young, highly educated Palestinian told me

   America's famous ``new economy'' promised rapid growth without
inflation. Yet its inflation rate is now the highest of any big
rich economy. No wonder share prices tumbled when the latest
figures were published on April 14. Those who have, over the past
few years, made much of America's Goldilocks economy (neither too
hot, nor too cold) should have remembered that the tale ends with
Goldilocks being chased away by the bears. &QL;

   As the Elian Gonzalez soap opera drags on daily, Miami's Cuban

not deal with Cuba while Fidel Castro is in power. He is the devil,

Economist yields to nobody when it comes to contempt for Castro,
but to use Elian for propaganda purposes, as the exiles now are, is
exactly the tactic Castro would choose. He is getting enormous
mileage out of this case. It shows, even better than the trade
embargo can, how vindictive and inhumane the United States can be. &QL;

people being beaten and shot there are white? Frankly, yes. There
is no other honest answer. Yet outsiders are right to be concerned

   The rest of the Americas celebrated, or mourned, their
``discovery'' by Europeans back in 1992, the quincentenary of
Columbus's landfall. But that meant little to Brazil. Its discovery
by the Portuguese came eight years later, on April 22, 1500, and by
accident, when a fleet bound for India was blown off course.
Brazilians mark that event this weekend, amid much soul-searching
about what makes them unique. After 500 years, it is now high time
for South America's giant to shake off its lingering inferiority
complex. &QL;

   One of the issues on which Al Gore expects to trounce George W.
Bush this election year is the environment. Understandably so. The
vice president's reputation as somebody who cares deeply, really
deeply, about the planet is well known. On the evidence of his 1992
book-manifesto, ``Earth in the Balance,'' whose second edition
arrives in bookstores this weekend to coincide with ``Earth Day
2000,'' Gore is, in fact, a hypocrite of heroic proportions. His
description of the environmental ``crisis,'' and his way of
thinking about it, could not be more extreme. Is Gore's expounded
hot air contributing to global warming? &QL;

   Fresh on the heels of Vladimir Putin's election last month as
Russia's new president, the American government has wasted no time
in asserting its interests in the oil-rich region of the ex-Soviet

Director Louis Freeh and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ to

   America's famous ``new economy'' promised rapid growth without
inflation. Yet its inflation rate is now the highest of any big
rich economy. No wonder share prices tumbled when the latest
figures were published on April 14. Those who have, over the past
few years, made much of America's Goldilocks economy (neither too
hot, nor too cold) should have remembered that the tale ends with
Goldilocks being chased away by the bears. &QL;

   As the Elian Gonzalez soap opera drags on daily, Miami's Cuban
exiles are increasingly, utterly immovable on one point: they will
not deal with Cuba while Fidel Castro is in power. He is the devil,
and six-year-old Elian their saint. How misguided they are. The
Economist yields to nobody when it comes to contempt for Castro,
but to use Elian for propaganda purposes, as the exiles now are, is
exactly the tactic Castro would choose. He is getting enormous
mileage out of this case. It shows, even better than the trade
embargo can, how vindictive and inhumane the United States can be. &QL;

   Is the western world's concern about the deteriorating turn of
events in Zimbabwe just a reflection of the fact that some of the
people being beaten and shot there are white? Frankly, yes. There
is no other honest answer. Yet outsiders are right to be concerned
about Zimbabwe, not least because what happens there will have a
profound effect upon what happens in other parts of Africa, and
therefore upon all Africans, black and white. &QL;

   The rest of the Americas celebrated, or mourned, their
``discovery'' by Europeans back in 1992, the quincentenary of
Columbus's landfall. But that meant little to Brazil. Its discovery
by the Portuguese came eight years later, on April 22, 1500, and by
accident, when a fleet bound for India was blown off course.
Brazilians mark that event this weekend, amid much soul-searching
about what makes them unique. After 500 years, it is now high time
for South America's giant to shake off its lingering inferiority
complex. &QL;

   One of the issues on which Al Gore expects to trounce George W.
Bush this election year is the environment. Understandably so. The
vice president's reputation as somebody who cares deeply, really
deeply, about the planet is well known. On the evidence of his 1992
book-manifesto, ``Earth in the Balance,'' whose second edition
arrives in bookstores this weekend to coincide with ``Earth Day
2000,'' Gore is, in fact, a hypocrite of heroic proportions. His
description of the environmental ``crisis,'' and his way of
thinking about it, could not be more extreme. Is Gore's expounded
hot air contributing to global warming? &QL;

ZAMBRANO HAS PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how tough it was to coach in Los Angeles, former
Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano remained a cool character, his Armani
suits always perfectly tailored, his hair as slick as another
former L.A. sports personality, Pat Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Life in New York, however, has caused a few of Zambrano's hairs
to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I accepted this job, I knew it wouldn't be easy,'' said
Zambrano. ``Let's face it, we have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Zambrano was run out of town because Galaxy management
felt he had a problem communicating with players, not because of
his coaching. Zambrano left the Galaxy with the best winning
percentage (39-18, .684) in Major League Soccer, but without an MLS
championship in two playoff appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Now Zambrano has the toughest task of all, rebuilding the New
York/New Jersey MetroStars, a laughingstock in New York since its
inaugural season and a team with a famous malcontent, Germany's
Lothar Matthaeus.
</P>
<P>
   If communication was a problem here, it's nothing compared to
what's happening in the Big Apple, where Zambrano finally got some
relief in a 3-2 overtime victory against MLS champion Washington
D.C. United over the weekend to improve the MetroStars record to
2-4.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the MetroStars dropped to 1-4 after losing to
Kansas City, causing an uproar in the lockerroom afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA has a team like us. It's called the Clippers,'' said
MetroStars goalkeeper Mike Ammann. ``Now I know what it's like to
play for them. You can't teach someone something if they don't have
a brain.
</P>
<P>
   Ammann was just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it matters who we play, it makes no
difference,'' he said. ``We don't come to play. We could play the
worst team in the league. We'd lose to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always angry when we lose,'' added Matthaeus. ``This is
not teamwork. And I say communication is very important when you
have a team. We have no communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments by Ammann, Matthaeus and others have caused
Zambrano to take notice. He says maybe years of losing has affected
some of his players, admitting some of them need to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not realize the power of those statements well,'' said
Zambrano. ``I thought that these guys could put the past behind
them, but for some of them it's too hard to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why sometimes change is good, not because they are bad
players, but because they have been through so much, they can't
walk out at Giants Stadium loose and fluid. They think about the
pressure of playing in New York and that works against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say for the first time I see this with my own eyes and
that some of these players need a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning the MetroStars around may take a while. Defender Thomas
Dooley and midfielder Tab Ramos are still out with injuries, plus
New York has a losing reputation (52-82 overall), which is tough to
change overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that we have to change the
character and we have to bring an attitude that is much more a
winning attitude,'' said Zambrano. ``I think our guys are
shell-shocked in some ways from all the things that have happened
in the past and I don't think they can come out of it just by me
talking or just by training well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind you, I tell you that and I also tell you that I don't
think these guys are such bad players. It's just that they are not
able to perform here. They cannot withstand the pressures that come
with playing in New York. That can happen. We need to have players
with the kind of character that can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano admits his patience has been tested by Matthaeus. He
said everyone knew the world's all-time national team appearance
leader would be the first to lash out if the team started losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand his (Matthaeus) frustration because I'm
frustrated as well,'' said Zambrano. ``He was forewarned when he
went (here) that this was going to be a difficult situation. So
it's not like right now he can say, `Well, I didn't know.' This was
pretty much spelled out to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Matthaeus ever be benched for his behavior? He threw his
captain's band at a linesman during the Kansas City match.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he will play for this team; I won't bench him,'' said
Zambrano. ``I don't think that this is an issue where I'm going to
try to teach Lothar Matthaeus a lesson by benching him. He's a
quality player and I believe could be a very important factor for
our rebuilding, but that is obviously whether he wants to perform
that role or not. That's what it comes down to.'' &QL;

   MELBOURNE _ Twenty-five years after the fall of South Vietnam to
the Communists, and the ignominious American flight from Saigon,
the fear that other non-Communist countries in Southeast Asia would
topple like a row of dominoes seems farfetched.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Communist-ruled Vietnam and Laos have joined the
Association of South-East Asian Nations, the group of non-Communist
countries that they previously castigated and threatened to
subvert.
</P>
<P>
   But what would have happened if U.S. President Lyndon Johnson,
faced with the awful choice of opting in or out of Vietnam so early
in his presidency, had elected not to fight?
</P>
<P>
   Soon after dawn on Aug. 17, 1964, a crowd began gathering in
Merdeka Square outside the gleaming white presidential palace in
the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, when President Sukarno, the self-styled Great
Leader of the Revolution, mounted the podium to deliver his annual
independence day address, the crowd had grown to a million.
</P>
<P>
   Sukarno once said that to intoxicate the masses was what he
lived for. Never before had he succeeded so well, and never would
he again. His address, interrupted by frequent applause, took three
hours to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The fiery leader called 1964 ``A Year of Living Dangerously,'' a
title that was both apt at the time and prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours earlier, Indonesia had landed 50 guerrillas on
the west coast of the Malayan peninsula, striking for the first
time against the heartland of Malaysia, which then included
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Sukarno was launching an armed ``confrontation'' against what he
claimed was a British-sponsored neocolonial federation. Three weeks
later the air force followed with an airdrop of paratroops into
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed in the media by events in Vietnam, the southern
tier of Southeast Asia came close to war.
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet Union and China had become bitter rivals,
Sukarno and the Indonesian Communist Party, with its 3 million
members and 10 million sympathizers, turned to China and received a
warm response.
</P>
<P>
   A month after Sukarno proclaimed the year of living dangerously,
the People's Daily in Beijing, speaking for the Chinese Communist
Party, linked the Malaysian and Vietnam crises as joint struggles
against U.S. imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival in Jakarta of Marshal Chen Yi, the Chinese foreign
minister, in October 1964, marked the start of violent
anti-American demonstrations in Indonesia. These were followed by
the establishment of what became known as a Beijing-Jakarta axis.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia walked out of the United Nations and formed an
alliance with China to make Jakarta the world center of
anti-imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta warned that if Britain, which had substantial military
forces in Malaysia, attacked Indonesia during its confrontation
with Malaysia, Chinese forces would intervene directly while
Beijing stirred up revolutionary elements in other parts of
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai arrived in Jakarta in April
1965 to advise Sukarno to create a ``people's army'' outside the
control of the regular army, which remained anti-Communist although
it was being infiltrated by leftists.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of weapons, shipped in from China as building equipment,
were distributed to Communist youth and women's units in Indonesia.
Communists took control of Antara, the official Indonesian news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of troops moved into eastern Sumatra, posing a
threat to the west coast of the Malayan peninsula. In Kalimantan,
the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo, some 15 battalions
took up positions close to the Malaysian states of Sabah and
Sarawak.
</P>
<P>
   All of this occurred when the situation in South Vietnam was
deteriorating rapidly. The Vietcong had become strong enough to
mount terror attacks in the heart of Saigon. They were also
threatening to cut South Vietnam in two. Regular North Vietnamese
forces were for the first time moving into the South.
</P>
<P>
   Without heavy American intervention, the war in Vietnam was
lost. Washington had two options: It could bow in massively or bow
out. President Johnson decided to intensify U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Jakarta, only the generals stood in the path of vigorous
pursuit of the revolution that Sukarno demanded. In a speech on the
night of Sept. 30, 1965, he called for those military leaders to be
crushed. That night six generals were killed in an attempted coup
in which the Communists were deeply involved.
</P>
<P>
   General Suharto, who led the successful countercoup, was
fortuitously left off the death list prepared by the coup planners.
He quickly took control.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia went into reverse gear. The Beijing-Jakarta axis
collapsed, and ``confrontation'' with Malaysia ended. Tens of
thousands of Communists were massacred and the party was banned.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly relations were re-established with the United States,
and Indonesia joined Malaysia and Singapore in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Marshall Green, the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia at
this tumultuous time, wrote that a ``successful Sino-Indonesian
alliance would have created a great Communist pincer in Southeast
Asia, with the largest and fifth largest countries in the world
enclosing not only Vietnam but also the vulnerable countries of
mainland Southeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States had withdrawn from Vietnam before the
attempted Indonesian coup, the effect would have been to strengthen
Sukarno's pro-Communist stance and his determination, with Chinese
backing, to crush Malaysia. It would have undermined the will and
means of the Indonesian generals to resist the Communist takeover.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the late Indonesian foreign minister Adam Malik,
who became vice president under General Suharto, if the attempted
coup against the Indonesian generals had not taken place, Sukarno
would soon have presided over a Communist Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of Southeast Asia the situation was precarious. Laos
was all but in Communist hands. In Cambodia, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk had decided that Hanoi would win in Vietnam and had thrown
in his lot with China. Thailand faced a Beijing-sponsored war of
national liberation. And across the Strait of Malacca from
Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia had separated bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely then that Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand,
caught in the pincers that Green referred to, would not have
survived the pressure. The dominoes would have fallen. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-five years ago, on April 17, 1975, I was in
Phnom Penh. It was a city that had been under siege for months, a
place of fear and desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Khmer Rouge rockets rained down daily, bringing random death,
injury and destruction. The population had been swollen to 3
million, mainly by people fleeing the war-torn countryside.
</P>
<P>
   We were warned that Phnom Penh's defenses could not hold out
much longer. I remember hearing a Voice of America radio broadcast
in which President Gerald Ford warned Congress in a somber tone
that the situation in both Cambodia and South Vietnam had reached a
critical phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The options before us are few and time is very short,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I was working as a Cambodian staff member of the American aid
agency CARE. I had my chance to leave Phnom Penh. In the early
morning of April 12, a U.S. Embassy official told me that I had to
get to the embassy within an hour if I wanted to be evacuated from
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   The American staff of CARE had gone, leaving the management of
its multimillion dollar program in our hands. My mind was on the
plight of more than 3,000 refugee families in the provincial town
of Kampong Speu.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Khmer Rouge tightened their noose around Phnom Penh,
we had been able to arrange trucks to carry food and medical
supplies to these refugees. Now the road had been cut and I was
preoccupied with a meeting that morning to finalize an airlift of
supplies instead.
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting ended, I suddenly realized that I was running
late for the rendezvous at the U.S. Embassy. I arrived just in time
to see the last of the evacuation helicopters taking off. There was
no other way out. I was trapped, like everyone else in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   People prayed that the Cambodian New Year that started the
following day would turn a fresh page in Cambodia's recently
tormented history. We knew that the war would soon be over. But we
did not know whether its end would bring peace or more death and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, Khmer Rouge soldiers clad in black pajamas and
carrying AK-47 assault rifles walked into the city. Many were just
teenagers. People thought that between Cambodians we could work
things out.
</P>
<P>
   I went to one of the city's main hotels, where the Red Cross had
set up a neutral zone. I spent the day helping its staff in the
emergency room in one of the bungalows. Later that afternoon the
Khmer Rouge ordered the entire city emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Our family group of 16 left that night along with thousands of
others. Imagine 3 million people trying to get out of the city.
Among the forced evacuees were huge numbers of women, children,
elderly and infirm _ even thousands of hospital patients, many
seriously ill or maimed.
</P>
<P>
   This forced march was desperately slow. It took us 10 days to
get to Tonle Bati, usually reached from Phnom Penh in an hour. This
was just the beginning of the Killing Fields.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, also fell to
the communists.
</P>
<P>
   The next 10 months were a time of unimaginable horror in
Cambodia. I managed to survive by disguising my identity and slowly
working my way westwards towards the border with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1976, I crossed into Thailand, joining other
Cambodians in refugee camps there. Later, I was taken to America.
But of the 16 members of my family, I was the only one to make it
to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Have Cambodia and Vietnam learned any lessons from this terrible
period?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alliance between the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese
communists during the years of the war in Indochina, both countries
underwent internal purges and fought against each other. The
conflict resulted in a 10-year occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Cambodia and Vietnam have mended their relations.
Both are now members of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, and espouse market economics. Both have relative stability
and considerable economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Vietnam's communist rule and its inability to end corruption
and bureaucratic red tape scare away many investors. Cambodia, too,
has governance problems. Yet even its less-than-fair elections have
awakened the population to the importance of having their voices
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cambodia and Vietnam must accept the bright light of
accountability and transparency before they can enjoy the full
benefits of democratic prosperity _ and be sure that the dark
period of their recent history is never repeated. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

   I was working as a Cambodian staff member of the American aid
agency CARE. I had my chance to leave Phnom Penh. In the early
morning of April 12, a U.S. Embassy official told me that I had to
get to the embassy within an hour if I wanted to be evacuated from
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   The American staff of CARE had gone, leaving the management of
its multimillion dollar program in our hands. My mind was on the
plight of more than 3,000 refugee families in the provincial town
of Kampong Speu.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Khmer Rouge tightened their noose around Phnom Penh,
we had been able to arrange trucks to carry food and medical
supplies to these refugees. Now the road had been cut and I was
preoccupied with a meeting that morning to finalize an airlift of
supplies instead.
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting ended, I suddenly realized that I was running
late for the rendezvous at the U.S. Embassy. I arrived just in time
to see the last of the evacuation helicopters taking off. There was
no other way out. I was trapped, like everyone else in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   People prayed that the Cambodian New Year that started the
following day would turn a fresh page in Cambodia's recently
tormented history. We knew that the war would soon be over. But we
did not know whether its end would bring peace or more death and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, Khmer Rouge soldiers clad in black pajamas and
carrying AK-47 assault rifles walked into the city. Many were just
teenagers. People thought that between Cambodians we could work
things out.
</P>
<P>
   I went to one of the city's main hotels, where the Red Cross had
set up a neutral zone. I spent the day helping its staff in the
emergency room in one of the bungalows. Later that afternoon the
Khmer Rouge ordered the entire city emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Our family group of 16 left that night along with thousands of
others. Imagine 3 million people trying to get out of the city.
Among the forced evacuees were huge numbers of women, children,
elderly and infirm _ even thousands of hospital patients, many
seriously ill or maimed.
</P>
<P>
   This forced march was desperately slow. It took us 10 days to
get to Tonle Bati, usually reached from Phnom Penh in an hour. This
was just the beginning of the Killing Fields.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, also fell to
the communists.
</P>
<P>
   The next 10 months were a time of unimaginable horror in
Cambodia. I managed to survive by disguising my identity and slowly
working my way westwards towards the border with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1976, I crossed into Thailand, joining other
Cambodians in refugee camps there. Later, I was taken to America.
But of the 16 members of my family, I was the only one to make it
to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Have Cambodia and Vietnam learned any lessons from this terrible
period?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alliance between the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese
communists during the years of the war in Indochina, both countries
underwent internal purges and fought against each other. The
conflict resulted in a 10-year occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Cambodia and Vietnam have mended their relations.
Both are now members of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, and espouse market economics. Both have relative stability
and considerable economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Vietnam's communist rule and its inability to end corruption
and bureaucratic red tape scare away many investors. Cambodia, too,
has governance problems. Yet even its less-than-fair elections have
awakened the population to the importance of having their voices
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cambodia and Vietnam must accept the bright light of
accountability and transparency before they can enjoy the full
benefits of democratic prosperity _ and be sure that the dark
period of their recent history is never repeated. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ I was overlooking The City. The executive dining room
was on the top floor of one of the world's foremost investment
banks.
</P>
<P>
   As the co-head of a small Internet start-up, I had a certain
sense of accomplishment. A feeling that the playing field had been
leveled. That the small could triumph and reach the heights. And
that the view was pretty nice from up here.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, I was having lunch with a moderately interesting
banker. And I'd gotten up at 5 a.m. to catch the Eurostar from
Paris _ in second-class, of course, no exchanges. And my daughter
had a bit of a cold the night before, and I was wondering if she
had made it to school.
</P>
<P>
   I was here for the clincher in a series of deals I had been
working on. All of which I had signed. I was pretty pleased with
myself. Pleased with my reflection in the eyes of these staid
businessmen who so obviously appreciated the energy and youthful
dynamism coming through their door with my new-economy label and my
trendy, Internet shoes. (Of course, it's not hard to look
fashionable in a British bank.)
</P>
<P>
   But after a year of frenetic travel, 150 e-mails per day, not a
single penny in the bank and a still-distant prospect of any form
of relief, I had to ask myself: Why am I doing this?
</P>
<P>
   Is it really going to work? All this stock is valuable only on
paper. Even that depends on the day. Am I not a little old to spend
precious mid-career years on something that may not pan out?
</P>
<P>
   My daughter turned 3 when I signed on to be co-director of an
Internet start-up. She will shortly be 4. I have not seen much of
her fourth year. How do I calculate what I have earned? How do I
measure what I have lost?
</P>
<P>
   I have begun to admit and accept my split personality. I am too
much of a mom.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I am ambitious and like to wield influence. Yes, my kids
drive me crazy if I spend more than a day with them both. Yes, I
would like to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   No, I cannot stand missing the moments when my 3-year-old
snuggles into the body she came from. Or laughing uproariously at
my son's apprenticeship with irony.
</P>
<P>
   I will not drop out completely, of course. But I will have to
accept my new self-imposed limits.
</P>
<P>
   Not Director of an Internet Start-Up, plus Chair of that
Professional Women's Network, plus that one-day-a-week commitment
to career counseling at my old business school. Plus mom of two and
wife of one (who definitely gets the short end of the stick). Plus,
plus, plus.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to grow up and learn to say that
incomprehensibly rare word: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not, like many friends, want a huge house that takes as
much time as a job in renovations, decoration and lawn supervision.
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want to earn sudden millions. (Did anyone in
business school ever calculate the opportunity cost of cash?)
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want to talk about my company at every single
dinner party we go to.
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want never to have dinner parties anymore because I
do not have the time or the energy.
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want weekends to become a hermit existence
(interspersed with bouts of e-mail) in an effort to prepare for the
next week's high-paced onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   I want time. Time to get down on the floor and make puzzles with
my 3-year-old without thinking simultaneously of the 43 things I
should have added to my Palm Pilot's ``To Do'' List.
</P>
<P>
   Time to listen to my son's quasi-endless chatter and see in its
evolution his growing sense of himself and of the world.
</P>
<P>
   I want time to talk to my friends on the phone, to organize long
and leisurely dinners animated by conversation nourished by the
plays and films and friends we have recently seen.
</P>
<P>
   I bumped into a neighbor of mine at the market recently (the
first time I have been there this year). She asked about my
venture, as one of my most admiring fans. I told her I was slowing
down. She was consternated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to see more of my kids,'' I said. And her face broke
into a delighted smile. ``You are so smart _ and so wise,'' she
said. ``I have a photo of my son when he was 3. At that time, I was
running around like crazy, not paying attention. Then the time flew
by so fast. He's grown and gone now. Whenever I look at that photo,
I cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking to school in the morning with a small hand clasped
contentedly in mine, I have to admit it is not the boardroom. It is
much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   You need time to fully grasp what you are missing. So I will
walk the talk, making decisions that resonate with my soul. And
tell my ego that life is long _ childhood short.
</P>
<P>
   I have spent years writing and reading about shareholder value.
The new-economy guys have stock options downloading into their
dreams. But last week, I picked up my 7-year-old son after school
for the first time in a year. Delight chased incredulity off his
face. And that's when I knew that my stock had finally gone up. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

   Walking to school in the morning with a small hand clasped
contentedly in mine, I have to admit it is not the boardroom. It is
much more valuable.

walk the talk, making decisions that resonate with my soul. And
tell my ego that life is long _ childhood short.

   I have spent years writing and reading about shareholder value.
The new-economy guys have stock options downloading into their

face. And that's when I knew that my stock had finally gone up. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

 (STORY SUMMARY: Most 401(k) retirement plans ask employees to
manage their own investments. One man has an easier, cheaper _ and
more lucrative _ way.)     
 By SCOTT BURNS  
 c.2000 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooks Hamilton doesn't look like a revolutionary. For one
thing, he is a benefits attorney and 401(k) plan record keeper.
People in these vocations are better known for emptying rooms than
for filling them.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, Hamilton wears pinstriped suits, at least
when he's being lawyerly. But when he puts on sweats and settles in
front of one of his computers, Hamilton becomes a dangerous threat
to the established order.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hamilton, in a September 1998 ``Worth'' article on 401(k)
plans, who introduced the idea of ``yield disparity'' _ the
performance chasm that separates the top 20 percent of 401(k) plans
participants from the bottom 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hamilton who calculated that the top 20 percent would
retire with more than 100 percent of their preretirement income
while the bottom 20 percent would retire to a diet of cat food.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hamilton says he has found a way to close the yield gap. He
proposes to turn the 401(k) from a retirement plan dependent on
costly retail mutual funds into one that relies on low-cost
wholesale pension management.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton calls his solution the Freedom Plan. If it works the
way he says it will, the Freedom Plan could siphon much of the $593
billion in 401(k) assets now held in retail mutual funds into
managed pension accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ground zero for the Freedom Plan revolution is Safelite, a
privately-held company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. With $877
million in annual sales, Safelite is the largest manufacturer and
installer of auto replacement glass in the country.
</P>
<P>
   It has 600 service centers in all corners of the U.S., 3,200
vans, 80 warehouses, two manufacturing plants, and 6,300 employees.
If you've ever had a broken windshield replaced, there's a good
chance you've done business with Safelite.
</P>
<P>
   Safelite management had for years struggled to spread the word
about the company's 401(k) benefit to its widely scattered, mostly
blue-collar work force. But as recently as 1994, the Safelite
401(k) was stumbling along with a 38 percent participation rate,
about half the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as bad, the average contribution of those who did
participate was a meager 2.3 percent of pay, also less than half
that in the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Safelite CFO Douglas Herron asked Hamilton how the
company could improve its plan. Hamilton had a few ideas.
</P>
<P>
   To spur participation, Safelite started automatically enrolling
new employees in the plan unless they specifically opted out of it.
And to reward job longevity, the company started matching 20
percent of an employee's contribution in the first two years of his
or her service, escalating to 40 percent after five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to encourage a long career at Safelite,'' says
Herron. And Safelite agreed to increase its match rate when overall
participation in the plan reached specific targets.
</P>
<P>
   When the participation rate was at 50 percent, for instance,
Safelite would increase its match by 10 percent. When the
participation rate hit 60 percent, the match would grow by 25
percent. When the participation rate exceeded 75 percent, the
company match would rise by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These incentives, Hamilton figured, would turn veteran Safelite
employees into plan evangelists, boosting participation and
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   To help the process along, all employees were mailed
personalized projections that showed how increases in contributions
would affect their retirement. The goal was to have employees
contribute enough to capture at least 90 percent of the potential
company match.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's final suggestion was the really radical one. Instead
of offering a wider range of investment choices or even a
self-directed brokerage account, as some plans do, Hamilton wanted
the company to float a new option called PDI, for Professionally
Directed Investment.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who selected the PDI option would have their money
invested by the same professional managers who were handling
Safelite's defined-benefits pension. This would lower the cost of
operating the plan and, very likely, increase the investment return
of the money under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a typical 401(k) plan, the money is managed by amateurs,''
says Hamilton. ``With PDI it's invested by pros.''
</P>
<P>
   In a final twist on accepted convention, Hamilton made PDI the
default option for positive enrollment. (Most plans make a money
market fund, perhaps the world's least appropriate retirement
investment, their default choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless a new employee specified otherwise, his or her money
would go into PDI. To Hamilton, making PDI the default option was
crucial, because it meant that even the most financially illiterate
Safelite employee would have a well-designed investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Many 401(k) savers have no such assurance. Investing may seem
like the new national pastime, but the reality is that to many
people, portfolio management is a mystery they have no interest in
solving. They spread their retirement savings across the choices
they are offered rather than making choices appropriate to their
age. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One landmark study, by UCLA business school professor Shlomo
Benartzi and University of Chicago behavioral finance expert
Richard Thaler, found that the investment choices made by 401(k)
savers tend to reflect the number of options in the plan and its
implicit asset allocation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in a plan that offers more bond funds than
equity funds, participants tend to have low equity commitments.
Participants in a plan that offers more equity funds than bond
funds tend to have a higher equity commitment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, TWA's plan, according to the study, offers five
stock funds and one bond fund. Participants in TWA's plan have a 75
percent equity allocation. The University of California plan offers
four bond funds and one stock fund. In that plan, participants have
a 34 percent equity allocation. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 150-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Safelite added PDI to its plan in January 1999. By Jan. 1, 2000,
Hamilton says, the participation rate had reached 73 percent and
the average contribution had hit 4.2 percent of pay. That enabled
employees to capture 75 percent of the potential match money.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an ordinary level of employee turnover, Hamilton is
confident that Safelite will reach 90 percent participation by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of PDI on Safelite employees' retirement prospects is
dramatic. Hamilton estimates that the typical employee will see his
or her probable retirement income rise from only 14 percent of
final salary to 50 percent. Add Social Security benefits, and most
employees will approach 100 percent of final pay.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the joy of having choices? What about the subtle
pleasures of deciding between the growth of the Pacific Rim, the
security of real estate, and the undervaluation of small-company
stocks?
</P>
<P>
   If Safelite is any indication, most people won't miss the extra
options. Safelite's new plan-eligible employees in January still
had six mutual funds from which to choose, but only 5.9 percent
opted out of PDI.
</P>
<P>
   That means traditional mutual funds are missing 94.1 percent of
this year's new money. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   To spur participation, Safelite started automatically enrolling
new employees in the plan unless they specifically opted out of it.
And to reward job longevity, the company started matching 20
percent of an employee's contribution in the first two years of his
or her service, escalating to 40 percent after five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to encourage a long career at Safelite,'' says
Herron. And Safelite agreed to increase its match rate when overall
participation in the plan reached specific targets.
</P>
<P>
   When the participation rate was at 50 percent, for instance,
Safelite would increase its match by 10 percent. When the
participation rate hit 60 percent, the match would grow by 25
percent. When the participation rate exceeded 75 percent, the
company match would rise by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These incentives, Hamilton figured, would turn veteran Safelite
employees into plan evangelists, boosting participation and
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   To help the process along, all employees were mailed
personalized projections that showed how increases in contributions
would affect their retirement. The goal was to have employees
contribute enough to capture at least 90 percent of the potential
company match.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's final suggestion was the really radical one. Instead
of offering a wider range of investment choices or even a
self-directed brokerage account, as some plans do, Hamilton wanted
the company to float a new option called PDI, for Professionally
Directed Investment.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who selected the PDI option would have their money
invested by the same professional managers who were handling
Safelite's defined-benefits pension. This would lower the cost of
operating the plan and, very likely, increase the investment return
of the money under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a typical 401(k) plan, the money is managed by amateurs,''
says Hamilton. ``With PDI it's invested by pros.''
</P>
<P>
   In a final twist on accepted convention, Hamilton made PDI the
default option for positive enrollment. (Most plans make a money
market fund, perhaps the world's least appropriate retirement
investment, their default choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless a new employee specified otherwise, his or her money
would go into PDI. To Hamilton, making PDI the default option was
crucial, because it meant that even the most financially illiterate
Safelite employee would have a well-designed investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Many 401(k) savers have no such assurance. Investing may seem
like the new national pastime, but the reality is that to many
people, portfolio management is a mystery they have no interest in
solving. They spread their retirement savings across the choices
they are offered rather than making choices appropriate to their
age. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One landmark study, by UCLA business school professor Shlomo
Benartzi and University of Chicago behavioral finance expert
Richard Thaler, found that the investment choices made by 401(k)
savers tend to reflect the number of options in the plan and its
implicit asset allocation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in a plan that offers more bond funds than
equity funds, participants tend to have low equity commitments.
Participants in a plan that offers more equity funds than bond
funds tend to have a higher equity commitment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, TWA's plan, according to the study, offers five
stock funds and one bond fund. Participants in TWA's plan have a 75
percent equity allocation. The University of California plan offers
four bond funds and one stock fund. In that plan, participants have
a 34 percent equity allocation. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 150-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Safelite added PDI to its plan in January 1999. By Jan. 1, 2000,
Hamilton says, the participation rate had reached 73 percent and
the average contribution had hit 4.2 percent of pay. That enabled
employees to capture 75 percent of the potential match money.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an ordinary level of employee turnover, Hamilton is
confident that Safelite will reach 90 percent participation by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of PDI on Safelite employees' retirement prospects is
dramatic. Hamilton estimates that the typical employee will see his
or her probable retirement income rise from only 14 percent of
final salary to 50 percent. Add Social Security benefits, and most
employees will approach 100 percent of final pay.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the joy of having choices? What about the subtle
pleasures of deciding between the growth of the Pacific Rim, the
security of real estate, and the undervaluation of small-company
stocks?
</P>
<P>
   If Safelite is any indication, most people won't miss the extra
options. Safelite's new plan-eligible employees in January still
had six mutual funds from which to choose, but only 5.9 percent
opted out of PDI.
</P>
<P>
   That means traditional mutual funds are missing 94.1 percent of
this year's new money. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   For all the ensuing governmental and media hubbub, the ``denial
of service'' attacks that cut off access to some of the Web's most
popular destinations in early February affected only a very few
people.
</P>
<P>
   Even active users who were temporarily shut out of their
favorite sites _ Amazon.com, eBay, Buy.com, for example _ could
simply pick up where they left off after service was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Or most of them could, anyway. Two sites were unfortunate
exceptions: online brokerage houses E(asterisk)Trade and Datek.
</P>
<P>
   DoS attacks take advantage of a weakness in the underlying
protocol on the Internet. IPv4 (for ``Internet Protocol Version
4'') is the lingua franca of the world's computers, and while the
system has worked well up to this point, it was never intended to
prevent strikes like those in February.
</P>
<P>
   There's no method for authenticating the origin of an IPv4
packet; it's possible to fake, or ``spoof,'' the source address of
a request. An attacker can send messages with a spoofed source
address through a so-called amplifier, flooding his target with
responses to messages it didn't send, slowing or stopping the
delivery of legitimate data.
</P>
<P>
   Although details remain sketchy, this is apparently what
happened in February _ major sites laid low with a simple trick,
using easily obtainable tools. And while the results were
spectacular, the technical know-how required is minimal, allowing
almost anyone to accomplish the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much additional security a site claims to have,
nothing can eliminate these DoS attacks as the Internet currently
stands.
</P>
<P>
   And that's frightening to anyone who trades online. Unlike the
other sites that were hit in the attacks, everything that happens
on E(asterisk)Trade and Datek (and on all Internet-based trading
sites for that matter) is time-critical, tied to events in the real
world. A half-hour can be a lifetime if your core holding is
tanking.
</P>
<P>
   Given the ease and anonymity of the DoS attacks that shut the
sites down, they pose a significant risk for anybody who actively
trades online, simply by closing down an investor's link to the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term solution to the problem is replacing IPv4 with a
more robust protocol, and IPv6, which doesn't allow spoofed source
addresses, is the leading contender.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, making the switch from one protocol to another is
an immense task, and moving to IPv6 entirely _ thus preventing
anonymous DoS attacks _ is estimated to be a decade-long process.
</P>
<P>
   It will require replacing every piece of software on the Net,
from low-level router code and operating systems to Windows and
your Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   No one site or user can do it alone, though industry leaders
such as standards committees, network infrastructure providers, and
Microsoft could lead the push.

   CHARLESTON-RESTAURANTS (Charleston, S.C.) _ The city of
Charleston survived the first Reconstruction era, but just barely.
It will be interesting to see how it handles the second one. Around
every corner, the hammers are banging and dust is flying, as
stately old homes are freshened up for sale to Northern
carpetbaggers. With approximately one horse-drawn, tourist-laden
carriage for every bona fide resident, it has reduced traffic
accidents to almost zero by making it impossible for any car to
reach a speed of more than 8 miles per hour. The tourist rush that
has transformed Charleston in the last 10 years has brought an
unanticipated benefit: good restaurants. A decade ago, fine dining
took place in people's homes. Restaurants worthy of the name could
be counted on the fingers of one hand, with several fingers to
spare. Now it takes both hands, and some toes as well. In fact, it
would hard to think of another American city of the same size _
Charleston has a population under 100,000 _ with a more dynamic,
promising restaurant scene. By William Grimes.

   CHARLESTON-GRITS (Charleston, S.C.) _ In a dimly lit corridor
just beyond the bustling kitchen of Anson Restaurant, the executive
chef, Mike Lata, is feeding corn into a one-horsepower mill the
size of an exercise bicycle. He reaches inside a bulging sack and
lifts a fistful of yellow kernels, sun-puckered and as hard as
glass beads, and drops them into a conical hopper to fall between
the mill's two pink granite stones. What emerges is a coarse meal
that will very soon be transformed into a creamy plate of yellow
grits like Northerners never see. Lata may be the only the chef in
the nation who is a miller, too. But the care he takes with his
grits _ controlling the variety of corn, the coarseness of the
grind and certainly the freshness _ is evidence of how important
North America's great native starch has once again become in the
South and beyond. By Matt Lee and Ted Lee.

   SOUTHERN-BREAKFAST (Charleston, S.C.) _ One of the things that
brightens the lives of itinerant scribblers like me is breakfast.
As its happens, I've spent a lot of time, over the years, in the
American South, a region that specializes in big, bountiful
breakfasts, at least partly because an energy-giving meal is better
consumed in the morning than at midday in its steamy climate. At a
little place called Hominy Grill in the not-yet-quite-fashionable
Cannonborough neighborhood here, they serve what may well be the
best breakfast in the Carolinas, which means one of the best in
America. This is a place whose breads are homemade, where instant
grits and quick grits and machine-ground grits find no welcome.
Fried eggs are gentled to perfection. At Hominy Grill, in other
words, breakfast is no gastronomic stepchild. It is cooked as
carefully as if it were a banquet. By R.W. Apple Jr.

DENNY'S HOPES FOR REDEMPTION AMONG BLACKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SALATHEIA BRYANT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Before Denny's built a restaurant in his neighborhood,
Vic Bonner Jr. had a personal reason not to eat there. He boycotted
the national restaurant chain because it had been accused of
treating black customers differently than whites.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Denny's Classic Diner opens Sunday, Bonner has
pledged to give the eatery another chance because he sees diversity
at this particular business.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see that long line out there (looking for jobs) was
encouraging,'' said Bonner, an African-American. ``It makes us feel
better that it's black-owned. It's showing a true commitment by
Denny's to rectify past wrongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite well-publicized, class-action lawsuits that accused the
chain of providing slow or no service to blacks, many residents in
this inner-city neighborhood south of downtown Houston are
welcoming this new Denny's _ and the company's new attitude that
has changed the ethnic makeup of its stores' owners
</P>
<P>
   The Houston store's owner is black, and residents and members of
the Third Ward Redevelopment Council hope the $1.5 million project
trimmed in neon green and red lights will stimulate other
commercial investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one way of putting up a big sign saying, `We're here
and we're viable,''' said John Guess, chairman of the council. ``We
have not seen a franchise come into our community in quite some
time. It says to the community it's not forgotten. We're glad to
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
and Houston City Councilman Jew Don Boney also applauded the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny's is demonstrating they want to be a part of our
community,'' Boney said. ``It will point the way for other business
people to see the potential that exists in this neighborhood and
along that OST (Old Spanish Trail)/Almeda corridor we've been
trying to develop for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Financing for the deal was spearheaded by Unity National Bank,
the only black-owned financial institution in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an investment in a community that hasn't experienced
anything new in many, many years,'' said Larry Hawkins, Unity's
president and chief executive officer. ``We're seeing this boom in
downtown. This will spill into the Third Ward community, given its
strategic location.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant is owned by 40-year-old Alan D. Bergeron, who
grew up in the neighborhood and already owns two Shipley Donut
shops.
</P>
<P>
   When he visited the corporate offices for training last summer,
he was impressed with what he saw: diversity and change. He said
that during the training, the company was open about discussing the
lawsuits and its customer policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went much, much further than the federal government
required,'' said Bergeron. ``They made a point to drive that home
to me. They almost went overboard with presenting it.''
</P>
<P>
   While his Denny's was being built, some residents asked him if
he knew about Denny's past. And when he trained in a local Denny's
store, he saw a few incidents in which black customers still were
leery of being treated unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just deal with it. What else can you do?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most publicized cases, black Secret Service agents
sued Denny's after they were refused service in an Annapolis, Md.,
restaurant while white officers were served quickly. U.S. District
Judge Kenneth Hoyt of Houston and his wife complained that they had
to wait a long of time for service at a Denny's in California.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartanburg, S.C.-based chain settled one class-action
lawsuit in 1994 for $54 million and hired a civil rights monitor to
oversee the company's compliance with a consent decree it signed.
Since then, Denny's parent company, Advantica Restaurant Group, has
led an aggressive public campaign to make itself over.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the year the lawsuit was filed, Denny's had only one
black-owned franchise. Blacks now own 123 Denny's franchises.
</P>
<P>
   The chain had no contracts with minority suppliers in 1992. Now,
corporate officials say, the company does 17 percent of its
business with minority contractors, totaling about $125 million.
Also, the company reports that it had a million more black
customers in 1998 than it had in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Denny's has 28 franchise stores in the Houston area and all but
one is minority-owned and operated, including 18 that are owned by
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Hood-Phillips, Denny's chief diversity officer in
Spartanburg, believes that the company has worked hard to overcome
past problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe there are people out there who don't know the new
Denny's,'' said Hood-Phillips. ``We hope people will realize we're
not the same company we were seven years ago. We're going in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   At his Houston store, Bergeron so far hasn't had too much
problem with the company's past. He's turning away customers who
think the store is already open.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Bergeron readies his staff for opening day.
Workers have complied with all the training that has resulted from
the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Near the door, written in English and Spanish, is the company's
commitment to offer great service regardless of race, creed or
national origin. It gives customers a toll-free number to call if
they have a complaint that isn't resolved at the store location.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a perception out there that some folks may walk in
here with a chip on their shoulder. And that's not just here,
that's any Denny's,'' Bergeron told his mostly black crew. ``The
company is very aware of that. They have done everything short of
changing the name Denny's to change that. They've changed
everything from the way the building looks to the way they do
business.''

 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA 0427: A Mattie Roundtree, 100, opens doors to
the past

small-town America _ the values, the stories and the characters _
at the end of the millennium. Photo and a sig/locator map are

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Mattie Taylor Roundtree has a way of
opening doors for people, opening doors and pointing to what's on
the other side, and pushing people on through and out into the
world. That's what Mattie Roundtree has done in her 100 years. Open
doors. She knows something about doors slamming shut, too.
</P>
<P>
   Her front door is good, solid old cypress, planed smooth and
hung straight in 1924 by her carpenter husband, Lloyd. The big
hurricanes of 1926 and 1928 didn't budge the door, or the frame
house Lloyd built on land he bought for $60, paying 25 cents a
week. But the land was low, wet, and Lloyd found a better location
nearby, high on an ancient dune up on 32nd Street in Riviera Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men, they rolled that house up from the wet land. They
rolled it right up on tree trunks,'' says Mattie. ``Lloyd, he took
care of me. Me, I took care of Lloyd, and my family. But first was
the Lord. He came first. Lloyd understood.''
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years, Mattie Roundtree's door had no lock, was always
open. Open in the 1920s to kids from the white sand streets. Open
to the whole neighborhood in the '40s when her phone was the only
phone on the street. Open to her grandchildren in the 1950s, her
great-grandchildren in the '80s and great-great grandchildren in
the '90s. Always open for neighbors during hurricanes _ Lloyd built
a solid house. Always open, a portal to both past and future.
</P>
<P>
   Mattie Roundtree is 100, not as big a milestone as it once was.
It's not the length of her journey that makes her special. It's the
uncanny ability she has to unlock something in everyone she meets.
</P>
<P>
   She was born on a pecan farm in Boston, Ga. _ Thomas County,
just over the Florida border. Rural south Georgia in 1900 didn't
look a whit different than south Georgia in 1860 _ dirt farms, dirt
roads, dirt poor. Her family, the Taylors, had come down from South
Carolina after the Civil War. Freed slaves, they owned their farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never were sharecroppers,'' Mattie says.
</P>
<P>
   A good-looking young man lived nearby. Lloyd Roundtree, grandson
of a white planter and one of his slaves. The planter freed his
slaves, gave them his last name and gave them all farms, 160 acres
of good land. The Taylors and Roundtrees were not poor, but being
black they could get poor _ or dead _ in a single night. A wrong
word here, a wrong look there, and a black man could lose it all.
And doors to a better life were barred, shut and locked tight.
</P>
<P>
   The world Mattie was born into and left when she was 20 was
frozen in time by the Civil War. Gilded Age America did not make
its way to the pecan farms of south Georgia. The 20th century
hadn't started in Boston as of 1920, not for anybody, black or
white, especially black, like Mattie Roundtree.
</P>
<P>
   So Mattie and Lloyd set out for South Florida in 1920. Jobs in
the new restaurants for Mattie, carpentry work for Lloyd. A better
life, maybe, especially for the baby. Eddie.
</P>
<P>
   Now when Mattie speaks, you don't hear the 20th century, you
hear the 19th. To hear Mattie Roundtree, you have to let her open
doors to the past, and then you have to pass through. It's an
incredible passage.
</P>
<P>
   A childhood memory: ``I seen that tail star in 1910. That tail
star said something bad going to happen. And something did. That
big boat full of rich white people sunk two years later, and all
them rich white people got themselves drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   On a woman's place: ``My Lloyd didn't want me to work. But the
Lord didn't say to women, `Don't you go out and work.' So I worked.
At the Model Laundry, down on Dixie in West Palm Beach. I made some
kinda money _ 10 cents an hour. Some kinda money ... ``
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the old rural dialect fool you. This is a woman who
went her way guided by her Lord and razor-sharp intuition. And she
went a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Mattie's the oldest member of the Hurst Chapel African Methodist
Episcopal Church of Riviera Beach _ 72 years with the church. When
Mattie Roundtree commits to something, it's for life. She still
takes her daily walk, still fishes, if someone takes her to a good
stretch of water. And her politics? She's a life-long Republican,
to the consternation of her 82-year-old daughter-in-law, Louise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all good Democrats,'' says Louise, who lives with and
looks after Mattie. ``But that's Mattie's privilege and right.''
</P>
<P>
   So you lean over close to Mattie, because she can't hear too
well, and ask: a Republican?
</P>
<P>
   She says: ``Why, yes, of course, because Mr. Lincoln was a good
man, a good president. He freed the slaves. My people.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not simply mean her people, as in race, but her people,
as in family.
</P>
<P>
   You don't meet many Lincoln Republicans anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Mattie Roundtree, armed with an eighth-grade education,
harvested more wisdom from the slack weeds and peanut plants of
south Georgia than some folks reap from Ivy-covered academies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lincoln didn't want to free the slaves,'' she whispers.
``It wasn't in his politics. You got to understand that. He was
ordained to free them, by the Lord. But he was still a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattie's granddaughter, Doris Heastie, listens and nods and
says, ``Yes, Grandma.'' Doris herself can collect Social Security
now. She lives in a grand new house _ broad front porch, big
windows that catch the sea breeze _ next to Mattie's old house.
She's one of Eddie's three daughters, married to the Rev. Raymond
Hastings, presiding elder of the African Methodist Episcopal
Church, Fort Pierce District. The church, the Bible, the Lord are
the threads that tie the Roundtree family to their past, to their
future, to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie, Mattie's son, my father, was the first to go to
college. Florida A&AMP;M,'' Doris says. ``He studied French and was the
first black notary certified by the state of Florida. That was
Mattie's doing. She only had that little bit of schooling, but she
loved to read. She knew what education meant. Doors open. Eddie was
an interpreter in France during World War II. Now imagine that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My Lloyd didn't like books,'' says Mattie. ``He thought a man
should work so as to stay free. You know, be his own man, his own
boss. He thought girls should go to school.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mattie, Eddie and his wife Louise won the battle of the
books. Eddie's three daughters _ Doris, Deborah and L'nette _ went
to college, Doris to Bethune-Cookman in Daytona, where she met
Raymond. And the children of the three daughters went to college.
And their kids' kids. All the Roundtrees love books. All those
Roundtrees out there in a world Mattie couldn't have conjured in a
fitful dream, all of them have gone somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth generation is yet too young to go anyplace. Six
generations. Think about it. Mattie Roundtree is a
great-great-great-grandmother. And great-great aunt to 537. The
cousins are teachers, landscape architects, shipyard
administrators, high-tech communications specialists. Distant
cousin Richard is better known as Shaft. The Georgia Taylors and
Roundtrees made their way into a new and, for them, dangerous
world. Mattie Roundtree launched her family into the rarefied air
of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her house was full of books,'' Doris says. ``Stacked
everywhere. I'd walk across the yard to Grandma's for ice cream,
you know, all the treats I couldn't get at home. And she'd hand me
a book. But you know, her real strength didn't come just from
books. It came from somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattie went house to house at election time, went right down
to the polls. Telling people to vote. `You go and vote,' she'd say.
`It's your right.' Black people couldn't vote, of course. Poll
taxes and such. But Mattie was out there. In 1925, 1930. She was
out there 30 or 40 years before the big demonstrations. Lloyd said
it was dangerous. It was.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattie sits in a big chair. She's tiny, her face shines like
rich buffed mahogany. Big eyes shine bright behind big glasses. She
grips her cane, beautiful long fingers curled around the top. She
listens, nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Doris says, ``Yes, Grandma, it was right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattie could sew,'' says Doris. ``A seamstress she was. When I
was a teenager in the '40s, we weren't allowed to try on clothes at
Burdines, down on Clematis. So Grandmother would look in the
window, just look at the dresses. Then she'd come home and cut
patterns from memory, from newspapers, and make the dresses. The
same dresses as in the window. I wore all the latest fashions, and
Mattie made them all. People thought I was rich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, you was rich,'' Mattie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there was the telephone,'' says Doris. ``In the
1940s, Mattie's was the only phone on the street. Well, Mr. Harry
T. Moore was the executive secretary for the Florida NAACP. He
worked for Thurgood Marshall. Well, Mr. Moore got fired from his
teaching job up in Mims around 1949 _ fired for his work with
Thurgood _ and he took his family down here to keep a low profile,
protect his family. He rented that house right across the street.
Mrs. Moore took a job teaching at Washington Junior High. Mr. Moore
did his NAACP work. When Thurgood Marshall wanted to talk to Mr.
Moore, he'd call our phone, and Mattie would send me across the
street to get Mr. Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the neighbors said, `Mattie, there's going to be
terrible trouble for us if you let that man use the phone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mattie listens to the story. She nods. ``It was right,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Doris, ``they killed Mr. Moore anyway. He went up
to Mims for Christmas, 1951 I think. They killed him. Blew him up
in his house with a bomb on Christmas. His wife died, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattie's getting tired. She listens with eyes half shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to use the phone,'' she says, and you know she means
more than the words convey. She means Harry T. Moore had to do what
he had to do, and that she had to do what she had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people have soared in the last 50 years,'' Doris says. ``I
mean my family, yes, but I mean black people. Oh, we got bad ones,
like the young ones who stole Mattie's money right out of her
Bible, stole her meat right from the freezer. We got the bad ones,
and so do your people. But we have soared . Because of people like
Mattie. People who didn't lie down and die. People who opened
doors, for themselves, for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's late, Mattie's tired. Her house awaits. The old fireplace
Lloyd built for her, with the photo on the mantle of Lloyd's father
_ white shirt, suspenders, a Georgia planter. Over there is the
pine cupboard with the ceramic plates she and Lloyd used for almost
60 years. A second front door has been added to the porch _ no
windows, covered in heavy wire mesh, big lock.
</P>
<P>
   The old front door door wears a lock now, too, but still shuts
tight and true, like Lloyd wanted.
</P>
<P>
   If you knock, Mattie will throw it open.

THE BIG FAME OF LITTLE STEVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TIMOTHY FINN  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The album he self-released last year, ``Born Again Savage,'' was
the final in a five-record, 18-year project that was supposed to
enlighten Steven Van Zandt, politically and spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall,'' he said recently, ``I think I succeeded in what I
set out to do: write about who I am and figure out what's going on
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Zandt's road to self-enlightenment has been paved thick with
irony lately: He spent much of the last two decades preaching about
peace, justice and revolution; he admittedly abhors most of what
flows through mainstream culture; and he still dresses as
flamboyant retro-rocker Little Steven _ ``like an urban
swashbuckler whose frigate just got towed away for
double-parking,'' one critic wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But in 2000 Van Zandt is more popular than ever, primarily
because he plays an endearing mobster on HBO's ``The Sopranos,''
one of the hottest shows on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the height of irony, a ridiculous Hollywood story,'' he
said. ``An isolated, alienated individual who doesn't even relate
to his own so-called industry, never mind the broader entertainment
industry, suddenly comes out of nowhere and gets involved in
something new and exciting and extremely eccentric that takes off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the show from the start, which I figured was the kiss
of death. I don't like anything. It's the second time in my life
it's happened _ I've liked something a lot and it's embraced by a
large part of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time was in 1975, when he became a guitarist for
longtime friend Bruce Springsteen in the E Street Band, a gig he
suspended in 1984 but revived last year when Springsteen and the
band reunited for what has been a wildly successful worldwide tour.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after that tour stopped at Kemper Arena (and after HBO
aired the season finale of ``The Sopranos''), Van Zandt called The
Star from New York to talk about politics, music and his latest
love, acting.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you create records as personal and political as yours
have been, you obviously want your messages to be heard. Yet,
especially these days, radio hasn't been friendly to the kind of
music you make. How do you reconcile that?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two big questions there, one of which I never
thought we'd be asking: First, is politics relevant in rock music?
And, even more important, will rock music itself survive and
flourish again?
</P>
<P>
   By the time the '70s hit, politics had become very unfashionable
in music. In the '80s, when I started doing it, journalists were
asking me what on earth politics had to do with rock music. Also by
that time, radio did not want to play my music, and not just
because it was political. All those major artists performed on (the
anti-apartheid anthem) ``Sun City,'' but radio wouldn't play it.
The song was considered too black for white radio and too white for
black, which, of course, was part of the point.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000 my basic message is: We are all politically engaged,
whether we want to admit it or not. If you're active, your
engagement is obvious. If you're passive, that's also engagement:
You're endorsing the status quo. So you can't pretend you're not
political.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think there's any way rock can deliver the kind of
political punch it did 30 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   It's gonna be tough, at least for now. The issue-oriented types
of events will happen less often. Now that rock music is not an
integral part of culture, we're gonna have less of that _ less of
the educational component, which was once part of the natural
makeup of rock music, whether it was from artists educating their
audiences or disc jockeys educating their listeners. That has been
a big loss: the power of DJs to educate and to exercise their
political personalities.
</P>
<P>
   You have been honored by various organizations, including the
United Nations, for your work on behalf of human rights. What are
you proudest of?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the apartheid issue was the most obvious win. You
don't get one like that in politics _ maybe once in a lifetime.
People spend six years in liberation struggles and don't get
anything close to that. It was very satisfying, a complete win.
Usually it's more of a gray area, an inch here and there, then you
lose an inch. I have great respect for those who work on issues
year after year and inch forward. This was a complete, amazing
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   If you could change anything in politics, what would it be?
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the '80s and into the early '90s, I figured out
that all political issues can be reduced to one issue: campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a little more radical about it than (Senator John) McCain,
although I give him credit for bringing it up. But all issues flow
from that, and until we find a way to eliminate money from the
electoral process, we will never have a democracy. The Supreme
Court has ruled that money is covered by the First Amendment, which
is the height of insanity. Why is money free speech? If money is
freedom of speech, lack of money is no speech _ suppression.
</P>
<P>
   What has the success of ``The Sopranos'' done for you
personally?
</P>
<P>
   What they say about TV is true. I'm telling you, within two
weeks of that show going on the air, 90 percent of the people who
stopped me wanted to talk about the show. As you know, I look quite
different in the show than I do normally, and HBO only goes into
about one in four homes, but still the overwhelming majority of the
people who stop me now want to talk about the show.
</P>
<P>
   How did you get the part of Silvio Dante?
</P>
<P>
   David Chase, the show's creator, happened to be watching the
first televised Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, when
I inducted the Rascals, and thought he might want me in the show in
some role. He got in touch with me, and I went down and we talked,
and I decided it was something I wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   I had some immediate second thoughts, though, because I wasn't
comfortable about taking another actor's job. There are a finite
number of characters, and some actors work all their lives trying
to get a part like this, and here I am, a guitar player coming in.
I wasn't comfortable with that.
</P>
<P>
   So he said ``I'll write you in. I'll create a part for you.'' I
proposed a guy who ran a big-band, Copacabana-type club. We settled
on a guy named Silvio Dante who runs a strip joint instead.
</P>
<P>
   I then endowed him with appropriate characteristics, creating an
entire biography of him: He's a loyal, devoted guy whose ambitions
had evolved beyond the ``family business'' and into more legitimate
areas, into entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't relate to the modern culture, and he longs for the
good old days. So he and I have that in common. Silvio is a
throwback to the '40s and '50s. He lives in the past, so I wanted
him to look like that.
</P>
<P>
   After creating all that, I took it to David and the writers and
said, ``This is how I see the guy. Do you agree?'' They pretty much
agreed with what I presented. Then I handed it over to them. He's
been their baby ever since, and each week they broaden the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Silvio is a cold-blooded killer, but he has lots of appealing
tics and traits. Where did you draw his character him from?
</P>
<P>
   I've been a big fan of the genre, the gangster thing, for a long
time: Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, George Raft, Bogie. I'm a big
film noir fan, too, so I went back and revisited all those gangster
movies and read some books.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the same processes I've used in the past _ political
research or digging deep for personal truths _ I used in learning
about this other guy, Silvio. Ultimately you become somebody else.
That's how I look at it. You dig deep and discover the
characteristics that are that person, and you wake it up.
</P>
<P>
   I think we all have every personality inside of us, from Hitler
to Ghandi. Acting is a matter of finding and awakening that thing,
a small part of you that may be dormant. Obviously some things
maybe are best left dormant.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, what has the reunion with Springsteen and the band meant
to you, a die-hard rock 'n' roll guy?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it's great to belong somewhere. At this point
it's very difficult to find a place in music where I fit. Even
though my new record got more airplay than any other, and it's
alive and well, I still don't quite fit in anymore. I play pure,
traditional rock music, which has never been less fashionable than
it is now.
</P>
<P>
   The tour also has been a great chance to reconnect with one of
the best bands in history, a band I'm proud to be a part of, and to
play again with guys I've known for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe best of all, we've reconnected with our audience, which
was something extraordinary that I sort of remembered, but not
really. You can't really remember that kind of experience until you
do it again. I don't think there has ever been an audience in
history that has developed the intimate relationship with an artist
that our audience has.
</P>
<P>
   What we and the audience do is quite unique these days. The
mass, shared experience will be harder to find. You're already
seeing it. In the 1980s, bands lined up to play the arenas and
stadiums. Now very, very few bands can do arenas, never mind
stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Our concerts transcend a few contemporary afflictions. Our
society is suffering from short attention spans and a time-deficit
disorder: We're always late, we don't know how much time to
dedicate to work or families, but it's never enough.
</P>
<P>
   At our show, for three hours, time stops. That room becomes a
community because that's the theme of the show. That's what Bruce's
work is about: community. And that gets into the whole paradox of
America _ how to remain an individual and be a part of a community
at the same time.

LONGTIME FRIEND AND DEDICATION SUBJECT ADMIRES CONNELL'S OPUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN MARK EBERHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   ``For Naoma and Webster Schott.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Half a century of friendship lies behind the dedication that
graces Evan S. Connell's new work, Deus lo Volt! Chronicle of the
Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   The Schotts, a Kansas City couple, don't really know why KC
native Connell dedicated this particular work to them, but they are
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea and I didn't ask. I was honored,'' says Webster
Schott. ``I've known Evan Connell for 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And not simply as friend but as colleague. Schott has had a
literary career himself, having edited a book of William Carlos
Williams' poetry (Imaginations), and having written book reviews
for publications ranging from Life magazine to The New York Times
to The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   Those reviews included a 1948 or '49 piece of an anthology that
included a Connell short story; Schott met Connell as a result of
that review.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a peer and friend view Connell's novel about the
Crusades? Schott is generally complimentary, but also honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an astonishing work. It's an endless succession
of events, episodes, all of them with apparent historical accuracy.
... The amount of information that Evan has brought to this book is
breathtaking. I think it's totally convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   And?
</P>
<P>
   He notes that the book is full of ``violence, brutality and
inhumanity conducted on behalf of a spiritual ideal. All of it
suggests that ... in effect, no matter what man says about
religious guidance, he's really an animal on two feet.'' And yet
what Connell has done is historically grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Schott thinks Connell is truly what most writers only say they
are: independent and unique. He notes that Connell, married to his
craft, has never had a family. And ``he can get his possessions
into the back seat of a small auto,'' though he obviously has
enjoyed financial success.
</P>
<P>
   ``To visit his apartment, it's spare; it's like that of a
monk,'' Schott says. ``Evan has led the life almost of a hermit.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Deus lo Volt! fails to become a best seller like Son of
the Morning Star or the Bridge novels, the author will care little,
Schott thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evan is in nobody's pocket, including the reading public's,''
Schott says. ``Evan writes what he wants to write and what he feels
he needs to write.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Connell's own views, he seems more concerned about his
next book than about how this one sells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to do now and this bothers me,'' Connell
says from his home in Santa Fe, N.M. ``This happens every time I
finish a book; I feel empty and have no idea what to do next and I
get very uneasy about that, so I hope something turns up.''
</P>
<P>
   Deus lo Volt! originated when Connell found a paperback copy a
few years ago of accounts of the Crusades written by Geoffroy de
Villehardouin and Jean de Joinville. He appropriated Joinville as
the narrator for his novel and imagined a ``prequel'' to the actual
memoir Joinville had written.
</P>
<P>
   So inspiration will certainly come again for the 74-year-old
author. What's he doing in the meantime?
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading and loitering.''

EVAN CONNELL TACKLES AMBITIOUS CRUSADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN MARK EBERHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deus lo Volt! Chronicle of the Crusades, by Evan S. Connell (462
pages; Counterpoint; $28)
</P>
<P>
   His agent doesn't like the book much. His sister is dismayed by
it. His publisher is putting out a guide to help readers get
through it.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas City native Evan S. Connell couldn't be happier with
Deus lo Volt! Chronicle of the Crusades, the most ambitious but
most challenging book of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Deus lo Volt! (God wills it!) isn't your average modern novel.
It is millennial _ if the millennium in question is 1000. It's
action-packed, but the action is savage and the savageries are
committed by Christians. It is politically incorrect, disturbing,
saddening _ and brutally, brilliantly, historically accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Connell has been fortunate. Commercial and critical success have
united for him in works such as Son of the Morning Star, as well as
Mrs. Bridge and Mr. Bridge, which were set in Kansas City and later
combined to make a Merchant-Ivory movie that was filmed here.
</P>
<P>
   But will Deus lo Volt! fare as well?
</P>
<P>
   Evan S. Connell neither knows nor cares.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthless roads
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity and power can lead to mischief. In 1095 Europe
boasted a growing population, a strong economy _ and a Catholic
Church strengthened by a reform movement that had given royal
personages less power over the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   So when things look good domestically, it's natural to look
abroad. Late that year Pope Urban II declared that Seljuk Turks
were harassing Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem and said the ``holy
city'' must be captured by the West.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people responded to his call, and what
followed was two centuries of bloodshed and death. Pilgrims marched
to their demise; soldiers and knights and kings went to battle;
even a disastrous children's crusade led innocents to their graves.
</P>
<P>
   And Connell decided his book would cover it all. Two centuries
in 462 pages? No problem _ for him, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent ... complains that there were so many characters and
they were treated so cursorily that you didn't have time to develop
any feeling for any one particular person,'' Connell says in a
telephone interview from his home in Santa Fe, N.M. ``But I
intended it to be a panorama. As you walk along an unrolled
tapestry, figures appear and are replaced by others.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell acknowledges the structure will be off-putting to some
modern readers. In fact, Deus lo Volt! was rejected by a couple
publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   But in medieval literature, this ``tapestry'' approach was the
norm. Even the epic poems such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,
which do feature strong personages, display little of what
contemporary readers have come to expect. There are no character
studies. The ``plots'' are somewhat dynamic but they lack the
dramatic surges and upheavals of a novel.
</P>
<P>
   So Connell's presentation is authentic. Again, he is asked if
this might not prove problematic for the reading public.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way I wanted to do it,'' he says softly.
</P>
<P>
   He also spared nothing in his portrayals of atrocities committed
in the name of God. This book is not for sissies:
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian fishermen throwing nets just before sunset happened
to see a man swimming. They pursued him on their boats and saw he
was a Turk who, alarmed by their shouts, tried to escape. But they
rowed strongly, caught him in their net and saw he was carrying a
bottle of Greek fire (an incendiary) suspended from his neck. So
they landed their captive as though he were a fish and led him with
his evil mixture through the army, scourging him, reviling him,
after which they mangled his body and chopped him apart.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for being fishers of men.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister is ... extremely religious, and she has difficulty
accepting the fact that Christians would do these things,'' Connell
says. ``And I think that's not at all unusual; I think a lot of
people will be offended by these facts.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does he respond?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to respond to that,'' he says and again the
voice is soft, noncombative. ``It is what happened and I didn't
invent anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell, in fact, allowed himself almost no deviation from the
historical record. Everything in the book is factual except for a
few philosophical musings that he put into the mouth of his
narrator, Jean de Joinville _ who was a real person, too.
</P>
<P>
   Connell doesn't blame his sister or anyone else from bridling at
the brutalities he includes. The author says he is ``not
religious'' _ and yet even he had trouble with the subject matter
at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started working on this book I was coming across these
horrifying things and at first ... I was questioning, doubting this
`Christian' behavior and after awhile I realized that was not how
he (the narrator) felt about it; it was how I felt about it. And so
I went back to the beginning and very carefully excised every
statement or anything I had written that would indicate my doubt
about the Christian pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own attitude is pretty common in the 20th century; most
people would be appalled by the Christians slicing off strips of
dead Saracens' feet because they were starving, and mounting
decapitated heads on poles; these are the sorts of things we frown
on these days. But that is a 20th-century sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Joinville, the narrator, speaks with ease of his faith in
God but also his disdain for the Turkish ``infidels'' and
``vermin'' that he says practice a ``counterfeit'' faith. In his
mind there is no conflict between warfare and worship:
</P>
<P>
   ``At first our Church was poor and defenseless,'' Joinville says
early in the book. ``(N)ow she is rich and able to defend herself.
When Christ bade Peter to put up his sword, He spoke for that
occasion only, since the time for use had not arrived. Thus, to
make war against Saracens, who are enemies of the Messiah, must not
be incompatible with Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't easy sentiments to swallow in a world that has come
to believe in religious tolerance (even if such a belief isn't
always practiced). But Connell thinks his unflinching depiction of
those times is relevant today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess more than one historian has commented that the
Christian//Muslim warfare from the Middle Ages continues to poison
our relations between East and West even today, you know _ the
Arabs and the Jews and all of this. ... (It) can be traced back to
this horrifying sack of Jerusalem in 1099 and the consequent fury
of the Muslims. I don't think anything can be done about it after
all these centuries, but maybe ultimately we can reach some kind of
accord _ and maybe the book can at least explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   A monumental read
</P>
<P>
   That Deus lo Volt! is a great book is beyond question. It's a
tough go in the first 150 pages, where it covers the years
1095-1170, or a year every two pages _ a dizzying pace for a novel,
even a historical one.
</P>
<P>
   But it gets easier as the reader acclimates. And the emergence
later in the text of England's King Richard the Lion-Hearted and
his adversary, the great Muslim sultan Saladin, add to the
narrative's depth and dramatic fire.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's demanding. There is no introduction. No character
list. No chronology. No glossary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little ... not a quarrel, but a discussion with the
publisher about this,'' Connell says. ``They wanted an
introduction, bibliography and a glossary and these kinds of
things, but I wanted all the way to give the impression of an old
manuscript rather than one more professorial history. So they are
doing a reader's guide, a separate little booklet ... it has all
that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Connell's historical novel of George Armstrong
Custer, Son of the Morning Star, wasn't exactly an easy read,
either, and yet it became a best seller. Custer, though, is part of
America's own history and legend.
</P>
<P>
   And in Kansas City, of course, Connell is most identified with
Mrs. Bridge and Mr. Bridge, books that concern the daily lives of a
well-to-do KC family up till World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Those books are fairly easy to read. And yet perhaps Deus lo
Volt! isn't quite such a departure after all: The Bridge novels
each are constructed as a series of vignettes _ a tapestry not of
knights, pilgrims and kings but of husbands, wives and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't really thought about that,'' says Connell, who was
born in Kansas City in 1924. ``But I suppose so. I had tried to
write 15 chapters and a dramatic climax for `Mrs. Bridge' but ...''
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't work out for him, and he stumbled onto the more
fluid vignette form, which he likes because of the freedom it
offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do, yes. It can become self-indulgent, so you have to be
careful, wondering if you're not playing tennis without a net. But
with some subjects it works.''
</P>
<P>
   And all in all, it works for Deus lo Volt! It's a stunning book
about a savage time, with a message that crosses a millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the same kind of religious fanaticism today, the same
kind of mindless obsession with a cause, the kind of stupidity that
got us into Vietnam,'' Connell says. ``It's very similar, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   So things really don't change that much after a thousand years?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''

straight in 1924 by her carpenter husband, Lloyd. The big
hurricanes of 1926 and 1928 didn't budge the door, or the frame
house Lloyd built on land he bought for $60, paying 25 cents a
week. But the land was low, wet, and Lloyd found a better location

``The men, they rolled that house up from the wet land. They rolled

   SOUTHCOMM _Southern Co. will become a smaller company once it
sheds its unregulated business unit through an initial public

company will also get the chance to shore up its traditional

telecommunications or acquisitions of neighboring electric or gas
utilities. The company is likely to intensify preparations for the
day when deregulation reaches the Southeast and it faces
competition from other electric suppliers. (Quinn, Atlanta

   POOCH-INSURANCE _Maybe Old Yeller didn't have to die. Just when
it seemed insurance couldn't get any more complicated here in
America, along comes pet insurance. If not an entirely new concept
(one company's been selling the stuff since 1983 in _ where else? _
California) insuring pets is an idea that's taken off like Air Bud
in the last year. In some ways, it's a kinder, gentler process than
insuring humans _ policy holders get to choose their own
veterinarians, rather than spend hours sitting in some doggie HMO.
In other ways, it's just as bad _ just as many humans can't buy
coverage for partners or non-immediate family members, Internet

 &HT;    A heady tale about home brewing
 &HT;    By Mark Lisheron and Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hubris led us to call Pierre Celis. We'd
compared notes over pints of other people's beer. And while not
certified master brewers, we had a combined 12 years of home
brewing experience. We were, in hindsight, a bit cocky.
</P>
<P>
   We'd brewed delicious beer in a variety of styles, we told one
another _ ales, lagers, bocks and doublebocks, everything from
light, tangy wheat beers to 40-weight imperial stouts. Mark was the
only one to admit ever having made a bad batch of home brew, but
then, he comes from Milwaukee, the town famous for dumping hideous,
taste-free American lager upon the land. But in his defense, it was
just one batch. And even then the blindness was only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't need Celis _ the founder of the Austin brewery of the
same name and a god among beer geeks _ for his experience. But we
did think we could use some distinguished company. So we invited
him over to Mark's house to brew. And now we have a confession:
</P>
<P>
   This is a tale of a good beer that tested the faith of two home
brewers. We, the above bylined, were braced to stand before you
utter failures. We believed we had wasted the time of Pierre Celis,
a gentleman and a brewer whom we admire _ nay, worship. (``You're
why I live in Austin,'' Pat said as he wept and clutched the
master's ankles.) Our batch of grand cru was invaded by something,
most likely Ebola, and what began as a promising golden brew looked
like a description author James Ellroy used to describe the sky
over Los Angeles: carcinogenic tan. In the presence of Pierre
Celis, we feared we'd brewed the lousiest beer you ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre held up his end. If there is a more genial and gracious
person in American brewing, we have yet to hoist one with him or
her. And while the idea of having one of the world's best brewers
oversee the effort of a couple of amateurs sounds preposterous if
you say it out loud, Pierre was only too happy to play along.
</P>
<P>
   We had chosen to brew a grand cru, an homage to Celis Grand Cru,
a personal favorite of ours, an exquisite beer and one of the
best-kept secrets in America. With the right ingredients and a
little guidance, we believed we had a reasonable chance of paying
homage to the master.
</P>
<P>
   Brewing, we tell anyone who makes the mistake of getting us
talking about it, is as easy as making a big pot of soup. And it
takes less than $100 worth of equipment to get started. We embrace
the credo of Charlie Papazian, whose book, ``The Complete Joy of
Homebrewing,'' is the bible for home brewers. ``Relax,'' Papazian
repeats again and again in the book. ``Don't worry. Have a
homebrew.'' Sometimes we get so relaxed we forget about brewing
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   And we did. We decanted Pierre's home brew, Celis Grand Cru,
into Belgian glasses. We toasted Pierre as the family kitten, Davy
Crockett, crawled onto his shoulder and tousled his hair with his
front paws. Awwww.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking beer while engaging in the art and science of
replenishing your supply is perhaps the chief benefit of home
brewing. It relaxes. It evaporates worries. And it aids focus on
the five important elements of home brewing: malt, hops, water,
yeast and a slavish devotion to cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
   Think of home brewing as building a home for your four main
ingredients, and then assume they cannot live harmoniously in
anything less than a spotless domicile. It's like making soup in a
restaurant the health department's coming to inspect.
</P>
<P>
   Home brewers use different methods to sterilize equipment, but a
special brush for bottles and a gallon of bleach is plenty
adequate. Before we picked up Pierre at the Celis Brewery, Mark
washed all the equipment in a solution of bleach diluted with
water.
</P>
<P>
   Beginners usually start brewing with malt extract, a thick syrup
created from the magical (hey, anything chemical is magical to us _
it's science and stuff) conversion of malted barley into the sugars
that yeast love. The yeast eats the sugar; our buddy alcohol is the
by-product.
</P>
<P>
   We started our extract in 10 gallons of water in the brew pot
that once was a half-barrel keg liberated from a big, evil American
brewer. The barrel's top is opened like a can and its bottom is
fitted with a spigot for draining the cooked liquid, which is
called wort. (Gnarly lingo is one of many benefits of home brewing,
aside from having an excuse to hang around drinking beer.)
</P>
<P>
   Mark acquired this modified wonder so he could cook on the kind
of propane burner folks use for shrimp or crawfish boils. He likes
brewing outdoors. His wife, averse to the lingering smell of malt
and hops in the house, likes outdoor brewing even better.
</P>
<P>
   As the water warmed up and a bemused Pierre looked on, we
steeped a couple of pounds of specialty grains in a nylon mesh
grain bag in a gallon of water on the stove. After an hour of
steeping to extract its malt sugar, the extract would be added to
the outdoor pot and the grains discarded, having nobly done their
duty.
</P>
<P>
   The entire crude operation amused Pierre, a man of European
stature who had to get up on his toes to get his nose over the brew
pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen this kind of brewing before,'' he said in a
way that cast doubt upon whether this was brewing at all. ``From
this you can make good beer?''
</P>
<P>
   We assured him it was so.
</P>
<P>
   He taste-tested our malt extract like Pooh Bear his honey. He
breathed deeply into our nylon mesh bag full of bright green
pellets of hops, dropped into the wort at various times to add
bitterness and aroma to the beer. He wondered if the coriander and
orange peel necessary for the spiciness were fresh enough.
</P>
<P>
   Blessedly, Pierre refused to pass judgment. When we dithered
over whether to stick to a grand cru recipe in one of Mark's
brewing books or modify it based on a few Belgian secrets Pierre
imparted, he turned oracular.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do this for your pleasure,'' heannounced. ``Make it once
like I make it and once like this. See which you like better.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre was sharing one of the great joys of brewing. With light
and dark, roasted and pale malts; with spicy and citrus-like,
bitter and mild hops; with hard and soft water and yeast strains
from all over the world, every beer you make is unlike every other
ever made. Only the industrial brewers have achieved numbing
consistency in their beers.
</P>
<P>
   This is why we invited Pierre. This man who had more than 50
years ago in Belgium learned to brew a 500-year-old recipe for
White Beer.
</P>
<P>
   Celis began brewing this tangy, cloudy beer made with wheat,
barley malt, hops, coriander and orange peel on his own in 1966. So
beloved was his beer that when his brewery burned to the ground in
1985, a European brewing conglomerate rebuilt it for him and kept
him in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Celis is considered one of a handful of the finest brewers in
America. His Belgian white beer is considered the American
prototype for the style. The white and the grand cru are two of the
most honored beers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   We admire the man's passion, and he was nothing if not a good
sport. He seemed flattered or at least perfectly comfortable that
his formidable reputation would not be threatened this or any other
day by dilettante punks like us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want only to have success with my beer,'' Pierre told us.
``How much money I have, I never learn that. I never in my life say
how much money I have in the bank. There is the success of my beer
and the pleasure I have in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   We wanted to hug the guy.
</P>
<P>
   As the wort was in the last stages of boiling, merging sweet
malt and bitter, aromatic hop flavors, Pierre bid adieu. We suspect
he just didn't want to stick around to help clean up. We didn't
give it a thought, occupied thinking we were the two luckiest home
brewers in the mortal realm. What could possibly go wrong on such a
perfect day? Our mood was enhanced by the fact that we were into
our second or third bottle of Pierre's precious beverage. It would
have been rude to stop in our esteemed guest's presence.
</P>
<P>
   At the completion of the boil, we dropped in a coil of copper
tubing with a hose attached to one end. By running cold water
through this wort chiller and out the open other end outside the
brew pot, you quickly bring down the temperature of the wort to a
level that will not kill the yeast. For the record, Pat was a
little wigged out because we didn't cover the pot _ this is the
point where the beer-to-be is most vulnerable to bacterial
infection, but Mark assured him that THIS WAS HOW THEY DID IT IN
MILWAUKEE ALL THE TIME. Pat relaxed. He did not worry. He had a
Grand Cru.
</P>
<P>
   We sanitized two carboys _ a jargony name for the kind of glass
bottles once commonly found on water coolers _ stuck a sanitized
filtered funnel in one and opened the spigot. We had a hard time
cleaning a persistent cloudy residue out of one of the carboys, and
the memory of that labor would come to haunt us. When both carboys
were topped off with golden liquid, we added the yeast, gave them
both a manly shake to allow the yeast more oxygen, kissed them good
night and tucked them in for a fortnight's fermentation.
</P>
<P>
   By morning, a creamy white head had formed at the surface of the
beer in both carboys in the garage. The yeast adored their new
homes, busily converting the malt sugars to alcohol and sending the
by-product, carbon dioxide, through a plastic tube fitted to the
top and into a bucket filled with water.
</P>
<P>
   For a blissful two weeks Mark checked the beer. When it appeared
that the carbon dioxide blow-off had slowed, he transferred the
beer into two other sanitized carboys, leaving behind yeast that
had done its job, gone to sleep and settled to the bottom. From
there it's usually a simple process of bottling and capping the
beer, waiting until it carbonates, then self-congratulation for a
batch well-brewed.
</P>
<P>
   Then: apparent tragedy. What happened next filled us with the
same sense of dread we feel at sports stadiums that carry only
Industrial Brau and Industrial Brau Lite. What was supposed to be a
week's rest for the beer before bottling turned into a brand-new
fermentation.
</P>
<P>
   As the beer bubbled all over again, the shimmering gold turning
to swampy ochre, we were certain the yeast had found something else
_ something unsavory _ upon which to feed. Carbon dioxide blew off
for three more weeks before the beer stopped growling.
</P>
<P>
   Was it contaminated as it chilled, or was the residue in the
carboy to blame? Probably not the latter, because the contents of
both carboys _ clean and close-enough-to-clean _ turned on us.
</P>
<P>
   Home brewers _ Charlie Papazian and the rest _ will tell you it
happens to everyone. Yeast is a living organism, as susceptible to
contamination as we are the common cold. No self-respecting home
brewer quits after a bad batch. You should try it. Really. It's
easy.
</P>
<P>
   The experts are right. Some of the best times we have had,
separately and together, have come over a brew pot and a passel of
cold ones. Talk to a home brewer, any home brewer, and you won't
get them to shut up. Pierre is right. It isn't about anything other
than the desire to make great beer.
</P>
<P>
   Our home brew shop suggested we bottle at least some of the
roughly five cases of skunky beer, let it age for a couple of weeks
and taste it to try to discern what went wrong. This is a first for
both of us _ a beer that needs to be autopsied.
</P>
<P>
   Then we drew off a portion of the brew, just to see how bad it
was. It magically cleared, its color a bit more amber than Pierre's
Grand Cru. We poured it into coffee cups. Not a trace of those
funny smells that warn you not to sip. So we did. This was
remarkably delicate, spicy and high-octane _ just like Pierre's.
</P>
<P>
   All that needless worry. Our grand cru was saved. Not to mention
our pride. After bottling, we intend to deliver some of this beer
to the Celis Brewing Co. for Pierre to try, confident that he'll be
kind.
</P>
<P>
   And in a week or so, after the beer has fully carbonated, Mark
will have Pat over for a couple of our own grand crus, to celebrate
and to discuss all those cracks about Milwaukee.

</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the outcome of Muhammad Ali's refusal to serve in
the armed forces in the 1960s? Were any criminal charges made
against him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. In 1967, Ali, under his previous name, Cassius Clay, was
convicted of violation of Selective Service laws by a federal court
in Houston, which imposed a $10,000 fine and five-year prison
sentence. He remained out of jail pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had advised Ali's draft board in
Louisville, Ky., to reject the fighter's claim of conscientious
objector status on three grounds: that his anti-war beliefs weren't
sincere, that they weren't based on religious training, and that he
didn't object to all wars. The board then rejected Ali's claim
without giving grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department later conceded that Ali's beliefs were
sincere and religious _ grounded in the Black Muslim faith _ but it
insisted that he didn't object to all wars, and the conviction
should stand.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court held that whether Ali opposed all wars was
immaterial, since the draft board had been wrongly advised and gave
no indication of what grounds it chose to disallow his claim. In a
unanimous ruling in June 1971, the Supreme Court reversed the
conviction and prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we contact Janet Reno by mail or e-mail to express
our opinion about her action in the Elian Gonzalez case?
</P>
<P>
   A: The mailing address: Office of the Attorney General,
Department of Justice, 10th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W.,
Washington, DC 20530. Comments can be made by calling 202-616-0019;
faxes can be sent to 202-514-5331. The Justice Department says
there is no e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I heard about a ``nine-alarm'' fire. We've
never known of anything more than a three- or four-alarm fire. What
do the various numbers of alarms mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The numbers simply refer to the resources needed to fight the
fire, as determined by the chief in charge. The higher the number,
the more units and manpower necessary to bring the fire under
control. A recent fire at a yacht club and pier in Boston was
nine-alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Iannone, senior editor of Firehouse.Com in College Park,
Md., said there's no national standard on what is meant by the
various numbers. For example, one alarm in a rural area might mean
a response from one fire station, and a second alarm means a second
station. Something even more serious would call for a general alarm
and an ``all call'' would mean all available manpower in a wide
area.
</P>
<P>
   But in Iannone's location, outside Washington, D.C., a first
alarm consists of four engine companies, two ladder trucks and a
rescue squad (involving seven stations), while a second alarm would
bring resources from another six or seven stations.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors, such as the types of structures, resources, and
manpower available at any given location, also figure into the
meaning of the number of alarms, he added. There's no maximum
number, but in many cities a ``general alarm'' means all available
manpower and units.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the $ symbol for dollar originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing and World Book
Encyclopedia explain that there's no definitive answer, but the
most widely accepted explanation is that it evolved from the
Mexican or Spanish P's for pesos, or piastres, or pieces of eight.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that it derives from US, with the S atop the
U.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the logo of Circle K, the popular
convenience store chain. Do you know where it originated?
</P>
<P>
   A: The K in Circle K comes from the name of Kay Misenheimer,
operator of three Kay's Food Stores in El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The stores were purchased in 1951 by Fred Hervey of El Paso who,
as a boy, already was showing a good nose for business with the
tried-and-true concept of ``location, location, location.'' He was
savvy enough to relocate his soda stand from one of the city's
busiest corners, where it wasn't always convenient for motorists to
stop, to outside his father's open-air theater, which proved to be
a natural.
</P>
<P>
   The Circle K logo was adopted in 1957, and was chosen because _
as a nod to El Paso's Western location _ it resembled a cattle
brand. The logo has been updated now with a bolder look to the K,
said Julie Igo of the parent Tosco Corp. But the basic logo has
been kept to emphasize the Western heritage of the convenience
stores, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the Federal Reserve do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Federal Reserve System is an independent agency of the
U.S. government. It helps oversee the nation's banking system
through 12 Federal Reserve banks and 25 branches.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, its most important job is to assist the U.S.
government in managing the economy by encouraging economic growth
and controlling inflation, pursuing these goals by influencing
interest rates and thus the availability of money and loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed gets no money from Congress. It raises all its operating
expenses from investment income and fees for its services. It
reports to Congress about its proposed policies, but is legally
free to make its own policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has a seven-member Board of Governors, with each member
appointed by the president to a 14-year term, subject to Senate
confirmation. A president normally appoints only two Fed governors
during a four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Much has been made recently of the lackluster academic
performances of both George W. Bush and Al Gore when they attended
Ivy League institutions. I thought that to be awarded a Rhodes
scholarship, as Gore was, a person had to have stellar academic
credentials. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rhodes scholarships are awarded in part to people deemed to
be potential leaders, with the aim of providing them an opportunity
to study at Oxford University in England. By definition, the word
``scholar'' implies, as you say, ``stellar academic credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem here. Gore was never a Rhodes scholar. He
received a degree in government with honors from Harvard University
in 1969, and after a stint in the Army attended Vanderbilt
University Divinity School and Vanderbilt Law School without
obtaining a degree from either one.
</P>
<P>
   You may be thinking of Bill Bradley, who was a Rhodes scholar at
Oxford from 1965 to 1967. President Clinton, of course, also was a
Rhodes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember reading that Clinton didn't finish his studies at
Oxford. Am I correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton didn't earn a degree at Oxford, if that's what you
mean. He attended Oxford for two years as a Rhodes scholar after
graduating from Georgetown University in 1968. He gave up a third
year of study at Oxford in favor of attending Yale University Law
School, from which he earned his law degree in 1973. In 1994,
Oxford awarded him an honorary doctorate in civil law.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the members of the three-judge federal appeals court
that extended a temporary ban on removing Elian Gonzalez from the
United States. Was their ruling unanimous?
</P>
<P>
   A: The order was issued by Judges J.L. Edmonson, Joel Dubina and
Charles Wilson. It was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the academic and professional credentials of Dr.
Irwin Redlener, who was appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to
advise the government about transferring Elian Gonzalez to his
father? Has he been involved in government duties before?
</P>
<P>
   A: Redlener is president and co-founder of the Children's Health
Fund, a philanthropic initiative created to develop and support
health care programs for medically underserved children. He's also
a professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine and lecturer in pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. And
at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, he's president of the
Children's Hospital, director of the Child Health Network, and
director of community pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   He received his medical degree at the University of Miami (Fla.)
School of Medicine and pediatric training at Babies Hospital of the
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, the University of
Colorado Medical Center, and the University of Miami-Jackson
Memorial Hospital in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Redlener has had many government-related roles, including
serving as co-chairman of the Healthy Start Advisory Group for
America's Promise: The Alliance for Youth, and chairman of the
National Advisory Council on the National Health Service Corps. He
also has been a physician special consultant to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He has been published, spoken and testified widely on health
care for homeless and indigent children, child abuse and neglect,
and national health policy. In 1993, he was vice chairman of the
health professional review group for the White House Task Force on
national health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Over the years, I've heard that Liz Claiborne, the fashion
designer, supports satanic worship. Can you shed any light on it? I
have boycotted buying her clothing.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's ``absolutely no truth'' to these rumors, said a
spokeswoman for Liz Claiborne Inc. She added that the rumor tends
to be circulated for a time, then dies out when people discover
it's not true, and then begins circulating again when someone else
hears and spreads it.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor sometimes includes the assertion _ also false _ that
Liz Claiborne talked about her ``devil donations'' on ``Oprah
Winfrey.''
</P>
<P>
   When the rumor first began making the rounds, the company
decided to respond to consumer inquiries on an individual basis
instead of launching a major counterattack in the media. That
seemed to work. The rumor hasn't affected the company's sales, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm considering building a shelter in my basement in case of
tornadoes. Do any government agencies provide plans?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has just what
you need to build a residential ``safe room,'' or have a contractor
do it for you. And as FEMA spokeswoman Mary Hudak pointed out, your
question is particularly timely, with storm season approaching and
the report of a recent survey of people in 15 tornado-prone states
showing that most residents have taken no action to safeguard their
homes and families.
</P>
<P>
   But there's help, and it's as near as your computer or your
telephone. Shelter information can be found online at
www.fema.gov/mit/saferoom, or you can call toll-free 1-888-565-3896
and ask for FEMA publication 320 (Taking Shelter From the Storm,
Building a Safe Room Inside Your House) and/or 320A. Publication
320 discusses different shelters, Hudak said, while 320A gives
details about specific construction techniques, specifications and
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Other useful tornado safety information can be found online at
www.fema.gov/library/tornadof.htm

<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the golf term ``fore''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The traditional vocal warning to golfers playing ahead that a
ball is headed their way comes from an old English word meaning
``in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a toll-free number for checking the Florida
Lottery's winning numbers?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to pay for such telephone information. The
winning numbers hotline, as it's called, is 1-900-737-7777. Callers
are charged 77 cents a minute (47 cents of which goes to Florida's
Educational Enhancement Trust Fund, the remainder to the provider
of the service). Results are available online at
www.flalottery.com. For all other Florida lottery information, call
850-487-7784.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering all the recent turbulence in the stock market,
can you refresh my memory about a formula that I thought was in
place to stop trading if stock prices fell by a certain percentage?
</P>
<P>
   A: In April 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission
approved three ``circuit-breakers'' for trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. As explained by Myron Greene, publisher of the
Mutual Fund Timing Guide, they are: (1) A decline of 10 percent
from the previous day's close will halt trading for one hour if it
occurs before 1 p.m., or for 30 minutes if it occurs between 1 and
2 p.m. A 10 percent decline after 2 p.m. will not halt trading. (2)
A decline of 20 percent will halt trading for two hours if it
occurs before 1 p.m. or one hour if it occurs between 1 and 2 p.m.
A 20 percent decline after 2 p.m. halts trading for the day. (3) A
decline of 30 percent at any time will halt trading for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The number of points represented by declines of 10, 20 and 30
percent is recomputed at the end of each quarter and rounded to the
nearest 50 points. The values curently are 1,050, 2,100 and 3,150
points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these circuit-breaker rules, the NYSE and Chicago
Mercantile Exchange also impose restrictions on index arbitrage,
called ``collars,'' when the Dow rises or falls by more than 200
points. CNBC alerts viewers when these restrictions are in effect
by displaying ``curbs in'' above the current value of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Vice President Al Gore had anything to say about the
execution in his home state of Tennessee of the convicted child
killer, Robert Glen Coe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Apparently not. Melissa Ratcliff of Gore's press office said
she had researched it ``and not found that he has said anything on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Henry O. Flipper, the first black West Point graduate, was
pardoned posthumously by President Clinton a year or two ago. The
Thomasville, Ga., native had graduated from the Military Academy in
1877. Where is he buried?
</P>
<P>
   A: Flipper, who was court-martialed in 1881 and dishonorably
discharged in 1882 after being accused of embezzlement, was buried
in Thomasville after he died in 1940 at age 84. The commander of
the all-black ``Buffalo Soldiers'' unit of the 10th Cavalry, he had
been acquitted in the court-martial, but found guilty of conduct
unbecoming an officer. In 1976, an Army board upgraded his
discharge to honorable, but the conviction stood. He was given a
posthumous pardon by Clinton in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although reports at the time of the pardon said the action would
clear Flipper's record and make him eligible for reburial at
Arlington, a cemetery spokeswoman said that has not taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our mail is delivered regularly between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. A
call to the local customer service number did no good and, in fact,
delivery has become worse. Is there still a postmaster general to
whom we can complain? What is the contact information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The postmaster general is William J. Henderson. Address: U.S.
Postal Service, Office of the Postmaster General and Chief
Executive Officer, 475 L'Enfant Plaza West SW, Washington, DC
20260-1200. Since you had no luck with the local customer service
number, you might try the Postal Service's consumer advocate in
Washington: 202-268-2284.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw the 1944 movie ``The Fighting Sullivans.'' I
know that two ships were named after the five Sullivan brothers. Do
you know any details about the first vessel?
</P>
<P>
   A: DD 537 _ USS The Sullivans _ was in service from 1943 to
1965. It's now a National Historic Landmark, berthed at the
lakefront Buffalo &AMP; Erie County Naval &AMP; Military Park in Buffalo,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   DD 537 is of the Fletcher class, the largest class of U.S.
destroyers in World War II. It took part in intense combat,
rescuing downed aviators, and earning nine battle stars. After a
Korean War deployment, the 376-foot-long, 2,100-ton vessel was laid
up, acquired by the City of Buffalo, and moved to the city's
lakefront naval and military park, where it's displayed along with
the USS Little Rock (cruiser), USS Croaker (submarine) and a number
of aircraft and military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of the Sullivan brothers was one of the oft-told
stories of World War II. The brothers, who stipulated as a
condition of their enlistment that they be permitted to serve on
the same ship, died in the Battle of the Solomon Islands when their
cruiser, the USS Juneau, was sunk. Their loss has been called one
of the biggest blows to any one family in U.S. wartime history.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy again honored the brothers when it christened DDG 68 _
USS The Sullivans _ in 1995. It's an Arleigh Burke-class guided
missile destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Two other Cubans escaping with Elian Gonzalez also survived.
What has become of them? Were they allowed to stay in the United
States, or were they deported?
</P>
<P>
   A: Arianne Horta, 22, and Nivaldo Fernandez, 32, were the other
survivors. At last report they were working for a car dealership in
Miami and hoped to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Age wasn't the only factor in the difference in their situation
and that of 6-year-old Elian. Immigration policy permits Cuban
refugees who make it to land _ as Horta and Fernandez did _ to
stay. Elian was rescued at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was really upset with myself when I forgot the Discovery
Channel's ``Walking with Dinosaurs'' recently. Is a tape of the
show available?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're in luck. The ambitious three-hour undertaking, which
marries live-action filming with computer animation and
state-of-the-art animatronics to re-create the ancient world of
dinosaurs, is available for purchase. Call 1-888-404-5969 and order
item number 165340. The cost is $24.95, plus shipping and handling
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between the new National Parks Pass and
the Golden Eagle Passport that I used to hear so much about? Both
cost $50.
</P>
<P>
   A: The new pass ``is more or less a substitute for the Golden
Eagle,'' said Paul Winegar of the National Park Service. It allows
entry for a year from date of purchase into National Park Service
sites that charge admission.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Eagle _ whose price has been raised to $65,
incidentally _ allows entry for a year from date of purchase into
other federal recreation areas as well, such as those managed by
the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Army
Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Winegar explained that you can buy the new National Parks Pass
for $50 and pay an additional $15 for a sticker that gives access
to all the sites allowed by the Golden Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   For information on the new pass, call 1-888-467-2757 or check
online at www.nationalparks.org/pass/html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on the cost of gasoline in Canada. For
comparison, can you give us some sample prices of the cost of
gasoline in Europe, where prices historically have been higher than
here?
</P>
<P>
   A: In Europe, where taxes account for about three-quarters of
the cost of gasoline in most countries, prices have approached the
equivalent of $4 U.S. a gallon for years. Gasoline prices in many
European countries have jumped at least 20 percent just in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sample national averages (changing local currencies to
equivalent U.S. dollars and quantities in which sold to equivalent
gallons) as of March 20, as reported by the Energy Information
Administration: France, $4.06; Italy, $3.93; and Germany, $3.77.
The U.S. average on the same date was $1.71. Britain's prices are
higher _ $4.66 a gallon _ because the value of the British pound
has climbed sharply against most other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The U.S. House of Representatives recently appointed a
Catholic chaplain. Some reports called him the first and only
Catholic chaplain of the House, but at least one newspaper said
there was a Catholic chaplain before. Which is correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Rev. Daniel Coughlin, who was appointed March 23, is the
first Catholic priest to become the House chaplain. The Senate has
had one Roman Catholic chaplain _ Charles C. Pise, appointed Dec.
11, 1832 _ which may be the point of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Since William Lynn, a Presbyterian from Philadelphia, was
appointed the first House chaplain in 1789, House chaplains have
come from nine denominations: Methodist (21), Presbyterian (17),
Baptist (8), Episcopalian (4), Christian (2), Congregationalist
(2), Unitarian (2), Lutheran (1), and Universalist (1).
</P>
<P>
   The first Senate chaplain was Samuel Provoost, an Episcopalian
from New York, also appointed in 1789. In all, Senate chaplains
have represented eight Denominations: Episcopalian (19), Methodist
(17), Presbyterian (14), Baptist (6), Unitarian (2),
Congregationalist (1), Lutheran (1), and Roman Catholic (1). The
current Senate chaplain is Lloyd Ogilvie, a Presbyterian who has
served since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported on House chaplains, which raised a question in
my mind. Doesn't the concept of having chaplains for Congress
impinge upon the separation of church and state? Also, why not
widen the base, for example having a Christian this time, a rabbi
the next, Muslim, Buddhist and so forth?
</P>
<P>
   A: Over the years, critics have charged that the practice of
official chaplains violates the concept of separation of church and
state. But in 1983, the Supreme Court upheld the practice as deeply
ingrained in the nation's history and tradition. The court stated
that the ultimate authority for the position lies in the
Constitution, which says the House and Senate each may choose their
officers, with no restrictions on what kind of officers may be
chosen. Using that authority, both chambers have chosen to continue
to elect an officer as chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   While all the official chaplains have been Christians, guest
chaplains _ who are invited about twice a month _ have come from
other faiths, including Judaism, Islam, Native American religions
and others. Regardless of denomination, it's expected that clergy
selected to serve as chaplain will do so not as a denominational
advocate, but as an individual pastor sensitive to diverse
religious backgrounds.

 &HT;    Mrs. Wrights' Sauce a condiment for all occasions
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Jamese Wright calls her mother`s sauce ``a
condiment.'' A peppery condiment.
</P>
<P>
   And it is unique. It's not a barbecue sauce _ though it goes on
ribs and wings. One backer described it as ``somewhere between
ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.'' But the texture is closer to
A-1. And the original is more spicy than sweet, made with an
abundance of peppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember as a child we used to sit in the kitchen and take
bread and dip it,'' the younger Wright says. Her mother always
cooked with it. Sometimes dinner would be spaghetti ``with those
huge hot franks, fried onions with tomato sauce and tomato paste,
and then we'd throw our sauce in it. Mom would mix the sauce into
hamburger and we'd put it on top. We would smoke with it and the
neighborhood would start smelling the sauce and come over.''
</P>
<P>
   Now customers who have bought Mrs. Wrights' Sauce have shared
their ideas for using it, adding it to Bloody Marys, spicing up
soups, stews and sauces as well as chili and gumbo. Some fans turn
to it as a marinade for beef and steaks, brisket and chicken.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce is available in the original spicy version and a mild
one created by the daughter to meet customer demand. She has also
came up with a spicy spread, a concentrate made with the
long-cooked peppers in the original sauce, to be used sparingly in
everything from a pot of chili to a cream cheese dip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for the people who are not weak of heart,'' she says.
``At home we call it the `boomerang spread.'''
</P>
<P>
   This month the pepper spread won a third place New Product Award
in Chile Pepper magazine's Fiery Food Challenge. The sauce also won
third in the meat sauce competition.
</P>
<P>
   Both the original spicy and mild sauce are made in Englewood and
retail for $4.95 for a 12-ounce jar. It is marketed under the
clever slogan ``How can you go wrong with Mrs. Wrights?''.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When Dayton Dragons fans buy their first hot dogs
and burgers at Fifth Third Field today, they'll find something new
alongside the ketchup and mustard bottles _ Mrs. Wrights' Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hometown sauce with an 115-year history. It comes with a
story of a dedicated daughter who went to bat for her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wright is Daytonian Bobby Wright, who took over as keeper
of the family sauce recipe 30 years ago. It had been passed down
from her great-grandmother, who created the sauce more than 100
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the special sauce would be just a treasured family recipe
were it not for Bobby Wright's daughter Jamese, 41, who was named
for her father James.
</P>
<P>
   Like her brothers, Jamese Wright had moved away from Dayton,
following careers first in the Air Force and later with an Austin,
Texas, firm that made computer parts. Then in the mid-1990s, her
father died. Her mother, an active woman whose jobs over the years
included being a model, an IRS agent and a Realtor, went into deep
depression. She stayed home, eventually retreating to her bedroom,
coming out only to feed the little dog her husband had given her
just days before he died.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jamese Wright became a victim of company
downsizing. She was planning to use her severance pay for a
sabbatical, starting with a cruise to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``But something stopped me,'' she said. ``I came home.''
</P>
<P>
   When she saw her mother's condition, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was losing her. I thought that if she knew I needed her help
that would bring her out of her depression. That's what gave me the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I canceled everything and I told her, `I've been telling you
for years you're sitting on a gold mine with this sauce,' and I
made her teach me how to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Mrs. Wright showed no interest in the project. But at
the end of two weeks her daughter knew how to make the sauce. She
became the fourth-generation keeper of the recipe. And she became a
daughter with a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took all my money and put it in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   First, she went back to Austin. A friend who had a restaurant
let her use the kitchen to start making and bottling the sauce.
Because of government regulations and the realities of setting up a
new business, it took months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold my first little 5-ounce bottle on Sept. 8, 1998, to a
customer who came into the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   And she sent a case to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's when she realized I was serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wright certainly acknowledged her daughter's ``gumption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `If she can do all this, I can get out of my
bedroom.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she saved her mother's life,'' Mrs. Wright says.
``That's what got me out _ the sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wright starting going to stores, marketing the family
sauce. Her first sales were to The Little Store and Christy's
Restaurant in the Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   She heard about the minor league baseball team coming to a new
downtown stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard they were really going to build it, I thought, `A
home team needs to use a home product.'''
</P>
<P>
   She met with Dave Levey, general manager for Sports Service
(which operates the ballpark concessions). Levy said, ``We keep
telling people we have to get someone local in here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I heard you calling and here I am.'''
</P>
<P>
   So her family sauce will be among the more familiar condiments
at the ballpark. And the two women may be on the way to their goal
of making Mrs. Wrights' Sauce a household word.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Jamese Wright has moved back to Dayton she has
added another dream. While she works at the Dayton Mall, she says,
``I'd like to have a little place where I can make the sauce and
sell it with some chicken and ribs.''
</P>
<P>
   And her 67-year-old mother, now a part of the dreaming, adds,
``We'd like to be downtown.''

   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Mattie Taylor Roundtree has a way of
opening doors for people, opening doors and pointing to what's on
the other side, and pushing people on through and out into the
world. That's what Mattie Roundtree has done in her 100 years. Open
doors. She knows something about doors slamming shut, too. Her
front door is good, solid old cypress, planed smooth and hung
straight in 1924 by her carpenter husband, Lloyd. The big
hurricanes of 1926 and 1928 didn't budge the door, or the frame
house Lloyd built on land he bought for $60, paying 25 cents a
week. But the land was low, wet, and Lloyd found a better location
nearby, high on an ancient dune up on 32nd Street in Riviera Beach.
``The men, they rolled that house up from the wet land. They rolled
it right up on tree trunks,'' says Mattie. ``Lloyd, he took care of
me. Me, I took care of Lloyd, and my family. But first was the
Lord. He came first. Lloyd understood.'' (Reid, Palm Beach Post)

America, along comes pet insurance. If not an entirely new concept
(one company's been selling the stuff since 1983 in _ where else? _
California) insuring pets is an idea that's taken off like Air Bud
in the last year. In some ways, it's a kinder, gentler process than
insuring humans _ policy holders get to choose their own
veterinarians, rather than spend hours sitting in some doggie HMO.
In other ways, it's just as bad _ just as many humans can't buy
coverage for partners or non-immediate family members, Internet

 &HT;    Our wascally agents laid egg in raid
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I've thought up a way the federal government
could appear a little less heavy-handed the next time it conducts a
raid involving an impressionable young child.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to dress up all of those menacing federal
agents in kid-friendly mascot suits _ you know, like Sylvester the
Cat, Tweety Bird and Bugs Bunny. ``Eh, what's up, Doc? Spread
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, thanks to our unimaginative federal government,
America has come across to the rest of the globe as a bunch of
mean-spirited, weapons-toting goons. Just imagine how less ugly our
country would have looked if that agent in the infamous Associated
Press photo had been dressed for the occasion in a festive purple
Barney outfit, instead of those scary, olive-drab fatigues. If the
agent taking 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives had
been wearing a Barney outfit and singing, ``I love you, you love
me,'' the kid might have been smiling for the birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Heck. He might have even pulled Barney's tail. Why scare the kid
when you can give him a chance to jerk your tail?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the outrage being directed at America is based on
perception. Would the raid to reunite the child with his father
have been viewed as quite so dastardly if our federal agents had
been decked out in a colorful assortment of Disney costumes? The
kid probably wouldn't have been quite so frightened if he had been
taken away by, say, Huey, Dewey and Louie. Or Yosemite Sam. Or even
the Famous San Diego Chicken. The Chicken could have plucked him
out of there.
</P>
<P>
   And if you had some short agents, you could always do the Seven
Dwarfs thing. They enter the home singing, ``Whistle while you
work. Castro is a jerk. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Would America look so nasty to the rest of the world if that AP
photo had shown a federal agent in an Elmer Fudd outfit carrying
one of those cartoon guns with a horn on the end? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of side advantages to my plan. For one, Janet
Reno's gotta look less like Miss Transylvania dressed in a Barney
suit than she does in those dowdy clothes she runs around in. Is
she taking fashion tips from the Addams family?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, when you start using Disney characters, that means
you've got an instant corporate sponsor. Think of the advertising
campaign. ``Where you goin', Elian?'' ``I'm going to Disney
World.'' Let Disney or Warner Bros. pick up the tab on the raid in
exchange for advertising. Save the taxpayers some bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, if the boy had been apprehended by agents wearing
theme-park outfits, he might be afraid to go to Disney World for
the rest of his life. Parents, as you know, that ain't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't anybody at the federal level have any snap? This is a
kid we're dealing with. The raid took place the day before Easter.
Put two and two together, you knuckleheads. Use your noggins for
something other than a bulletproof helmet. Why weren't the agents
dressed like the Easter Bunny and his chicken assistants?
</P>
<P>
   This raid would have taken on a softer tone if the agents had
been carrying gigantic colored polyurethane eggs. But since the
agents weren't carrying these eggs, they laid one.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   FILE 1 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the outcome of Muhammad Ali's refusal to serve in
the armed forces in the 1960s? Were any criminal charges made
against him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. In 1967, Ali, under his previous name, Cassius Clay, was
convicted of violation of Selective Service laws by a federal court
in Houston, which imposed a $10,000 fine and five-year prison
sentence. He remained out of jail pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had advised Ali's draft board in
Louisville, Ky., to reject the fighter's claim of conscientious
objector status on three grounds: that his anti-war beliefs weren't
sincere, that they weren't based on religious training, and that he
didn't object to all wars. The board then rejected Ali's claim
without giving grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department later conceded that Ali's beliefs were
sincere and religious _ grounded in the Black Muslim faith _ but it
insisted that he didn't object to all wars, and the conviction
should stand.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court held that whether Ali opposed all wars was
immaterial, since the draft board had been wrongly advised and gave
no indication of what grounds it chose to disallow his claim. In a
unanimous ruling in June 1971, the Supreme Court reversed the
conviction and prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we contact Janet Reno by mail or e-mail to express
our opinion about her action in the Elian Gonzalez case?
</P>
<P>
   A: The mailing address: Office of the Attorney General,
Department of Justice, 10th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W.,
Washington, DC 20530. Comments can be made by calling 202-616-0019;
faxes can be sent to 202-514-5331. The Justice Department says
there is no e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I heard about a ``nine-alarm'' fire. We've
never known of anything more than a three- or four-alarm fire. What
do the various numbers of alarms mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The numbers simply refer to the resources needed to fight the
fire, as determined by the chief in charge. The higher the number,
the more units and manpower necessary to bring the fire under
control. A recent fire at a yacht club and pier in Boston was
nine-alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Iannone, senior editor of Firehouse.Com in College Park,
Md., said there's no national standard on what is meant by the
various numbers. For example, one alarm in a rural area might mean
a response from one fire station, and a second alarm means a second
station. Something even more serious would call for a general alarm
and an ``all call'' would mean all available manpower in a wide
area.
</P>
<P>
   But in Iannone's location, outside Washington, D.C., a first
alarm consists of four engine companies, two ladder trucks and a
rescue squad (involving seven stations), while a second alarm would
bring resources from another six or seven stations.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors, such as the types of structures, resources, and
manpower available at any given location, also figure into the
meaning of the number of alarms, he added. There's no maximum
number, but in many cities a ``general alarm'' means all available
manpower and units.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the $ symbol for dollar originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing and World Book
Encyclopedia explain that there's no definitive answer, but the
most widely accepted explanation is that it evolved from the
Mexican or Spanish P's for pesos, or piastres, or pieces of eight.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that it derives from US, with the S atop the
U.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the logo of Circle K, the popular
convenience store chain. Do you know where it originated?
</P>
<P>
   A: The K in Circle K comes from the name of Kay Misenheimer,
operator of three Kay's Food Stores in El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The stores were purchased in 1951 by Fred Hervey of El Paso who,
as a boy, already was showing a good nose for business with the
tried-and-true concept of ``location, location, location.'' He was
savvy enough to relocate his soda stand from one of the city's
busiest corners, where it wasn't always convenient for motorists to
stop, to outside his father's open-air theater, which proved to be
a natural.
</P>
<P>
   The Circle K logo was adopted in 1957, and was chosen because _
as a nod to El Paso's Western location _ it resembled a cattle
brand. The logo has been updated now with a bolder look to the K,
said Julie Igo of the parent Tosco Corp. But the basic logo has
been kept to emphasize the Western heritage of the convenience
stores, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the Federal Reserve do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Federal Reserve System is an independent agency of the
U.S. government. It helps oversee the nation's banking system
through 12 Federal Reserve banks and 25 branches.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, its most important job is to assist the U.S.
government in managing the economy by encouraging economic growth
and controlling inflation, pursuing these goals by influencing
interest rates and thus the availability of money and loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed gets no money from Congress. It raises all its operating
expenses from investment income and fees for its services. It
reports to Congress about its proposed policies, but is legally
free to make its own policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has a seven-member Board of Governors, with each member
appointed by the president to a 14-year term, subject to Senate
confirmation. A president normally appoints only two Fed governors
during a four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Much has been made recently of the lackluster academic
performances of both George W. Bush and Al Gore when they attended
Ivy League institutions. I thought that to be awarded a Rhodes
scholarship, as Gore was, a person had to have stellar academic
credentials. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rhodes scholarships are awarded in part to people deemed to
be potential leaders, with the aim of providing them an opportunity
to study at Oxford University in England. By definition, the word
``scholar'' implies, as you say, ``stellar academic credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem here. Gore was never a Rhodes scholar. He
received a degree in government with honors from Harvard University
in 1969, and after a stint in the Army attended Vanderbilt
University Divinity School and Vanderbilt Law School without
obtaining a degree from either one.
</P>
<P>
   You may be thinking of Bill Bradley, who was a Rhodes scholar at
Oxford from 1965 to 1967. President Clinton, of course, also was a
Rhodes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember reading that Clinton didn't finish his studies at
Oxford. Am I correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton didn't earn a degree at Oxford, if that's what you
mean. He attended Oxford for two years as a Rhodes scholar after
graduating from Georgetown University in 1968. He gave up a third
year of study at Oxford in favor of attending Yale University Law
School, from which he earned his law degree in 1973. In 1994,
Oxford awarded him an honorary doctorate in civil law.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the members of the three-judge federal appeals court
that extended a temporary ban on removing Elian Gonzalez from the
United States. Was their ruling unanimous?
</P>
<P>
   A: The order was issued by Judges J.L. Edmonson, Joel Dubina and
Charles Wilson. It was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the academic and professional credentials of Dr.
Irwin Redlener, who was appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to
advise the government about transferring Elian Gonzalez to his
father? Has he been involved in government duties before?
</P>
<P>
   A: Redlener is president and co-founder of the Children's Health
Fund, a philanthropic initiative created to develop and support
health care programs for medically underserved children. He's also
a professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine and lecturer in pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. And
at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, he's president of the
Children's Hospital, director of the Child Health Network, and
director of community pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   He received his medical degree at the University of Miami (Fla.)
School of Medicine and pediatric training at Babies Hospital of the
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, the University of
Colorado Medical Center, and the University of Miami-Jackson
Memorial Hospital in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Redlener has had many government-related roles, including
serving as co-chairman of the Healthy Start Advisory Group for
America's Promise: The Alliance for Youth, and chairman of the
National Advisory Council on the National Health Service Corps. He
also has been a physician special consultant to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He has been published, spoken and testified widely on health
care for homeless and indigent children, child abuse and neglect,
and national health policy. In 1993, he was vice chairman of the
health professional review group for the White House Task Force on
national health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Over the years, I've heard that Liz Claiborne, the fashion
designer, supports satanic worship. Can you shed any light on it? I
have boycotted buying her clothing.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's ``absolutely no truth'' to these rumors, said a
spokeswoman for Liz Claiborne Inc. She added that the rumor tends
to be circulated for a time, then dies out when people discover
it's not true, and then begins circulating again when someone else
hears and spreads it.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor sometimes includes the assertion _ also false _ that
Liz Claiborne talked about her ``devil donations'' on ``Oprah
Winfrey.''
</P>
<P>
   When the rumor first began making the rounds, the company
decided to respond to consumer inquiries on an individual basis
instead of launching a major counterattack in the media. That
seemed to work. The rumor hasn't affected the company's sales, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm considering building a shelter in my basement in case of
tornadoes. Do any government agencies provide plans?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has just what
you need to build a residential ``safe room,'' or have a contractor
do it for you. And as FEMA spokeswoman Mary Hudak pointed out, your
question is particularly timely, with storm season approaching and
the report of a recent survey of people in 15 tornado-prone states
showing that most residents have taken no action to safeguard their
homes and families.
</P>
<P>
   But there's help, and it's as near as your computer or your
telephone. Shelter information can be found online at
www.fema.gov/mit/saferoom, or you can call toll-free 1-888-565-3896
and ask for FEMA publication 320 (Taking Shelter From the Storm,
Building a Safe Room Inside Your House) and/or 320A. Publication
320 discusses different shelters, Hudak said, while 320A gives
details about specific construction techniques, specifications and
plans.

<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the golf term ``fore''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The traditional vocal warning to golfers playing ahead that a
ball is headed their way comes from an old English word meaning
``in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a toll-free number for checking the Florida
Lottery's winning numbers?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to pay for such telephone information. The
winning numbers hotline, as it's called, is 1-900-737-7777. Callers
are charged 77 cents a minute (47 cents of which goes to Florida's
Educational Enhancement Trust Fund, the remainder to the provider
of the service). Results are available online at
www.flalottery.com. For all other Florida lottery information, call
850-487-7784.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering all the recent turbulence in the stock market,
can you refresh my memory about a formula that I thought was in
place to stop trading if stock prices fell by a certain percentage?
</P>
<P>
   A: In April 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission
approved three ``circuit-breakers'' for trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. As explained by Myron Greene, publisher of the
Mutual Fund Timing Guide, they are: (1) A decline of 10 percent
from the previous day's close will halt trading for one hour if it
occurs before 1 p.m., or for 30 minutes if it occurs between 1 and
2 p.m. A 10 percent decline after 2 p.m. will not halt trading. (2)
A decline of 20 percent will halt trading for two hours if it
occurs before 1 p.m. or one hour if it occurs between 1 and 2 p.m.
A 20 percent decline after 2 p.m. halts trading for the day. (3) A
decline of 30 percent at any time will halt trading for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The number of points represented by declines of 10, 20 and 30
percent is recomputed at the end of each quarter and rounded to the
nearest 50 points. The values curently are 1,050, 2,100 and 3,150
points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these circuit-breaker rules, the NYSE and Chicago
Mercantile Exchange also impose restrictions on index arbitrage,
called ``collars,'' when the Dow rises or falls by more than 200
points. CNBC alerts viewers when these restrictions are in effect
by displaying ``curbs in'' above the current value of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Vice President Al Gore had anything to say about the
execution in his home state of Tennessee of the convicted child
killer, Robert Glen Coe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Apparently not. Melissa Ratcliff of Gore's press office said
she had researched it ``and not found that he has said anything on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Henry O. Flipper, the first black West Point graduate, was
pardoned posthumously by President Clinton a year or two ago. The
Thomasville, Ga., native had graduated from the Military Academy in
1877. Where is he buried?
</P>
<P>
   A: Flipper, who was court-martialed in 1881 and dishonorably
discharged in 1882 after being accused of embezzlement, was buried
in Thomasville after he died in 1940 at age 84. The commander of
the all-black ``Buffalo Soldiers'' unit of the 10th Cavalry, he had
been acquitted in the court-martial, but found guilty of conduct
unbecoming an officer. In 1976, an Army board upgraded his
discharge to honorable, but the conviction stood. He was given a
posthumous pardon by Clinton in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although reports at the time of the pardon said the action would
clear Flipper's record and make him eligible for reburial at
Arlington, a cemetery spokeswoman said that has not taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our mail is delivered regularly between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. A
call to the local customer service number did no good and, in fact,
delivery has become worse. Is there still a postmaster general to
whom we can complain? What is the contact information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The postmaster general is William J. Henderson. Address: U.S.
Postal Service, Office of the Postmaster General and Chief
Executive Officer, 475 L'Enfant Plaza West SW, Washington, DC
20260-1200. Since you had no luck with the local customer service
number, you might try the Postal Service's consumer advocate in
Washington: 202-268-2284.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw the 1944 movie ``The Fighting Sullivans.'' I
know that two ships were named after the five Sullivan brothers. Do
you know any details about the first vessel?
</P>
<P>
   A: DD 537 _ USS The Sullivans _ was in service from 1943 to
1965. It's now a National Historic Landmark, berthed at the
lakefront Buffalo &AMP; Erie County Naval &AMP; Military Park in Buffalo,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   DD 537 is of the Fletcher class, the largest class of U.S.
destroyers in World War II. It took part in intense combat,
rescuing downed aviators, and earning nine battle stars. After a
Korean War deployment, the 376-foot-long, 2,100-ton vessel was laid
up, acquired by the City of Buffalo, and moved to the city's
lakefront naval and military park, where it's displayed along with
the USS Little Rock (cruiser), USS Croaker (submarine) and a number
of aircraft and military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of the Sullivan brothers was one of the oft-told
stories of World War II. The brothers, who stipulated as a
condition of their enlistment that they be permitted to serve on
the same ship, died in the Battle of the Solomon Islands when their
cruiser, the USS Juneau, was sunk. Their loss has been called one
of the biggest blows to any one family in U.S. wartime history.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy again honored the brothers when it christened DDG 68 _
USS The Sullivans _ in 1995. It's an Arleigh Burke-class guided
missile destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Two other Cubans escaping with Elian Gonzalez also survived.
What has become of them? Were they allowed to stay in the United
States, or were they deported?
</P>
<P>
   A: Arianne Horta, 22, and Nivaldo Fernandez, 32, were the other
survivors. At last report they were working for a car dealership in
Miami and hoped to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Age wasn't the only factor in the difference in their situation
and that of 6-year-old Elian. Immigration policy permits Cuban
refugees who make it to land _ as Horta and Fernandez did _ to
stay. Elian was rescued at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was really upset with myself when I forgot the Discovery
Channel's ``Walking with Dinosaurs'' recently. Is a tape of the
show available?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're in luck. The ambitious three-hour undertaking, which
marries live-action filming with computer animation and
state-of-the-art animatronics to re-create the ancient world of
dinosaurs, is available for purchase. Call 1-888-404-5969 and order
item number 165340. The cost is $24.95, plus shipping and handling
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between the new National Parks Pass and
the Golden Eagle Passport that I used to hear so much about? Both
cost $50.
</P>
<P>
   A: The new pass ``is more or less a substitute for the Golden
Eagle,'' said Paul Winegar of the National Park Service. It allows
entry for a year from date of purchase into National Park Service
sites that charge admission.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Eagle _ whose price has been raised to $65,
incidentally _ allows entry for a year from date of purchase into
other federal recreation areas as well, such as those managed by
the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Army
Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Winegar explained that you can buy the new National Parks Pass
for $50 and pay an additional $15 for a sticker that gives access
to all the sites allowed by the Golden Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   For information on the new pass, call 1-888-467-2757 or check
online at www.nationalparks.org/pass/html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on the cost of gasoline in Canada. For
comparison, can you give us some sample prices of the cost of
gasoline in Europe, where prices historically have been higher than
here?
</P>
<P>
   A: In Europe, where taxes account for about three-quarters of
the cost of gasoline in most countries, prices have approached the
equivalent of $4 U.S. a gallon for years. Gasoline prices in many
European countries have jumped at least 20 percent just in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sample national averages (changing local currencies to
equivalent U.S. dollars and quantities in which sold to equivalent
gallons) as of March 20, as reported by the Energy Information
Administration: France, $4.06; Italy, $3.93; and Germany, $3.77.
The U.S. average on the same date was $1.71. Britain's prices are
higher _ $4.66 a gallon _ because the value of the British pound
has climbed sharply against most other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The U.S. House of Representatives recently appointed a
Catholic chaplain. Some reports called him the first and only
Catholic chaplain of the House, but at least one newspaper said
there was a Catholic chaplain before. Which is correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Rev. Daniel Coughlin, who was appointed March 23, is the
first Catholic priest to become the House chaplain. The Senate has
had one Roman Catholic chaplain _ Charles C. Pise, appointed Dec.
11, 1832 _ which may be the point of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Since William Lynn, a Presbyterian from Philadelphia, was
appointed the first House chaplain in 1789, House chaplains have
come from nine denominations: Methodist (21), Presbyterian (17),
Baptist (8), Episcopalian (4), Christian (2), Congregationalist
(2), Unitarian (2), Lutheran (1), and Universalist (1).
</P>
<P>
   The first Senate chaplain was Samuel Provoost, an Episcopalian
from New York, also appointed in 1789. In all, Senate chaplains
have represented eight Denominations: Episcopalian (19), Methodist
(17), Presbyterian (14), Baptist (6), Unitarian (2),
Congregationalist (1), Lutheran (1), and Roman Catholic (1). The
current Senate chaplain is Lloyd Ogilvie, a Presbyterian who has
served since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported on House chaplains, which raised a question in
my mind. Doesn't the concept of having chaplains for Congress
impinge upon the separation of church and state? Also, why not
widen the base, for example having a Christian this time, a rabbi
the next, Muslim, Buddhist and so forth?
</P>
<P>
   A: Over the years, critics have charged that the practice of
official chaplains violates the concept of separation of church and
state. But in 1983, the Supreme Court upheld the practice as deeply
ingrained in the nation's history and tradition. The court stated
that the ultimate authority for the position lies in the
Constitution, which says the House and Senate each may choose their
officers, with no restrictions on what kind of officers may be
chosen. Using that authority, both chambers have chosen to continue
to elect an officer as chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   While all the official chaplains have been Christians, guest
chaplains _ who are invited about twice a month _ have come from
other faiths, including Judaism, Islam, Native American religions
and others. Regardless of denomination, it's expected that clergy
selected to serve as chaplain will do so not as a denominational
advocate, but as an individual pastor sensitive to diverse
religious backgrounds.

 &HT;    Don't let cracks in driveway turn into potholes
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When it comes to driveways, there are two camps:
those who care about cracks and those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   I place myself in the latter group. An occasional tuft of grass
rising through the pavement doesn't bother me at all.
</P>
<P>
   But whether or not you react to minor cracks, you have to do at
least a little routine maintenance to keep the little cracks in the
driveway from turning into potholes.
</P>
<P>
   Asphalt driveways should be sealed every few years, and larger
cracks and holes in both asphalt and concrete driveways should be
repaired before they spread too far.
</P>
<P>
   To repair and reseal an asphalt driveway, wait for a period when
temperatures are at least 50 degrees and no rain is expected for
several days. Also, no seed pods, leaves or other plant material
should be falling.
</P>
<P>
   If the driveway has no large cracks or potholes, the resealing
job is easy but messy.
</P>
<P>
   Repairing large cracks and potholes, however, is fairly labor
intensive.
</P>
<P>
   FIX LARGE CRACKS BEFORE YOU SEAL
</P>
<P>
   Asphalt-driveway sealing products can cover a crack up to about
1/8-inch during the sealing process, but a larger crack or hole
must be fixed before sealing.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks up to about 1/2-inch can be sealed by pouring in a liquid
crack sealer, which costs $6 or $7 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Start by using your hand garden tools to remove any plant matter
and dirt in the crack. A wire brush works well to clean down to
bare asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Asphalt crack fillers can be messy, and children and pets can
track the material into the house if they step on it before it is
dry.
</P>
<P>
   Sand sprinkled over fresh crack filler helps reduce the
potential for tracking. If you've got a deep crack, sand can also
be used to fill the bottom of the crack before using the crack
filler at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Larger cracks and potholes must be filled with ``cold patch,'' a
form of asphalt that comes in a bag, can or bucket. A 60-pound bag
costs about $6, and that's enough to fill a hole about 2 feet long
by 1 foot wide.
</P>
<P>
   To use cold patch, clean loose debris from the crack or hole.
Chip away asphalt at an angle so the bottom of the hole is larger
than the edge at surface level. (This is the hard labor part.) The
old asphalt rim at the surface of the hole will help hold the patch
in place.
</P>
<P>
   Pour cold patch into the hole until the patch is a bit higher
than the surrounding driveway. Tamp it down firmly. One way to
smush it in is to place a plywood board over the patch and then
drive across it.
</P>
<P>
   Use a liquid crack filler to seal the edges of the patch.
</P>
<P>
   Driveways also need to be clear of grease and oil before they
are sealed. If household detergents don't remove oil stains, check
hardware stores for chemicals designed for driveway cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Asphalt is made up of an oil-based adhesive that holds together
sand and bits of small rock. Motor oil spilled on the driveway
tends to break down the adhesive, so deep oil stains may have to be
treated with an oil-spot primer before you reseal the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   RESEAL ASPHALT EVERY 3 YEARS
</P>
<P>
   Asphalt driveways should be resealed about once every three
years to maintain their solid-black appearance and protect them
from cracking and oil damage. Sealing more often than that leads to
a buildup of sealing agent that cracks and becomes unsightly.
</P>
<P>
   Asphalt sealer comes in 5-gallon drums that sell from $7 to $20.
I found a wide range of prices for identical products, so a little
comparison shopping may be worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need a brush and squeegee for spreading the sealer.
Coverage varies, but about 100 square feet per gallon is typical.
</P>
<P>
   You must wear gloves, a breathing mask and eye protection. Also
wear clothes and shoes you're willing to throw away or use as work
clothes. Asphalt sealer can be sticky, stinking, sloppy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a tip: Buy your sealer a day in advance and turn the drum
upside down overnight. That brings sediments to the top of the
container, making stirring easier.
</P>
<P>
   Clear grass and plants from a couple inches on both sides of the
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Follow directions on the drum and spread the sealer carefully.
Work from the garage toward the street.
</P>
<P>
   When finished, place barriers at the driveway entrance, and keep
children and pets away until the seal cures. You should expect to
lose the use of your driveway for at least a day. Seals may look
dry in a couple hours, but read the can for an estimate of how long
the product should sit before you can drive on it.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of traveling scam artists who show up at your door
offering to seal your driveway at discount prices. If you want to
hire someone, check the Yellow Pages under ``asphalt'' and deal
only with companies you have checked out through the Better
Business Bureau or through references.
</P>
<P>
   REPAIR PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR CONCRETE
</P>
<P>
   You may have to visit several home-improvement stores, but you
should be able to find concrete-driveway crack-repair products
similar to those used for asphalt and in a similar price range.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to make a concrete repair
that perfectly matches the color of the rest of the driveway.
</P>

   Concrete driveways can be sealed every other year to prevent
water and ice damage, but not everyone thinks sealing concrete is
worth the trouble. A sealed concrete drive sheds water, and some
experts believe that slows the processes that cause concrete to
crumble over time.
</P>
<P>
   Sealers designed specifically for concrete sell for about $6 to
$8 per gallon, and a gallon typically covers 200 to 300 square
feet. Application is quick and easy, and can be done using ordinary
rollers or sprayers.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ I've thought up a way the federal
government could appear a little less heavy-handed the next time it
conducts a raid involving an impressionable young child. My
suggestion would be to dress up all of those menacing federal
agents in kid-friendly mascot suits _ you know, like Sylvester the
Cat, Tweety Bird and Bugs Bunny. ``Eh, what's up, Doc? Spread

   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Mattie Taylor Roundtree has a way of
opening doors for people, opening doors and pointing to what's on
the other side, and pushing people on through and out into the
world. That's what Mattie Roundtree has done in her 100 years. Open
doors. She knows something about doors slamming shut, too. Her
front door is good, solid old cypress, planed smooth and hung
straight in 1924 by her carpenter husband, Lloyd. The big
hurricanes of 1926 and 1928 didn't budge the door, or the frame
house Lloyd built on land he bought for $60, paying 25 cents a
week. But the land was low, wet, and Lloyd found a better location
nearby, high on an ancient dune up on 32nd Street in Riviera Beach.
``The men, they rolled that house up from the wet land. They rolled
it right up on tree trunks,'' says Mattie. ``Lloyd, he took care of
me. Me, I took care of Lloyd, and my family. But first was the
Lord. He came first. Lloyd understood.'' (Reid, Palm Beach Post)

(one company's been selling the stuff since 1983 in _ where else? _
California) insuring pets is an idea that's taken off like Air Bud
in the last year. In some ways, it's a kinder, gentler process than
insuring humans _ policy holders get to choose their own
veterinarians, rather than spend hours sitting in some doggie HMO.
In other ways, it's just as bad _ just as many humans can't buy
coverage for partners or non-immediate family members, Internet

FDA FAILING TO CONTROL MERCURY IN FISH, GROUPS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Envivonmental groups say that swordfish, shark, tuna, and other
seafood are laced with mercury, and that the US Food and Drug
Administration is failing to monitor or control the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some 36 percent of swordfish, 33 percent of shark, and 4 percent
of large tuna samples the FDA tested from 1992 to 1998 exceeded the
level at which it is supposed to take action, according to the
FDA's own data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the
environmental groups. The information was released Tuesday in a
report by the Mercury Policy Project, Clean Water Action, the
California Communities Against Toxics, and the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted ``a disturbing trend to conduct less and
less testing and to altogether cease monitoring for certain
species.'' For instance, said the report, the agency tested 13
samples of canned tuna in 1995, and none in 1994, 1996, 1997, and
1998. On average, Americans consumed ten cans of tuna in 1998, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally outrageous,'' said Lee Ketelsen, New England
director of Clean Water Action. ``It's the FDA's job to protect us
from contaminants in food, and they've abandoned that when it comes
to mercury in seafood.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercury exists naturally in the environment, but is also used in
thermometers and other products that end up in landfills and
incinerators and is spewed by coal-fired power plants and other
industrial sources. It gets converted to methyl mercury and climbs
the food chain; it can threaten the health of people with existing
neurological and developmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   A top FDA official acknowledged that sampling and testing have
waned in recent years, but said that this was due to the fact that
the agency exhaustively sampled and tested in the 1970s, when
mercury was a major concern. Its periodic testing since then has
shown no major increase in the mercury threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding now, we found in the '70s,'' said Gregory
Cramer, an FDA chemist in the agency's Office of Seafood. ``In
fact, we're probably doing too good a job of scaring people away
from fish, which may be causing even greater harm than mercury,
because people are ignoring the health benefits of fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the environmental groups say that if mercury is a recognized
problem in freshwater fish, with 40 states advising limits on fish
consumption, especially for pregnant women and children, it should
also be recognized as a problem in seafood.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that there has been a 25 percent increase in
fish consumption since 1980, much of it in the form of large tuna
sold as steaks or sushi. On average, Americans eat 19 pounds of
fish a year, 15 pounds of which is seafood, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Large ocean fish like swordfish, sharks, and tuna tend to have
mercury in them despite the vast waters they roam in, which
disperse pollution better than rivers and streams. That's because
the fish are old and at the top of the food chain, gobbling up lots
of smaller fish that may be riddled with mercury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the federal government's `don't ask, don't tell'
policy,'' said Michael Bender, the Mercury Policy Project's
director, noting the report's finding that the FDA is not
monitoring swordfish, shark, and tuna from domestic waters any
longer, and is inadequately monitoring those species from
international waters. ``If the FDA doesn't look for problems, then
it can't honestly tell anyone there are problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer of the FDA said that the National Academy of Sciences is
reviewing the FDA action level of 1 part per million of mercury in
seafood, and will issue a recommendation this summer on whether to
change it. But barring that, the FDA ``is comfortable'' with the
current standard.
</P>
<P>
   But two Democratic senators on Capitol Hill remain unconvinced.
Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy and Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin blasted the FDA
Tuesday for its ``troubling'' response to concerns they raised
about the agency's handling of the mercury threat in a
congressional inquiry last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA response to our inquiry confirms our worst fears,''
Leahy said. ``FDA stopped monitoring mercury levels in domestically
caught swordfish, shark, and tuna in 1998. Yet in one sampling,
three of the four fish tested in 1997 had levels exceeding FDA's
human health standard for mercury.''

<P>
   Nearly four decades ago, a new sedative brought the golden age
of pharmaceuticals to a tragic end. The drug debuted in Europe in
1957 as a treatment for nausea, and within a few years it was being
sold in more than a dozen countries to relieve morning sickness in
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, nobody suspected that drugs could pass from a
mother's bloodstream to the fetus. But by 1962, reports of
flipperlike limbs and other deformities in more than 10,000
newborns worldwide were linked to use of the drug among expectant
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious debacle in the history of drug development
would become synonymous with the sedative's generic name:
thalidomide.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the birth defects reached the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration before the drug could be approved for sale in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   But in July 1998, thalidomide came to the market. A New Jersey
biotech company gained the right to sell it for the treatment of a
debilitating complication of leprosy. Now, due to FDA regulations
that permit ``off label'' use of approved drugs, thalidomide can be
prescribed for any medical condition within a physician's
discretion.
</P>
<P>
   And the possibility of its widespread use is more than
theoretical: While it's unlikely to resume its former role as
either tranquilizer or antiemetic, thalidomide has already
demonstrated therapeutic potential against dozens of serious
diseases, including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Its own manufacturer has called it ``the most reviled drug in
history,'' yet thalidomide may be primed for a surprising comeback.
</P>
<P>
   In groundbreaking studies at the Rockefeller University in New
York, for example, thalidomide has shown promise in treating
symptoms of AIDS, tuberculosis and autoimmune diseases, such as
scleroderma, a life-threatening condition in which fibrous tissue
grows in the skin and internal organs.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists still don't know why the drug causes birth defects.
But as they discover more of its benefits, many are deciding that
thalidomide therapy is worth the risk _ as long as a patient isn't
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation of thalidomide began soon after its global
fall from grace. In the mid-1960s an Israeli doctor reported that
the drug not only eased discomfort in leprosy patients but also
alleviated the symptoms of erythema nodosum leprosum, an otherwise
intractable complication of leprosy that causes painful skin
lesions.
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide soon became the international drug of choice for
that condition. In the United States, the Public Health Service
distributed it at its leprosarium in Carville, La., beginning in
the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until the 1990s that work on the drug revealed its
versatility. Led by immunologist Gilla Kaplan, the Rockefeller
investigators found that thalidomide inhibits the production of a
substance called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) that
stimulates the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In patients battling tuberculosis, AIDS or leprosy,
overproduction of TNF-alpha causes such systemic changes as fever,
wasting and night sweats. Too much TNF-alpha may also be associated
with a host of diseases, including multiple sclerosis, some forms
of lupus, asthma, Crohn's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Studies
are now under way to explore the drug's potential in all these
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Most thalidomide research, however, is focused on combating
cancer. In the mid-1990s, scientists at Harvard Medical School and
Children's Hospital in Boston announced that thalidomide belongs to
a family of substances that curb the growth of blood vessels needed
to nourish tumors. These so-called antiangiogenic agents have
become a cottage industry in cancer research, and about 90 percent
of thalidomide prescriptions now go to cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the drug has proved most effective in treating multiple
myeloma, a bone-marrow cancer that is especially resistant to
traditional therapies. Results released last November from the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock showed
that thalidomide could boost survival rates even in patients who
had relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy and bone-marrow
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the first drug with solid activity against
multiple myeloma in more than 35 years,'' says Elias Anaissie,
clinical director of the Arkansas program.
</P>
<P>
   And because thalidomide doesn't work by the same mechanisms as
standard cancer treatments, he says, ``it's going to open new doors
for scientists to discover other agents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anaissie also cautions that thalidomide is no magic bullet.
While encouraging, its success in cancer treatment has been
limited, and some patients complain of side effects such as
drowsiness, constipation, and nerve damage (which may be permanent)
in the hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Freedman, a researcher in Kaplan's lab, says
thalidomide's effects are varied and complex enough to be almost
unpredictable. In addition to its activity against TNF-alpha and
blood-vessel growth, the drug is now known to stimulate
immune-system cells and other immunoregulators, sometimes with
unexpected results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thalidomide turns out to be a much more complicated drug than
anybody ever thought,'' Freedman says. ``You have to be really sure
of what the pathogenesis of the disease is before you give a drug
like thalidomide, because you could be aiding the disease instead
of eliminating it.''
</P>
<P>
   In two separate studies thalidomide therapy has been linked to
the unexplained deaths of patients suffering from graft-versus-host
disease _ a condition in which immune cells from transplanted bone
marrow attack host tissue _ and a severe skin disorder called toxic
epidermal necrolysis.
</P>
<P>
   And many observers outside the medical community remain
concerned about possible abuse of the drug. Distribution of
thalidomide to physicians and pharmacists is strictly controlled
and monitored by the FDA and Celgene Corp., the drug's
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide users are required to undergo counseling on the
drug's risks and to use reliable contraception while taking it.
Because thalidomide's disastrous effects on fetuses are known to
occur during the first trimester, preventing conception among women
taking the drug is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The drug's packaging includes printed warnings and a picture of
a thalidomide baby, and the pills themselves are stamped with the
silhouette of a pregnant woman bisected by a diagonal _ the
universal do-not-take-while-pregnant symbol that marks a drug as a
teratogen, a chemical that causes fetal deformities.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a repeat of the 1960s tragedy is inevitable as long as
thalidomide is readily available, says Randy Warren, founder of the
Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer thalidomide is on the market, the lazier people
will become about the warnings,'' Warren says. ``They're going to
start to feel safe with it again. Mark my words: Another
thalidomide baby will be born.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to prevent any tragedies,'' counters Celgene
president Sol Barer, who worked closely with the thalidomide
victims association in designing both the distribution program and
the drug's packaging. ``Our trade name is Thalomid, which is very
close to `thalidomide,' for obvious reasons. There should be no
mistake that this is a teratogenic agent. And people aren't taking
it for minor ailments. They're taking it for serious things for
which there is very little alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren's group and Celgene both support the development of
thalidomide analogues that would preserve the drug's beneficial
effects while eliminating its unfortunate ones.
</P>
<P>
   Celgene already has two families of such agents in clinical
trials, Barer says, and the first product of these studies could
arrive on the market within five years. It's unlikely, however,
that any single compound will match thalidomide's broad spectrum of
activity, he says; instead, different drugs will probably be
designed to target each of thalidomide's mechanisms of action. That
might be the most appropriate fate for a drug with a checkered
past: to retire the paterfamilias with the foul reputation and
divide the best of its legacy among a more benevolent generation.

<P>
   Nearly four decades ago, a new sedative brought the golden age
of pharmaceuticals to a tragic end. The drug debuted in Europe in
1957 as a treatment for nausea, and within a few years it was being
sold in more than a dozen countries to relieve morning sickness in
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, nobody suspected that drugs could pass from a
mother's bloodstream to the fetus. But by 1962, reports of
flipperlike limbs and other deformities in more than 10,000
newborns worldwide were linked to use of the drug among expectant
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious debacle in the history of drug development
would become synonymous with the sedative's generic name:
thalidomide.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the birth defects reached the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration before the drug could be approved for sale in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   But in July 1998, thalidomide came to the market. A New Jersey
biotech company gained the right to sell it for the treatment of a
debilitating complication of leprosy. Now, due to FDA regulations
that permit ``off label'' use of approved drugs, thalidomide can be
prescribed for any medical condition within a physician's
discretion.
</P>
<P>
   And the possibility of its widespread use is more than
theoretical: While it's unlikely to resume its former role as
either tranquilizer or antiemetic, thalidomide has already
demonstrated therapeutic potential against dozens of serious
diseases, including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Its own manufacturer has called it ``the most reviled drug in
history,'' yet thalidomide may be primed for a surprising comeback.
</P>
<P>
   In groundbreaking studies at the Rockefeller University in New
York, for example, thalidomide has shown promise in treating
symptoms of AIDS, tuberculosis and autoimmune diseases, such as
scleroderma, a life-threatening condition in which fibrous tissue
grows in the skin and internal organs.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists still don't know why the drug causes birth defects.
But as they discover more of its benefits, many are deciding that
thalidomide therapy is worth the risk _ as long as a patient isn't
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation of thalidomide began soon after its global
fall from grace. In the mid-1960s an Israeli doctor reported that
the drug not only eased discomfort in leprosy patients but also
alleviated the symptoms of erythema nodosum leprosum, an otherwise
intractable complication of leprosy that causes painful skin
lesions.
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide soon became the international drug of choice for
that condition. In the United States, the Public Health Service
distributed it at its leprosarium in Carville, La., beginning in
the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until the 1990s that work on the drug revealed its
versatility. Led by immunologist Gilla Kaplan, the Rockefeller
investigators found that thalidomide inhibits the production of a
substance called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) that
stimulates the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In patients battling tuberculosis, AIDS or leprosy,
overproduction of TNF-alpha causes such systemic changes as fever,
wasting and night sweats. Too much TNF-alpha may also be associated
with a host of diseases, including multiple sclerosis, some forms
of lupus, asthma, Crohn's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Studies
are now under way to explore the drug's potential in all these
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Most thalidomide research, however, is focused on combating
cancer. In the mid-1990s, scientists at Harvard Medical School and
Children's Hospital in Boston announced that thalidomide belongs to
a family of substances that curb the growth of blood vessels needed
to nourish tumors. These so-called antiangiogenic agents have
become a cottage industry in cancer research, and about 90 percent
of thalidomide prescriptions now go to cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the drug has proved most effective in treating multiple
myeloma, a bone-marrow cancer that is especially resistant to
traditional therapies. Results released last November from the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock showed
that thalidomide could boost survival rates even in patients who
had relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy and bone-marrow
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the first drug with solid activity against
multiple myeloma in more than 35 years,'' says Elias Anaissie,
clinical director of the Arkansas program.
</P>
<P>
   And because thalidomide doesn't work by the same mechanisms as
standard cancer treatments, he says, ``it's going to open new doors
for scientists to discover other agents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anaissie also cautions that thalidomide is no magic bullet.
While encouraging, its success in cancer treatment has been
limited, and some patients complain of side effects such as
drowsiness, constipation, and nerve damage (which may be permanent)
in the hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Freedman, a researcher in Kaplan's lab, says
thalidomide's effects are varied and complex enough to be almost
unpredictable. In addition to its activity against TNF-alpha and
blood-vessel growth, the drug is now known to stimulate
immune-system cells and other immunoregulators, sometimes with
unexpected results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thalidomide turns out to be a much more complicated drug than
anybody ever thought,'' Freedman says. ``You have to be really sure
of what the pathogenesis of the disease is before you give a drug
like thalidomide, because you could be aiding the disease instead
of eliminating it.''
</P>
<P>
   In two separate studies thalidomide therapy has been linked to
the unexplained deaths of patients suffering from graft-versus-host
disease _ a condition in which immune cells from transplanted bone
marrow attack host tissue _ and a severe skin disorder called toxic
epidermal necrolysis.
</P>
<P>
   And many observers outside the medical community remain
concerned about possible abuse of the drug. Distribution of
thalidomide to physicians and pharmacists is strictly controlled
and monitored by the FDA and Celgene Corp., the drug's
manufacturer.
</P>

<P>
   To anyone but a neurologist, Patrick Rennich's migraines would
seem a curse. With perverse regularity, they strike after he plays
sports like soccer or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before he's hit with nauseating pain on one side of his
head, Rennich experiences something called a visual aura _ a
neurological disturbance that starts with a slowly expanding blind
spot near the center of his left visual field. Soon after, Rennich
sees static, like on a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern is so predictable that Rennich, a 28-year-old
electrical engineer from Acton, Mass., can say, ``If you want me to
get a migraine with aura at two in the afternoon, I can.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what neurologist Michael Cutrer wanted. Based at
both Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and
Women's Hospital, Cutrer had been looking for someone like Rennich
for years. The neurologist hoped that a magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scan of such a patient's brain during the aura would provide
clues to what happens inside his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Cutrer asked Rennich and his wife, Jean, to come to the YMCA
next door to his research lab. The couple played games of free
throws, running sprints back and forth across the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, Rennich began to notice distortions in his vision
and hustled next door to the lab, where he lay prone inside the MRI
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The MRI monitored the activity in Rennich's cerebral cortex,
specifically the sections that control vision. Later, the results
would be processed and color coded _ red indicating areas of high
neural activity; orange and yellow showing lower levels; and white
showing the smallest amount.
</P>
<P>
   According to the MRI results, an area of darkness appeared on
the image of his brain, indicating that the neurons in a small
region of the cerebral cortex were no longer transmitting visual
information. The region grew slowly, ``like ripples from a pebble
tossed into a pond,'' Cutrer says. Rennich's aura had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Observing the brain's electrochemical activity during a migraine
aura is just one of the new routes to understanding the mysteries
of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists have long understood the physical evidence. Blood
vessels in the outer covering of the brain, the meninges, become
overdilated and hypersensitive to the blood coursing through them.
But finding the actual reason for headache pain has frustrated
neurologists for years.
</P>
<P>
   With developments like Cutrer's MRI the mystery becomes more
vexing. The path to the pain is clearly marked, but why that path
exists at all remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The activity of neurons, though complex, is usually predictable.
When the neuron is stimulated, sodium ions rush into the cell and
potassium ions rush out, leaving the neuron with a positive
electrochemical charge. This forces the cell to fire and thus
transmit information to other neurons.
</P>
<P>
   In a migraine sufferer, however, neurons cease to behave
rationally. Cutrer believes that during Rennich's aura, his visual
neurons began firing slightly out of sync with one another and not
in response to a visual stimulus. On the MRI this firing pattern
resembled a wave rolling toward a shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon, observed before only in animal experiments, is
called cortical spreading depression. The dark area on Rennich's
MRI, Cutrer believes, is a photographic record of this process and
reveals the progression of Rennich's expanding blind spot. The
scintillations of light that Rennich also saw in his aura, Cutrer
says, were most likely a result of sodium ions flooding and
overexciting the visual neurons.
</P>
<P>
   After about 30 minutes, Rennich's aura subsided, and he felt
relatively normal for nearly an hour. Then his migraine began. The
visual neurons, which had fired abnormally during the cortical
spreading depression, had released large amounts of potassium ions.
Over time, the potassium spread from the visual cortex to the
pain-controlling neurons in the meninges.
</P>
<P>
   These neurons, located in the walls of the meningeal blood
vessels, began to fire and released neuropeptides, telling the
brain to register pain and the blood vessels to dilate. The dilated
vessels then prompted the pain neurons to fire again. Essentially,
a pain-causing feedback loop was set in motion, creating the agony
of a migraine.
</P>
<P>
   In people with chronic headaches, the brain appears to be
sensitive to light and stress, hormones or quirky things such as
eating a raw onion or playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic tension-type headaches are similar to the ones everyone
has at least occasionally _ except that for these people they
strike almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   Migraines tend to affect one side of the head.
</P>
<P>
   Cluster headaches are an excruciating phenomenon that hits
mostly men. According to the first recorded description of such a
headache, dating from the 1700s, the sufferer felt ``as if his eye
was slowly being forced out of its orbit with so much pain that he
nearly went mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the first clue that the brain itself might be
responsible for headaches was discovered in the 1940s. Researchers
in Italy found evidence that the urine of those who had just
experienced a migraine contained breakdown products of the
neurotransmitter serotonin.
</P>
<P>
   The finding hinted that serotonin played an important role in
migraine headaches, but the process remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The idea gained momentum when researchers found that injecting
anyone with a serotonin-depleting chemical caused a migraine, even
if the person had never suffered one before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quest became to develop drugs that would mimic the effects
of serotonin,'' says neurologist David Dodick of the Mayo Clinic in
Scottsdale, Ariz. This approach paid off spectacularly, beginning
in the early 1990s with the release of a class of designer drugs
called triptans, sold under such brand names as Imitrex and Zomig.
For many sufferers, they can stop a migraine in mid-process.
</P>
<P>
   With new research, more possibilities for tailoring effective
drugs have emerged. The most promising research focuses on
understanding the role of another compound _ nitric oxide.
Neurologists studying headaches have long known an unusual fact:
When a heart patient places a small pill of nitroglycerin under his
tongue to ward off angina attacks, the nitroglycerin changes to
nitric oxide in the body and immediately dilates blood vessels in
the heart. Yet in some of these patients, it also triggers a
migraine attack within six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Jes Olesen, chairman of the neurology department at the
University of Copenhagen, says that by unlocking the precise action
of nitric oxide, researchers may be able to develop even more
potent antiheadache medications than the triptans.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, neurologists suspect that genetic
abnormalities may be at the root of some headaches. In the 1990s,
researchers traced the cause of a particularly rare type of
headache called familial hemiplegic migraine _ which is passed in
families as a dominant trait _ to a single gene on chromosome I9.
This chromosome codes for a component of a calcium channel in
neural membranes. By modulating the intake of ions into the neuron
cell, the channel controls when the neuron will fire. The mutation
leaves the nerves in the arteries around the brain in a constant
state of hyperactivity, causing them to register pain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, practitioners and patients search for more immediate
remedies. The triptans are far from sure-fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients explore alternatives, trying everything from
acupuncture to the bacterial concoction known as botulinum toxin
type A, or Botox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same stuff that people have injected into their
foreheads to temporarily paralyze muscles and reduce wrinkles,''
says Alex Mauskop of the New York Headache Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgeons noticed that Botox injections had a surprising
side effect: They seemed to keep migraines at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of cluster headaches, causes and remedies are even
more obscure. Cluster headaches tend to come in cycles, hitting the
sufferer once or twice a day. They are more likely to strike
smokers, can be triggered by alcohol and can often be soothed by
breathing pure oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   For now, patients are left to sort out their own treatments and
wait for the next phase of research for better drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably cool it on the basketball,'' Patrick Rennich
says. ``But I know now that the problem's not with me _ it's just
with my brain.''

has at least occasionally _ except that for these people they
strike almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   Migraines tend to affect one side of the head.
</P>
<P>
   Cluster headaches are an excruciating phenomenon that hits
mostly men. According to the first recorded description of such a
headache, dating from the 1700s, the sufferer felt ``as if his eye
was slowly being forced out of its orbit with so much pain that he
nearly went mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the first clue that the brain itself might be
responsible for headaches was discovered in the 1940s. Researchers
in Italy found evidence that the urine of those who had just
experienced a migraine contained breakdown products of the
neurotransmitter serotonin.
</P>
<P>
   The finding hinted that serotonin played an important role in
migraine headaches, but the process remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The idea gained momentum when researchers found that injecting
anyone with a serotonin-depleting chemical caused a migraine, even
if the person had never suffered one before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quest became to develop drugs that would mimic the effects
of serotonin,'' says neurologist David Dodick of the Mayo Clinic in
Scottsdale, Ariz. This approach paid off spectacularly, beginning
in the early 1990s with the release of a class of designer drugs
called triptans, sold under such brand names as Imitrex and Zomig.
For many sufferers, they can stop a migraine in mid-process.
</P>
<P>
   With new research, more possibilities for tailoring effective
drugs have emerged. The most promising research focuses on
understanding the role of another compound _ nitric oxide.
Neurologists studying headaches have long known an unusual fact:
When a heart patient places a small pill of nitroglycerin under his
tongue to ward off angina attacks, the nitroglycerin changes to
nitric oxide in the body and immediately dilates blood vessels in
the heart. Yet in some of these patients, it also triggers a
migraine attack within six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Jes Olesen, chairman of the neurology department at the
University of Copenhagen, says that by unlocking the precise action
of nitric oxide, researchers may be able to develop even more
potent antiheadache medications than the triptans.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, neurologists suspect that genetic
abnormalities may be at the root of some headaches. In the 1990s,
researchers traced the cause of a particularly rare type of
headache called familial hemiplegic migraine _ which is passed in
families as a dominant trait _ to a single gene on chromosome I9.
This chromosome codes for a component of a calcium channel in
neural membranes. By modulating the intake of ions into the neuron
cell, the channel controls when the neuron will fire. The mutation
leaves the nerves in the arteries around the brain in a constant
state of hyperactivity, causing them to register pain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, practitioners and patients search for more immediate
remedies. The triptans are far from sure-fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients explore alternatives, trying everything from
acupuncture to the bacterial concoction known as botulinum toxin
type A, or Botox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same stuff that people have injected into their
foreheads to temporarily paralyze muscles and reduce wrinkles,''
says Alex Mauskop of the New York Headache Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgeons noticed that Botox injections had a surprising
side effect: They seemed to keep migraines at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of cluster headaches, causes and remedies are even
more obscure. Cluster headaches tend to come in cycles, hitting the
sufferer once or twice a day. They are more likely to strike
smokers, can be triggered by alcohol and can often be soothed by
breathing pure oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   For now, patients are left to sort out their own treatments and
wait for the next phase of research for better drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably cool it on the basketball,'' Patrick Rennich
says. ``But I know now that the problem's not with me _ it's just
with my brain.''

<P>
   Nearly four decades ago, a new sedative brought the golden age
of pharmaceuticals to a tragic end. The drug debuted in Europe in
1957 as a treatment for nausea, and within a few years it was being
sold in more than a dozen countries to relieve morning sickness in
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, nobody suspected that drugs could pass from a
mother's bloodstream to the fetus. But by 1962, reports of
flipperlike limbs and other deformities in more than 10,000
newborns worldwide were linked to use of the drug among expectant
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious debacle in the history of drug development
would become synonymous with the sedative's generic name:
thalidomide.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the birth defects reached the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration before the drug could be approved for sale in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   But in July 1998, thalidomide came to the market. A New Jersey
biotech company gained the right to sell it for the treatment of a
debilitating complication of leprosy. Now, due to FDA regulations
that permit ``off label'' use of approved drugs, thalidomide can be
prescribed for any medical condition within a physician's
discretion.
</P>
<P>
   And the possibility of its widespread use is more than
theoretical: While it's unlikely to resume its former role as
either tranquilizer or antiemetic, thalidomide has already
demonstrated therapeutic potential against dozens of serious
diseases, including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Its own manufacturer has called it ``the most reviled drug in
history,'' yet thalidomide may be primed for a surprising comeback.
</P>
<P>
   In groundbreaking studies at the Rockefeller University in New
York, for example, thalidomide has shown promise in treating
symptoms of AIDS, tuberculosis and autoimmune diseases, such as
scleroderma, a life-threatening condition in which fibrous tissue
grows in the skin and internal organs.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists still don't know why the drug causes birth defects.
But as they discover more of its benefits, many are deciding that
thalidomide therapy is worth the risk _ as long as a patient isn't
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation of thalidomide began soon after its global
fall from grace. In the mid-1960s an Israeli doctor reported that
the drug not only eased discomfort in leprosy patients but also
alleviated the symptoms of erythema nodosum leprosum, an otherwise
intractable complication of leprosy that causes painful skin
lesions.
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide soon became the international drug of choice for
that condition. In the United States, the Public Health Service
distributed it at its leprosarium in Carville, La., beginning in
the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until the 1990s that work on the drug revealed its
versatility. Led by immunologist Gilla Kaplan, the Rockefeller
investigators found that thalidomide inhibits the production of a
substance called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) that
stimulates the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In patients battling tuberculosis, AIDS or leprosy,
overproduction of TNF-alpha causes such systemic changes as fever,
wasting and night sweats. Too much TNF-alpha may also be associated
with a host of diseases, including multiple sclerosis, some forms
of lupus, asthma, Crohn's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Studies
are now under way to explore the drug's potential in all these
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Most thalidomide research, however, is focused on combating
cancer. In the mid-1990s, scientists at Harvard Medical School and
Children's Hospital in Boston announced that thalidomide belongs to
a family of substances that curb the growth of blood vessels needed
to nourish tumors. These so-called antiangiogenic agents have
become a cottage industry in cancer research, and about 90 percent
of thalidomide prescriptions now go to cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the drug has proved most effective in treating multiple
myeloma, a bone-marrow cancer that is especially resistant to
traditional therapies. Results released last November from the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock showed
that thalidomide could boost survival rates even in patients who
had relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy and bone-marrow
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the first drug with solid activity against
multiple myeloma in more than 35 years,'' says Elias Anaissie,
clinical director of the Arkansas program.
</P>
<P>
   And because thalidomide doesn't work by the same mechanisms as
standard cancer treatments, he says, ``it's going to open new doors
for scientists to discover other agents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anaissie also cautions that thalidomide is no magic bullet.
While encouraging, its success in cancer treatment has been
limited, and some patients complain of side effects such as
drowsiness, constipation, and nerve damage (which may be permanent)
in the hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Freedman, a researcher in Kaplan's lab, says
thalidomide's effects are varied and complex enough to be almost
unpredictable. In addition to its activity against TNF-alpha and
blood-vessel growth, the drug is now known to stimulate
immune-system cells and other immunoregulators, sometimes with
unexpected results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thalidomide turns out to be a much more complicated drug than
anybody ever thought,'' Freedman says. ``You have to be really sure
of what the pathogenesis of the disease is before you give a drug
like thalidomide, because you could be aiding the disease instead
of eliminating it.''
</P>
<P>
   In two separate studies thalidomide therapy has been linked to
the unexplained deaths of patients suffering from graft-versus-host
disease _ a condition in which immune cells from transplanted bone
marrow attack host tissue _ and a severe skin disorder called toxic
epidermal necrolysis.
</P>
<P>
   And many observers outside the medical community remain
concerned about possible abuse of the drug. Distribution of
thalidomide to physicians and pharmacists is strictly controlled
and monitored by the FDA and Celgene Corp., the drug's
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide users are required to undergo counseling on the
drug's risks and to use reliable contraception while taking it.
Because thalidomide's disastrous effects on fetuses are known to
occur during the first trimester, preventing conception among women
taking the drug is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The drug's packaging includes printed warnings and a picture of
a thalidomide baby, and the pills themselves are stamped with the
silhouette of a pregnant woman bisected by a diagonal _ the
universal do-not-take-while-pregnant symbol that marks a drug as a
teratogen, a chemical that causes fetal deformities.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a repeat of the 1960s tragedy is inevitable as long as
thalidomide is readily available, says Randy Warren, founder of the
Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer thalidomide is on the market, the lazier people
will become about the warnings,'' Warren says. ``They're going to
start to feel safe with it again. Mark my words: Another
thalidomide baby will be born.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to prevent any tragedies,'' counters Celgene
president Sol Barer, who worked closely with the thalidomide
victims association in designing both the distribution program and
the drug's packaging. ``Our trade name is Thalomid, which is very
close to `thalidomide,' for obvious reasons. There should be no
mistake that this is a teratogenic agent. And people aren't taking
it for minor ailments. They're taking it for serious things for
which there is very little alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren's group and Celgene both support the development of
thalidomide analogues that would preserve the drug's beneficial
effects while eliminating its unfortunate ones.
</P>
<P>
   Celgene already has two families of such agents in clinical
trials, Barer says, and the first product of these studies could
arrive on the market within five years. It's unlikely, however,
that any single compound will match thalidomide's broad spectrum of
activity, he says; instead, different drugs will probably be
designed to target each of thalidomide's mechanisms of action. That
might be the most appropriate fate for a drug with a checkered
past: to retire the paterfamilias with the foul reputation and
divide the best of its legacy among a more benevolent generation.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   To anyone but a neurologist, Patrick Rennich's migraines would
seem a curse. With perverse regularity, they strike after he plays
sports like soccer or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before he's hit with nauseating pain on one side of his
head, Rennich experiences something called a visual aura _ a
neurological disturbance that starts with a slowly expanding blind
spot near the center of his left visual field. Soon after, Rennich
sees static, like on a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern is so predictable that Rennich, a 28-year-old
electrical engineer from Acton, Mass., can say, ``If you want me to
get a migraine with aura at two in the afternoon, I can.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what neurologist Michael Cutrer wanted. Based at
both Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and
Women's Hospital, Cutrer had been looking for someone like Rennich
for years. The neurologist hoped that a magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scan of such a patient's brain during the aura would provide
clues to what happens inside his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Cutrer asked Rennich and his wife, Jean, to come to the YMCA
next door to his research lab. The couple played games of free
throws, running sprints back and forth across the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, Rennich began to notice distortions in his vision
and hustled next door to the lab, where he lay prone inside the MRI
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The MRI monitored the activity in Rennich's cerebral cortex,
specifically the sections that control vision. Later, the results
would be processed and color coded _ red indicating areas of high
neural activity; orange and yellow showing lower levels; and white
showing the smallest amount.
</P>
<P>
   According to the MRI results, an area of darkness appeared on
the image of his brain, indicating that the neurons in a small
region of the cerebral cortex were no longer transmitting visual
information. The region grew slowly, ``like ripples from a pebble
tossed into a pond,'' Cutrer says. Rennich's aura had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Observing the brain's electrochemical activity during a migraine
aura is just one of the new routes to understanding the mysteries
of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists have long understood the physical evidence. Blood
vessels in the outer covering of the brain, the meninges, become
overdilated and hypersensitive to the blood coursing through them.
But finding the actual reason for headache pain has frustrated
neurologists for years.
</P>
<P>
   With developments like Cutrer's MRI the mystery becomes more
vexing. The path to the pain is clearly marked, but why that path
exists at all remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The activity of neurons, though complex, is usually predictable.
When the neuron is stimulated, sodium ions rush into the cell and
potassium ions rush out, leaving the neuron with a positive
electrochemical charge. This forces the cell to fire and thus
transmit information to other neurons.
</P>
<P>
   In a migraine sufferer, however, neurons cease to behave
rationally. Cutrer believes that during Rennich's aura, his visual
neurons began firing slightly out of sync with one another and not
in response to a visual stimulus. On the MRI this firing pattern
resembled a wave rolling toward a shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon, observed before only in animal experiments, is
called cortical spreading depression. The dark area on Rennich's
MRI, Cutrer believes, is a photographic record of this process and
reveals the progression of Rennich's expanding blind spot. The
scintillations of light that Rennich also saw in his aura, Cutrer
says, were most likely a result of sodium ions flooding and
overexciting the visual neurons.
</P>
<P>
   After about 30 minutes, Rennich's aura subsided, and he felt
relatively normal for nearly an hour. Then his migraine began. The
visual neurons, which had fired abnormally during the cortical
spreading depression, had released large amounts of potassium ions.
Over time, the potassium spread from the visual cortex to the
pain-controlling neurons in the meninges.
</P>
<P>
   These neurons, located in the walls of the meningeal blood
vessels, began to fire and released neuropeptides, telling the
brain to register pain and the blood vessels to dilate. The dilated
vessels then prompted the pain neurons to fire again. Essentially,
a pain-causing feedback loop was set in motion, creating the agony
of a migraine.
</P>
<P>
   In people with chronic headaches, the brain appears to be
sensitive to light and stress, hormones or quirky things such as
eating a raw onion or playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic tension-type headaches are similar to the ones everyone
has at least occasionally _ except that for these people they
strike almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   Migraines tend to affect one side of the head.
</P>
<P>
   Cluster headaches are an excruciating phenomenon that hits
mostly men. According to the first recorded description of such a
headache, dating from the 1700s, the sufferer felt ``as if his eye
was slowly being forced out of its orbit with so much pain that he
nearly went mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the first clue that the brain itself might be
responsible for headaches was discovered in the 1940s. Researchers
in Italy found evidence that the urine of those who had just
experienced a migraine contained breakdown products of the
neurotransmitter serotonin.
</P>
<P>
   The finding hinted that serotonin played an important role in
migraine headaches, but the process remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The idea gained momentum when researchers found that injecting
anyone with a serotonin-depleting chemical caused a migraine, even
if the person had never suffered one before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quest became to develop drugs that would mimic the effects
of serotonin,'' says neurologist David Dodick of the Mayo Clinic in
Scottsdale, Ariz. This approach paid off spectacularly, beginning
in the early 1990s with the release of a class of designer drugs
called triptans, sold under such brand names as Imitrex and Zomig.
For many sufferers, they can stop a migraine in mid-process.
</P>
<P>
   With new research, more possibilities for tailoring effective
drugs have emerged. The most promising research focuses on
understanding the role of another compound _ nitric oxide.
Neurologists studying headaches have long known an unusual fact:
When a heart patient places a small pill of nitroglycerin under his
tongue to ward off angina attacks, the nitroglycerin changes to
nitric oxide in the body and immediately dilates blood vessels in
the heart. Yet in some of these patients, it also triggers a
migraine attack within six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Jes Olesen, chairman of the neurology department at the
University of Copenhagen, says that by unlocking the precise action
of nitric oxide, researchers may be able to develop even more
potent antiheadache medications than the triptans.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, neurologists suspect that genetic
abnormalities may be at the root of some headaches. In the 1990s,
researchers traced the cause of a particularly rare type of
headache called familial hemiplegic migraine _ which is passed in
families as a dominant trait _ to a single gene on chromosome I9.
This chromosome codes for a component of a calcium channel in
neural membranes. By modulating the intake of ions into the neuron
cell, the channel controls when the neuron will fire. The mutation
leaves the nerves in the arteries around the brain in a constant
state of hyperactivity, causing them to register pain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, practitioners and patients search for more immediate
remedies. The triptans are far from sure-fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients explore alternatives, trying everything from
acupuncture to the bacterial concoction known as botulinum toxin
type A, or Botox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same stuff that people have injected into their
foreheads to temporarily paralyze muscles and reduce wrinkles,''
says Alex Mauskop of the New York Headache Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgeons noticed that Botox injections had a surprising
side effect: They seemed to keep migraines at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of cluster headaches, causes and remedies are even
more obscure. Cluster headaches tend to come in cycles, hitting the
sufferer once or twice a day. They are more likely to strike
smokers, can be triggered by alcohol and can often be soothed by
breathing pure oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   For now, patients are left to sort out their own treatments and
wait for the next phase of research for better drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably cool it on the basketball,'' Patrick Rennich
says. ``But I know now that the problem's not with me _ it's just
with my brain.''

<P>
   To anyone but a neurologist, Patrick Rennich's migraines would
seem a curse. With perverse regularity, they strike after he plays
sports like soccer or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before he's hit with nauseating pain on one side of his
head, Rennich experiences something called a visual aura _ a
neurological disturbance that starts with a slowly expanding blind
spot near the center of his left visual field. Soon after, Rennich
sees static, like on a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern is so predictable that Rennich, a 28-year-old
electrical engineer from Acton, Mass., can say, ``If you want me to
get a migraine with aura at two in the afternoon, I can.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what neurologist Michael Cutrer wanted. Based at
both Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and
Women's Hospital, Cutrer had been looking for someone like Rennich
for years. The neurologist hoped that a magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scan of such a patient's brain during the aura would provide
clues to what happens inside his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Cutrer asked Rennich and his wife, Jean, to come to the YMCA
next door to his research lab. The couple played games of free
throws, running sprints back and forth across the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, Rennich began to notice distortions in his vision
and hustled next door to the lab, where he lay prone inside the MRI
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The MRI monitored the activity in Rennich's cerebral cortex,
specifically the sections that control vision. Later, the results
would be processed and color coded _ red indicating areas of high
neural activity; orange and yellow showing lower levels; and white
showing the smallest amount.
</P>
<P>
   According to the MRI results, an area of darkness appeared on
the image of his brain, indicating that the neurons in a small
region of the cerebral cortex were no longer transmitting visual
information. The region grew slowly, ``like ripples from a pebble
tossed into a pond,'' Cutrer says. Rennich's aura had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Observing the brain's electrochemical activity during a migraine
aura is just one of the new routes to understanding the mysteries
of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists have long understood the physical evidence. Blood
vessels in the outer covering of the brain, the meninges, become
overdilated and hypersensitive to the blood coursing through them.
But finding the actual reason for headache pain has frustrated
neurologists for years.
</P>
<P>
   With developments like Cutrer's MRI the mystery becomes more
vexing. The path to the pain is clearly marked, but why that path
exists at all remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The activity of neurons, though complex, is usually predictable.
When the neuron is stimulated, sodium ions rush into the cell and
potassium ions rush out, leaving the neuron with a positive
electrochemical charge. This forces the cell to fire and thus
transmit information to other neurons.
</P>
<P>
   In a migraine sufferer, however, neurons cease to behave
rationally. Cutrer believes that during Rennich's aura, his visual
neurons began firing slightly out of sync with one another and not
in response to a visual stimulus. On the MRI this firing pattern
resembled a wave rolling toward a shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon, observed before only in animal experiments, is
called cortical spreading depression. The dark area on Rennich's
MRI, Cutrer believes, is a photographic record of this process and
reveals the progression of Rennich's expanding blind spot. The
scintillations of light that Rennich also saw in his aura, Cutrer
says, were most likely a result of sodium ions flooding and
overexciting the visual neurons.

 &HT;    WRESTLING GRAPEVINE
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As World Championship Wrestling continues its rise, Extreme
Championship Wrestling is starting to slip away from contending
with the Big 2. The slide might continue after a less than
successful ``Cyberslam 2000'' event last week. First to the mat was
Justin Credible, who took the ECW title belt from Tommy Dreamer
moments after Dreamer beat WWF wrestler and ECW champion Tazz for
the belt. The title change means Credible will meet his tag team
partner Lance Storm, and Dreamer in a 3-way match for the title at
the ``Hardcore Heaven'' pay-per-view in May. But why would ECW want
to split up the Impact Players (Credible and Storm)? Two reasons:
one, because their gimmick is getting stale; and two, Storm may be
ready to jump to WCW. If he does leave, ECW would like to get a new
partner in crime for Credible or turn him to a face _ something he
has never been in ECW.
</P>
<P>
   The other main problem to come out from the convention was ECW
owner Paul Heyman's tirade on his most recognized wrestler, Raven.
Raven, who left ECW for WCW only to return to a hero's welcome last
fall, has struggled to get healthy. He had shoulder surgery before
returning to ECW. Heyman said he was less than pleased with Raven's
work ethic. While this may be an angle, those in attendance said
his words were disappointing. Heyman is caught between a rock and a
hard place because he has just lost his champion (Mike Awesome) and
is running low on star power.
</P>
<P>
   Another big signing for WCW.
</P>
<P>
   Former WWF Intercontinental champion, ``Marvelous'' Marc Mero,
agreed to terms with WCW last week. Mero was in the WCW as Johnny
B. Badd in the early 1990s before becoming a champion in the WWF.
While Mero's signing is important, the bonus is Mero's wife, Rena.
Maybe you knew her as Sable. While the WWF stripped her of that
name when she left in 1999, she could pop up on WCW at the end of
this year if WCW's attorneys can make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the law, New York state Sen. Thomas Libous recommend
a bill that would force wrestlers competing in New York to undergo
mandatory drug testing. The bill is meeting with obvious disdain
from the WWF. ``We are performers, we are showmen, he'd be drug
testing everyone on Broadway. He'd be drug testing the circus,''
WWF Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon told the Associated Press.
``If in fact he's trying to single us out, that is
unconstitutional.'' Currently to wrestle in New York, wrestlers
must give references, divulge any criminal history and submit to a
pre-match physical. Libous' proposal would penalize wrestlers who
tested positive for drugs, by prohibiting them from wrestling in
the state for 24 hours. A second positive test would strip them of
their license for a year and fine their sponsors $25,000. A third
negative result would mean a permanent ban from New York
competition and $100,000 fine for the sponsors. Last year, Oregon
passed similar legislation. The result: a boycott of the state by
the WWF. McMahon and the WWF won't be able to do the same in New
York where Madison Square Garden has hosted some of the biggest
events in WWF history. The WWF also makes 2-to-3 stops a year in
New York cities.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Mysterio Jr. plans to return to WCW television soon.
Although he won't be in the ring until June.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday will be WWF's ``Backlash'' pay-per-view and it seems
to be suffering from ``Wrestlemania'' hangover. The main event will
see Triple H meet The Rock for his WWF title. To add some meat to
this repeat of Wrestlemania, the WWF is dragging out injured 'Stone
Cold' Steve Austin and maybe even retired Shawn Michaels. While
Austin is trying to return to active competition from his neck
surgery, he is at least a few months away from getting in the ring.
And banking on him to draw in the fans will only lead to
disappointment. Coming off the disappointing ``Wrestlemania,'' the
WWF could be opening the door for the WCW to get back in the
ratings' race.
</P>
<P>
   My only prediction for ``Backlash'' is the main event. The past
two weeks has been setting up Austin to double-cross The Rock,
which means that will not happen. WWF has been toying with the idea
of turning either Rock or Austin heel, but it doesn't make sense
with Austin still not ready to return to the ring. So expect to see
Rock to lose, Austin to be involved in a move that was going to
help the Rock, but ended up putting Rock in a losing situation,
with one of the McMahons completing the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Here's something to look for in the WWF after ``Backlash.''
Expect the Dudley Boyz to feud with the Acolytes. Another change of
events could be Rikishi turning heel and starting a major feud with
The Big Show. Also, coming off two straight ``Raw'' main events,
Chris Jericho is starting to get the push many expected from him
when he came over from the WCW last year. He is an early favorite
to win the ``King of the Ring'' pay-per-view in June. Finally, the
WWF will make a run at WCW high-flyer Juventud Guerrero as soon as
his WCW deal expires.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for porn superstar Jenna Jameson in the WWF anytime
soon. One of the hottest rumors on the internet is that the
actress, who has worked as a correspondent for E! Entertainment
television, was talking about a job with the WWF. While the WWF has
a wrestler who claims to be a former male porn star on its roster,
to have a real, live porn actress in the ranks seemed to be pushing
the bounds of taste.
</P>
<P>
   The second hottest rumor last week was that out-of-work, NBA bad
boy Dennis Rodman was talking to WCW about returning. If 'The Worm'
is going to turn up my best guess is it will be at ``Bash At the
Beach,'' where he debuted in 1996.

   Norman Reedus knew he stood a good chance of losing his
anonymity when he became a movie actor and began dating one-time
supermodel Helena Christensen. But the meaning of celebrity didn't
fully sink in, he says, until one day a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He logged onto the Internet, did a search of his own name and
ended up in a chat room in which the main topic of conversation was
his and Christensen's relationship and what a horrible name they'd
given their newborn son: Mingus.
</P>
<P>
   Reedus, whose skin has yet to thicken, says he fired off a
defensive e-mail and got an embarrassed apology in return.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sitting in the Chateau Marmont with Christensen, who's
holding Mingus, he quickly explains that they named the baby for
jazz bandleader Charlie Mingus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babies are amazing,'' says Reedus, 31. ``So honest and
instinctual.''
</P>
<P>
   The infant has already been to Asia and Europe with his
globetrotting parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think my life was hectic,'' Christensen says before
excusing herself to join friends for lunch at a nearby table, ``but
I didn't know what hectic was until I had a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one can deny that Reedus' young career has been on a
tear of late. After his appearance in 1997's ``Mimic,'' with Mira
Sorvino, he made a string of dark, mostly little-seen movies. But
he got noticed in ``Six Ways to Sunday'' as a serial killer with
Oedipal issues.
</P>
<P>
   His rough-edged appeal is about to be seen in Warner Bros.'
``Gossip,'' a college drama with Kate Hudson. Reedus says going
mainstream was not a conscious decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I choose roles based on how interesting they are to me,'' he
says. ``It's not about the length of the trailer.'' But he admits
big-budget movies aren't so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I was used to only having two takes per scene, but I
could get used to having 15 takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now, he says, he'll begin to get as much recognition for
his acting as for the Prada ads he appeared in two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken, like, six pictures in my life, and I still get the
model-turned-actor thing,'' he says. ``I feel like I'm going to be
called an `up and comer' forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Reedus has recently wrapped ``Beats,'' not to be confused with
his other upcoming movie, a comedy called ``The Beat Nicks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beats'' chronicles the murder of Joan Burroughs (Courtney
Love) by her husband, William. Reedus plays Lucien Carr, who had an
affair with Joan.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy whose loud, drunken outburst at a party caught
the attention of a theater director, who promptly cast him in a
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play was just a drag,'' Reedus says, ``standing around
doing the same thing every night.'' But an agent saw it one evening
and signed him up.
</P>
<P>
   Reedus left his L.A. home at 12 to train for the pro-tennis
tour. He quit in his teens and moved to London, then Japan, with
his mother, eventually making his way back to L.A., where he eked
out a living painting abstracts and repairing motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Previously linked with model Bridget Hall, Reedus met
Christensen at the hip L.A. bar R-23. He hadn't particularly
thought about having children.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when Helena and I met,'' he says, ``we started trying to
have one immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The first night they spent together, he remembers with a smile,
was right here at the Chateau Marmont. Perhaps it was their
combustible chemistry, perhaps it was a candle or a cigarette, but
Reedus says a pillow caught fire, and they had to extinguish it in
the bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they ever found that pillow,'' he says. ``I
hope not.'' &QL;

<P>
   Fitness trainer and Fitball enthusiast Ari Weller admits he's a
bit of a weirdo. He was once kicked out of his health-club job
because he wanted space to do cartwheels.
</P>
<P>
   Now, from his 23rd Street studio in New York City, Weller has
become the pied piper for a new, minimalist exercise movement that
could make the traditional gym a relic of the mechanical age.
</P>
<P>
   His followers? Sean (Puffy) Combs, model Chandra North and
scores of Manhattan professionals.
</P>
<P>
   His idea? That one rubber ball replaces weights, benches, and
step machines to provide a demanding workout and produce a lean,
cut body.
</P>
<P>
   With his shaved head, deep brown eyes and uniform of baggy army
trousers, Weller could be mistaken for a monk _ or maybe a
snowboarder. What he calls his ``new bohemian'' movement classes
are so organic, they don't even require sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was to open up a gym without any equipment,'' Weller
says. ``If you had a tree, you could use a tree. In my case, I take
balls and resistance bands. It's a natural workout, without
machines or TVs to tap you out of the experience. Keeping your mind
involved is sort of the point.''
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is required to work out with Weller?
</P>
<P>
   ``A leap of faith and a good deal of humility,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His movement class starts out innocently enough, with shoulder
rolls, head rolls and face, mouth and eyeball stretches. Then on to
frog leaps, crab crawls and snail slides up and down the length of
the room, ending with monkey cartwheels.
</P>
<P>
   When Weller demonstrates the monkey, his body is transformed:
His arms appear longer and he all but shrieks.
</P>
<P>
   ``His alter ego is Curious George,'' jokes one student.
</P>
<P>
   Weller uses the ball primarily for his one-to-one training.
Fitballs have been endorsed by orthopedic surgeons since the '60s,
so they're nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the possibilities are infinite,'' Weller says. ``Sitting
on the ball, for one, is not easy. And it allows you to make a
total connection with your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Coburn, a bond trader who has trained with Weller for
years, says, ``I'm more fit now than I've ever been. I used to be a
big weight lifter, but now I really know how to use my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Weller's technique is dynamic and constantly changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think how at kids' gyms they're running all over the place,''
he says. ``They're tumbling, rolling, jumping. I'm doing that for
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   He integrates movements from yoga, martial arts and dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare the way a bodybuilder and a martial artist moves,'' he
says, ``ones walks like a robot, one flows like water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been too much emphasis on exercising to look good,''
he continues. ``These exercises address a bigger priority _
longevity, dealing with life's circumstances, getting old, slipping
on ice, getting out of the way of a taxi. The irony is that when
you stop doing sport just for vanity, you end up looking better
than you've ever looked.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a higher level of exercise seems to be the craze du jour
_ even diehard gyms like Equinox are dragging yoga masters in with
the barbells. But Weller takes a practical view.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go from Ninth Avenue to Nirvana in an hour,'' he
says. ``I'm not promising instant physical perfection or spiritual
enlightenment. If somebody finds those things in my class ...
hallelujah! Glad I could help.''

   Norman Reedus knew he stood a good chance of losing his
anonymity when he became a movie actor and began dating one-time
supermodel Helena Christensen. But the meaning of celebrity didn't
fully sink in, he says, until one day a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He logged onto the Internet, did a search of his own name and
ended up in a chat room in which the main topic of conversation was
his and Christensen's relationship and what a horrible name they'd
given their newborn son: Mingus.
</P>
<P>
   Reedus, whose skin has yet to thicken, says he fired off a
defensive e-mail and got an embarrassed apology in return.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sitting in the Chateau Marmont with Christensen, who's
holding Mingus, he quickly explains that they named the baby for
jazz bandleader Charlie Mingus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babies are amazing,'' says Reedus, 31. ``So honest and
instinctual.''
</P>
<P>
   The infant has already been to Asia and Europe with his
globetrotting parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think my life was hectic,'' Christensen says before
excusing herself to join friends for lunch at a nearby table, ``but
I didn't know what hectic was until I had a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one can deny that Reedus' young career has been on a
tear of late. After his appearance in 1997's ``Mimic,'' with Mira
Sorvino, he made a string of dark, mostly little-seen movies. But
he got noticed in ``Six Ways to Sunday'' as a serial killer with
Oedipal issues.
</P>
<P>
   His rough-edged appeal is about to be seen in Warner Bros.'
``Gossip,'' a college drama with Kate Hudson. Reedus says going
mainstream was not a conscious decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I choose roles based on how interesting they are to me,'' he
says. ``It's not about the length of the trailer.'' But he admits
big-budget movies aren't so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I was used to only having two takes per scene, but I
could get used to having 15 takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now, he says, he'll begin to get as much recognition for
his acting as for the Prada ads he appeared in two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken, like, six pictures in my life, and I still get the
model-turned-actor thing,'' he says. ``I feel like I'm going to be
called an `up and comer' forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Reedus has recently wrapped ``Beats,'' not to be confused with
his other upcoming movie, a comedy called ``The Beat Nicks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beats'' chronicles the murder of Joan Burroughs (Courtney

<P>
   ``The play was just a drag,'' Reedus says, ``standing around

   Reedus left his L.A. home at 12 to train for the pro-tennis
tour. He quit in his teens and moved to London, then Japan, with
his mother, eventually making his way back to L.A., where he eked
out a living painting abstracts and repairing motorcycles.

   The first night they spent together, he remembers with a smile,
was right here at the Chateau Marmont. Perhaps it was their
combustible chemistry, perhaps it was a candle or a cigarette, but
Reedus says a pillow caught fire, and they had to extinguish it in
the bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they ever found that pillow,'' he says. ``I
hope not.'' &QL;

<P>
   Fitness trainer and Fitball enthusiast Ari Weller admits he's a
bit of a weirdo. He was once kicked out of his health-club job
because he wanted space to do cartwheels.
</P>
<P>
   Now, from his 23rd Street studio in New York City, Weller has
become the pied piper for a new, minimalist exercise movement that
could make the traditional gym a relic of the mechanical age.
</P>
<P>
   His followers? Sean (Puffy) Combs, model Chandra North and
scores of Manhattan professionals.
</P>
<P>
   His idea? That one rubber ball replaces weights, benches, and
step machines to provide a demanding workout and produce a lean,
cut body.
</P>
<P>
   With his shaved head, deep brown eyes and uniform of baggy army
trousers, Weller could be mistaken for a monk _ or maybe a
snowboarder. What he calls his ``new bohemian'' movement classes
are so organic, they don't even require sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was to open up a gym without any equipment,'' Weller
says. ``If you had a tree, you could use a tree. In my case, I take
balls and resistance bands. It's a natural workout, without
machines or TVs to tap you out of the experience. Keeping your mind
involved is sort of the point.''
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is required to work out with Weller?
</P>
<P>
   ``A leap of faith and a good deal of humility,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His movement class starts out innocently enough, with shoulder
rolls, head rolls and face, mouth and eyeball stretches. Then on to
frog leaps, crab crawls and snail slides up and down the length of
the room, ending with monkey cartwheels.
</P>
<P>
   When Weller demonstrates the monkey, his body is transformed:
His arms appear longer and he all but shrieks.
</P>
<P>
   ``His alter ego is Curious George,'' jokes one student.
</P>
<P>
   Weller uses the ball primarily for his one-to-one training.
Fitballs have been endorsed by orthopedic surgeons since the '60s,
so they're nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the possibilities are infinite,'' Weller says. ``Sitting
on the ball, for one, is not easy. And it allows you to make a
total connection with your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Coburn, a bond trader who has trained with Weller for
years, says, ``I'm more fit now than I've ever been. I used to be a
big weight lifter, but now I really know how to use my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Weller's technique is dynamic and constantly changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think how at kids' gyms they're running all over the place,''
he says. ``They're tumbling, rolling, jumping. I'm doing that for
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   He integrates movements from yoga, martial arts and dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare the way a bodybuilder and a martial artist moves,'' he
says, ``ones walks like a robot, one flows like water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been too much emphasis on exercising to look good,''
he continues. ``These exercises address a bigger priority _
longevity, dealing with life's circumstances, getting old, slipping
on ice, getting out of the way of a taxi. The irony is that when
you stop doing sport just for vanity, you end up looking better
than you've ever looked.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a higher level of exercise seems to be the craze du jour
_ even diehard gyms like Equinox are dragging yoga masters in with
the barbells. But Weller takes a practical view.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go from Ninth Avenue to Nirvana in an hour,'' he
says. ``I'm not promising instant physical perfection or spiritual
enlightenment. If somebody finds those things in my class ...
hallelujah! Glad I could help.''

 &HT;    Views differ on market sag restraining `wealth effect'
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the big unknowns getting a lot of attention
these days is what consequences the stock market's decline will
have for consumer spending, via the so-called wealth effect.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Jerry A. Hausman of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology tells Forbes (May 1) the collapse of stocks trading at
price/earnings ratios of 100 to 1,000 would be ``bad news for
Porsche dealers ... but it wouldn't be big enough to bring the
economy into a recession.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, he contends, is what policy-makers do as a result of a
market decline. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan could fix a
burst stock market bubble, as he did when the market crashed in
1987 _ or he could ``break it some more, as his predecessors did in
1929.''
</P>
<P>
   The Economist (April 28) is not so bullish. The British
publication notes that market optimists believe the U.S. economy is
``fundamentally so sound'' a market collapse would not cause a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine says America's overhang of private debt _
especially margin debt used to buy stock _ and the large U.S. debt
to foreigners would make the consequences of a stock market crash
``more severe than most people expect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If current levels of borrowing and spending are based on the
rosy assumptions of continuing high stock market returns, the
negative impact of a crash on consumption and investment could be
bigger,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   GRENADE FOR MCCOLL?
</P>
<P>
   Business Week (May 1) suggests that Bank of America Chief
Executive Officer Hugh L. McColl be prepared to catch a few verbal
blasts at the bank's shareholders meeting in Charlotte, N.C.,
today. ``McColl faces heavy criticism over his $50 million pay
package _ and allegations that he is stacking the board of the
nation's largest bank with cronies who lack the know-how to oversee
$630 billion in assets,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS, the huge California state teachers pension fund,
already has pledged to vote against reinstating four board members
on the compensation committee and another with business ties to the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the big issue may be the ``circumstances surrounding the
departure of board member Shirley Young,'' a former General Motors
vice president. The bank says she was dropped because she left her
job at GM, in accordance with bank policy. Bank critics say she was
forced out because of her criticism of McColl's management style.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH MENTIONING
</P>
<P>
   _ Fortune (May 1) profiles the plight of 8-year-old Amy Martin,
who has a rare toxic disease, sometimes fatal, in which the liver
lacks a key enzyme. Hers is the kind of illness that might be
helped by gene therapy, and that, in turn, has both medical and
business implications, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Smart Money (May), The Wall Street Journal's personal finance
magazine, focuses on a plan for ``the perfect retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual Investor (May) helps investors decide how to choose
between the stocks of strong blue chip companies that compete with
each other, such as Wal-Mart and Amazon, AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom and
Coca-Cola and Pepsico.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: AN INTIMATE VIEW OF THE CARIBBEAN

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By ADELE MALOTT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    I recently asked a group of mature travelers what their favorite
trips were. One couple, speaking in unison, replied, ``Amazing
Grace.'' They had celebrated their 30th anniversary on the Amazing
Grace and were enchanted by what they called ``the unspoiled
voyage.''
 &HT;    The Amazing Grace is a rather graceless little boat that each
month cruises 2,000 miles from the Bahamas to Trinidad and then
back again to supply the five ships of the Windjammer Barefoot
Cruise fleet with provisions.
 &HT;    James Bishop is a voyager who chose the no-frills intimacy of
the Amazing Grace cruise.
 &HT;    ``There's no denying the hedonistic attractions of a Caribbean
cruise aboard one of those mobile pleasure platforms that carry a
thousand-plus people,'' he said. ``But, what is denied is the
opportunity to spend your leisurely hours poking around places
you've never heard of _ but if given the chance would never forget.
 &HT;    ``There is a tradeoff,'' Bishop added. Amazing Grace is for
people who are interested in a more down-home atmosphere, food
that's pretty much mom's standard fare and, as he put it, ``a
guarantee that you'll get smokestack soot on the seat of your
pants.''
 &HT;    A nearly half-century-old motor vessel that used to be a
lighthouse tender off the Scottish coast, Amazing Grace carries no
more than 94 passengers. The dress code is relaxed _ shorts and
shower shoes 24 hours a day. And, Bishop said, ``You might visit as
many as nine different ports on a one-way trip, maybe twice as many
going both ways. They may include such normally ignored places as
Iles des Saintes, Planta Cay and Jost Van Dyke. And you may spend
as much as a full day _ sometimes an overnight stay _ at any one of
them.''
 &HT;    The real beauty of Amazing Grace, Bishop said, is that on the
normal, southbound run, only three out of 13 days are spent
cruising the sea. In the other direction, it's just two out of 13.
Most time is spent on shore.
 &HT;    And, he added, ``For those who keep track, it's a different
country almost every other day.'' On an average round-trip, it's
possible to visit nine independent, micro-nations, plus overseas
territories still owned by England, France and Holland, as well as
all those inviting beaches.
 &HT;    The island-hopping is what really distinguishes a trip aboard
the Amazing Grace from a traditional cruise. ``On a regular cruise,
the ship is more important than the trip,'' Bishop said. ``On
Amazing Grace, it's just the opposite.''
 &HT;    For the most part, Amazing Grace's cabins have bunk beds, some
without ladders to the upper beds. Most rooms have no desks, and
few offer chairs. In some cases, the bathroom is down the
companionway and must be shared by other passengers.
 &HT;    Apart from the long, padded sunbathing lounges, there is nothing
particularly comfortable about the seating, and park benches are
used when movies are shown. The dining room has great U-shaped
booths.
 &HT;    But none of this seems to bother anybody, as demonstrated by the
fact that on one southbound voyage last fall, nine out of 10
passengers were repeaters. Some were on their sixth or seventh
sailing. One group of eight passengers from different parts of the
United States had been on Amazing Grace years ago and were enjoying
their fifth reunion trip.
 &HT;    Mildred Boudreaux of Berwick, La., was on her ninth round-trip
and had already signed up for another.
 &HT;    ``I just like being on the water,'' Boudreaux said, laughing.
``And since Amazing Grace is so small, I'm very close to it.
Besides, the ship is really so unpretentiously casual.''
 &HT;    In fact, it's so casual that status bars don't exist. The crew _
from dishwashers to the first mate _ quench their thirst at the
same bar as Amazing Grace's passengers. That can lead to some
entertaining, insightful stories, because most of the crew is
Caribbean.
 &HT;    Pay attention to the ship's cruise director and you'll get great
tips on saving money on land excursions. For example, it's best to
wait to buy duty-free stuff until the ship docks at the French
islands. There, a pack of cigarettes costs just a buck.
 &HT;    Except for predictably pricey memorabilia from the ship's shop,
Amazing Grace's rates are not out of line. Standard drinks are $2.
At most places onshore, beer is $2.
 &HT;    At the beat-up village of Soufriere on St. Lucia _ a soggy,
sagging town straight out of ``Somerset Maugham'' _ several Amazing
Grace passengers stopped by Harmony's bar to be served the local
beer by a barefoot 14-year-old and to watch near-naked fisherman
across the street gutting the morning's catch.
 &HT;    But having a drink is the least of the attractions. Rick and
Debbie Camp of Palmerton, Pa., went swimming with the stingrays on
Grand Turk.
 &HT;    ``Sure, they've got those long, twitchy, lethal-looking tails,
but they're really very gentle,'' Debbie Camp reported.
 &HT;    John Sweet and his son Andy, respectively from Chapel Hill,
N.C., and Denver, took a catamaran side trip to Mustique to mingle
with the rich and shameless. David Bowie and Mick Jaeger both have
homes there, and it was Princess Margaret who originally gave the
island its expensive cachet years ago ($14 hamburgers).
 &HT;    Less exalted women can be seen by the roadside on Bequia,
sitting beneath a thatch canopy, hand-chipping stone into pebbles
for construction.
 &HT;    At the tidy village of Terre-de-Haute, a cafe owner sits on the
sidewalk cutting coconut meat from its shell as a man putt-putts by
on his moped with a 50-pound tuna slung across the handlebars.
 &HT;    A rewarding travel experience is composed of such entertaining
trifles. And Jack Shea of Pompano Beach, Fla., wished he had been
able to accumulate more of them. But he ended his cruise at
Trinidad. ``Dumb move,'' he scowled. ``I should have signed up for
the round-trip.''
 &HT;    And he wasn't the only one who felt that way.
 &HT;    Low- or value-season rates on Amazing Grace start at $1,375 for
one-way trip between Grand Bahama and Trinidad. Low season is
usually between May and December. Port fees cost an additional $150
for each direction.
 &HT;    Port stops often include Antigua, Bequia, Conception, Cooper
Island, Dominican Republic, Grand Bahama, Grand Turk, Great
Ionagua, Grenada, Iles des Saintes, Jost Van Dyke, Nevis, Norman
Island, Plana Cay, St. Barthelemy, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St.
Maarten, Tortola, Trinidad and Virgin Gorda.

 &HT;    ``Slow down to see the world'' is not only the motto of tour

reason to take a walking trip, whether in Colorado, France or
Turkey.
 &HT;    Here's a selection of walking trips that spans the globe. Prices
are per person, based on double occupancy, and land-only unless
otherwise noted.
 &HT;     Backroads  (801 Cedar St., Berkeley, Calif. 94710;

Among them is a new ``Walking Turkey'' trip. This 10-day adventure,

&HT;     BEARDS REMAIN THE BAILIWICK OF TEXAS BARBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUSSELL GOLD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas attorney general's office has ruled
that state law prohibits licensed cosmetologists from trimming
beards.
</P>
<P>
   Beards, the lawyers say, are the realm of barbers.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that might be thought of as bureaucratic
hair-splitting, the law was fuzzy on where hair ends and the beard
begins, so the lawyers stepped in to clarify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it likely that most observers would consider the
sideburns worn by the late Elvis Presley at the time of his early
success in 1956 as part of his hair,'' the attorney general's
office stated last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, whether the muttonchops which adorned his
face at the time of his death were hair which a cosmetologist might
trim, or a partial beard which could be serviced only by a
barber,'' is a difficult question.
</P>
<P>
   Henry O'Neal Holifield, director of the Texas Cosmetology
Commission, offered this advise for confused cosmetologists: ``If
you go below the bottom of the ear, you are probably going to have
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential fines for unlawful beard trimming can range up to
$200.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Barber Examiners is expected to decide by
this summer where the hair stops and the beard begins.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, state lawmakers have wanted to merge the
barber board and cosmetology commission into one agency.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Williams Sr., chairman of the state barber board, said
if that happens, it would wipe out his profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barbering that I know will never be the same,'' he said.

   Now that Little Elian has been through the entire cycle of the
American media washer, and now that his story is in the early
stages of development as a television movie for CBS (``a writer of
Cuban descent has been attached to the project''), we now return
you to regular programming while we search for another news story
to hammer into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant Gumbel was right. If that kid were from Haiti, he'd have
been home in 48 hours and the whole Disneyland-media-circus,
hide-in-the-closet affair would never have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe the Haitian kids have it better. Little Elian
is never going to be the same. He's going to be the Cuban Gary
Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Or worse: In five years, he'll be on ``Hollywood Squares.''
</P>
<P>
   The people at ABC News have been in a major snit ever since
someone had the bright idea of allowing the actor Leonardo DiCaprio
interview President Clinton about global warming. The entire
interview, the text of which was released by the White House, was
pared down to a few snippets, probably to appease all those newsies
who cried about the end of journalism as we know it. But here's
what they should be most embarrassed about: Leo proved to be a far
better interviewer, with smarter questions, than Diane Sawyer or
many of the other celebrity anchors at the network.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, by cutting the interview _ which was informative and dense
with insight on both of their parts (about a serious environmental
issue) _ ABC proved that it values entertainment reporting over
anything hard-core.
</P>
<P>
   Either that or they were saving room for the real celebrity
coup: Little Elian interviews Al Gore about school lunches.

 &HT;    FROM RUSSIA TO AMERICA: LEARNING TO COPE IN A STRANGE NEW WORLD
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (l) lifestyle categories for
release Sunday, April 30.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vodka consumption is down. The weather has
improved. Life is more stable, though there is a gnawing concern
about the health of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not summarizing the state of affairs in Russia. I'm talking
about my life in America since moving back to the United States
from Moscow five months ago. My family and I have come home after
seven years abroad in Russia and the Middle East, and we're coping
with culture shock in our own country.
</P>
<P>
   We're Rip Van Winkle: America is full of prosperity and
high-tech gadgets that we had only a vague notion of in Russia. We
watched in amazement at my sister's home near Baltimore when she
declined to pick up her ringing telephone, aware through her caller
ID that it was a bothersome telemarketer.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Pilot has replaced the Filofax as the repository of
choice for the yuppie crowd. The tech world seems to dominate all.
Among friends and co-workers, there seems to be two topics of
conversation _ the dot-com stock you shoulda bought two years ago
or the one you shoulda sold two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to keep up, like arriving late at a party where
everyone else is in full revelry and you're trying to figure out
what they're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   We left Russia amid a brutal war in Chechnya and a sad reality
in the streets of Moscow as the mercurial economy took its toll on
working-class Russians. It is a country with profound problems just
feeding its population, not one of luxurious concerns such as the
value of stock options or affording gas for the SUV.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist, it was a fascinating assignment, yet always
comforting to know that America was the oasis at the end of the
road.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans in Russia, we were sympathetic to the pain endured
by everyday Russians trying to survive, but also slightly smug at
seeing how far the mighty superpower has fallen. Lenin and Marx
were wrong, in practice if not in theory, and the evidence is plain
to see in the dirty streets and dilapidated apartment blocks
throughout Russia.
</P>
<P>
   We were smug, that is, until we returned to the States to news
of school shootings and a New Economy that has created a surprising
gap between the haves and the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   If Russians have an abundance of poverty, we seem to have our
share of moral scarcities amid the boom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the old saying went during the Cold War, there are
more Russians trying to leave their country for life in America
than the other way around. It remains true today. Just take a look
at the line snaking around the U.S. Embassy in Moscow every morning
as Russians seek visas to visit and move here.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-week spending blitz last winter to reassemble our lives
in Washington, we bought a house and a car, and were reminded of
just how fortunate we are to live in a country that has a banking
system that actually works.
</P>
<P>
   Our Russian friend Andrei used to pepper us with questions about
credit; he marveled at the fact that a middle-class wage earner in
America could actually afford a home with payments spread out over
30 years, or a car over five years. No such thing exists in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in America, the world's premier service economy, we've
tolerated in recent weeks a profound lack of service as we set up
house, bought furniture and underwent delicate negotiations to
actually get the cable guy to come hook up the TV.
</P>
<P>
   But at least it's simply random incompetence, not commonplace
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Not once since we arrived last December have we had to pay a
bribe, a common occurrence in Russia if you expect to get anything
done in a timely fashion. In order to move our furnishings out of
Russia last fall, we had to give up a few pieces of furniture to
the Russian government before the rest of our shipment made it onto
the boat.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Sarah, had picked up the items for a pittance at a
Moscow flea market _ rustic farmhouse chairs, a table and some
knickknacks. Ostensibly, they were seized as a ``donation'' to be
displayed at a state museum near Moscow. In reality, it was a bribe
that gave us the right to move the rest of our belongings out of
the country with no further bureaucratic hassles.
</P>
<P>
   We suspect that those items are indeed on display near Moscow _
at the country home of some mid-level bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   It took weeks, sometimes months, to accomplish things in Russia
unless you paid bribes or had connections, or both. America, with
its voice-mail menus and drive-thru windows, seems surrealistically
efficient by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after enrolling our daughter in a pre-school in
Chevy Chase, Md., we were confronted with a bizarre reality of
upscale suburban Washington. Her school hosted a seminar for
parents titled: ``How to apply for kindergarten and prepare your
child for the interview process.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewing to gain admittance to kindergarten? Our Russian
friends would be baffled, just as we were by unwritten rules in
Russia that say the father has little to say about the way children
are raised.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, I can take my 4-year-old to the park without fear
of the disapproving stares I received in Russia from the
``babushkas'' _ the grandmas who apparently felt a father could not
responsibly care for his child. Just where was the mother, they
would ask me in Russian, with their arraigning stares, and why on
this chilly afternoon isn't your child wearing two sweaters?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line of these anecdotes will come as no surprise for
anyone who has followed Russia and its history: Despite the fall of
the Soviet Union and America's well-meaning attempts to foster
democracy in Russia, they generally don't understand us and we
don't understand them. It is an unhealthy paradigm for two
countries that possess most of the world's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Snugly back in America, we don't miss the gritty
unpredictability of Russia or seeing the sad effects of their
poverty from our apartment window in southern Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But neither are we entirely comfortable with the almost
antiseptic nature of life in America these days and the
indifference with which many of our family and friends regard
politics and current affairs. There seems to be a lot of discourse
on talk radio and Internet chat forums, but not much serious
thought about America's place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have a popular saying, spawned during centuries under
the harsh rule of czars, and decades more under the authoritarian
regimes of the communists. The phrase is ``sto dyelat?'' _ What is
to be done? _ and it is widely applied to almost every aspect of
life. It reflects a fatalism and powerlessness that comes almost
naturally, earned through years of repression.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans, we, too, have a ready explanation for our
impassivity. For most of us, life is good and our problems are
relatively minor compared to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Complain all you want about Elian or the census or gas prices or
the tech-stock correction or taxes.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done?
</P>
<P>
   Above all, be content. That seems to be the consensus in America
these days.

 &HT;    FROM RUSSIA TO AMERICA: LEARNING TO COPE IN A STRANGE NEW WORLD
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (l) lifestyle categories for
release Sunday, April 30.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vodka consumption is down. The weather has
improved. Life is more stable, though there is a gnawing concern
about the health of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not summarizing the state of affairs in Russia. I'm talking
about my life in America since moving back to the United States
from Moscow five months ago. My family and I have come home after
seven years abroad in Russia and the Middle East, and we're coping
with culture shock in our own country.
</P>
<P>
   We're Rip Van Winkle: America is full of prosperity and
high-tech gadgets that we had only a vague notion of in Russia. We
watched in amazement at my sister's home near Baltimore when she
declined to pick up her ringing telephone, aware through her caller
ID that it was a bothersome telemarketer.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Pilot has replaced the Filofax as the repository of
choice for the yuppie crowd. The tech world seems to dominate all.
Among friends and co-workers, there seems to be two topics of
conversation _ the dot-com stock you shoulda bought two years ago
or the one you shoulda sold two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to keep up, like arriving late at a party where
everyone else is in full revelry and you're trying to figure out
what they're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   We left Russia amid a brutal war in Chechnya and a sad reality
in the streets of Moscow as the mercurial economy took its toll on
working-class Russians. It is a country with profound problems just
feeding its population, not one of luxurious concerns such as the
value of stock options or affording gas for the SUV.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist, it was a fascinating assignment, yet always
comforting to know that America was the oasis at the end of the
road.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans in Russia, we were sympathetic to the pain endured
by everyday Russians trying to survive, but also slightly smug at
seeing how far the mighty superpower has fallen. Lenin and Marx
were wrong, in practice if not in theory, and the evidence is plain
to see in the dirty streets and dilapidated apartment blocks
throughout Russia.
</P>
<P>
   We were smug, that is, until we returned to the States to news
of school shootings and a New Economy that has created a surprising
gap between the haves and the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   If Russians have an abundance of poverty, we seem to have our
share of moral scarcities amid the boom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the old saying went during the Cold War, there are
more Russians trying to leave their country for life in America
than the other way around. It remains true today. Just take a look
at the line snaking around the U.S. Embassy in Moscow every morning
as Russians seek visas to visit and move here.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-week spending blitz last winter to reassemble our lives
in Washington, we bought a house and a car, and were reminded of
just how fortunate we are to live in a country that has a banking
system that actually works.
</P>
<P>
   Our Russian friend Andrei used to pepper us with questions about
credit; he marveled at the fact that a middle-class wage earner in
America could actually afford a home with payments spread out over
30 years, or a car over five years. No such thing exists in Russia.

MS. RENO, IT WAS JUST ABOUT TIME

<TEXT>
<P>
   Great job, Janet Reno. Or, to put it another way: Better late
than never.
</P>
<P>
   After procrastinating for months, after giving the belligerent
Miami relatives more leeway than they ever deserved, after
shrinking from her obvious duty more than once _ after all that,
the attorney general finally rescued Elian Gonzalez from his
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``kidnappers'' because, in effect, that's what they were,
these people who took possession of a 6-year-old against his
father's wishes and defied a lawful order to turn the boy over so
that he could be reunited with his lone surviving parent. Whatever
shortcomings Juan Miguel Gonzalez might have as a father, he surely
can provide a saner, safer environment for his son than those
lunatic uncles and cousins who forced last weekend's action by
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Miami relatives forced Reno's hand with their
bullheaded insistence on dictating the terms of Elian's
long-awaited reunion with his father. These people had no business
trying to dictate anything. They had no legal claim to custody of
the boy. They had no legal standing to negotiate Elian's status
with Reno or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was more than patient. She was, if anything, derelict in
her responsibility by waiting so long to remove Elian from that
Miami home and return him to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez was found floating in the ocean on Thanksgiving
Day after his mother drowned in an ill-fated attempt to reach the
United States. He should have been sent home immediately to his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, these crackpot relatives latched onto Elian as if
they'd found a stray pet and proceeded to turn him into a poster
child for political activists who quickly identified him as an
invaluable propaganda tool in their perpetual war of words with
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Miami relatives had put this kid on display like
an adorable exhibit in some human petting zoo. They sent him out
each day to perform for the TV cameras and news photographers and
even went so far as to feature him in a shameless propaganda video.
</P>
<P>
   Famed attorney F. Lee Bailey said the tape reminded him of one
that Patty Hearst's kidnappers made ``with a gun to her head.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Miami relatives were even slightly concerned about the
welfare of this child, they had a strange way of showing it.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Castro's Cuba might not be the fate we would wish for a
little boy who captured America's collective heart. But it's
difficult to imagine how being with his father, even in Cuba, could
damage Elian as much as the crass exploitation that was inflicted
on him in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And how about that Marisleysis Gonzalez, the young woman who
supposedly had been acting as Elian's ``surrogate mother''? Either
she's a complete phony who has been grievously overacting in her
ranting, raving TV appearances, or she is dangerously unstable and
has no business anywhere near a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Elian was well-served by being separated from her.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we have this gaggle of self-serving politicians
excoriating Reno for doing her job in a conscientious and effective
manner. Rep. Tom DeLay, to name just one, may be the most
embarrassing excuse for a public servant ever produced by the great
state of Texas. What in the world were Republicans in Congress
thinking about when they handed this nitwit an important leadership
position? And if they don't have the gumption to dump him as
majority whip, can't they at least put a muzzle on him?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal, folks. Reno had to remove Elian Gonzalez from
that house in Miami and return him to his father. The home was
occupied by unstable, unpredictable people who had threatened to
resist any attempt to remove the boy. There was a volatile,
agitated mob gathered in the streets around the home.
</P>
<P>
   What was she supposed to do? That commando-style raid was the
only way to get the kid out of there while minimizing the
possibility that someone might get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't pretty to watch. But it worked.

&HT;     DANDELIONS: A WEED THAT IS WELCOME IN THE KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union

<P>
   Dandelions are in dire need of a savvy spinmeister.
</P>
<P>
   Until the right person steps forward, however, dandelions will
continue to be regarded as nature's most schizophrenic offering.
</P>
<P>
   They are reviled as Public Enemy No. 1 by golf course
superintendents and fastidious lawn owners everywhere. The weed
that won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet dandelions are also edible and amazingly good for you. This
bitter green perennial, high in fiber and rich in potassium and
vitamin A, is one of the world's most healthful plants.
</P>
<P>
   Dandelions rank ahead of both broccoli and spinach in overall
nutritional value. They are one of the top six herbs in the Chinese
medicine chest.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone with a lawn or access to a pasture will attest, they
are ubiquitous. And free.
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple rule of thumb regarding the lovely, much
maligned dandelion. The leaves are for greens, the blossoms for
wine, the roots for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   For our purposes, we'll concentrate on the nutritionally rich
greens, which tend to act as a tonic and gentle diuretic and can
replace spinach in almost every recipe in your cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal time to pick dandelions is before they flower and
blossom.
</P>
<P>
   Here are tips for harvesting dandelions:
</P>
<P>
   Cut the greens with the top of the root still attached so that
the leaves stay together. This makes them easier to clean. A
stirrup hoe works well.
</P>
<P>
   Collect the greens away from the road and in areas that have not
been sprayed with herbicide or pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   If buds or flowers have already appeared, wait until flowering
is complete. Cut the old greens and flowers off at the root and let
new greens grow. Harvest the new greens while young and tender and
they will be only slightly more bitter than in early spring.
</P>
<P>
   The greens can be eaten raw, and they make a fine salad. Simply
break the tender young leaves after washing them thoroughly to rid
them of sand and grit.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking dandelion greens is labor-intensive for folks who like
to buy bagged salad, but it's not complicated. Here are a few tips:
</P>
<P>
   Wash the greens thoroughly in slightly warm water, removing old,
discolored or badly broken leaves. Cut off the roots and any tough
stems, and wash again, lifting the greens out of the water to allow
any sand to settle in the pan. Sprinkle the greens with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the greens with just the water that was clinging to the
leaves after washing in a tightly covered heavy pot or steamer
until they are limp and barely tender, between 5 and 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Drain them and chop them fine.
</P>
<P>
   Dress them with olive oil, garlic, salt and vinegar, or try
using them in any of the following recipes:
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   DANDELION OMELET
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 2)
</P>
<P>
   3 strips bacon
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   4 mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup or so of fresh dandelion greens, chopped fine
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (total) grated mozzarella, provolone, muenster or
similar white cheese and/or grated colby longhorn or mild cheddar
cheese
</P>
<P>
   Fry the bacon crisp in an omelet pan. Remove from pan and
crumble into a small bowl, reserving the fat. Saute the mushrooms
in the remaining bacon fat (which can be reduced by half if you
wish). After the mushrooms have sauteed for a minute or so, add the
dandelions and saute until wilted. Remove the mushrooms and greens
to the same bowl containing the bacon and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Scramble the eggs lightly, adding the cheese and dandelion
filling and cooking until the eggs reach the desired firmness.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   DANDELION WITH SPAGHETTI
</P>
<P>

tender. Add spaghetti to pot and cook until spaghetti is done.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, saute garlic in oil until lightly colored.
Do not let the garlic burn. Add tomatoes. Simmer 10 to 15 minutes
and put tomato sauce on top of drained spaghetti and dandelions.
Top with hot pepper flakes and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   DANDELION LASAGNA
</P>

   1 teaspoon oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon basil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup wheat germ
</P>
<P>
   3 cups tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces tomato paste

</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound mozzarella cheese sliced thinly
</P>
<P>
   Bring water to a boil, add dandelions and cook until tender.
Remove dandelions with a slotted spoon and reserve the cooking
water. Place dandelions in a blender with garlic, 1 tablespoon
parsley, basil and oregano. Blend thoroughly, but be careful not to
liquefy the greens. Add wheat germ, 2 cups tomato sauce and tomato
paste. Blend just enough to mix thoroughly and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Bring reserved cooking water back to a boil. Add lasagna noodles
and olive oil. Cook until just tender, but still firm (5 to 8
minutes), drain and reserve. Mix ricotta cheese, cayenne and the
remaining 2 tablespoons parsley; reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly butter the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Position
3 lasagna noodles side by side as a first layer. Cover with 1/3 of
the dandelion sauce, then 1/2 of the ricotta cheese. Shake some
parmesan cheese over the ricotta and cover with a layer of
mozzarella slices. Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Layer the final three lasagna noodles and the last third of the
dandelion sauce. Cover with the remaining parmesan and mozzarella
cheese and 1 cup tomato sauce. Bake at 375 for 30 minutes.

   ``People need stories more than bread itself,'' a mystical
tale-teller intones near the beginning of the ABC special-effects
extravaganza ``Arabian Nights.'' ``They tell us how to live, and
why.''
</P>
<P>
   On TV during sweeps month, however, stories generally have less
grandiose ambitions. They seek merely to get a rise out of viewers,
or at least a rise in the numbers of viewers. Sure, sweeps may be a
mindlessly antiquated system that serves neither the networks nor
the advertisers _ to say nothing of the shaft-job it pulls on
viewers, clustering all event programming around a handful of days
on the calendar _ but it's the only system we have, so they're
sticking to it, by God.
</P>
<P>
   Who would've guessed at the beginning of the 1999-2000 season
that one of the highlights of each and every sweeps month over the
past year would've been a spate of cheaply produced little game
shows that easily steamrollered vastly more expensive and ambitious
miniseries? It's been an unpredictable TV season _ comedy took a
dive, and was resurrected, inadvertently, in the form of dubious
``reality'' programming and game shows.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's merciful that it's coming to a close and that, by
and large, this May the networks are trotting out the usual barrage
of ``events'' and stunt casting and series cliffhangers. Here's how
the networks intend to entertain us for the next month:
</P>
<P>
   Today &QL; 
``Friends'' (NBC) _ Bruce Willis appears in a three-episode
storyline as Ross's girlfriend's father with a thing for Rachel
(Jennifer Aniston). The season ends May 18 with an hourlong episode
featuring Tom Selleck's return just as Chandler (Perry) is
preparing to propose to Monica (Courtney Cox). The battle for a
big-bucks payday for the cast in exchange for another season will
ensue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago Hope'' (CBS) _ Just desserts as the head of the HMO
(James Garner) running the hospital suffers a heart attack and
becomes a victim of his own bureaucracy. Quite possibly the show's
final episode. &QL; 
Friday, April 28 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosby'' (CBS) _ Cos bids farewell with considerably less
fanfare than that which attended his last TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' (NBC) _ Multiple Tony
winner and acclaimed mezzo-soprano Audra McDonald guest-stars as a
police psychologist; how can this show possibly work some musical
numbers into her role? She returns for the season finale May 19. &QL; 
Sunday, April 30 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The '70s'' (NBC) _ In the manner of predecessor ``The '60s,''
this miniseries follows four friends who somehow manage to be a
part of virtually ital!every significant event of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arabian Nights'' (ABC) _ Robert Halmi, Sr., fresh from the,
er, whatever ``The Tenth Kingdom`` was, returns with more
miniseries-sized special effects and fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Me Home: The John Denver Story'' (CBS) _ Chad Lowe, Mr.
Hilary Swank, strives to help his family go for the acting-trophy
hat trick by essaying the sensitive singer-songwriter. Well, at
least it's a good lead-out for viewers of ``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' (Fox) _ David Duchovny wrote and directed this
comic episode in which a case investigated by Mulder and Scully is
bastardized into a shlocky movie starring Garry Shandling and Tea
Leoni. Its cliffhanger episodes _ the question this time: Will
there be an eighth season? _ air May 14 and 21. &QL; 
Monday, May 1 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (ABC) _ As if this show needs
!ital!higher ratings, it offers a weeklong series of celebrity
editions, featuring David Duchovny, Queen Latifah, Ray Romano and _
yes, pipe down already _ Rosie O'Donnell. On May 18, the end of
Western Civilization is officially announced with a gratuitous
special going ``Behind the Scenes at 'Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventh Heaven'' (The WB) _ Another controversial topic is
handled in a subdued manner when the Rev. Camden (Stephen Collins)
counsels a sexually molested teenager. &QL; 
Tuesday, May 2 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Angel'' (The WB) _ Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) guest-stars
for some more romantic travails; Angel (David Boreanaz) returns the
favor in ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer's'' May 9 episode. &QL; 
Wednesday, May 3 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The 35th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards'' (CBS) _ Yet
more trophies get distributed to celebrities, who in turn thank
their agents and managers and publicists. Dolly Parton hosts; Faith
Hill and the Dixie Chicks will be on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawson's Creek'' (The WB) _ The romantic triangle between
Dawson (James Van Der Beek), Joey (Katie Holmes) and Pacey (Joshua
Jackson) gets so messy that it won't be until the May 24 season
finale that everything is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Party of Five'' (Fox) _ The Salingers bid viewers adieu;
America shrugs. &QL; 
Thursday, May 4 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Worlds Funniest Game Show Moments'' (Fox) _ There simply don't
exist words cynical enough to describe this one. &QL; 
Friday, May 5 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sabrina, The Teenage Witch'' (ABC) _ Sabrina enjoys her last
days of potentially strong ratings before moving next season to The
WB. Also tonight: The series finale of ``Boy Meets World,`` which
I'm pretty sure no one has ever watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence'' (NBC) _ Game-show mania strikes this romantic
series, as Robbie (Seth Peterson) wins loot on a show hosted by Ed
Begley, Jr. The season doesn't end so whimsically, however, as Syd
(Melina Kanakaredes) goes into a coma by the May 19 finale. &QL; 
Sunday, May 7 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Geppetto'' (ABC) _ Drew Carey not only dances, but sings, and
it's a far cry from ``Cleveland Rocks'` _ find out if this is a
good thing in this musical version of ``Pinocchio'' co-starring
Julia Louis Dreyfuss and Wayne Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason and the Argonauts'' (NBC) _ See ``Arabian Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cupid &AMP; Cate'' (CBS) _ Romantic comedy starring Mary-Louise
Parker, Peter Gallagher and Bebe Neuwirth. &QL; 
Monday, May 8 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The 4th Annual Celebrity Weddings: In Style'' (ABC) _ Those
darn celebrities just keep getting married, and In Style magazine
is there to coo and slobber all over them. Celine Dion and Jenny
McCarthy represent the level of intellectual vigor at work here. &QL; 
Wednesday, May 10 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Drew Carey Show'' (ABC) _ A lavish musical number
commemorates the consummation of Drew and Kate's relationship. The
following week, Drew, in an admittedly shameless bid for an Emmy,
closes the season with a parody of virtually every ``very special''
sitcom episode ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's to You, Charlie Brown: 50 Great Years!'' (CBS) _ Whoopi
Goldberg hosts a tribute to the world's most successful loser and
everyone else in Charles Schulz's beloved comic strip. And, since a
variety show's not a variety show unless Faith Hill pops in, she's
on hand to sing a song apropos of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharing the Secret'' (CBS) _ Mare Winningham stars in this
drama about bulimia. Suggested alternate titles: ``Cough It Up,''
``Finger Foods,`` ``Purge-atory.'' &QL; 
Thursday, May 11 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' (NBC) _ Julianna Marguiles is not listed in the credits
for the May 18 season finale, involving a school shooting, so she
may get jettisoned in this episode when her character revives a
``do not resuscitate'' patient and thereby irks Dr. Weaver (Laura
Innes) in an episode filled with ER mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paranormal: Do You Believe?'' (Fox) _ From the network that,
in January, declared it was putting a stop to tacky ``reality''
programming, and then, in February, after the debacle that was
``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?,'' swore that it was
seriously ceasing and desisting all tacky ``reality'' programming,
comes more tacky ``reality'' programming. &QL; 
Friday, May 12 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Gloria Estefan, Caribbean Soul: The Atlantis Concert'' (CBS) _
Musical special featuring Mark Anthony and 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 49th Miss Universe Pageant'' (CBS) _ An epistomological
study in global socio-economic dynamics in which attractive young
women in revealing clothing discuss their plans for improving the
planet. &QL; 
Sunday, May 14 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus'' (CBS) _ Stop me if you've heard this one: Blondish,
Anglicized guy, clean-cut except for the long hair, beard and
sandals, wanders otherwise swarthy environs doing good and
encouraging others to do likewise and discovers no good deed goes
unpunished, only to inspire an endless stream of blandly reverent
biopics and mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, May 15
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies Man'' (CBS) _ Stunt-casting alert: ``Golden Girls'' Rue
McClanahan and Estelle Getty join Betty White as they vie for the
affections of George Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roswell'' (The WB) _ Everything is revealed in the season
finale: Sheriff Valenti (William Sadler) discovers the extent of
the young aliens' powers, and Max (Jason Behr), Isabel (Katherine
Heigl) and Michael (Brendan Fehr) receive a communique concerning
their future, one that may not include Liz (Shiri Appleby) or, for
that matter, being on TV next season. &QL; 
!folo!Tuesday, May 16 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' (ABC) _ This sitcom's season ends with the
happy couple thinking about a baby again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brady Bunch`` and ``Diff'rent Strokes'' (Fox) _ Because
our attention span won't accommodate a two-hour movie, Fox strides
boldly forward with two one-hour ``original Mini-Movies'' _ read
that, hacked out just slightly slower than the speed of light _ set
behind the scenes at and in the nation's jails after two
once-popular sitcoms. &QL; 
Wednesday, May 17 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' (NBC) - Sure, this series about White House
machinations may be full of itself sometimes, but how many other
shows would hinge its season finale on the issue of campaign
reform? Marlee Matlin reprises her role as a savvy political
operative in the May 3 and 10 episodes; in the latter, Sam (Rob
Lowe) is finally busted for consorting with the prostitute he met
in the season premiere.
</P>
<P>

Goodbye.`` &QL; 
Thursday, May 18 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Popular'' (The WB) _ Every season-finale cliche in the book _

show's finale, with stunt-casting guest stars Peggy Lipton, Delta
Burke and Erik Estrada. &QL; 
Friday, May 19 &QL;
</P>

</P>

Sunday, May 21 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing Up Brady'' (NBC) _ In the, um, tradition of ``The
David Cassidy Story'' comes this teleflick about ``The Brady
Bunch'' from the perspective of Barry Williams, who played Greg _
and dated both his mom and his sister on the series! Stud!
</P>
<P>
   ``The Linda McCartney Story'' (CBS) _ Telebiopic about a woman
known essentially for marrying well. At this rate, next May sweeps
they'll be doing movies about you and me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' (Fox) _ Al Gore makes a cameo appearance, and no,
he won't be assuming the role of Bender the robot. Physicist

season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the Hill'' (Fox) _ Country singers Randy Travis, Clint

 HARVARD HOLDS A MOCK TRIAL FOR JESUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A Harvard Divinity School professor, playing
the role of prosecutor in the trial of Jesus, had just rested his
case, arguing that Jesus was not the harmless, otherworldly poser
of questions some made him out to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remind you of the testimony of one Mathias, who tells us
that Jesus said, `I have not come to bring peace, but a sword,' ''
said New Testament scholar Allen Callahan, taking some license to
refer to the then-unwritten Gospel of Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dershowitz, Jesus' self-appointed pro bono lawyer, shot to
his feet, gesturing at ``Pontius Pilate,'' the Roman prefect of
Judea, played Tuesday by Harvey Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your honor, I want to call this Mathias as a hostile
witness,'' shouted Dershowitz, a law professor and trial attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we accept this heresay evidence about my client?
Nobody has even seen Jesus with a sword. And whatever sword he may
have been talking about, if indeed he was talking about one, was
surely a metaphorical sword of God.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went Tuesday at ``The Trial of Jesus of Nazareth,'' held
during a regular if unusual meeting of ``Contemporary
Interpretations of Jesus,'' the course Cox and Callahan are
teaching at Harvard Divinity School.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, Callahan, and Dershowitz were the only actors, and of them
only Cox played a historical role. The roles of prosecutor and
defense attorney were invented to personify the forces for and
against Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said that he and Cox did it to jar familiar perceptions
of Jesus and to ``sharpen the issues'' of justice and truth in the
judgment against Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a theologian and chairman of the divinity school's
department of religion and society, said he got the idea of
reenacting the trial after talking with Dershowitz about the nature
of Roman justice during the life of Jesus. He said he also decided
to take up Dershowitz on a dare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying to Harvey, `Just think of all the trouble the
world would have been spared if Jesus had had a good Jewish
lawyer,' '' Dershowitz recounted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz said that the role fulfilled a lifelong dream.
``Jesus is the one client I've always wished I could have
represented,'' said the law professor whose clients have included
O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bulow, and Leona Helmsley.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, as Pilate, began by decrying the fact that the matter of
this ``rabble-rousing rabbi from Galilee'' was threatening the
peace during Passover and, worse, delaying Pilate from enjoying a
Roman bath.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said that Jesus' claims of kingship were a threat to
the rule of Tiberius, the Roman emperor. ``Some have said his
kingdom is not of this world,'' he said, but his seditious acts
were occuring ``in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz complained about Jesus being questioned the night of
his capture without the presence of a lawyer. He then said that,
among Jews, kingship was a longstanding metaphor and that
everything Jesus advocated had been said earlier by Hebrew prophets
and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he is an itinerant preacher,'' said Dershowitz.
``If you crucify him, you will make him into a martyr who will
crumble your government.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan rejected that warning. ``A cross doesn't make a
martyr,'' he said. ``A cross is a billboard that announces that
what he was doing was an affront to the emperor, and that anyone
who would do the same will suffer the same destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The limitations of the class brought the trial to a premature
close. Students voted only with their comments, which were evenly
divided between those who saw the justice of getting rid of the
rebellious rabbi and those who saw no need to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz came up with a novel substitute punishment. ``I think
it would be appropriate to tie him in litigation and appeals for
years,'' he said. ``That way he would spend his life with lawyers,
whom he hated.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, as Pilate, demurred: ``I think even the Romans would agree
that that would be cruel and unusual punishment.''

COLLECTOR FACES SUITS OVER HOLLYWOOD MEMORIABILIA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   How do you solve a problem like Maria's missing brown jumper?
</P>
<P>
   And the famous guitar that Julie Andrews toted across the
Austrian hills with the von Trapp brood?
</P>
<P>
   What about the Maltese Falcon, also allegedly among the missing,
along with the hot pink satin gown Marilyn Monroe wore while
telling the world that diamonds are a girl's best friend?
</P>
<P>
   And what of Betty Grable's famous white bathing suit, the one
that launched a thousand pinups?
</P>
<P>
   How do you solve these problems? In court, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   In a spat of Hollywood-esque proportions, Warner Bros. studios
and entertainer Debbie Reynolds have filed separate lawsuits in a
Massachusetts court, charging that a collector has taken as many as
250 famous movie costumes and props worth a total of $3 million
from their private collections.
</P>
<P>
   The movie studio and Reynolds, herself a longtime collector and
memorabilia preservationist, say they were stunned and horrified to
see their prized possessions among 1,178 items that collector John
Lebold was offering for auction on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum bid for the lot: $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked and astounded by the claims made against me in
this case,'' Lebold said in an affidavit filed in the two Middlesex
(Mass.) Superior Court cases. ``I have spent hundreds and hundreds
of hours maintaining, repairing, and preserving these costumes.
They are mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebold's proposed auction on the Internet site Auctionfun.com
was billed as one of the largest and most significant private
collections of Hollywood memorabilia ever offered.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advertised items were the ``The Sound of Music''
jumper and guitar, stone tablets carried by Charlton Heston in
``The Ten Commandments,'' jeans and a T-shirt worn by James Dean in
``Giant,'' and the blue gingham dress worn by Judy Garland in ``The
Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the description, it sounds very impressive,'' said Giles
Moon, an expert on entertainment memorabilia with Sotheby's in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. filed the first lawsuit last month alleging that
the James Dean clothing, the Maltese Falcon statue, and 148 other
items in the auction were missing from its inventory. The other
items include a white wool top and a paisley skirt worn by Ingrid
Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' a beige sweater worn by Natalie Wood in
``Rebel Without a Cause,'' and a three-piece green velvet costume
worn by Errol Flynn in ``The Adventures of Don Juan.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds followed with her own lawsuit two weeks ago, saying
that the Julie Andrews jumper and guitar, the Grable bathing suit,
the Marilyn Monroe dress, and other items were missing from her
extensive collection.
</P>
<P>
   The American Textile History Museum, which recently showcased
dozens of costumes from Lebold's collection in Lowell, Mass., has
become a neutral party in the dispute, caring for the items in
question until the court cases are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Lebold insists he has receipts for all but a few of the items.
The confusion, he alleges, has been caused by the fact that
multiple copies of the costume or prop were often made, so that
when one became ripped or soiled, it could be quickly substituted,
saving expensive studio time.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there were numerous duplicate guitars used by
Andrews in ``The Sound of Music'' because one scene called for her
to fall into a lake while singing, Lebold said.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists such as Moon say sloppy or nonexistent studio record
keeping makes it even more difficult to determine the provenance of
Hollywood costumes. One lawyer predicted that the case will be ``no
slam dunk'' for either side.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds says in court affidavits that she hired Lebold in the
early 1970s as a curator for her proposed Hollywood Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The two reportedly had a falling out after Lebold was arrested
and charged with larceny in 1980 after allegedly taking more than
600 items from Burbank Studios. The trial ended in a hung jury. The
charges were dismissed after most of the items were returned.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lebold, of Brewster, Mass., nor Reynolds has been
particularly successful in their attempts to display their
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Lebold's Hollywood Museum on Hollywood Boulevard lasted just two
years, from 1983 to 1985, before closing its doors.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old Reynolds, meanwhile, was forced to sell her
Debbie Reynolds Hotel &AMP; Casino in Las Vegas to the World Wrestling
Federation in 1998 as part of a bankruptcy sale.

PROUD TRADITION CONTINUES IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brazil's cultural and material wealth are enviable, its history
rich and varied. But, as the country celebrates the 500th
anniversary of the arrival of Europeans, probably no single
Brazilian event has received as much international attention as the
July 16, 1950, World Cup final at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Uruguay upset the Brazilians, 2-1, sending
virtually the entire population into mourning. The result confirmed
Brazil's colonial inferiority for some and provided motivation for
others to overcome those effects. Once Brazil recovered from the
defeat, it began transforming soccer, injecting a unique feeling of
joy into the game. The Brazilians have been able to blend tactical
imagination with individual creativity to produce an almost hybrid
variety of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The last 50 years of Brazilian history have been marked by
military dictatorships, voracious consumption of natural resources,
and deteriorating social structures that left huge gaps between
rich and poor, literate and illiterate. But the Maracana still
stands _ it has been declared a historic monument _ and Brazil's
soccer still sets standards.
</P>
<P>
   When Brazil plays host to Ecuador in Sao Paulo Thursday, it will
be defending an unbeaten record in World Cup qualifying home
matches. Brazil has lost only once in World Cup qualifying, when
Bolivia converted twice in the final minutes of a USA '94 game in
La Paz.
</P>
<P>
   Though Brazil has lost one of its great young hopes, Ronaldo, to
more knee surgery, the Selecao should be well-armored. There is
even a chance Romario could return after scoring three goals for
Vasco da Gama in a 5-1 win over Flamengo in the Taca Guanabara
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brazilian Selecao does not exist without Romario,'' Vasco
vice president Eurico Miranda said. ``The Selecao is Romario and 10
other players.''
</P>
<P>
   Romario, 34, is in many ways more of a phenomenon than Ronaldo.
Romario paved the way to Europe for Ronaldo but did not make the
jump to Italy, likely because clubs were concerned about his lack
of physical size and the size of his ego.
</P>
<P>
   Romario has scored 45 goals in 63 internationals. He likely
should have been included on the France '98 team, and it is
incredible that coach Mario Zagallo not only left out Romario but
did not utilize Edmundo. Now, Romario and Edmundo are teammates
with Vasco, and Romario has emerged as the team leader as well as
the Taca Guanabara's top scorer with 15 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Flamengo had discarded Romario last year, and this was an
emotional reunion between Rio's top two teams at the Maracana _ six
players were ejected and seven were issued cautions.
</P>
<P>
   After Vasco fell behind to Flamengo, 1-0, ``Romario asked for
calm from the players and called for them to take responsibility,''
Vasco coach Abel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romario is the best striker in Brazilian futbol and should be
in the Selecao,'' former Vasco striker Roberto Dinamite said. ``He
is a player cut out for the games that are disputed in a climate of
war, games like the qualifying matches.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   African qualifying for the World Cup moves to group stages with
a draw for the remaining 25 teams in Zurich Friday. Most of the
favorites advanced, though Algeria and South Africa had
difficulties. The Algerians edged Cape Verde, 2-0, sparked by Ahmed
Bourahli in his debut game. Bourahli scored in the ninth minute and
set up Rafik Saifi for the second goal four minutes later. The
crowd at Stade Olympique in Annaba was 80,000 _ greater than the
population of Cape Verde's largest city, Cidade de Praia. South
Africa struggled on a choppy rugby field in Bloemfontein, taking a
1-0 victory over Lesotho. Sean Bartlett, formerly of Colorado and
New York/New Jersey of MLS, converted his 19th international goal.
Assadi Mummer Al-Qadhafi, son of the Libyan chief of state, is
making progress as president of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya Football
Federation. Assadi, who doubles as a striker for the national team,
has taken Libya into the next round despite a 3-1 loss at Mali. The
Libyans won the first leg, 3-0, in Tripoli. In Monrovia, Liberia,
president Charles Taylor proved he knows how to recruit a crowd to
Samuel K. Doe Stadium. ``Any government minister who is not at that
field will be in trouble,'' threatened Taylor, who is still a
fugitive from justice after his mid-1980s escape from Plymouth
County jail, during a reception before the Liberia-Chad game. The
Liberians advanced after a 0-0 tie, having won, 1-0, in N'Djamena.
But three spectators died as the stadium was filled above the
35,000 capacity. Two were crushed in the crowd and one fell from a
fence attempting to escape.

CIVIC JOURNALISM: TAKING STOCK AFTER A DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ About 100 journalists are attending the James K. Batten
Awards and Symposium, sponsored by the Pew Center for Civic
Journalism. The event features seminars, speeches, an array of
media heavyweights, and a $25,000 prize to be shared by the
Savannah (Ga.) Morning News, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and New
Hampshire Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities are a celebration of the most significant
journalism reform effort in decades. According to Jan Schaffer,
executive director of the Pew center, the decade-old ``civic
journalism'' movement _ which engages news outlets in direct
conversations with their readers, viewers, and listeners to tackle
community issues _ has spawned hundreds of newsroom projects in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in many quarters, civic journalism is dismissed as
boosterism masquerading as news. While advocates see it as a way of
improving local journalism by reconnecting media outlets with their
audience, detractors see the emphasis on problem-solving as a
distortion of journalistic objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never very well defined, I think that was by design,''
says Edward Seaton, former president of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors (ASNE), who has a decidedly mixed view of civic
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   That gets to the heart of the movement's dilemma. To win
converts, it has defined itself so flexibly that both sides view it
through the prism of their own biases. And the detractors seem to
have the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't have a problem with the tools and techniques of
civic journalism,'' says Schaffer. ``They have a problem with the
label.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this was an argument that tried to persuade people, I
think it's also fair to say a majority of the elite press . . .
remained unpersuaded,'' says Jay Rosen, chairman of the New York
University journalism department and a driving force behind civic
journalism. ``We lost control of part of the rhetoric here.''
</P>
<P>
   In what comes close to being an official definition, the Pew
center says civic journalism treats people ``as civic assets, as
players or participants in the story, rather than as victims or
passive spectators of legislative or bureaucratic processes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Savannah Morning News, a co-recipient of the Batten Award
for Excellence in Civic Journalism, used focus groups and community
forums for its series examining the impact of the region's growing
elderly population. The Inquirer's ``Citizen Voices '99'' project
included more than 60 public forums that helped focus coverage on
Philadelphia's mayoral race. New Hampshire Public Radio's ``Tax
Challenge'' Web site allowed citizens to calculate how various tax
proposals would affect their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was founded in 1993, the Pew Center for Civic
Journalism _ funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts _ has created a
bustling cottage industry, subsidizing more than 92 civic
journalism initiatives in more than 170 print and broadcast
newsrooms. This year, it is bankrolling 15 new projects at outlets
ranging from Wisconsin Public Television to the Yakima (Wa.)
Herald-Republic _ to the tune of about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The center runs numerous workshops in conjunction with groups
like the Investigative Reporters and Editors and the Radio and
Television News Directors Foundation (RTNDF). More than 2,500
journalists have attended its workshops and more than 6,500 receive
its newsletter, Civic Catalyst. The 116 applicants for the 2000
Batten Awards represent a 25 percent jump over the usual total.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen, for one, is surprised by this emergence. ``I certainly
didn't anticipate a movement . . . a lot of headlines in the trade
press, and a lot of controversy,'' he says. Adds Schaffer: ``I
think it's been validated. . . . We're an R &AMP; D center for content.
I'm proud to have that label. I think it's one of the legacies of
civic journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet civic journalism has run afoul of some high-profile critics.
Washington Post executive editor Leonard Downie Jr. has expressed
doubts and former New York Times executive editor Max Frankel has
written disapprovingly that ``the ardent civic journalists . . .
want to tell it and fix it all at once.'' In The New Yorker,
Michael Kelly, now editor of The Atlantic Monthly, lambasted civic
journalism during the 1996 campaign season, dismissing it as ``a
do-gooding philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   All this has forced advocates to practice careful diplomacy,
trying to win friends without turning off skeptics. The 1998 Batten
Award went to The (Baltimore) Sun, even though its editor John
Carroll (now editor of the Los Angeles Times) said the paper's
``Reading By 9'' project was not civic journalism. Later, a
chagrined Carroll said, ``I kind of regret'' that remark.
</P>
<P>
   ASNE spokesman Craig Branson says his group is ``scrupulously
neutral'' on civic journalism. ``Probably half our members hate the
idea,'' he adds. ``And about 30 percent of our members might say
`hey, we can probably do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently three editors who were leading practitioners _ Steven
Smith of The (Colorado Springs) Gazette, Martha Steffens of the
Binghamton Press &AMP; Sun-Bulletin and Cole Campbell of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch _ departed those papers. Will their legacies live on?
While lauding civic journalism for helping ``deinstitionalize''
coverage, Smith's successor Terri Fleming, pointedly voices support
for ``a renewed emphasis on those core responsibilities, which I
think we drifted away from.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Swanson, executive director of the RTNDF, says civic
journalism is now less reliant on formal projects and more broadly
defined as ``expanding sources and Rolodexes . . . I would tell you
it's a good thing. The name's had some baggage attached to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston University journalism professor and ex-ABC newsman Bob
Zelnick, who moderates a Batten Symposium seminar Thursday,
expresses a typical view about civic journalism. If it is just
another term for old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting, ``I'm all
for it,'' he says. ``To the extent that civic journalism is looked
upon as a substitute for traditional things journalists cover, I
think it can be looked upon as a source of mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, creative ambiguity about what civic journalism is has
allowed the movement to germinate. But that may also be the
double-edged sword that keeps the reform experiment from winning
the war for hearts and minds.

 (Eds.: All dollars are US. Hells Angels is cq, no apostrophe.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG _ License plates proclaim this ``Friendly Manitoba,''
and the province is best known for wheat farms, flatness, and the
rectitude of its inhabitants. But the hottest agricultural
commodity flowing from the Canadian heartland these days is pot to
blast your socks off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manitoba product has a following as far away as south
Florida,'' said Brent Eaton, special agent with US Drug Enforcement
Administration's Miami office. ``On a larger scale, Canadian
homegrown is displacing brands from Colombia and Mexico because of
its extreme potency.''
</P>
<P>
   Manitoba is joining British Columbia and Quebec as producer of
hydroponic weed so powerful that drug enforcment officials on both
sides of border claim it no longer should be considered a soft
drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the stuff you smoked in college,'' said Staff
Sergeant Chuck Doucette, a drug investigator with the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, which has been frustrated in its efforts
to crack down on one of North America's fastest-growing crime
sectors by courts so lenient that Canada is winning an
international reputation as safe haven for marijuana purveyors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is high-powered product that's producing hundreds of
millions of dollars in profits for some very nasty characters,''
Doucette said. ``Most of it is going straight to the United States
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Made-in-Canada marijuana _ some of it brazenly marketed over the
Internet _ is also changing the definition of ``homegrown.'' Once
the term conjured over-the-hill hippies tending backyard plots.
Today it means indoor hydroponic ``grow-ops'' run with ruthless
efficiency by Asian crime syndicates or white biker gangs, most
notoriously the Hells Angels.
</P>
<P>
   So much Canadian marijuana is now pouring over the border, with
American enforcement agencies reporting a tenfold increase over the
last two years, that the US State Department considered placing
Canada on its narcotics ``black list'' _ alongside the likes of
Burma and Afghanistan _ for not doing enough to curb the drug
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented proposal faltered under diplomatic pressure
and pleas from Ottawa. But Canada's lax attitude toward marijuana,
long a source of irritation for police, is coming under fire even
from the United Nations _ the body's International Narcotics
Control Board recently warned Canadian-based websites now represent
the world's No. 1 Internet source of marijuana seeds and high-tech
cultivation equipment, including computer-driven hydroponic
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Hydroponics is a catch-all term for intensive indoor growing
methods using heavily fertilized water, powerful lights, high heat,
and humidity. Increasingly, sophisticated plant genetics also are
coming into play.
</P>
<P>
   The result is marijuana far more potent than anything grown
out-of-doors. Levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC _ the compound
that gives pot its pow _ average 15 to 20 percent in the standard
hydroponic marijuana that is already British Columbia's single most
valuable agricultural product. Ultra strains top out at
mind-numbing THC levels of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the marijuana produced in Latin America, long
considered creme de la creme, has an average THC content of only 6
percent and even Jamaica's strongest rarely reaches 12 percent. The
stuff smoked by most casual American users has THC levels of 2 to
3percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``BC pot, Manitoba pot _ these are getting the top dollar in the
US,'' said Marc Emery, a British Columbia marijuana activist,
publisher of Cannibis Culture magazine, and open seller of
marijuana seeds via his company, Emery Seeds of Vancouver.
``Canadian growers have a lot of skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangs employ specialist hydroponic technicians to oversee
hundreds of plants at a time. A single superhybrid can yield a
pound of potent buds and leaves every 90 days _ worth $2,000 in
Canada, $4000 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's burgeoning marijuana industry in some ways represents a
replay of the Roaring 20s, when whiskey smuggled from north of the
border slaked America's Prohibition thirst. Then, as now, the
border is simply too long and porous to deter serious smugglers _
who either use unguarded crossings in remote areas or simply play
the odds and place shipments in truck containers or automobile
trunks, knowing that only a tiny percentage of travelers are
searched.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian police are stepping up the battle on the home
front, alarmed at the takeover of the industry by organized crime
and soaring numbers of shootings, bombings, and other attacks. So
lucrative is the enterprise that producers purchase suburban houses
or urban duplexes to grow marijuana for a year or two, then abandon
structures rotted by humidity and rank with mildew.
</P>
<P>
   In an especially troubling trend, criminals now routinely hire
``front families,'' often illegal immigrants from Vietnam or China,
to lend an outwardly normal appearance to dwellings serving as
hydroponic marijuana farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want kids playing on the lawn, mom smiling from the
window to defer suspicions of neighbors,'' said Doucette. ``But
these places are often firetraps, full of makeshift wiring, propane
tanks, chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Winnipeg police have raided eight substantial
indoor hydroponic operations, seizing $1.7 million worth of
marijuana plants. ``It's a huge cash business,'' said Detective
Sergeant Ron Trakalo of the Winnipeg Police Vice Squad. ``It's a
crime industry literally growing up all around us.''
</P>
<P>
   The busts in Manitoba produced a flurry of headlines, mainly
because the staid province seemed such an unlikely marijuana
producing center. In fact, the province is still a long way from
catching up with Canada's reigning champs, British Columbia and
Quebec _ nonetheless, among aficionados, BC Bud and Quebec Gold
have been joined by Winnipeg Wheelchair Weed, so-nicknamed because
of its disabling effects on users.
</P>
<P>
   In British Columbia, annual marijuana cultivation is reckoned to
be worth more than $2 billion, making the illicit plant one of the
most important sectors of the provincial economy. ``As an industry,
pot comes just after logging and mining,'' said Sergeant Randa
Elliott of the Organized Crime Agency. ``We estimate there are
10,000 grow-ops in the province. ''
</P>
<P>
   In raids last month, the agency, composed of officers and local
British Columbia police, swooped down on 80 operations, seizing
14,258 marijuana plants with an estimated value of $5.6 million,
hundreds of pounds of marijuana packaged for shipment, and _ rare
for Canada _ an array of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One home was heavily fortified with steel doors, alarm
systems, and surveillance cameras,'' Elliott said. ``Obviously
we're not talking Ma and Pa growing just enough good stuff to stay
mellow. We're talking major crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Canadian marijuanaas an important export crop
reflects a transformation in the cultivation of North America's
favorite recreational drug. Surreptitious clearings in remote rural
areas have been around for decades, of course, but cultivation in
Canada was restricted by the short growing season. And the potency
of northern weed was unremarkable, certainly not in a league with
the cannibis from Colombia, Mexico, and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the rural plots have been overshadowed by hydroponic
groweries requiring little space and producing prodigiously
powerful product. Such operations are expanding rapidly in the
United States, too, but Canada is winning a reputation as a safe
base because courts treat even commercial cultivation as a minor
offense, rarely handing out jail time or fines of more than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a penalty for a pot grower pocketing $200,000 per
crop,'' griped one drug enforcement officer in Quebec. ``That's a
minor business expense, a cheap license fee. It's a national
embarrassment.''

AUTHOR FINDS MORE STRIVING TO LIVE `SACRED' LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA AND MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an age when so many Americans are absorbed, perhaps even
obsessed, by the ebbs and flows on Wall Street it would seem an
unlikely moment to be talking about the rebirth of spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that's exactly what Roger Housden discovered when he
traveled across America meeting a diverse range of people, from
Hollywood producers to letter carriers to financial consultants who
are working and struggling to listen to their souls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen individuals all over the country essentially
coming to their own formulation and understanding of what the
sacred means to them personally,'' said Housden, who chronicles his
journey in a recently released book titled ``Sacred America: The
Emerging Spirit of the People.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiritual materialism prospers here to a degree that would
stagger any European mind,'' writes Housden, who is British.
``Transformation, or spiritual rebirth itself, through any number
of unique methods, has become a major product line, which points to
how unhappy people must be with who they are already.''
</P>
<P>
   What he finds are people striving to live ``sacred'' lives. But
that doesn't necessarily mean belonging to a religious congregation
or delving into Eastern spiritualism.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Housden found a ``growing call for authenticity. That
is the willingness to stand by and live by what one knows to be
true. I don't mean dogma or beliefs. I mean what you know in your
gut to be so from one moment to the next and having the courage to
live by one's own light.''
</P>
<P>
   Translated into concrete terms, Housden found people driven by
what he describes as a ``spiritual sensibility'' to engage in good
works _ doing something about homelessness, helping former convicts
reintegrate into society and improving public education, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Housden is part of a recent wave of authors writing about a
spiritual renaissance in America _ a theme that has become hugely
popular in the publishing industry. Part of the reason Housden
cites in his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is still one of the most religious countries in the
world, with over 90 percent believing in a god of some kind, and
this religiosity has always colored the nation's own view of
itself,'' Housden writes. ``This is why Americans, even if they do
not articulate it in so many words, and in spite of everything that
points to the whole experiment going horribly wrong, feel in their
bones that there is something sacred about the United States of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   And confirming what has become a dominant view among observers
of American culture, Housden finds the reason Americans are turning
to the ``sacred'' is a response to modern times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prevailing goals set by the culture are entirely
materialistic,'' Housden said in a telephone interview from San
Francisco. ``More and more money and more and more toys. If in
doubt, go shopping. That consumerism is attempting to fill the gap
that you and I and pretty much most people feel _ who am I and what
does it all mean. The people I talked to are interested in
answering those questions in a much deeper way.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for answers is not necessarily leading many people
toward traditional religious institutions that might seem the
likeliest setting for wrestling with questions of meaning and
purpose, Housden said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Housden writes that the ``Sacred America'' he found
is an ``increasing communion of souls who are living their lives,
not by some external dictate of creed or culture, but by the
prompting of the knowing, intelligent heart _ the original meaning
of conscience. This, rather than yet more experts and priests, is
the fertile ground for a leaderless spiritual emergence.''

<P>
   Why don't Christians all celebrate Easter at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   The scheduling of Easter is a complicated task that has split
the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity for millennia.
</P>
<P>
   The Western church, which includes Roman Catholics and
Protestants, generally schedules Easter on the first Sunday after
the first full moon after the vernal equinox. But there are
adjustments to that formula in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern church uses a similar methodology, but does not
allow Easter to fall until after the Jewish holiday of Passover,
because in the New Testament, the crucifixion and resurrection of
Jesus follow the start of Passover. As a result, the Orthodox
Easter can fall as late as four weeks after the non-Orthodox
Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox and non-Orthodox churches have agreed that scheduling
Easter at the same time is desirable, but they have been unable to
figure out how to do so. Next year, however, their separate
scheduling methods will coincidentally bring them to the same date,
and all Christians will celebrate Easter April 15.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The calypso beat became more insistent in my
noggin with every passing reference, every bumper sticker, every
earnest note about Earth Day, Earth Fortnight, and Earth Month. Tom
Lehrer summed it up Earth Decades ago.

   Don't drink the water and don't breathe the air.

   Lehrer recorded that ditty at the hungry i (lowercase CQ) here
in July 1965. The North Beach nightclub was probably dark, dank,
and filled with smoke from, among other substances, today's
forbidden fruit, tobacco. Today San Francisco is a capital of what
the geographer Joel Garreau calls ``Ecotopia,'' a peaceable kingdom
awash in self-parody. Some of its denizens might not laugh at
Lehrer.

   When I interviewed Lehrer in 1970, before the first Earth Day,
he noted that this song was his most popular, many furlongs ahead
of such touchy topics as ``Werner Von Braun'' and ``The Vatican
Rag.'' In the late 1960s, ``Pollution'' had become, so to speak,
mainstream. Among those singing it on television were Arthur
Godfrey, Carol Burnett, Nanette Fabray, the Smothers Brothers, and
Bing Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bing crooned it on ABC, the network asked the author to
change ``mud'' and ``crud'' to ``dust'' and ``rust.'' Lehrer
agreed, he said, ``in the interests of more fearless and forthright
satire.''

   Unlike more persistent troubadours, Lehrer has been publicly
silent, preferring his day job of teaching math, playing the piano
strictly for fun. Good news comes from Atlantic/Rhino Records,
which is issuing a boxed set, ``The Remains of Tom Lehrer,'' in
time to present to college graduates who soon will be, as Lehrer
wrote in 1953, ``sliding down the razor blade of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDs could form a crash course on the Cold War the grads were
lucky to miss. ``So Long, Mom,'' ``Who's Next?'' and ``The MLF
Lullaby'' might give some flavor. Among the 74 sendups are some
seldom heard before, like how Lehrer enjoyed spending ``Hannukah in
Santa Monica.''

   Lehrer once manned a lectern in Cambridge, breathing the same
sharp New England vapors as his peers in American satire, S.J.
Perelman and Fred Allen. He has since decamped to Santa Cruz, an
Ecotopian outpost on Monterey Bay, where the state university is
itself a study in self-parody. Designed in reaction to the 1960s,
the campus has no large Berkeleyesque quadrangle.

   In the 35 years since Lehrer wrote about its defilement, the
Earth has made a comeback. Boston Harbor is now a silken reservoir
of Perrier, recycling is a ritual for millions, and Earth Day has
surpassed for the truly hip the fussier rites of Easter and
Passover.
</P>
<P>
   The Earthlings Uber Alles cult surely needs the needle Lehrer
applied to ``The Folk Song Army.'' A grim bumper sticker, ``The
Earth Does Not Belong to Us. We Belong to the Earth,'' could
inspire ``Mudpie Lullaby.'' Lehrer could do it effortlessly. He's
already proved that he is brilliantly bicoastal.

HOW DUMB ARE THESE REPUBLICANS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick parlor game to determine the bona fides of the Republican
Party's feigned outrage over the snatching of the little Cuban boy
from his captors, er, his great uncle:
</P>
<P>
   Take a sampling of the statements from our leading Republican
solons, and where the name ``Elian'' appears, substitute ``Monica''
and scan closely any quote that contains the phrase ``the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   First up: good old Henry Hyde, the Santa Claus of the
impeachment farce, rumbling about how he's ordered his staff to do
a ``preliminary investigation'' before some big-time congressional
hearings. Henry, we missed you. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   There's Senate majority leader Trent Lott, the oleaginous
Mississippian, forsaking his normal business of looting the defense
budget for his Pascalouga shipyard down home. Lott, who went
through three starched shirts a day running from microphone to
microphone during impeachment, hauled Janet Reno in for grilling
Tuesday. He wants hearings too.
</P>
<P>
   The usual claque of Sun Belt Claghorns evoked images of Waco and
jackbooted government thugs along the lines of the National Rifle
Association's anti-gun-control propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Even New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who knows a thing or two
about storm troopers, denounced ``storm troopers'' in Miami. Now
there's one for the books.
</P>
<P>
   And how about New Hampshire Senator Bob Smith? This is a guy who
gives nincompoops a bad name. This oafish orator, who defected from
the GOP last year only to come crawling back when Lott bribed him
with a committee chairmanship, ran to the Washington airport to
embrace Elian's dysfunctional extended family when he heard there
were TV cameras at the gate and no politician to hog them. ``Abuse
of power,'' sputtered Smith, who is rarely at a loss for a sound
bite, no matter how hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   The same old gang that led the charge on impeachment,
Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, and investigating and harassing
everyone around Clinton, including the secretary and the steward
who brings in his morning coffee, those same Grand Inquisitors are
back in business over this 6-year-old kid whom the Cuban lobby in
Miami refused to turn back to his own father.
</P>
<P>
   How dumb are these Republicans? Dumb enough to try it all over
again. Though I suspect their ardor will cool when they digest the
implications of the poll numbers. Outside of the hothouse
atmosphere of Dade County, most Americans think the boy belongs
back with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   From the lofty editorial perches of New York flutter down
condemnations cloaked in conflicting logic. Yeah, sure, the boy
belonged back with his dad, grumped The New York Times on Sunday,
but the method used, though no one was seriously hurt, ``is likely
to haunt the country for years to come.'' Oh?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Times opinion hardened: the government acted ``rashly
and unwisely'' and should have taken longer in dealing with the
relatives, whose appearances on TV only reinforce the doubts Janet
Reno had about their willingness to ever turn the kid over to
rightful authorities. The Little Havana ``family'' makes ``The
Sopranos'' look almost normal.
</P>
<P>
   The Times thus joined hands with the rabid anti-Clintonists of
The Wall Street Journal, whose fulminations described this
skillfully exercised humanitarian act in gangsterish terms. And not
to be missed is Peggy Noonan's latest anti-Clinton jihad yammering
about the dolphins who surrounded Elian ``like a contingent of
angels.'' This is ax-grinding presented as a film script treatment.
Say, Irv, can we get Flipper for the dolphin part? Is it time to
get real yet?
</P>
<P>
   Remember all the marching around and harrumphing by the Sun Belt
Brigade over IRS horror stories, with tearful taxpayers complaining
that those meanies in green eyeshades were wrecking the lives of
decent citizens? They had hearings that went all over C-Span and
the networks. And the envelope, please?
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressional investigators were unable to substantiate the
allegations of IRS misconduct,'' the AP reported in deadpan fashion
Monday. It quoted the Government Accounting Office _ firmly in
control of the Republican majority these days _ whose report was
completed last May but withheld from the public, apparently because
the Republican ransackers could find no horror stories that
withstood scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation established that the allegations themselves
had been based on an incomplete awareness of the total
circumstances,'' concluded the GAO. Game, set, match.
</P>
<P>
   Toss this report on the mountain of Republican probes that went
nowhere: Whitewater, impeachment, Travelgate, Filegate, the legal
shakedowns of the secretary of labor, the former secretary of HUD,
etc., etc. Millions have been sluiced down the trough of partisan
tomfoolery to no end but to discredit the Clinton administration
and try to overturn not one but two national elections. If that's
not a ``vast right-wing conspiracy,'' folks, it'll do till the real
thing comes along.

FAMILY VALUES FAKERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American cockfight over family values took an odd turn last
weekend. The cocks chickened out.
</P>
<P>
   As we know, heavily armed federal agents blasted into a Miami
home to take 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez away from his extended
Cuban-American relatives and deliver him to his father, Juan
Miguel, in Washington. Extraordinary measures were necessary. Blind
hate of Cuban leader Fidel Castro led the extended relatives to
create a hostage situation, complete with intransigence and the
abusive ``I like to be in America; OK by me in America; everything
free in America,'' POW-style home video of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The show of force was ugly, but the forces that kept this child
from his father were even uglier, including an insubordinant Mayor
Alex Penelas of Miami, who refused to help the government remove
Elian from the relatives. The government did what it had to do. It
was not a raid. It was a rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The final confirmation of this should have been the pictures of
Elian and Juan Miguel Gonzalez released a few hours after the
rescue, with smiles that could not have been faked. One might think
this would be a moment to put aside politics to celebrate the
reunion. Considering how politicians have spent the last decade
beating up on deadbeat dads for child support and blaming absentee
fathers for much of the breakdown of the family, one might think
there would be more interest in the efforts of Juan Miguel to
retrieve his son.
</P>
<P>
   But no, the cocks stayed in the corner. Few of them had a good
thing to say about the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was outraged, I was sickened, and afterward, I was
ashamed,'' said House majority whip Tom DeLay of Texas. ``You bet
there'll be congressional hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same DeLay who has made child abuse an issue and has
said fathers have an ``irreplaceable value'' in raising children.
``Children that grow up without their fathers are twice as likely
to drop out of school and 2 1/2 times as likely to become teen
mothers,'' DeLay has said. ``I know that fathers have a duty, a
right and a responsibility to be an influential and guiding force
in their children's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a member of
the Judiciary Committee, said his committee ``should take a close
look at the propriety of the federal government breaking into a
child's house.'' In 1985, Specter refused to criticize the
firebombing by Philadelphia police to rid a house of the radical
group MOVE, even though that government action killed four
children, destroyed 53 homes, and made 270 neighbors homeless. Back
then Specter said: ``This is not the time to talk about blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire was particularly loopy. Smith
caddied the Miami relatives who followed Elian to Washington.
Smith, who preaches parent power in education and against
abortions, said: ``I'm disgusted, I'm angry, I'm sad. I couldn't
feel worse if my own son were taken.'' It did not occur to him to
say, ``I'm thankful, I'm thrilled, I'm greatful. I couldn't feel
happier if my own son were returned.''
</P>
<P>
   As we all know, the cocks were not all Republicans still
smarting over their failure to impeach President Clinton. There is
Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore.
Despite the determination by immigration officials that Elian
should be sent back to Cuba, Gore announced that the boy should
stay here until a family court decided the matter.
</P>
<P>
   A family court in a hostage situation? Gore had to be kidding.
This is the same man who repeatedly touts the White House crackdown
on deadbeat dads.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most meaningful conferences for me personally was
the one we held in 1994 to promote fatherhood,'' Gore said in a
speech last summer. ``For too long, the crucial role of fathers had
been missing from the policy picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has changed. . . . Nearly 1.5 million men acknowledged
paternity in 1998, an increase of 12 percent in one year _ three
times the 1993 figure of 516,000. A man acknowledging paternity
does not make a father, but it is a start, the first step toward
committing to a child the emotional and financial support a father
must give to merit the name.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gore claiming he is ``leading the fight for responsible
fatherhood,'' it makes it all the more curious why he would get in
the way of the paternity of Juan Miguel, who by serious news
accounts was a responsible father despite the divorce from the late
mother. While Gore's position was no more hypocritical than family
values Republican rival George W. Bush _ who of course also
denounced the rescue, it has to leave Democrats a little less
enthusastic about his judgment as president should he win.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore to join the mostly Republican chorus that placed Castro
hate above fatherhood shows how family values depends on whose
family is being valued. These politicians say we need cocks as well
as hens to raise the chicks. Elian Gonzalez turned them all into
chickens, clucking in cowardice.

NEW ENGLAND ARCHER ON TARGET FOR THE OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Butch Johnson has a gold medal in his trophy case, but a gold
medal isn't a return ticket to Olympus. Certainly not in the sport
of distant bull's-eyes and twitchy fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archery is one of those games where you have your ups and
downs,'' Johnson said. ``If you're shooting good at the right time
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was on a down during the US Olympic Trials last summer.
So when he missed making the three-man team by 22 points (out of
more than 5,000), Johnson shrugged, packed up his bow and arrows,
and went back to Woodstock, Conn. ``It's OK,'' he told himself.
``Life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December, the phone rang from Colorado Springs. It was
George Greenway, the National Archery Association's executive
director, telling the 44-year-old Johnson that he had a ticket to
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Parker, the former schoolteacher who had edged Johnson at
the trials, had been kicked off the team for shooting two extra
arrows in the opening round. ``What was my reaction? Kind of glad I
made it,'' Johnson said. ``But nothing spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Archery's hit-or-miss nature tends to flatten out emotions that
way. If you let your psyche be ruled by the flight of an arrow,
you'll end up pulling drawstrings in a rubber room.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you run the same elimination round 10 days in a row,''
Johnson said, ``you'll have 10 different winners. That's the way
the game is.''
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson went to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, the US
males finished sixth. Four years ago in Atlanta, they won both the
individual and team golds. This time, they could be sixth again. So
Johnson is going easy on the euphoria pills.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have dreamed that Parker could have gotten the boot?
Nobody saw him shoot the extra arrows _ everybody was watching
Olympic hopeful Geena Davis (yes, the actress) at the other end of
the range.
</P>
<P>
   Parker claimed he didn't know he'd done it until he found the
arrows behind the target after the round, when the scores had
already been tabulated. If he hadn't told a fellow
archer/ex-girlfriend, who told someone else . . .
</P>
<P>
   And who would have guessed that Justin Huish, the hang-loose
ponytailed dude who'd gone double gold in Atlanta, would get
arrested in February for possessing marijuana with intent to
distribute, and quit the team?
</P>
<P>
   No alternate had ever made the Olympic archery squad. Suddenly,
two have. The new roster (original member Vic Wunderle, Johnson,
and Rod White) is ``Olympic team version 3.0,'' joked team coach
Lloyd Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is sanguine about all this. Random chance and
hairbreadth margins are archery's essence. Ask William Tell. To
make the US team, competitors shot 576 arrows in two sets of trials
in New Jersey and California, aiming at a target the size of a
softball from 70 meters away.
</P>
<P>
   The top archers will hit the bull's-eye more than 90 percent of
the time. Missing the target is virtually unheard of. ``I might
miss once a year,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing like shooting free throws, and athletic ability
only goes so far. (Johnson didn't play a sport in high school.)
Medals can be decided by a heartbeat _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people develop fear,'' Johnson said. ``Some of them
just can't handle it, and they basically fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was born in Worcester, Mass. and moved to nearby
Webster when he was 14, came to the sport by chance. ``When I was
15, an archery shop opened up in our neighborhood, and I went with
my brother-in-law to give it a try,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Johnson entered the state championships and
beat every adult there. The next year, he went to the nationals and
began a long, meandering path to the Olympics, which had just
restored archery after half-a-century's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Johnson ever had five-ringed dreams. He'd glance at the
TV when the Games were on, he said, ``but I didn't go out of my
way.'' Johnson wasn't even competing in the Olympic event. He was
doing compound (where the bow has pulleys and cables), not recurve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I got disqualified for some of the picky rules they used
to have,'' Johnson said. So he crossed over to the Olympic side and
ended up making the team for Barcelona, roaming the athletes'
village with the runners and gymnasts and swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think, `Hey, there's Carl Lewis,' '' Johnson said. ``But
you'd walk by and wouldn't say anything. You didn't want to bother
them. They didn't know who we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympus was everything Johnson thought it would be _ and less.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it was a little disappointing,'' he confessed.
``There's all that hoopla, but it was like going to another
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing like that in 1996, when the Americans came out of
nowhere (``We would have been happy with a bronze,'' he said.) to
pull off a sweep on home ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said it was one of the best events to watch,'' Johnson
said. ``The stands were full and everybody was going crazy.
Probably the best moment of my life was watching the flag go up and
hearing the anthem. I turned around and said to Rod (White), `This
makes all the hard work worth it.' I'd do 10 times the work to get
back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had no illusions about the gold medal changing his
world. Kerri Strug he wasn't. Woodstock, which is in Connecticut's
``quiet corner'' up near the Massachusetts and Rhode Island
borders, threw a get-together for him when he got back. So did
Webster. Then Johnson went back to his job as sales manager for
Hall's Arrow in Manchester, Conn., and began preparing for the next
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Archers work the amateur side of Olympus, along with the
judokas, the modern pentathletes, the table tennis players. Until
they make the national team, they pay for everything _ equipment,
coaching, travel _ out of pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to make some money at this, but it's not the
game I'm in,'' said Johnson, who also coached fellow Connecticut
resident Karen Scavotto to a place on the Olympic team. ``Oh, well
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   He is famous in the way small-town people are famous. ``Letters
addressed to Butch Johnson, Woodstock CT, show up at my house,'' he
said. ``And sometimes people will say, `Oh, you're the guy who does
the archery.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson didn't figure to be doing it Down Under this summer,
even though he'd won three national titles since Atlanta. He went
to last year's trials in a slump amid a hectic personal time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised I didn't make it, but there was a lot going on
in my life and I was going through a divorce, which didn't make
things any easier,'' Johnson said. ``So it didn't surprise me
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson went back to Woodstock and resumed practicing on the
homemade range in back of his house. In October, he began hearing
grapevine talk about Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew something was going on, but they kept it very quiet,''
Johnson said. ``I was just waiting to see what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   When the word came down, Johnson popped no champagne corks. It's
not as if he hasn't climbed Olympus before. And Parker is still
going through the appeals process. ``My understanding is, he
doesn't have much of a prayer,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a hit-or-miss sport, which is why Johnson left the
year loose. ``I hadn't made plans,'' he said. ``I was going to keep
competing anyway. Whatever happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is between jobs; he's worked at a marina, in an auto
body shop, and as a carpenter. The phone could ring any time
between now and mid-September, saying that an arbitrator has
decided otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Johnson will pack up bow and arrows and head for
Australia, where he's never been. So it goes in Robin Hood's
pastime. ``If you don't make a team,'' Butch Johnson said,
``there's always another team.''

ANNUITY YIELD IS FIXED, BUT CD'S A RATE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. A small pension, Social Security, dividends, interest from
savings, and a 401(k) that has been converted to a lifetime annuity
give me enough to live on in my senior co-op and to travel. Is it
better to leave my IRA in the bank and make the required
withdrawals or convert it to an annuity as I did with my 401(k)?
</P>
<P>
   M.H., Laguna Woods, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A. Well, let's assume you can earn 6 percent on your CD, the
national average for bank CDs entering this week. (The highest rate
for five-year CDs of less than $100,000 was 7.41 percent.) If you
are earning that 6 percent and if you simply withdrew $395 a month,
the pool would last you a little longer than 19 years, 10 months.
Should you die before those 19.9 years are up, the balance in the
account would go to your estate, or to whomever you chose to give
it through your will.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you go for the annuity, you are guaranteed
that $395 a month _ no matter how long you live. If you die before
age 90, the insurance company pockets the residual cash that you
have not withdrawn; nothing accrues to your estate.
</P>
<P>
   There is also another way to look at this proposition. You could
currently move the money to a 7.41 percent CD; if such rates held,
the pool would support withdrawals of $395 a month for a little
more than 26 1/2 years, until you are approaching age 96. Of
course, if you did buy that 7.41 percent CD you would be assured
that rate for only five years; after that you would have to renew
at a rate that could be higher, lower, or the same. So if you
decide to keep the money in CDs, you face the risk that future
rates might make a $395 monthly withdrawal deplete your capital at
a faster rate.
</P>
<P>
   A final consideration is that if you keep the money in the IRA,
you will have it available should you run into some kind of
emergency. You would not enjoy that flexibility with an annuity;
after all, the insurance company's bet is basically that you will
not live long enough to make you a winner in this deal.
</P>
<P>
   I searched the Web for an idea of life expectancy for a person
in your situation, but there were too many variables to get a firm
figure. The best estimate I could come up with was in the range of
eight to 12 years. If you kept the CD and withdrew $395 a month for
eight years, there would be a $47,772 balance when you died; if you
lived 12 more years, the balance would be $42,204. Both of those
calculations were based on the projected 7.41 percent return; if
you used the national average 6 percent interest, the figures would
be $40,259 and $29,780 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to you to decide. If you think you can celebrate your
95th or 100th birthday with a toast to the insurance company, go
ahead with the annuity. Myself, I'd keep the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our children are now graduated from college, and we
anticipate retiring at age 62, after increasing our current savings
level. How should we allocate our money in the next 10 years so
that we will be able to add $15,000 a year to our pension income?
Where should we place our ongoing savings to best achieve this?
</P>
<P>
   P.P., Scituate, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, on paper the course you are taking works out almost
perfectly. If you achieved 8 percent average annual returns from
your portfolio for the next 10 years and contributed $600 a month,
you would have a pool of $229,597. If that were then moved to a
fixed-income portfolio yielding 6.5 percent, that would bring you
$14,728 a year, which, as the be-bop boys used to say, is close
enough for jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not close enough for me, because this would mean you
would have no savings set aside to offset the inflation of the
later years or your retirement, and when you retire at age 62,
there are likely to be a lot of those later years. To give you an
idea of the effects of inflation, you would need $77,582 in 10
years to buy what $55,000 buys now. And even if you have already
factored in inflation when you came up with that $55,000 retirement
budget, you still would have the inflation after age 62 to deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   So I suggest that old unpleasant alternative _ save more, or
retire later.
</P>
<P>
   You may question why I used an 8 percent projection of portfolio
growth _ certainly the picture would have been brighter with an
assumption of 10 percent projected growth. And there is no question
that your fund choices are solid, and the money market position
represents only 16.66 percent of the portfolio. I do this partly
because about a decade before retirement I suggest that people
begin moving toward a more conservative portfolio, and partly
because I foresee some fairly lean market years in the early part
of that 10-year savings program.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion at this point would be to begin moving toward a
more conservative portfolio by using funds such as Vanguard
Balanced Index, Janus Balanced, Fidelity Puritan, or AIM Balanced _
all solid entries and within the fund families you are already
using. Since all of these funds divide their portfolios between
stocks and fixed-income holdings, you will be slowly building a
fixed-income element in your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about five years before your anticipated retirement date,
you should begin stepping up the pace, so that by the time you
retire you will have enough there to supply the needed income
stream, as well as a healthy reserve to be left in stocks to deal
with future inflation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are retired and plan to sell our home in Massachusetts
this year and moving to Florida. We are thinking of renting for one
year before buying a house or condo there. What would you recommend
for a conservative low-risk investment with a reasonable yield?
This would be used primarily for paying the rent and any incidental
housing costs.
</P>
<P>
   J.G., Reading, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Boy, are you planning to do the right thing! I can't remember
how many times over the years I have received letters from people
who decided to sell their northern homes and move to Florida or
Arizona, or any of the other southern climes. And then, after
they'd sold their old houses, bought new ones, and made the move,
they found they hated it.
</P>
<P>
   So back they were coming from somebody else's idea of paradise _
and their finances were invariably in a mess. So, yes _ your idea
of renting for a year before taking the plunge is an excellent one.
And if you're uncertain after a year, it might make sense to look
at another part of Florida and rent there for a year, stretching
the process out further.
</P>
<P>
   As for the best conservative low-risk investment for parking
$300,000 for a year (or maybe two) _ that's a no-brainer. You can
get one-year jumbo CDs paying as high as 7.02 percent entering this
week. Provided you divide your CD holdings so that you're within
the FDIC insurance limits at each of the institutions you choose,
that's a conservative, NO-risk investment. How are you likely to
beat that?

<P>
   For the last three years, it seems that venture capitalists have
been willing to invest in anything _ anything, that is, but
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Why struggle for eight to 10 years to develop a drug that must
go through extensive governmental regulatory approvals when a
dot-com venture can be launched with less money and provide a
twentyfold return 18 months later in an initial public offering?
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotech in the early 1990s was like a Hollywood that believed
in small films from independent producers where you had a cute
story and maybe a clever script and a director,'' said
Jean-Francois Formela, general partner at Atlas Ventures, the
Boston venture capital firm that has invested nearly 15 percent of
its funds in biotech.
</P>
<P>
   But after being burned with lots of little investments, venture
capitalists today ``are like big studios with lots of money
searching for script, stars, and hefty paybacks relatively
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a decade ago when science was the script and story that
wowed Wall Street, today's heftier biotech deals put greater
pressures on scientific management teams to execute a realistic
business strategy for revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the big many venture houses have shied away from
biotechnology. Last year, 26 New England biotech companies received
$121.8 million in funding, or just 2.9 percent of the $4.1 billion
invested by venture capitalists in the region, according to a Price
WaterhouseCoopers. In 1997, biotech drew $202.6 million, or nearly
15 percent of the $1.4 billion invested in New England venture
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is money to be had. ``We've seen a renewed interest
in biotech financing that we have not seen in quite a while,'' said
Sheila Matthews, chief financial officer of Epic Therapeutics Inc.
of Norwood, which received $12.5 million in new financing 13 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Venture houses with sophisticated partners who can spot the
science that will succeed in the market are having no trouble
luring investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pick the companies and execute well the financial
returns can be phenomenal,'' aid Nicholas G. Galakatos, a general
partner in MPM Capital LP who helped build Millennium
Pharmaceuticals, the Cambridge biotechnology firm that currently
has a market value of $5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping European money sources, MPM Capital's president, Dr.
Ansbert Gadicke, quickly raised $230 million for his
Cambridge-based firm, which has invested in 25 companies in less
than three years. Some have been in late-stage investments, where
companies need additional funds just before launching an initial
public offering. Others have been in companies that provide
software database tools to biologists and other researchers for
drug development.
</P>
<P>
   Gadicke, sees big opportunities ahead in biotech, particularly
weekly scientific breakthroughs in genomics, the study of genes
that cause diseases and other areas. These new findings, he said,
will spawn new companies and expand the biotech industry.
</P>
<P>
   One MPM investment, Caliper Technologies of Novato, Calif., a
developer of medical testing using a computer-like chip, hit the
Wall Street jackpot earlier this year when MPM's $5 million
investment became worth nearly $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month MPM rose to the top of a relatively small
group of big biotech financiers, announcing plans to invest a
record $600 million _ 90 percent of it in biotechnology and medical
device and 10 percent e-health startups. The huge investment is
nearly double the $310 million raised by Schroeder Ventures
International Life Sciences fund last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (MPM) are a very impressive and creative group,'' said
John Littlechild general partner at Healthcare Ventures, one of the
oldest biotechnology venture firms which is about to close on a
$175 million biotech fund after having invested $156 million over
the past 3 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be more biotech money raised in the
near-term as investors see the opportunities in genomics,
bioinformatics, and other scientific areas but it will always be a
small part next to high tech investing,'' said Gadicke, who
previously worked at Boston Consulting Group developing business
strategies and product marketing development with pharmaceutical
companies firms as well as his own company.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, MPM led an $11 million investment to put
Worcester-based t.breeders Inc. , which has developed technology to
expand and replicate stem cells, the life-saving blood cells that
are the building blocks of the immune system, together with
ViaCord, Inc. a private cord blood stem cell service company. The
seven-year old Boston-based company collects and stores the blood
from the umbilical cord of newborn babies for future use within the
family.
</P>
<P>
   Gadicke and MPM are putting more money into companies _ an
average of $15 million per company in the new $600 million fund
spread out over three to five years, versus an average of $8
million in the current fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's venture capitalist in biotech is making bets on
companies that can generate revenue and profits in a short period
of time _ three to six years maybe _ compared to the old model of
developing a drug from start to finish that took eight years,''
said David Barry, senior editor of Venture Capital &AMP; Health Care, a
monthly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond starting new companies, venture capitalists like MPM see
profits coming from financing existing biotech firms. Later-stage
companies _ those with positive data from early human clinical
trial enable investors to enter the last and next-to-last private
round before a company is either acquired or goes public. Knowing
whether the proposed drug will work and forecast its chances of
gaining US Food and Drug Adminstration approval sharply reduces the
financial risks, Gadicke said.
</P>
<P>
   Venture firms also are looking to invest in publicly-traded
biotech comapnies who need additional cash to complete a clinical
trial or launch a product but whose share price is often too low
for a secondary stock offering. Called Private Investments in
Public Enterprises, or PIPES, these investmentes enable venture
firms to get an equity stake in a promising company at a discount
price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotechnology in the next 20 years will provide us with new
drugs to treat the underlying causes of diabetes, and certain
cancers and cardiovascular diseases,'' said Gadicke. ``I think a
lot of it will come from companies here in Boston, as well as
California and in Europe. And we want to be the major financial
player.''

THESE ARE FAIRLY CHARMING `NIGHTS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; `tonight' refers to Sun., April 30) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Small-screen spectacle producer Robert Halmi, Sr. has lately
become synonymous with kitsch or worse. His 10-hour epic
mini-series ``The 10th Kingdom'' was roundly considered NBC's
Waterloo last sweeps period (and was even cited as the reason the
network's head of movie development was sent packing).
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the guy hasn't been saddled with a wholly unfair
reputation, though, to continue with our recent propensity for
honesty, ``Arabian Nights,'' his latest (at least until ``Jason and
the Argonauts'' debuts next week), stands as a pretty engaging
effort. Boasting opulent production design, impressive TV-quality
special effects and a modicum of oddball wit, the mini-series,
running tonight and Monday, has fun with its exhibitionism.
</P>
<P>
   Its set-up is a smidgen verbose: The Sultan of Baghdad (Dougray
Scott), having murdered one queen for venal infidelity, is loathe
to marry again, but pesky rules insist he must. All the members of
his harem realize he has gone mad and will murder his next wife
before he even consummates the marriage; only the brave
Scheherazade (Mili Avital), who remembers the Sultan in nobler
days, agrees to be wed.
</P>
<P>
   Scheherazade has what passes in these things for a plan: She
will divert his attentions with a series of fanciful stories. If
she can continue to pique his interest, she will survive.
Otherwise, so long, it's been good to know ya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience must be hooked in the first moments, or you've
lost them,'' a wizened Storyteller (Alan Bates) informs
Scheherazade early on as a life-saving measure. Given that, it
seems odd that screenwriter Peter Barnes and director Steve Barron
take nearly a half-hour to set up their fairly simple premise. Once
things get moving, however, the young bride's tales, however
familiar, take on an agreeable new life in these environs.
</P>
<P>
   There's ``Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves,'' with cool dragons and
an even cooler (and saliva-prone) camel. There's ``Aladdin,'' going
the network's mothership Disney one better with not one but two
hyperactive genies. There's a couple of O. Henry-esque tales, one a
grim variation on ``The Prince and the Pauper,'' the other an
Egyptian, cleverer take on, of all things, ``Weekend at Bernie's.''
</P>
<P>
   And the last yarn, with its duel atop a flying carpet whizzing
through red-rock canyons, attempts to evoke both the ``Indiana
Jones'' and ``Star Wars'' flicks in its gee-whizzery. The climactic
effort to tie all the stories together falls flat by comparison,
but at least allows the viewer time to separate the inventiveness
from the hokum.
</P>
<P>
   With all the spectacle, performances don't seem to be a high
priority, though John Leguizamo is very funny in his dual role as
Aladdin's two genies (particularly the kvetching Ring Genie).
Avital serves as an elegant hostess for the two evenings. But
perhaps the most soulful and evocative turn comes from Saffron the
camel, whose flings of viscous slobber will move you _ at least a
couple of more feet away from your set.
</P>

DURACELL SEEKS A RECHARGE STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much juice does Duracell have?
</P>
<P>
   Deep inside Gillette Co.'s quarterly earnings news last week was
this disappointing nugget: Sales at Duracell's global battery
business were down 2 percent and, worse, operating profits had sunk
by a startling 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are explanations for the setback, most notably the impact
of a weak euro currency on European business and excess battery
supply purchased months earlier by consumers worried about
potential Y2K malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bump on a long and profitable road,'' said Duracell
senior vice president Bruce Cleverly.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no getting around the fact that sales growth at
Duracell has slowed noticeably for more than two years. Revenue
growth that averaged about 10 percent annually between 1995 and
1997 came in at 4 percent in 1998 and 6 percent last year. Now this
year has begun with a quarterly sales decline.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, earnings growth has been better. Duracell operating
profits have grown by an average of about 10 percent annually over
the last five years, but only 2 percent to a total of $606 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, which paid $7.8 billion for Duracell in late 1996,
boasted at the time how its global marketing operations could help
sell more batteries everywhere on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   It also pushed an intriguing idea: The market segmentation
strategy that worked so well with shaving products, generating new,
better, and more expensive labels like Sensor Excel and Mach 3,
would be applied to Duracell batteries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Duracell plotted how it could move more of the global market up
from zinc batteries to superior and pricier alkaline products. By
1998, it rolled out a new Ultra label of high-end alkaline
batteries pitched to American customers who were using more
``high-drain'' expensive electronics than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to global domination. The
international strategy has succeeded to a degree, but economic
problems and other woes in different regions have impeded global
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers (globally) are not trading up to the alkaline
batteries as much as I expected,'' said Gillette stock analyst Tony
Vento of Edward Jones. ``I think a lot of that is the result of
these economic difficulties around the world in the last few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, other questions remain unanswered. Will a more
finely tuned segmenting strategy work for batteries over time? Can
Duracell pull off Gillette's strategy without the overwhelming 70
percent market domination its parent firm holds in the razor world?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very high-impulse, low brand-loyalty category,''
said John Daggett, a spokesman for Rayovac Corp., the number three
battery competitor. ``So far, the consumer hasn't fully embraced
(segmentation). There is some sticker shock with consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Duracell say the sales numbers speak for themselves. The company
generated $400 million in Ultra sales in 1999, its first full year
on the market. Duracell has just rolled out the latest generation
of Ultra and boosted promotional spending to back it up. ``Clearly,
we've demonstrated there's a need for a higher-powered alkaline
product,'' said Cleverly at Duracell.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts Duracell is selling higher-margin Ultra batteries,
which cost about 20 percent more than regular alkalines. But
Duracell has been cannibalizing some of its own regular alkaline
sales to generate the business.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra doubled its share of the alkaline battery market in March,
to 12.4 percent, compared to the same month last year, but Duracell
lost even more in regular-alkaline sales. Overall, Duracell's total
alkaline market share slipped from 50.2 percent to 48.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, second-place Energizer has recently rolled out a
high-end battery of its own. Gillette never had to deal with a
significant second-place competitor to the Mach 3 razor.
</P>
<P>
   Duracell controlled 46.3 percent of the US battery market,
measured in dollars, over a 52-week period ended April 1, according
to A.C. Nielsen. Energizer, a newly independent company spun out of
parent Ralston Purina Group this month, owned a 31.7 percent market
share. Rayovac held 13.1 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue: Are high-performance alkaline batteries really
worth it? Research published in December by Consumer Reports found
Duracell Ultra did perform better in the most demanding situations,
but was too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, the Ultra's big price swamps its superior
performance,'' Consumer Reports said. ``The moral on battery
shopping is simple: Buy by price.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleverly points out that sales comparisons to 1999, with its Y2K
battery sales, will be difficult this year, but still other factors
work in Duracell's favor in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term prospects are brighter than ever,'' he said. ``I
think this is a high single-digit to low double-digit growth
business for us.''

WOMEN BONDING AROUND STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are not your stereotypical strong-willed investors: New to
the market all, they include a dental assistant, a hairdresser, an
accounts-payable clerk, and a nurse. But when the Dow performed its
stomach-turning acrobatics recently, the members of the South
Shore's Kitchen Kabinet Investment Club kept their equilibrium
quite well, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   If your stock-picking technique is a mixture of research and
women's intuition, they say, you surely can stick out the volatile
days.
</P>
<P>
   As analysts try to gauge the mass reaction to an up-again,
down-again market, they might as well examine women like these. If
the current economic boom was built in part on individual
investors, members of clubs such as Kitchen Kabinet represent a
significant subset. The mostly middle-income women meet around
dining room tables over brownies and Goldfish crackers, discussing
market shifts. Buoyed by group security, they are drawn to stocks
with a tangible appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And committed to investing with other women. Of the 36,500 clubs
affiliated with the National Association of Investors Corp. _ each
with an average portfolio of about $40,000 and an average monthly
contribution of $58 per member _ more than half are women-only.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they'll perform better than men is a matter of debate.
Research suggests that women and men do, indeed, approach the
market with different perspectives. One University of
California-Davis study suggests that in the long run, women will
win. Men, overconfident about their knowledge, trade too often to
maximize returns, it says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women, I think, simply make better investors,'' says Jonathan
Pond, an author and commentator. ``They're more likely to hold onto
investments. . . . You don't do well churning your portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when investor stamina could mean the difference
between continued boom and recession, the market needs all of the
long-term investors it can get. It needs women like the members of
Kitchen Kabinet who, at their most recent meeting, held fast to
their 13 shares of Microsoft despite a scathing federal court
ruling that sent the value tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Too early to tell, they said, comparing notes in one member's
Braintree, Mass. home. Not enough stock to worry. Besides, drawn as
they are these days to the business news channels, they try not to
fixate on the daily reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got you glooming and dooming,'' said Lynne Cowan, 47.
</P>
<P>
   It helps, they say, to have the support of a group of women like
them. Many say they wouldn't have plunged into the market at all if
men had been involved. Some cite math anxiety, some a belief that
men would stifle discussion. Some suggest they can better handle a
turbulent market if they bond with their fellow seafarers.
</P>
<P>
   Men? ``I think they'd cramp our style,'' Cowan said. ``If we
want to talk about the kids today, we do. If we want to talk about
how someone is premenopausal or perimenopausal, we do.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to investing, the nine women in Kitchen
Kabinet say they're most comfortable with what they consider a
feminine decision-making process. Picking a stock might be partly
about examining the numbers, they say. But it's also a matter of
examining your gut.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen Kabinet members decided, early on, that they wanted to
invest in growth companies without taking on too great a risk. They
wanted to gauge how well their stocks were faring, based on
patterns they could see and touch.
</P>
<P>
   So while they researched return rates and assessed stock values,
they often selected stocks for less analytical reasons. Their very
first purchase was Wal-Mart, because every time they drove by a
store, the parking lot was full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You know, Wal-Mart's never empty,' '' said Meredith
Keane, 54, a business telemarketer who is the club's president.
``Whenever I go by there, there's somebody coming and going. It's
like the cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that daily observations can translate into profits,
is, to some women, a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Manton, a women's studies professor at the University
of Massachusetts-Boston, considers it one reason that, before the
precipitous dip of two weeks ago, her Womyn Investors' Club had
generated a $10,000 return after less than three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are really great investors,'' said Manton, 57, who
founded the club, of female UMass faculty, students and staff. ``We
tend to be fairly shrewd about looking at the things around us.''
</P>
<P>
   Male investors, too, often follow the ``buy what you know''
strategy, Brown University sociologist Brooke Harrington said, but
what they think they know can be vastly different. Women relate to
the economy as consumers, she said, and tend to focus on companies
such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot (another Kitchen Kabinet holding)
whose progress they can see and touch. Men view the economy as
producers and workers. So the relatively rare all-male investment
clubs, which make up 8 percent of the NAIC's member clubs, tend to
focus on stocks that relate to their fields of work.
</P>
<P>
   All-male clubs also tend to take more risks than women's clubs,
Harrington said. Kitchen Kabinet's portfolio is filled with proven
blue chips, and club members swear off any stocks that involve too
much watching or worrying.
</P>
<P>
   But Harrington suspects that a conservative approach has more to
do with the sorts of women who join all-female clubs than with
their gender alone.
</P>
<P>
   Women who enter the market in groups tend to be older; the
median age of NAIC members is 50. Most are new to investing,
uncomfortable with the financial decisions that, in the past, they
might have left to husbands or pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a household where Daddy worked and Mom stayed
home. Men knew more about the money,'' said Susan Griffin, 51, a
marketing worker who belongs to the Womyn Investors' Club.
</P>
<P>
   Many club members also eye retirement with genuine concern,
aware of social trends that leave elderly women worse off than
elderly men. That fear can be a strong motivation, Manton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down inside,'' it said, ``every woman fears she'll be a
bag lady when she gets old.''
</P>
<P>
   But if retirement can be fearsome, so can investing, Manton said
_ particularly for women who have never approached it before. Clare
Crawford, 61, an administrative assistant at UMass, said being
around other women helps.
</P>
<P>
   She was nervous at meetings, and, from relationships with an
aggressive father, husband, and boyfriend, shy in her dealings with
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy wanted to say something, I'd probably just wait,''
Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analyst Susan Kaplan said she has seen that dynamic
play out in clubs with both men and women. ``The men really run the
group, really tend to bulldoze women into doing things more
quickly, and, to use a male term, `pull the trigger,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With women, Crawford said, she is more comfortable interrupting
and disagreeing. She has become more accustomed to analyzing stocks
and doing math. ``I've grown through it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether her returns will grow as quickly is another matter.
Harrington, who studied investment clubs for her dissertation,
found that female-male clubs tend to perform the best, because
they're able to blend a mix of investing styles.
</P>
<P>
   And Terrance Odean, a business school professor at the
University of California-Davis, says investment clubs of all types
tend to underperform.
</P>
<P>
   But there are definite advantages to facing the Dow and Nasdaq
in groups, club members and financial advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   When the Womyn Investors' Club took a $5,000 paper loss in the
April 14 stock market dive, Crawford admitted to jitters. Had she
been a lone investor, she said, she might have started selling. But
because she shared her woes with 14 other women, she figured they'd
stay in.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, profits notwithstanding, Kitchen Kabinet members say
they're satisfied with the club dynamics as they are.
</P>
<P>
   So every time they've posted ads for new members, they've found
an easy way to winnow down the replies. First, they eliminate the
men.

HO-HUM HOUSTON; A SERIOUS VIBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's an old expression ``GP time,'' which means ``gay
people's time,'' which means at least 30 minutes later than a
designated time. (C'mon brothers and sisters _ when's the last time
you attended a gay event that actually started on time?) Yet while
gay folks perhaps can't tell time, they have always been blessed
with a dramatic sense of timing. To wit, there's Whitney Houston's
megawatt smile beaming from the cover of the May issue of Out. This
would be significant if only because Miss Whitney has been dissed
no end lately, what with all sorts of nasty rumors following her
high-profile no-show at last month's Academy Awards ceremony. But
this is supposed to be major since this is a gay magazine, and from
the first note Houston ever sang, she has been dogged by rumors
that she is gay, and that her marriage to Mr. Whitney Houston _
formerly known as singer Bobby Brown _ is a sham. So, of course,
Barry Walters pops the inevitable ``are you now or have you ever
been'' question. Even less surprising is Houston's answer _ ``I am
not a lesbian, darling.''
</P>
<P>
   This interview took place in February, so there's nothing about
the recent escapades that have turned her into tabloid catnip _ and
that's too bad since tittering about her latest antics is far more
interesting than dusty decade-old dish about her sexuality. I mean,
does anyone still care whether Houston is gay? And besides, aren't
we now preoccupied with Kevin Spacey's business anyway?
</P>
<P>
   More provocative is Nicholas Weinstock's thoughtful essay about
being a straight man whose closest friends are gay. Having one gay
friend, he contends, is cheered in certain circles as ``a sign of
hipness, looseness.'' But since Weinstock's number of gay buddies
and galpals are nudging double digits, he's the ``subject of
anxious observation'' from the friends and family. Even gay
acquaintances find his associations suspect. Weinstock unveils his
journey from a boy raised to ``heckle and fear the dark cult of
same-sexdom'' to someone who, save for the purpose of this article,
doesn't spend much time pondering his friends' sexual orientations.
All that matters, he writes, is his hope that ``Someday we will
live and love and lunch in a place free from priggish rules.''

   Did law enforcement fail to protect a young boy? Did government
officials ignore and neglect what was best for a defenseless child?
I'm not referring to the made-for-TV saga of Elian Gonzalez, but to
Leroy Brown Jr. In January 1999, the 8-year-old and his mother,
Karen Clarke, were gunned down in their Bridgeport, Conn., home.
Their deaths may have been just another statistic if not for the
fact that Brown was the star witness in a case that connected a
local drug dealer to the murder of Clarke's boyfriend. In Vibe,
writer Rob Kenner contends Brown didn't hesitate to tell his story,
but maintains law enforcement types dropped the ball in protecting
the boy and his mother from retaliation. Although initially there
were officers stationed outside the family's home, for reasons
still unclear the surveillance abruptly ended _ even though the
alleged killer, who was later charged in the murders, was out on
bail. In the aftermath of the deaths, the Clarke family hired
Johnnie Cochran and filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the
state. ``Witnesses should not be treated like this,'' Cochran says.
``Somebody comes forward and they get murdered. That sends a
horrible, horrible message.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue, rapper Fat Joe eulogizes his pal, Big
Punisher, the Bronx-born rhymesmith who died earlier this year at
28 of a heart attack. He recalls his friend, whom he brought into
the rap game, but considered his idol a ``beautiful, genuine man.''
Says Joe, ``We can't jump on stage; we can't joke all night; We
can't argue. I even wish we had the arguments back. A part of my
heart is gone forever.''

   OK, so not even Oasis still believes it's the best and biggest
band in the world. Its latest CD, ``Standing on the Shoulder of
Giants,'' stiffed on the charts, and it's unlikely the group will
ever come out with anything as stunning as 1995's ``(What's the
Story) Morning Glory?'' But you still can't beat 'em when it comes
to an interview, such as Danny Eccleston's amusing sit-down with
lead guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher in Q. This is the new
clean-and-sober Gallagher, but he's lost none of his cheeky and
profane candor as he riffs on everything from fellow Brit singer
Jamiroquai, to his inability to drive to the Royal Family, whom he
would flog before booting them out of their various mansions and
palaces. But in true Cain-and-Abel fashion, he saves his sharpest
barbs for his younger brother Liam, Oasis's lead singer. Asked
about his brother's wobbly march toward sobriety, Gallagher
remarks, ``Well, he only drinks twice a week now, which is
Monday-to-Thursday, and Friday-to-Sunday.'' Asked whether he
himself is done with the ``powders'' (that would be cocaine) for
good, Gallagher sounds like a dedicated 12-stepper, although he
quit cold turkey. ``My motto is `Just Say No For The Foreseeable
Future.' I've been lucky; I had the best years of my life doing it
and I'm having a great time not doing it.''

PILOTING THE TABLOIDS INTO THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Pecker wants to be known as the man who brought the
supermarket tabloids into the 21st century. The question is _ is
that where we'd like them to be?
</P>
<P>
   Pecker is the former Hachette Filipacchi (Elle, George) magazine
executive who is now the czar of the supermarket checkout stand.
The company he runs, American Media Inc., has a monopoly on the
country's tabloids. Early last year, he and his investors bought
the National Enquirer and the Star. Last fall they snapped up the
Globe (no relation) and its weak step-sister, the National
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   A brief digression: I enjoy the tabloids. For many years, I
entertained the theory that the fact-based tabs _ the Enquirer, the
Globe, and the Star, as opposed to the Calf-Born-With-JFK's-Head
tabs, like the Weekly World News _ were the purest form of
journalism. They are demand-side, as opposed to supply side,
publications. We here at the good Globe occasionally supply you
with stories of largely medicinal value, about, say, the
re-structuring of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But not the tabs. They print only stories you (well, I) want to
read: Liz, Larry and the pink pills; Oprah, Stedman and those pesky
pounds; Bryant Gumbel and 70 blondes to be named later. When I read
an Enquirer profile of retired engineer Robert Adler, entitled
``Genius Who Invented the Remote Control Can't Stand TV'' _ what
can I say other than, Why We No Have?
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the tabs are now under professional
management. In an interview, Pecker listed the changes that have
taken place on his watch: a $15 million television ad camapign; a
re-design; a return to circulation stability. Pecker has merged the
previously warring Globe and Enquirer under one roof, no small
accomplishment, given that less than a year ago the papers were
suing each other for ``tortious interference'' in the Frank
Gifford-Suzen Johnson hotel tryst. This is not a story you read
about in our Globe . . .
</P>
<P>
   Pecker claims to have broomed out some of the tab's more
egregious psychic hawkers (but not, apparently, ``Star Magazine's
Athena Starwoman, World's Most Accurate Psychic Astrologer'') to
create a less septic environment for advertisers. And, indeed, he
has lured national accounts like Warner Lambert, Schering Plough,
and Framingham's Bose Corporation to his pages.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbingly, Pecker has been pressing his editors for
increased accuracy, to ward off lawsuits. But if the tabs aren't
being sued, it's a sure sign they're not doing their job. Still, on
Pecker's brief watch, Celine Dion has already sued the Enquirer for
reporting that she was pregnant, and 10-year-old plaintiff Cody
Gifford, son of the above-mentioned Frank and the below-mentioned
Kathie Lee, is suing the Examiner over the Feb. 8 article, ``Kathie
Lee's Turning Poor Cody Into a Monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Pecker also talks about steering his publications into the
untested waters of . . . legitimacy. ``We don't publish grainy
photos,'' he insisted to me, a claim belied by some Globe
surveillance photos of actor Don Johnson in a San Francisco porn
store. ``We respect privacy laws,'' he mentioned at another point.
What about Kevin Spacey's privacy? Two of Pecker's tabs have been
working overtime _ grainy photos and all _ to ``prove'' that the
Oscar-winning actor is homosexual. ``I think it would be a
disservice not to run these photos for Star readers,'' Pecker says.
``(Spacey) scores very high in the Star's research on
celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Research panels and focus groups are just two of the latter-day
media tools that American Media is using to introduce the tabs to
the 21st century. (Pecker also has two new projects about to
launch: a Spanish-language tabloid, Mira, and a new consumer
magazine, Auto World Weekly.) I've seen a fair amount of Britney
Spears's backside lately, along with breathless coverage of the
middle-school boy band 'N Sync, evidence of Pecker's outreach to a
younger generation of tabloid readers.
</P>
<P>
   The next frontier? The web, of course. This summer, Pecker plans
to launch an ``all gossip channel'' for tab fans. ``It's the last
audience ready to convert to the new media,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a way around the problem of weekly publication
hamstringing some of the tabs' greatest opportunities. ``Kathie Lee
Gifford resigned her job on a Tuesday, because she knows the
(Enquirer) closes on Monday night,'' he avers. ``If our Web site
had been up and running, we could have gotten plenty of hits.''

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a number of things wrong with John Denver's life that
makes it less-than-perfect TV biopic material. One: It doesn't so
much end as simply just fizzle out. Two: There's not much in the
way of dramatic struggle early on in his career. Three: The
middle's pretty dull, too.
</P>
<P>
   Put Chad Lowe, he of the particularly watery disposition, in the
role of Denver, and what was a tale of mild drama is diluted all
the more. Let's put it this way: The most convincing moments of
``Take Me Home: The John Denver Story'' comes while Denver and his
wife, Annie, discuss his fertility problems.
</P>
<P>
   This is a connect-the-dots showbiz story: His father (Gerald
McRaney) doesn't understand him; his early career's uninspiring; at
a gig he sees a girl in the crowd and his jaw literally drops. He
follows her with the assiduousness of a stalker: Had a record label
not eventually signed him, you get the sense he might've gunned for
a President.
</P>
<P>
   But he tells Annie (Kristin Davis, whose only physical change
from 1965 to 1995 is her hairstyle), ``You follow the rules, huh?
So do I. We (musicians) are supposed to be dark and brooding, but I
guess it's not in me.'' And he wonders later why critics find him
bland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Me Home'' charts the course of Denver's career, from the
halcyon days of the '70s to the sallow '80s and '90s, through the
troubled times with Annie and their subsequent divorce and his
second failed marriage after that. John and Annie's arguments are a
little on the staggeringly uncompelling side _ they both just come
off as spoiled, petulant little kids who have plenty, but want the
one thing that the other won't give them.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of narrative cheating: John saves his marriage,
temporarily at least, in 1976 by writing ``Annie's Song;'' it
actually was released in 1974. Their divorce is played as so
devastating that he's off meeting his next wife in the very next
scene. Likewise, when the singer reaches an emotional rapprochement
with his father, there's no need, dramaturgically speaking, for him
to be around anymore, so pop promptly dies. Denver's social
activism is shunted off to the side, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who at times bears a striking resemblance to his subject,
doesn't exactly command the screen _ the actors playing his grown
children look older than he does _ and overacts while lip-syncing
to Denver's songs. In fact, the best _ or worst, depending on your
point of view _ of this exercise may be rediscovering Denver's
syrupy music all over again.
</P>
<P>
   _____ &QL; 
The show: ``Take Me Home: The John Denver Story''' &QL; 
What: Biopic about the singer/songwriter. &QL; 
The stars: Chad Lowe, Kristin Davis, Gerald McRane &QL; 
Where: CBS (Channel 2) &QL; 
When: 9 tonight

COLLECTOR FACES SUITS OVER HOLLYWOOD MEMORIABILIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you solve a problem like Maria's missing brown jumper?
</P>
<P>
   And the famous guitar that Julie Andrews toted across the
Austrian hills with the von Trapp brood?
</P>
<P>
   What about the Maltese Falcon, also allegedly among the missing,
along with the hot pink satin gown Marilyn Monroe wore while
telling the world that diamonds are a girl's best friend?
</P>
<P>
   And what of Betty Grable's famous white bathing suit, the one
that launched a thousand pinups?
</P>
<P>
   How do you solve these problems? In court, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   In a spat of Hollywood-esque proportions, Warner Bros. studios
and entertainer Debbie Reynolds have filed separate lawsuits in a
Massachusetts court, charging that a collector has taken as many as
250 famous movie costumes and props worth a total of $3 million
from their private collections.
</P>
<P>
   The movie studio and Reynolds, herself a longtime collector and
memorabilia preservationist, say they were stunned and horrified to
see their prized possessions among 1,178 items that collector John
Lebold was offering for auction on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum bid for the lot: $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked and astounded by the claims made against me in
this case,'' Lebold said in an affidavit filed in the two Middlesex
(Mass.) Superior Court cases. ``I have spent hundreds and hundreds
of hours maintaining, repairing, and preserving these costumes.
They are mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebold's proposed auction on the Internet site Auctionfun.com
was billed as one of the largest and most significant private
collections of Hollywood memorabilia ever offered.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advertised items were the ``The Sound of Music''
jumper and guitar, stone tablets carried by Charlton Heston in
``The Ten Commandments,'' jeans and a T-shirt worn by James Dean in
``Giant,'' and the blue gingham dress worn by Judy Garland in ``The
Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the description, it sounds very impressive,'' said Giles
Moon, an expert on entertainment memorabilia with Sotheby's in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. filed the first lawsuit last month alleging that
the James Dean clothing, the Maltese Falcon statue, and 148 other
items in the auction were missing from its inventory. The other
items include a white wool top and a paisley skirt worn by Ingrid
Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' a beige sweater worn by Natalie Wood in
``Rebel Without a Cause,'' and a three-piece green velvet costume
worn by Errol Flynn in ``The Adventures of Don Juan.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds followed with her own lawsuit two weeks ago, saying
that the Julie Andrews jumper and guitar, the Grable bathing suit,
the Marilyn Monroe dress, and other items were missing from her
extensive collection.
</P>
<P>
   The American Textile History Museum, which recently showcased
dozens of costumes from Lebold's collection in Lowell, Mass., has
become a neutral party in the dispute, caring for the items in
question until the court cases are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Lebold insists he has receipts for all but a few of the items.
The confusion, he alleges, has been caused by the fact that
multiple copies of the costume or prop were often made, so that
when one became ripped or soiled, it could be quickly substituted,
saving expensive studio time.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there were numerous duplicate guitars used by
Andrews in ``The Sound of Music'' because one scene called for her
to fall into a lake while singing, Lebold said.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists such as Moon say sloppy or nonexistent studio record
keeping makes it even more difficult to determine the provenance of
Hollywood costumes. One lawyer predicted that the case will be ``no
slam dunk'' for either side.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds says in court affidavits that she hired Lebold in the
early 1970s as a curator for her proposed Hollywood Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The two reportedly had a falling out after Lebold was arrested
and charged with larceny in 1980 after allegedly taking more than
600 items from Burbank Studios. The trial ended in a hung jury. The
charges were dismissed after most of the items were returned.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lebold, of Brewster, Mass., nor Reynolds has been
particularly successful in their attempts to display their
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Lebold's Hollywood Museum on Hollywood Boulevard lasted just two
years, from 1983 to 1985, before closing its doors.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old Reynolds, meanwhile, was forced to sell her
Debbie Reynolds Hotel &AMP; Casino in Las Vegas to the World Wrestling
Federation in 1998 as part of a bankruptcy sale.

TILTING AT WINDMILLS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He travels around the world in search of heroism, romance and
adventure, boldly challenging foes and turning a deaf ear to those
who dismiss his quest as folly.
</P>
<P>
   It's little wonder that ``Don Quixote de la Mancha'' is Robert
Halmi Sr.'s favorite story. Halmi, the executive producer behind
big-budget miniseries such as ``Merlin,'' ``The 10th Kingdom'' and
now ``Arabian Nights'' and ``Jason and the Argonauts,'' admits he
identifies with Miguel de Cervantes' adventure-obsessed and addled
Spanish nobleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, windmills are my specialty,'' he said. ``Chasing
rainbows and fighting windmills, that's all I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Those windmills are probably the network executives Halmi
publicly harps on about their programming choices (other than his
own work).
</P>
<P>
   ``They have, like, blinders on, they're talking to the lowest
common denominator,'' said Halmi, whose Hungarian accent still
clings to his deep voice 50 years after he fled the Communist
regime. ``They can't figure out anything original. If something is
on one network, the other network has to copy it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   For most TV producers, such complaints and criticism would be
seen as biting the hand that feeds them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is ABC, NBC and cable networks who sit up on their
haunches as Halmi's company, Hallmark Entertainment, dangles
effects-laden miniseries with name stars re-enacting classic
stories in exotic settings at a fraction of their production cost.
(CBS executives and Halmi have cut ties and still snipe at each
other, although neither wanted to discuss the origin of the feud.)
</P>
<P>
   The secret to Halmi's success is twofold: He starts with
familiar material, from the Bible (``Noah's Ark'') and mythology
(``The Odyssey,'' ``Jason and the Argonauts''), to historic figures
(``Cleopatra'') and classic literature (``Moby Dick,'' ``A
Christmas Carol''). Then his business-minded son, Robi, sells his
movies worldwide, using the proceeds of one to advance the
production budget of the next. (Some draw parallels to those ``buy
real estate with no money down'' schemes.) Hallmark Entertainment
owns the broadcast and video rights and reruns the programs on its
Odyssey cable network in the United States and Hallmark network
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice when the ratings are through the roof, as they were
for NBC's ``Gulliver's Travels'' in 1996 (the first in Halmi's
reinvented, easily recognized franchise), but even merely adequate
numbers bring the networks back for more.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers are drawn in by their spare-no-expense look,
including those computer-generated giants, floods and ghosts that
make a 30-second promo so eye-catching. All that for about
one-third of the production cost. Instead of shelling out $10
million for a ho-hum two-parter, they can invest that sum in a
lavish production with a large cast, the kind that excites viewers
and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can spend $30 million, $40 million, on `10th Kingdom,' or
more,'' Halmi said, speaking from Singapore where he is overseeing
yet another miniseries, ``The Monkey King,'' based on a Chinese
myth. ``There's even a project now that I'm probably going to spend
$65 million to $70 million on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the money. If the money's well spent and you come up
with something unique like '10th Kingdom' and 'Arabian Nights' or
'Jason,' you'll get it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. license fees are a losing situation,'' Halmi said.
``I can be just as easy on A&AMP;E or Discovery or NBC _ it makes no
difference to me. The marketplace is the rest of the world, and the
rest of the world is incredibly excited _ much more so than the
U.S. _ about what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Isenberg, a professor of film and TV production at USC's
School of Cinema and Television and a veteran producer and
programmer of TV movies, says the Halmis' European business
background has served them well, allowing them to use foreign
financing to subsidize U.S. prime-time programs.
</P>
<P>
   Television critics were as impressed by ``Gulliver'' as its
audience, praising the Lilliput and Brobdingnag mixing of miniature
and gigantic actors. But sometime after the third or fourth Halmi
sweeps megaproject, industry observers let out a chorus of ``here
we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Literary purists and, in the case of ``Noah's Ark,'' students of
the Old Testament, complain that Halmi tampers too much with the
works he professes to love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does doing 'Don Quixote' as a movie do a disservice?'' asked
Isenberg. ``Yes, if the audience thought they were seeing the book.
If they saw the movie, and it created interest in reading the book,
then it would be doing a service. Whether the movie does the first
or the second in a preponderance is a question of execution.''
</P>
<P>
   As for last season's ``Noah,'' which drew flak for rearranging
the chronological order of biblical events, Halmi responded, ``The
Old Testament was written by who, and did it actually happen? Was
there really a flood, was there Sodom and Gomorrah?'' He said he
would not alter a New Testament account because it is a historic
record, but ``if you are not blindly religious, then you can
question the Old Testament on many levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Halmi says he judges his movies' success, first and foremost, on
his own satisfaction. His second priority is viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly want to make any network executives
happy, but I definitely want to get my audience happy,'' Halmi
said. ``Lots of times, critics and executives kind of call me on
the carpet, but somehow the audience comes back and bails me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Halmi, the well-born son of the Hungarian royal family's
photographer (his father) and a playwright (his mother), satisfies
his appetite for great books with a well-stocked library that
includes first editions. He worked as a magazine photographer
through the '50s and '60s before dabbling in television production,
making his first big splash with the Emmy-winning 1989 miniseries
``Lonesome Dove.''
</P>
<P>
   The Halmis' RHI Entertainment was acquired by Hallmark Cards in
1994, providing the seed money for what has become a fast-growing
enterprise bearing out their philosophy that great, time-tested
stories have universal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Halmi plays down his sales technique. ``It comes from
casual conversation mostly, where I say, 'I would like to do this,'
and they say, 'OK.' I don't spend too much energy on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But network executives have described his pitch meetings as
bewitching, with the producer vividly recounting the story (no
doubt he would make ``Arabian Nights''' Scheherazade proud),
embellishing it with his vision of effects, sets, costumes and
locations. As he talks, he leafs through one of those collectible
volumes, pausing at their most enthralling illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Often he is well into pre-production before he has a U.S. deal.
``Maybe if I get you upset, I do it for myself _ and the rest of
the world,'' Halmi said.
</P>
<P>
   Halmi, now 76, keeps up a frenetic pace. A few days after his
Jan. 22 birthday, he underwent hip replacement surgery and was back
at his New York office three days later _ without painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You die in hospitals,'' he said. ``Nobody gets really cured
there. You get cured at home or working.''
</P>
<P>
   His work ethic _ he juggles some 20 projects in varying stages
at once _ is evident in the fact that, in just over four weeks'
time, three Halmi events are premiering here: ``Don Quixote'' on
TNT April 9, ``Arabian Nights'' this Sunday on ABC and ``Jason and
the Argonauts'' May 7 on NBC. (Originally, NBC pitted ``Jason''
directly against ``Arabian Nights'' until, Halmi says, the
``single-minded, stubborn people'' at NBC reconsidered and moved
theirs later.)
</P>
<P>
   Among his future projects: Charles Dickens' ``David
Copperfield'' (TNT, December 2000), James Gurney's ``Dinotopia''
(tentatively set for November 2001 on ABC), and the aforementioned
``The Monkey King'' (NBC, February 2001). He also hopes to mount
``King Lear'' and ``Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's Isenberg notes Halmi is partly to blame for the network
mentality he criticizes, the desire to recapture past ratings
successes with similar projects. ``If you spread the talent too
thin, it gets transparent,'' he said. ``And television has through
its history imitated itself to death and killed every genre it
has.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the critical comments he shrugs off or shoots down,
Halmi agrees he may have passed the saturation point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe I'm doing too much of it, maybe because I'm in a
rush to do lots of things because I have a limited number of years
left to do them in. I'm sure if I were 30 years younger, I would go
much easier and much slower.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he may do fewer films per year ``but bigger stuff,'' but
he won't retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine _ to drop dead on a golf course,'' he
grumbled. ``They're going to stuff you in a golf cart and take you
away? What a horrible thought! I'd rather drop dead behind a camera
or something.''

&HT;     WHITEWATER FIGURE TALKS ABOUT LIFE BEHIND BARS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ILENE LELCHUK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Susan McDougal, who spent 18 months in jail for
refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating the
Whitewater affair, described a life behind bars that included rats,
roaches and drinking toilet water.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal, 45, mixed pro-Clinton politics with her new found
activism as an advocate for prisoners during an address to 5,000
women gathered Tuesday at the Moscone Center for Mayor Willie
Brown's third annual women's summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am dedicating my life to telling people what's going on in
your towns, in your jails,'' said McDougal, who spent eight months
of her jail time in isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Her audience was a diverse mix of women and girls who attended
the daylong event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so hungry,'' McDougal, who has sought better treatment
of women prisoners since her release in 1998, said about the prison
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal served time in seven county jails in four states while
independent counsel Kenneth Starr investigated the Bill and Hillary
Rodham Clinton's investments with Susan and her former husband,
James McDougal, in the Whitewater real estate venture in Arkansas.
After spending 18 months behind bars for refusing to cooperate with
the federal investigation, McDougal was one of 14 people convicted
of fraud in connection with Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   She served less than four months of that two-year sentence
because of a back problem. A judge sentenced her to time served and
ordered her to spend 90 days in home detention.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitewater land deal occurred while Bill Clinton was
governor of Arkansas, but the federal investigation into wrongdoing
began after Clinton became president.
</P>
<P>
   James McDougal died in prison in March 1998 from ailing health.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a prominent Democrat and ally of the Clintons, called
McDougal a ``steel magnolia'' and a ``victim of Kenneth Starr's
vendetta'' as he introduced her at Tuesday's summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr set about destroying the president,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal said while she was in Arkansas jails, she drank water
out of a toilet tank, had to race rats and roaches to her meal tray
served in her solitary cell and slept on filthy floors.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal, who was kept in isolation because of her celebrity
status, also said she witnessed how other inmates' physical and
mental illnesses went untreated.
</P>
<P>
   A few pregnant women, whose complaints of feeling ill were
ignored, suffered miscarriages, McDougal said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he invited McDougal to the summit because of the
bravery she showed during the Whitewater investigation and her
prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Summit planner Caryl Ito added that McDougal's appeal as a
speaker was that ``she hasn't been heard very much. She's kind of a
curiosity, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Tuesday's summit was ``Bridges to Unleash
Opportunities,'' and the event included juvenile court Judge Glenda
Hatchett, the first black chief presiding judge in Georgia.

NEW ITALIAN CABINET FEATURES MANY FAMILIAR FACES  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In an eerie tableau of deja vu Italian politics, a new
Cabinet appointed by the designated prime minister, Giuliano Amato,
was sworn in Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, most of the same people were sworn into office
in the same gold Baroque room in the presidential palace by Italian
President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Then, they served Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema. D'Alema, who in December resigned amid coalition
squabbling but then cobbled together a new government, known in
Italy as D'Alema II, resigned for good this month after his
center-left coalition was defeated in regional elections.
</P>
<P>
   If the Amato government is approved by parliament this week, it
will be Italy's 58th government since World War II, and the latest
example of the Italian art of ``trasformismo'': the process by
which governments, built on fragile and often discordant
coalitions, easily collapse but are quickly rejiggered, often with
the same ministers and policies as before.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Ciampi asked Amato, 61, the treasury minister, to
try to form a government that could be accepted by parliament. The
center-left is badly divided and has a slim majority in both
houses, though it is wafer thin in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
   Silvio Berlusconi, a center-right politician and media tycoon
who was prime minister for less than a year in 1994, belittled the
new Amato government as ``a formation which speaks for itself, put
in place with the sole purpose of keeping the left in power.''
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the center-right's success in regional elections,
Berlusconi and his allies have been pressing for early national
elections. But Ciampi, reluctant to put Italy through its fourth
parliamentary elections since 1992 a year ahead of schedule,
instead asked Amato to form a government.
</P>
<P>
   Key posts in Amato's new Cabinet remain in the same hands.
Lamberto Dini was sworn in again as foreign minister, and Defense
Minister Sergio Mattarella also retained his job. Vincenzo Visco,
the former finance minister, shifted over to the treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Amato had hoped to whittle down the number of ministers from 25
to 21, but the need to placate the many feuding factions within his
coalition undermined that goal. His Cabinet has 24 members, fusing
the ministries of industry and foreign trade into one.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And in a last-minute illustration of the underlying brittleness
of the coalition, the former environment minister, Edo Ronchi, a
member of the Green party, balked after he was reassigned to the
ministry of European Affairs and the environment was given to
Willer Bordon, a member of the small Democrats Party. Eager to keep
a precarious political balance, Amato said he would replace Ronchi
with a politician from the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few new faces. Ottaviano Del Turco, a former union
leader and head of the anti-mafia committee in parliament, was made
finance minister. The health ministry was assigned to Umberto
Veronesi, Italy's best-known cancer specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, a socialist, earned the nickname ``doctor subtle'' for
his deft tenure as prime minister in 1992, a tumultuous time when
corruption scandals engulfed and eventually caused the collapse of
the Christian Democrats and their Socialist allies.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the Easter holidays patching his new Cabinet together.
``It wasn't easy,'' Amato told reporters. ``But at the end, we did
it.''

VOTERS HAVE MANY CHOICES FOR PRESIDENT  
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the ``mainstream'' media would have us believe that the
presidential campaign is down to a two-man race, the field, in
reality, is crowded with candidates, some of whom may actually be
deserving of your vote.
</P>
<P>
   (Notice I said your vote, not mine.)
</P>
<P>
   You can vote for candidates from such ``third'' parties as the
American Party, Communist Party, Green Party, Reform Party or
Libertarian Party, but the true originals are the Independents.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief run-down of some of the more intriguing
Independent candidates out there, assembled with the help of
Politics1.com.:
</P>
<P>
   A.J. ``Victor'' Albritton (Mississippi): The nominee of the
``American Republican Party,'' an unknown organization of which he
appears to be the only member. Pledges a ``new model Star Spangled
Banner'' and relocation of the federal capital.
</P>
<P>
   Paris C.L. Alvarez (Florida): Favors mandatory ``castration of
all international drug traffickers who are convicted in a court of
law'' and government distribution of ``marijuana to all retired
military personnel over the age of 35 if they so desire to smoke
(because) it will quilt all the world harmoniously.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez does not reveal whether he is retired military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   David Broida (Maryland): Twenty policy statements include:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I am as honest as a natural-born citizen of the United
States can be.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I have never served jail time and I am not a crook, yet.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I would not end racism, but I might try to ban the Indy
500.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I have lived in the Washington, D.C., area most of my life
but I have no idea what is going on at the federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Caruba (New Jersey): Head of the so-called ``Boring
Institute'' says even he cannot be as boring as Al Gore, Bill
Bradley and Steve Forbes. Caruba says he is prepared to ``campaign
vigorously so long as it doesn't involve leaving home too much''
and says his main reason for seeking the office of president is
``the perks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford R. Catton (New York): Reason for running: ``U.S. postal
employees have been stealing my mail since 1981.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Gottier (California): Sixty-four-year-old
self-described religious Agnostic who sums up his qualifications
with the single sentence: ``I have lived long.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but probably not long enough to get elected.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Grimes (Delaware): Grimes (no relation, I sincerely hope),
bills himself as the ``Leader and Director of the United Fascist
Union'' which advocates a New World Order based on a ``military
dictatorship form of government over the Earth.'' Grimes predicts
that ``the United States will be reduced from its present size to a
small, triangular-shaped land mass through the loss of many of its
coastal states.''
</P>
<P>
   Can we hope that one of those states is Delaware?
</P>
<P>
   Clay O. Hill (Florida): Hill collected 32 votes as a write-in
candidate for Congress in 1998 and is now running for president as
the Populist-Democratic-Viking candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Just what we need in the White House: Another guy wearing horns.
</P>
<P>
   Martin J. McNally (Illinois): Possibly the most exciting
independent candidate currently serving a federal prison sentence,
McNally claims to represent the unknown ``National Christian''
party and lists his mailing address as ``U.S. Penitentiary, Marion,
Illinois.'' Perhaps McNally is running so he can pardon himself
after he is elected. It will be an uphill battle, however. Although
McNally can run for office, he can't vote, not even for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Andisheh ``Andy'' Nouraee (Georgia): The only known candidate to
recommend porno books on his Web site, Andy's site also gave
shopping tips for would-be Y2K looters. (``Steel garbage cans
aren't just useful for breaking storefront windows; you can also
use them to carry away looted goods.'') Campaign slogans include:
``Putting the `racy' back in democracy'' and ``Putting the `vice'
back in service.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be fun to see Andy and Pat Robertson in a family
values debate?
</P>
<P>
   David E. Wyatt (Florida): The darling of artists and poets
everywhere who insist on wearing sunglasses whenever they are
photographed. Don't look for any references to Lincoln, Reagan or
FDR in this former bill collector's speeches; Wyatt says ``nothing
in the world has had a greater influence on my mind'' than the rock
band Pink Floyd's movie and album, `The Wall.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by his Web site, it's a pretty safe bet that he's in
favor of government distribution of marijuana, whether you're
retired military personnel over the age of 35 or not.

   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Mattie Taylor Roundtree has a way of

doors. She knows something about doors slamming shut, too. Her
front door is good, solid old cypress, planed smooth and hung
straight in 1924 by her carpenter husband, Lloyd. The big
hurricanes of 1926 and 1928 didn't budge the door, or the frame
house Lloyd built on land he bought for $60, paying 25 cents a
week. But the land was low, wet, and Lloyd found a better location
nearby, high on an ancient dune up on 32nd Street in Riviera Beach.
``The men, they rolled that house up from the wet land. They rolled
it right up on tree trunks,'' says Mattie. ``Lloyd, he took care of

WOODPECKER ENGLISH CIDER GOES WELL WITH BRATWURST, RIBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woodpecker English Cider certainly isn't beer, and the Beer Nut
hasn't had much experience with cider, but it might be an
interesting alternative for beer drinkers to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Cider is apple juice that has been fermented, which sounds like
wine to me. The trouble here in the office, however, is that our
hoity-toity wine writer won't drink anything that didn't start out
as grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, since cider comes in a beer bottle and looks like beer,
the powers that be here in the office made me try Woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
   The label says the ingredients are fermented apple juice or
apple juice concentrate. Frankly I don't like this ``or'' business.
I believe they and we should know exactly what it is, but I
digress.
</P>
<P>
   Woodpecker also contains sugar, coloring, light carbonation and
sulfites, which I for one, can't seem get enough of.
</P>
<P>
   The taste is tart and clean with just the tiniest bit of fizz.
It is reminiscent of the apple wine that one can acquire at the
apple bars near the train station in Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, while in the employ of our government, that I was
compelled to rub elbows with the locals and eat platters of smoked
pork chops and sauerkraut washed down with apple wine made on site.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodpecker's color is pale, even lighter than that that of
most supermarket apple juice, but it doesn't have the intense apple
taste or sweetness one finds in apple juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that it's not real apple-ly,'' said The Rev _ a
full-time neighbor, part-time friend and self-frocked minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing I like here is this does not give you beer
mouth,'' he said. ``You could come in from a night of drinking and
just tell your wife you'd been eating apple pie all night.'' (It's
an observation that means little right now, since both of us are
between ex-wives, but each of us made mental notes to file this
idea away.)
</P>
<P>
   Woodpecker is made in Springfield, Vt., using an English recipe
licensed by H.P. Bulmer of Hereford, England. Bulmer is the world's
largest cider maker. Stateside, the company also markets Woodchuck
Draft Cider and Strongbow, which is slightly more tart than
Woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev gives Woodpecker a 3 on the international 0-5 scale. He
said he puts it slightly ahead of Schlitz and Schaeffer, but just
this side of Miller Genuine Draft.
</P>
<P>
   I give it a 3.5. I'm thinking it might be right on target this
summer to wash down grilled bratwurst and sweet barbecued ribs. A
six-pack sells for $6.99.

&HT;     A `NIT-WIT' TAKES ON THE G-MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: APBNews.com is CQ)  
 &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was spy vs. spy, gossip-monger vs.
gossip-monger, one man's ``reliable sources'' vs. another's. It was
a match made in hearsay heaven.
</P>
<P>
   And Herb Caen, the legendary San Francisco newspaper columnist,
bested J. Edgar Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's G-men called Caen a ``nit-wit columnist,'' a ``gossip
monger,'' a ``keyhole journalist,'' and an ``ultra-liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Caen drove Hoover crazy.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear Hoover's panties twisting into a knot when
he teletyped the FBI office in San Francisco: ``Obviously this
matter must be handled with the utmost discretion and no contact is
to be made with Caen until (blacked out). Expedite, Hoover.''
</P>
<P>
   What set him off? Caen ran an item in the Oct. 8, 1956, edition
of the San Francisco Examiner about John Dillinger's watch. He said
the FBI museum had a fake substituted by one of the agents who shot
the bank robber.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents were assigned as Caen fact-checkers, going so far as
to trace serial numbers of Hamilton watches, even though there was
no watch at all in their museum.
</P>
<P>
   After much ado, an FBI agent finally told Caen his item was
wrong. In the agent's report, you can almost hear the great
columnist shrug.
</P>
<P>
   But the item that really must have gotten under Hoover's skin
was one that ran the previous August. Caen wrote that Hoover was at
the Del Mar races, ``on a diet, sober-faced, reading a Racing
Form.''
</P>
<P>
   Caen quotes an anonymous Texan as saying, ``Edgar is no fun
anymore. So serious. Why, he used to come over to our house every
night and sing `Pistol Packin' Mama.'''
</P>
<P>
   An agent put on the trail of that item told Hoover that Caen
``thrives on secondhand information written to suit his own
personal distorted sense of humor. He thinks he is a master of wit
and very funny. In fact, he is a no-good, loudmouthed individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, that's the Caen we knew. And J. Edgar Hoover was a great
humanitarian.
</P>
<P>
   Caen's FBI files, recently posted by APBNews.com, were compiled
from May 1941 to May 1967. They start with an inquiry into a Caen
item about a woman who supposedly ran through a San Francisco store
shouting ``Heil Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover wanted to know more about the woman. San Francisco-based
agent N.J.L. Pieper replied that he was unable to substantiate
anything in the story. ``Herb Caen is a nit-wit columnist,'' Pieper
wrote. ``Most of his stuff has no basis in fact, and is purely
rumor. This is a typical example.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 20, 1946, Caen reported that Gov. Earl Warren was a
shoo-in as next president, and that Warren would appoint a certain
``Mr. P'' to replace Hoover as FBI director.
</P>
<P>
   Caen got Hoover's attention with that one. An agent was assigned
to investigate, and told Hoover that ``Mr. P'' was retired San
Francisco agent Pieper, ``who, as you know, is highly regarded by
Gov. Warren.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent wrote that Caen was unreliable and possibly a
communist, but went on to recommend that ``the Bureau consider
inviting Gov. Warren to address a graduating class of the National
Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Caen may be a nit-wit, but why take chances? Hoover should buddy
up to Earl Warren anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The last item in Caen's FBI files, dated May 15, 1967, again
concerns an item on Hoover's possible firing. This time Caen
floated the rumor that then-Chief Tom Cahill of the San Francisco
police would be the new FBI director, with Caen adding, ``but
that's too good to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Caen and Hoover both used anonymous sources for information, and
both used that information to maintain their power. Both often were
misinformed. But Caen used his sources coyly, while Hoover seemed a
paranoid prisoner of his sources.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover would send San Francisco agents scurrying upon receipt of
Caen columns sent by informants with names like ``Jane Doe'' who
sniffed pro-communist sympathies between the dots.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI tracked such subversive activities as Caen serving as
master of ceremonies for Russian War Relief and being friends with
labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Caen's file also contains this gem: ``A confidential informant
of known reliability reported in July, 1943, that he received a
report from a reliable source that Herb Caen was a member of the
Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Caen's own informants were dubious, but never as
dubious as that. And the FBI didn't have moles like Caen's.
</P>
<P>
   In March of 1963, Caen ran an item about a high official of the
FBI coming to San Francisco and throwing the local office into a
tizzy by inspecting their shoeshines. ``It's a reign of terror,''
Caen quoted an unnamed agent as saying.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI memo to Hoover called Caen a ``gossip monger,'' but
confirms that Caen's gossip was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In his next column, Caen wrote of FBI agents being suspended
(``by their thumbs'') and tattling on each other. ``Frevvin's
sakes,'' Caen wrote. ``They turn each OTHER in.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnists apparently turn each other in, too. According to the
files, in June 1949 an anonymous anti-Caen letter was forwarded to
the FBI by Walter Winchell.
</P>
<P>
   It's a brutal world, and was particularly so during J. Edgar
Hoover's reign. But Caen was just the nit-wit columnist to take on
Hoover, and he didn't even stoop to material about cross-dressing _
with the possible exception of that pistol packin' mama item.

geometry of the universe on large scales is Euclidean _ or ``flat''
in physics jargon _ confirming a general view favored by theorists.
However further analysis of the data show that the universe seems
to lack a feature that is predicted by those same favored theories,

   TAUBMAN-AUCTION (New York) _ A. Alfred Taubman, the shopping

distress _ including the Sotheby's auction house 17 years ago. But
this tale of a white knight does not have a happy ending, as
Taubman leaves Sotheby's board under a cloud. Federal prosecutors
investigating possible price-fixing at Sotheby's and its chief
rival, Christie's, are being told that it was Taubman, now 75, and
the former chairman of Christie's who devised a scheme to fix
commissions in the early 1990s. Taubman has denied any wrongdoing.
Yet what is clear is that Taubman came under financial pressures

   James Goreham sent in a recipe for a French salad dressing. He
doesn't know if it's the one Brenda Canning of Granbury requested,
but he recommends it nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Ada Mortenson's request for lime-treated pickles brought many
responses. Pickling lime can be found in the canning supply section
of the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, we had a request to rerun the recipe for the apple
pie that was served at Jerry's Drive-In in Fort Worth.

&HT;     PLAY GENERATES NUCLEAR FRISSON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT HURWITT  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nobody knows what was said that night in the fall of
1941 when Werner Heisenberg, Germany's leading nuclear physicist,
traveled to Nazi-occupied Denmark to meet with his old mentor Niels
Bohr. Nobody knows by the end of ``Copenhagen,'' Michael Frayn's
scintillating new play at Broadway's Royale Theatre, but the
uncertainty commands a remarkable dramatic intensity.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it all the more remarkable, as many commentators have
noted ever since ``Copenhagen'' became a surprise popular hit in
London two years ago, is that much of the dialogue is about
physics. For two hours and 20 minutes, two men and a woman rattle
off the names of significant figures in 20th century physics and
engage in heady discussions of fission, quantum mechanics, wave
function and the uncertainty and complementarity principles.
</P>
<P>
   But the stakes are incomparably high. As Margrethe Bohr, the
third person present, observes in what is actually almost an
understatement: ``From those two heads the future will emerge.
Which cities will be destroyed, and which will survive. Who will
die, who will live. Which world will go down to obliteration and
which will triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Frayn's triumph lies not only in making complex principles and
conundrums of physics unusually clear, but also in putting them in
their social and political context: World War II and the race
between Germany and America to develop the atomic bomb. Nor does he
stop at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copenhagen'' immerses us in the exhilaration of the '20s, when
Bohr and his associates redefined our fundamental notions of the
physical world. He confronts us with the horror of the moment when
they realized that their theories might have a military application
(``My love, no one is going to develop a weapon based on nuclear
fission,'' Bohr reassures his wife just before the truth sinks in).
And he raises disturbing questions about the moral implications of
both failure and success.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Blakemore, who brought those ideas to life in the play's
Royal National Theatre premiere, has recreated that triumph with
some of the same design team and a new American cast. Philip Bosco,
Blair Brown and Michael Cumpsty inhabit the roles and embody the
ideas with compellingly natural immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   The story is both simple and provocatively complex. On one
level, it's an examination of just what took place _ or might've
taken place _ when Heisenberg visited Bohr in 1941. But it's an
examination conducted by the ghosts of the principals, ghosts that
slip quickly from one time frame to another, recreating the crucial
visit, the happier times in the '20s, the bitter recriminations
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Heisenberg, for those with only a smattering of physics, was the
1932 Nobel Prize winner most famous, among many notable
contributions, for developing the uncertainty principle: Broadly
applied, the idea that knowledge of one truth about a particle
(location, say) negates knowledge of any other (velocity) _
``because we can't observe it without introducing some new element
into the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1941, Heisenberg had become head of the German atomic program
and, apparently, had realized at least some of the potential for
building an atomic bomb. Niels Bohr, generally considered second
only to Einstein in his impact on modern physics, was still in
occupied Denmark. Months later he would escape, along with most of
Denmark's Jews, due to a remarkable collaboration of Danes and some
Germans. He made his way to America and the Manhattan Project.
</P>
<P>
   Margrethe Bohr is the lay person of the trio, though as wife of
one Nobelist (who typed every draft of his papers) and mother of
another, she's more than capable of holding her own. As played by
Brown, she's the ever-alert conscience and sometime judge-and-jury
of the trio, but very much a partisan as well. She's fiercely
protective of her husband and more than a little suspicious of
Heisenberg's motives throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Bosco creates a beautifully rounded portrait of the
elder-statesman scientist. Cautiously fearful about the impending
visit, his eyes light up with intellectual excitement when he
contemplates a new idea. Cumpsty, whose Heisenberg is the engine
that drives the piece, is tense, combative and fiercely engaged. He
wrestles with a concept with riveting intellectual energy. His
personal accounts of a shattered Germany after each World War are
vivid and affecting.
</P>
<P>
   Frayn, who proved himself a master of the complexities of farce
with the popular ``Noises Off,'' is equally adept at juggling time
frames, states of reality and difficult concepts this time out. He
creates a dazzling fugue of uncertainty, playing on the
unreliability of personal memory and juxtaposing the historical,
social, metaphysical and political ramifications of the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There's the revelation that modern physics has reversed the
effect of a millennium of science by placing humans once again at
the center of the universe _ since all we can know of it is a
matter of perception, and the act of perception affects what it
perceives. There's the troubling moral paradox that Heisenberg,
working for Hitler, never killed anyone, while the good Bohr
contributed directly to the annihilation of Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved mystery to which the characters keep returning,
is the ever more provocative question of what caused Heisenberg to
go to Denmark. Did he mean to warn Bohr about the Nazi atomic
program? To seek assurances that neither side would develop a
nuclear bomb? Or information about how far the Allied program had
progressed?
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over the end is the key issue of why Heisenberg,
atypically, never asked himself the question that might've led his
team to the bomb _ the simple formula for the necessary critical
mass. The moment of alternative reality _ when Bosco quietly
suggests it and Cumpsty seizes the idea with intellectual fervor _
is staged with harrowing simplicity by Blakemore. It lingers in the
mind with the awful indelibility of a mushroom cloud.

   JUNKYARD ( Baxter, Ga.) _ ``This probably won't be too thrilling
to you, a wrecking yard like this,'' Franklin Ray said, stepping
out of his jumbled homemade house and leading the way through piles
of tires and aluminum cans, decades of rusting cars and tractors,
entwined in wisteria and wild grapevines, sunk to their hubcaps in
years of pine needles and magnolia leaves. ``Daddy, what are you
going to do with this boat?'' Janisse Ray, a poet and nature
writer, asked, narrowing her dark eyes at a cabin cruiser blocking
her path. ``Who knows?'' he said, walking past a tricycle perched
on a 1958 Chevrolet Biscayne. Ms. Ray, 37, was born in this
junkyard. In her first book, ``Ecology of a Cracker Childhood,''
part memoir, part clarion call to save the longleaf pine, published
in December by Milkweed Editions, she casts a loving but
unflinching eye on growing up poor and fundamentalist in southeast
Georgia, with mental illness snaking through her clan like a dark
tributary of the Altamaha River. Her daddy ran the junkyard (he
still does), and his quicksilver mind could just as easily
resurrect a dead machine as answer the voice of God. By Ann Raver.

   DECORATOR-SHOWCASE (New York) _ You would become a white wine
drinker pretty quickly if you lived in the Kips Bay Boys and Girls
Club Decorator Showhouse, as I did for three days last weekend. Or
straight vodka. You'd think twice about chocolate ice cream. The
28th annual showhouse, open through May 21, is packed to its
sixth-story rafters with white lampskin and goatskin rugs, pale
linen walls, cream-colored microfiber, ivory silk and white-peach
velvet. Red burgundy and bordeaux drinkers: check your weapons at
the door. Lotus-eaters, step right in. By William L. Hamilton.

   MOMA-SCULPTURE (New York) _ ``They were expecting some kind of
experimental house like the one I built in Kobe,'' said the
architect Shigeru Ban last Monday, referring to the cardboard `log'
houses he designed, along with a paper church, for victims of the
earthquake in 1995. But Ban proposed something unexpected: a
soaring lattice arch made of cardboard tubes, which covers about a
third of the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art. Weighing
six tons and spanning 87 feet, it has a lightness of being, a
kinetic energy. And even though it is solidly bolted in place, it
looks like a giant box kite about to snap its string and take off
into the sky. By Ann Raver.

PUT YOUR BRAIN ON HOLD FOR `THE '70s' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; `tonight' refers to Sun., Apr. 30) 
Our rating: 1{ stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   History as written for the Ritalin Generation, the miniseries
``The '70s'' serves up a pop soundtrack of the usual suspects
playing over montages of archival footage of the decade's biggest
news stories, and then surrounds all that with an epic tale of
monumental idiocy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '70s,'' like ``The '60s'' which preceded it (the
miniseries, not the decade, though certainly the decades line up
chronologically as well), focuses on a small, tight-knit group of
folks, at least one of whom is conveniently present at nearly every
major American news event of the era. This requires some massive
leaps of narrative faith _ you just sort of have to switch off your
brain to believe that someone who was at the Kent State massacre in
1970 would become a close Nixon aide embroiled in Watergate and,
subsequently, an environmentalist, or that that same
ramrod-conservative Nixon supporter would be chummy with an
African-American who was chummy with white women, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   That character, Byron (Brad Rowe), has the loopiest arc, but his
black pal, Dexter (Guy Torry), embarks upon a pretty circuitous
path as well, from National Guardsman to movie-theater owner to
radical black activist to doting stepdad to Trans Am owner to cult
deprogrammer. Byron's girlfriend, Eileen (Vinessa Shaw), travels a
more credible path, from dutiful girlfriend to feminist icon _
she's the centerpiece of an early sexual discrimination lawsuit _
but still ends up the dutiful companion. Byron's sister, Christie
(Amy Smart), travels the most hackneyed route _ slut to model to
cokehead to New Agey bozo. Byron's wealthy, booze-swilling father
(Robert Joy) pops up occasionally to dispense the out-of-touch
snifflings of the pompous Older Generation.
</P>
<P>
   As our heroes fall easily into and out of jobs and
relationships, the tumult of the decade swirls about them, and they
learn important lessons but none more than friendship is good.
Interestingly, based on this miniseries, more time was spent in the
Me Decade dancing than playing sports (couldn't Dexter have joined
the Olympic team that went to the terrorist-tainted Munich Games?),
developing medical advancements and ratcheting up the junk-food
industry combined.
</P>
<P>
   Performances seldom rise above the amateurishness of the
material. But if one can compress the complexities of the '70s into
four hours for the attention-deficit disordered, why not into 15
seconds? So here goes, the '70s according to ``The '70s'':
</P>
<P>
   Kent State: Terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon: Even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Racism and sexual discrimination: Even worse, if possible, than
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism: OK, but don't get carried away.
</P>
<P>
   Streaking: See Feminism.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental activism: OK, but not that interesting a plot
point, so let's move on.
</P>
<P>
   Rock music: Best thing about the decade, even if, or maybe
because, it led to promiscuous sex.
</P>
<P>
   Promiscuous sex: OK, thanks to the pill, but don't let it lead
to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs: Iffy, but don't overdose or let it lead to a rudderless
spiritual quest.
</P>
<P>
   Rudderless spiritual quests: See Kent State.
</P>
<P>
   Disco: See ``Nixon.'' &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``The '70s.'' &QL; 
What: Miniseries about friends enduring the Me Decade. &QL; 
The stars: Brad Rowe, Vinessa Shaw, Guy Torry, Amy Smart. &QL; 
Where: NBC (Channel 4). &QL; 
When: 9 tonight and Monday. &QL;

U.S. NAVY TO INVESTIGATE DEATHS OF 3 WORLD WAR II MARINES

   TOKYO _ The U.S. Navy is investigating the deaths of three
American marines whose remains were concealed in a cave on Okinawa
from the end of World War II until 1998, according to a Marine
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a tip in 1998, the police in the town of Naha
discovered the remains of the marines, who had been missing since
July, 1945, shortly before the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the Navy identified the bones as those of Pvts. James D.
Robinson, John M. Smith and Isaac Stokes of the 37th Marine
Company, they were returned to family members in the United States
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese news media reported Wednesday that Naha residents
and Japanese soldiers had killed the U.S. servicemen in retaliation
for the rape of Okinawan women. The news reports quoted local
residents who said that the bodies had been dumped in the cave and
that villagers had made a pact never to speak of the incident.

IRAQ DENIES ENTRY TO RUSSIAN U.N. INVESTIGATOR

  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE

   UNITED NATIONS _ A former Russian ambassador to the United
Nations and the United States has been rebuffed by the Iraqis as he
tried to reopen an investigation into Kuwaiti prisoners still
missing after the 1990 Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The former ambassador, Yuli Vorontsov, who Secretary-General
Kofi Annan appointed in February as a special coordinator for
unanswered questions about missing Iraqis and citizens of other
nations, as well as Kuwaiti property, reported to the Security
Council Wednesday morning that he was still seeking a meeting with
the Iraqis. The envoy met recently with officials of Kuwait, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 people are still missing after falling into Iraqi
custody. Ambassador James Cunningham, the deputy U.S.
representative, told the council that Iraq, which is considered
close to the Russians, had an obligation to release prisoners or
return the remains of those who had died. ``Moreover, it is the
decent, humanitarian thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Saddam Hussein has also refused entry to the
Dutch ambassador at the United Nations, Peter van Walsum, who is
the chairman of the council's Iraqi sanctions committee. He has
tried for several months to visit Iraq to gauge the level of
civilian suffering because of sanctions imposed in 1990.

<P>
   Dead men tell no tales _ unless, of course, they have e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   At FinalThoughts.com, the dearly departed can send messages from
the Great Beyond to anyone with an electronic address. Web site
members can pen letters _ to friends, relatives, enemies, whomever
_ that are mailed upon their death.
</P>
<P>
   Never told Uncle Harry how much those fishing trips meant? Ship
him a posthumous thanks. Still not speaking to the ex-best friend
who can't keep a secret? Patch things up postmortem.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for FinalThoughts.com (www.finalthoughts.com) came to
30-year-old Todd Michael Krim during a particularly turbulent
flight from Los Angeles to London. As the plane tossed, Krim got to
thinking about ``what I would have left unsaid and undone'' in the
event of his demise.
</P>
<P>
   FinalThoughts.com launched in September and expanded in
February. Krim says about 10,000 people have signed up for the free
services the site provides: estate planning, funeral planning,
end-of-life-care, spirituality and genealogy. Members come from 50
countries and average a surprisingly spry 39 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   Although estate planning is the site's most popular feature, the
buzz has focused on e-mails from the hereafter. (In reality,
members choose one or more ``guardian angels,'' who send the
members' messages postmortem.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have told me that they've written apology letters
to friends and family members who they no longer talk to,'' Krim
says. ``It's pretty powerful. Think of how many people have lost
touch with people, or for whatever reasons there are just
irreconcilable differences. It's a way of bringing closure, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   FinalThoughts.com remains relatively untested: No member,
thankfully, has expired. But peace of mind counts for everything in
a business like Krim's. Clients will one day be departed, but at
least they won't be deleted.

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The movies couldn't do it. Radio couldn't do it. Even television
couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   With each great leap forward in communications, pundits have
prophesied the death of the lowly, old-fashioned paper book. Now
it's the Internet's turn, as growing numbers of technophiles claim
that Internet ``e-publishing'' will deliver the death blow to
paperbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, touting its e-book reading software, predicts that
e-book sales will overtake paper by 2009. Bill Gates and other
high-tech aficionados say digital books will be significantly
cheaper than printed titles, because there won't be costs related
to printing, binding and shipping. And, they say, as newly designed
reading devices (some of which will be hitting stores by Christmas)
replace eyestrain with ease, consumers will flock to them.
</P>
<P>
   E-enthusiasts point to the success of Stephen King's ``Riding
the Bullet,'' a 67-page novella published in mid-March as an
``electronic-only'' book. When the story became available,
Amazon.com averaged one consumer download per second for it. Within
three days of its release, more than 500,000 King fans either paid
$2.50 for the story or took advantage of downloads offered free by
some Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   That phenomenal commercial performance led to a ``Time''
magazine cover story and a lot of I-told-you-so's from e-book
proselytizers. Now, they say, all the revolution needs for ultimate
success is some clever design work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the (current) e-book devices are not ready for prime
time, but that is changing,'' says Jeff Bezos, chief executive
officer of Amazon.com. ``It's not a matter of whether (they'll
penetrate the market), it's a question of when.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the news media hype and ambitious publishing plans,
there are holes in this scenario. For one, King _ one of a few true
name-brand authors _ is a phenomenon unto himself. No matter what
format he uses, people will buy his work. (Lost in all the
excitement of ``Riding the Bullet's'' success is the very real
possibility that if the novella had been offered in print as well
as online, the unprecedented tide of electronic sales would have
been reduced to a trickle.)
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Applebaum, senior vice president of Random House, says
``Riding the Bullet'' is probably an aberration, at least in
today's book market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe right now one of the most popular full-length
e-books is Peter Abraham's `Crying Wolf,' and that has maybe
downloaded 1,000 copies,'' Applebaum says. ``We are not
unenthusiastic about e-books, but we're not in the front lines of
those saying they will replace bound books in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, what's good for publishers _ and consumers _ isn't
necessarily good for writers. Author royalties are based on the
retail price. On a $20 book, a 15 percent royalty _ the typical
percentage _ earns the writer $3. If the e-book version has a
drastically reduced price, as its proponents claim it will, authors
lose out. (Royalties on a $2 sale, for example, are 30 cents).
</P>
<P>
   And because so few authors sell books by the crate as King does,
``They're not going to go along with that,'' predicts Phyllis
Grann, president of Penguin Putnam.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that, unless authors and publishers work out a new
pay structure (or e-books remain as expensive as print),
technophiles will mostly be reading test patterns or a lot of
college fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, say bibliophiles who are unwilling to part with their
book jackets and bindings, there is another way.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry watchers say that not only will e-books at best be
a niche product, but recent advances in printing technology in this
digital age will usher in a new golden era of old-school
publishing. The emerging process is called ``print on demand,''
which Random House's Applebaum says ``is getting less attention
(than e-books) but is very interesting.'' The process, in short, is
making it faster, cheaper and easier to print books than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   Print on demand makes use of high-speed laser printers and
cutting-edge publishing software that eliminates many of the most
expensive, time-consuming steps in the printing process.
Previously, it was far too expensive for a printing company to
produce just 10, 50 or 100 copies of a book, but the new process
can produce limited runs inexpensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big offset press that everybody uses for traditional
printing can't print profitably under about 2,000 copies,'' says
Paul Hilts, technology editor for Publishers Weekly. ``Print on
demand is a wonderful boon because you can profitably print tiny
orders of one book _ 10 books, less than a cartonload.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hilts, retail chains such as Barnes &AMP; Noble and
Borders Books and Music are experimenting with placing
print-on-demand stations in their stores: If the book you want
isn't on the shelf, the store would be able to print and bind it
for you in about five minutes. But print on demand won't just make
it easier to pick up a new paperback copy of an out-of-stock
bestseller. Hilts thinks it will lead to an explosion of
small-press publishing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Don DeHart, president of DeHart's Printing Services in Santa
Clara, Calif., which offers print on demand, says he has seen the
explosion begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get requests for it daily,'' he says. ``I've had half a
dozen requests today from people who are interested in having us
print anywhere from 25 copies of a book to several hundred.''
</P>
<P>
   DarkTales Publishing, founded last year by three horror fans,
has jumped on the print-on-demand bandwagon, printing eight novels
and short-story anthologies.
</P>
<P>
   Although DarkTales' most popular book has sold only about 1,000
copies, the low cost of on-demand printing has kept the company in
the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to spark a renaissance in literature,''
says Keith Herber of Mt. Prospect, Ill., one of DarkTales'
founders. ``You no longer have to kowtow to the publishers and
write something they want to sell. If you've got a book you want to
publish, you can do it yourself for $250.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which, to be sure, is likely to hold off the rise of
e-books, especially for kids already more comfortable with laptops
and Palm Pilots than printed books. But it does suggest that
Gutenberg's adherents won't go without a fight.  &QL;

Consumers may have often suspected computer companies of trying to
pick their pockets. Now the companies are trying to fill them.
Small enough to slip into a shirt pocket or purse, handheld
computers are appearing with capabilities that go far beyond their
original task of organizing personal information. Once viewed as
Silicon Valley fashion accessories, geek toys and portable
sidekicks for desktop computers, these miniature computers are
reaching for a broader consumer audience as they add power and an

   JUNKYARD ( Baxter, Ga.) _ ``This probably won't be too thrilling
to you, a wrecking yard like this,'' Franklin Ray said, stepping
out of his jumbled homemade house and leading the way through piles
of tires and aluminum cans, decades of rusting cars and tractors,
entwined in wisteria and wild grapevines, sunk to their hubcaps in
years of pine needles and magnolia leaves. ``Daddy, what are you
going to do with this boat?'' Janisse Ray, a poet and nature
writer, asked, narrowing her dark eyes at a cabin cruiser blocking
her path. ``Who knows?'' he said, walking past a tricycle perched
on a 1958 Chevrolet Biscayne. Ms. Ray, 37, was born in this
junkyard. In her first book, ``Ecology of a Cracker Childhood,''
part memoir, part clarion call to save the longleaf pine, published
in December by Milkweed Editions, she casts a loving but
unflinching eye on growing up poor and fundamentalist in southeast
Georgia, with mental illness snaking through her clan like a dark
tributary of the Altamaha River. Her daddy ran the junkyard (he
still does), and his quicksilver mind could just as easily
resurrect a dead machine as answer the voice of God. By Ann Raver.

   DECORATOR-SHOWCASE (New York) _ You would become a white wine
drinker pretty quickly if you lived in the Kips Bay Boys and Girls
Club Decorator Showhouse, as I did for three days last weekend. Or
straight vodka. You'd think twice about chocolate ice cream. The
28th annual showhouse, open through May 21, is packed to its
sixth-story rafters with white lampskin and goatskin rugs, pale
linen walls, cream-colored microfiber, ivory silk and white-peach
velvet. Red burgundy and bordeaux drinkers: check your weapons at
the door. Lotus-eaters, step right in. By William L. Hamilton.

   MOMA-SCULPTURE (New York) _ ``They were expecting some kind of
experimental house like the one I built in Kobe,'' said the
architect Shigeru Ban last Monday, referring to the cardboard `log'
houses he designed, along with a paper church, for victims of the
earthquake in 1995. But Ban proposed something unexpected: a
soaring lattice arch made of cardboard tubes, which covers about a
third of the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art. Weighing
six tons and spanning 87 feet, it has a lightness of being, a
kinetic energy. And even though it is solidly bolted in place, it
looks like a giant box kite about to snap its string and take off
into the sky. By Ann Raver.

</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The movies couldn't do it. Radio couldn't do it. Even television
couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   With each great leap forward in communications, pundits have
prophesied the death of the lowly, old-fashioned paper book. Now
it's the Internet's turn, as growing numbers of technophiles claim
that Internet ``e-publishing'' will deliver the death blow to
paperbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, touting its e-book reading software, predicts that
e-book sales will overtake paper by 2009. Bill Gates and other
high-tech aficionados say digital books will be significantly
cheaper than printed titles, because there won't be costs related
to printing, binding and shipping. And, they say, as newly designed
reading devices (some of which will be hitting stores by Christmas)
replace eyestrain with ease, consumers will flock to them.
</P>
<P>
   E-enthusiasts point to the success of Stephen King's ``Riding
the Bullet,'' a 67-page novella published in mid-March as an
``electronic-only'' book. When the story became available,
Amazon.com averaged one consumer download per second for it. Within
three days of its release, more than 500,000 King fans either paid
$2.50 for the story or took advantage of downloads offered free by
some Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   That phenomenal commercial performance led to a ``Time''
magazine cover story and a lot of I-told-you-so's from e-book
proselytizers. Now, they say, all the revolution needs for ultimate
success is some clever design work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the (current) e-book devices are not ready for prime

there are holes in this scenario. For one, King _ one of a few true

been reduced to a trickle.)

unenthusiastic about e-books, but we're not in the front lines of

</P>
<P>
   Further, what's good for publishers _ and consumers _ isn't
necessarily good for writers. Author royalties are based on the

CYBERHIJACKERS STEAL CELEBRITY NAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's in a name? Until a few months ago, the last thing you
would have found on www.brianwilson.com was Brian Wilson. At the
time, the site consisted of a save-the-Earth campaign manned by an
environmentalist who was using the name of the famous Beach
Boy-turned-recluse to lure Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson is not the only victim of cybersquatting or what
others popularly call cyber-hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   Try punching in brucespringsteen.com. A Broooooce fan site? A
list of tour dates? Set lists from every show?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Brucespringsteen.com is a celebrity site. The site's
current ``celebrity of the week'' isn't even The Boss. It's Brad.
As in Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   And one site named for Paul McCartney leads to pornographic
material.
</P>
<P>
   No celebrities, apparently, are immune from this latest trend.
From musicians to movie stars to politicians, people with famous
names are getting hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   Matter of fact, unless you protect your name by registering it
with a dot-com directory such as networksolutions.com, it's open
season on (insert your name here).
</P>
<P>
   This is how it works: Cybersquatters pay as little as $70 to
purchase an unclaimed Internet domain name through one of the many
dot-com companies that offer the service. Once they have dibs on
the name, they create a site using that name as the address _
brianwilson.com, for instance. You do a search for Brian Wilson.
Brianwilson.com shows up. You click on it.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing this is not what you wanted, you are now faced with
two choices: stay or go. Cybersquatters, of course, are hoping
you'll stay and pay attention to whatever it is they're touting.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion and frustration are the obvious problems associated
with cybersquatting. The bigger problem: Some cybersquatters have
demanded money from famous people whose names have been
cyber-jacked to relinquish the claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's legalized thievery,'' says Jeff Liles, creative director
for Nvision, a division of Vectrix, a Dallas-based Internet company
that, among other things, creates Web sites. ``To take someone
else's name and sell it back to them, that's almost extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of cybersquatting cases recently involved high-profile
artists, politicians and organizations, from the Worldwide
Wrestling Federation to pop singer Don Henley to Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens every day,'' says Matthew Yarbrough, Special
Internet Council for law firm Vinson &AMP; Elkins in Dallas. ``Some
people know that using a famous person's name alone is gonna
generate traffic, and traffic is one of the most valuable
commodities on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, though, lawmakers are catching up. The first step toward
regulating cybersquatting was taken in November, when the
Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act was passed, making it
illegal to register a trademark name for the purpose of peddling it
to its rightful owner. Consequently, Yarbrough says, the number of
cases in which cybersquatters demand money to relinquish domain
names will probably drop (the Brian Wilson case, the perfect
example, was settled out of court; the site now belongs to him).
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard the court uses on cybersquatters is, `Are you
using this site in bad faith and intend to profit from it?' If they
do, then the court cannot only abort that site but it can also take
other action,'' Yarbrough says.
</P>
<P>
   But not all cybersquatters want your money. Some would rather
have your time. They lure you in the same way _ using a famous
person's name as their site address _ but push personal agendas,
not products or services.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has clinched the Republican presidential nomination,
recently encountered such a situation. A 30-year-old New York
database programmer, Zack Exley, started an anti-Bush site,
gwbush.com, causing the Texas governor to say, ``There ought to be
limits to freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign never sued, but it lodged a complaint with the
Federal Election Commission; the FEC recently dismissed it, saying
it had more serious complaints to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   But even seemingly harmless fan sites that use celebrity names
as addresses have come under fire. Courtney Love and the estate of
Kurt Cobain went to court in February to gain control of hole.com,
courtneylove.com and Kurt-Cobain.com, a trio of Nirvana-related
sites that are not sanctioned by Love, the controversial lead
singer of the rock group Hole and widow of Nirvana leader Kurt
Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   According to her PR flack, Love is upset because these sites
feature personal information that she doesn't want floating in
cyberspace. Kurt-Cobain.com, for instance, contains Cobain's
suicide note.
</P>
<P>
   Since Love took the issue to court, though, hole.com and
courtneylove.com have disappeared, at least this week.
</P>
<P>
   Love may have gotten lucky. Web sites that aren't created for
profit, only to provide information, may be a little harder to
exterminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sites are probably going to be OK as long as they don't
try to ride on the coattails of the celebrity and say that they
represent them or are affiliated with them,'' says Geoff Mantooth,
a lawyer for Decker, Jones, McMackin, McClane, Hall and Bates in
Fort Worth. ``If they're just presenting information, they have
First Amendment rights to do so. There's a fine line between
putting up a Web site for commentary and trying to make money off
it.''

   Saving Easter Lilies
</P>
<P>
   Q. I work in a nursing home where many patients get Easter
lilies as gifts. Everyone just throws them out when the flowers are
finished. I think that's a shame, and I would like to take them
home and plant them in my garden. Will they grow? Will they flower
again next Easter?  &QL; 
A. Don't take the Easter part of the name too literally. This
best-loved member of the lily family, Lilium longiflorum, actually
blooms in midsummer when it has its druthers. But since more than
11 million are forced into early bloom and sold all potted up and
decorated, this lily and Easter are forever entwined.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing a bulb takes a toll, and it can't be counted on to force
again for the following Easter, but given a year to rest up in your
garden, Easter lilies can recover and will bloom next summer and
every one for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   So gather them up (they look much better when planted in groups
anyway) and care for them inside until after the last frost date in
your area. Knock each bulb out of its pot, trying hard to keep the
soil around it. Plant it with the base eight inches deep in a
sunny, well-drained spot, leaving the foliage and flower stem
intact. The flowers will be finished, but the shiny green leaves
should remain all summer, and they play an important part in
providing food to help the bulb regain its strength.
</P>
<P>
   Planting the lily so deep allows the part of the stem that is
below ground to develop roots and protects the bulb over the
winter. Unlike many other bulbs that grow roots only from the base
of the bulb, L. longiflorum is a stem-rooter, growing roots along
the buried stem as well as from the bulb's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Don't cut the stalk down until the leaves turn yellow, and
fertilize once a month between now and then. A three-inch winter
mulch is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Next Easter will come and go without a peep from your lilies,
but the mother bulbs will be hard at work, developing new flower
stems for the Easter-in-July show.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering Grandmother
</P>
<P>
   Q. I want to plant a tree as a memorial to my grandmother. Could
you tell me which species suitable to the Northeast are the longest
lived?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It isn't the length of the life that counts, it's the quality
and meaning the life contains. The best species of tree might be
the one she swung on as a little girl, or the one your grandfather
proposed under, or even the one she planted to commemorate your
birth.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know which tree she would have preferred, you'll
have to balance longevity against other factors to make the right
decision. Canadian hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) can live more than
600 years, with the record being more than 900, but an insect, the
hemlock woolly adelgid, is wiping out hemlocks at a frightening
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern white pine can live longer than 400 years, but it is
susceptible to insects and diseases, and won't tolerate road salt
well. Ginkgo biloba can live to more than 300 years, and it doesn't
have any natural enemies or diseases in North America, but it
doesn't appeal to everyone and the female produces fruit that has
an unpleasant odor when it ripens and drops off.
</P>
<P>
   Since all grandmothers are beautiful, a beautiful tree like a
white oak (Quercus alba), a sugar maple (Acer saccharum), a white
fir (Abies concolor) or a European beech (Fagus sylvatica) might be
a terrific choice. Each can live to at least 200 years, but more
important, each would be a stunning memorial: stately, sheltering
and strong, looking better as it gets older. Of course, if your
grandmother didn't like squirrels, forget the oak.
</P>

   How to Get Noticed By a Search Engine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a small Web site that I would like to get listed on a
search engine. How do I do that?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most of the major search engines have a link that will let
you submit your site's URL for inclusion in their database. (It may
take a while to get added to the list, so be patient.) If you don't
want to go from site to site and register your address, there are
services like the one at www.submit-it.com that will do it for you,
for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines are usually composed of three parts. The
``spider'' or the ``crawler'' will first visit your site, follow
the links to the other pages within the site and check back
regularly to see if anything has changed. The information the
spider collects is passed to the index, a catalog of all the Web
pages that the spider has found. Until the page has been indexed,
it will not appear in the results given to users of that particular
search engine.
</P>
<P>
   The third part of the search engine is the actual software,
which combs the index and looks for results that match a query. The
software will try to rank the results according to relevance, which
can be based on several factors.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a keyword in the title of your page, or in the
headline, the page would probably rank higher on the relevance
scale. If a keyword is used repeatedly in your Web site, the site
would probably get a higher relevancy rating as well. These are
basic guidelines, though, because search engines have gotten much
more sophisticated in how they determine relevancy.
</P>
<P>
   For Web masters and site builders, The Search Engine Watch page
(www.searchenginewatch.com) is a good source of information. There
is a fee for some of the information, but there is still a lot of
data available for free.
</P>
<P>
   Deciphering an Error Message
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I boot up my computer, I get a message box that says,
``Incorrect version of MAPI32.dll.'' What is the program with the
problem, and how do I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   A. That particular error message is related to the Microsoft
e-mail program, Outlook. If you are getting that message, which is
not uncommon, or a message that the file is missing or damaged, you
may want to try the following for your version of Outlook. If you
have it open, close the program before trying to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   For Outlook 2000 users, go to the Start menu, then to Find and
choose Files or Folders. Type ``Mapi32.dll'' in the Named box. In
the Look In list, select My Computer and click Find Now.
</P>
<P>
   In the Search Results list, right-click on Mapi32.dll and click
Rename from the pop-up list. Rename the file Mapi32.old and press
Enter.
</P>
<P>
   You might see several copies of the Mapi32.dll file in the
results list, and you should rename each one. Close the Find Files
box when you are done.
</P>
<P>
   When you restart Outlook 2000, the program will look for the
files it needs to start up. If it cannot find them, it will try to
replace them. If you get a message saying they are missing, click
Yes in the dialog box and the Windows Installer should replace the
missing files and fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the same steps for renaming the Mapi32.dll file if you
use Outlook 98.
</P>
<P>
   Next, reinstall the parts of Outlook 98 that the system needs.
To do this, go to the Start menu to Settings and then to Control
Panel. Click twice in Add/Remove Programs and select Microsoft
Outlook 98, then click -Add/Remove. Click on Rerun Outlook 98
Setup, then click Next. Work through the dialog boxes and pick the
type of installation you need and the E-Mail Service Options you
want.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have verified the folder you are installing the missing
files to, click Next and the Setup program should replace the
missing files. Then restart your computer.

FROM OFF-BROADWAY TO WAY OFF BROADWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A life in the theater is one of extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in New York, Melia Bensussen directed a supernatural
chiller about evil spirits that menace children on a 19th-century
English estate. Now, back home in Dallas, the director is about to
mount a nostalgic American comedy set in early-20th-century
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The New York project, at Primary Stages theater, was an
adaptation of Henry James' ``The Turn of the Screw.'' Her direction
won her an Obie, the premier award for off-Broadway productions and
a signature honor, especially for an artist who devotes only a
small part of her career to working in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Her current project is Eugene O'Neill's ``Ah, Wilderness!'' at
Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where Bensussen is on the
theater faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep the Obie in my office here at SMU,'' she says with a
smile, taking a break from rehearsal. ``It's not a statue. It's a
piece of paper. They give it to you framed, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Statue or not, does the prestige of having an Obie dramatically
change a director's life _ at least in terms of monetary reward?
</P>
<P>
   Bensussen answers quickly with a soft, ``No.'' She waits a
dramatic beat, then laughs heartily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocco Sisto, the actor in `Turn of the Screw,' has won a
couple Obies,'' she says. ``He called me when he heard I won and
said, `Welcome to more recognizable poverty.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wonderful about the Obie for me,'' she adds, ``is that
I feel welcomed into a community that I have always admired.''
</P>
<P>
   That community includes the top producers in the theater capital
of the world; and they want her to spend more time there, which
she's trying to accommodate. Now a favorite at Primary Stages,
Bensussen will return to the theater to direct the much-anticipated
world premiere of ``Krisit,'' by Y York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll go into rehearsal in December,'' she says. ``The play
is about a Greta Garbo kind of star who emerges in her 70s after
having disappeared as a superstar in the 1930s. It deals with what
it means to age as a star in America.''
</P>
<P>
   But first is ``Ah, Wilderness!'' at SMU.
</P>
<P>
   Bensussen has never before directed an O'Neill play, and she's
starting with an atypical one. ``Ah, Wilderness!'' _ a celebration
of an idealized vision of middle-class America _ is the only comedy
written by America's greatest dramatist. It depicts a loving,
charmingly eccentric family _ the kind that O'Neill wished he had
grown up in. The play, which originally opened on Broadway in 1933,
stands in poignant contrast to ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,''
his corrosive drama that is more autobiographical.
</P>
<P>
   ``''Ah, Wilderness!'' reminds me of Thornton Wilder's `The
Matchmaker,' which I love,'' Bensussen says. ``The optimism, the
American spirit, the energy. It's so hopeful, so positive. And it's
a style piece. It's not so easy to do as it appears.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being her first O'Neill project, ``Ah,
Wilderness!'' is also Bensussen's first collaboration with another
director. She is co-directing with Kevin Paul Hofeditz, chairman of
the theater division at SMU's top-ranked Meadows School of the
Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great fun,'' she says. ``The arts division, and
Kevin in particular, has done me a great favor by sharing the work
with me at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Married to Dallas biologist Chuck Epstein and the mother of two
small children _ including a 4-month-old _ Bensussen says she
``felt, in the first year of my daughter's life, that I wanted to
emphasize her as much as possible. That was the logistical reason
(to collaborate.) What's happened that has been a revelation is
that I find myself understanding how I work and why I work when I
have to explain it to a colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, but has she had any arguments with her co-director?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have major disagreements, but not arguments,'' she admits.
``And the disagreements are jolly. ... I think the reason it has
worked is that our cast is of such high caliber. Where Kevin and I
perhaps contradict each other, the (cast) is able to find the best
in each of our adjustments and go with that choice. Stylistically,
in terms of the overall vision of the play, we see very much eye to
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the play's period setting, Hofeditz and Bensussen went
with colorblind casting for ``Ah, Wilderness!,'' which she felt was
an important choice to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a completely interracial cast,'' she says. ``The play
is all about this idealized family. It's not about genetic
matchups.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, cultural blending comes easily for Bensussen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's Mexican and my mother's American,'' she says. ``I
grew up in Mexico City, but New York is the homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the question, now that she's gaining attention for
her work, will her homeland _ a la Sam Mendes _ soon be Hollywood?
Bensussen shakes her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love going to the movies,'' she says, ``but I feel like my
work in the theater is only at a beginning point. I've been doing
theater for 20 years now, and I hope to be doing it for another 40
years. I think the great master artists of the theater only hit
their stride in their 50s and their 60s. I'm almost 40.''

 &HT;    Star's dental deficit truly gap-tivating
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's hard to escape Lauren Hutton.
</P>
<P>
   As the handsome face and husky voice of our very own Gardens
mall, she appears in its TV and radio ads. She still shows up on
the occasional magazine cover, and now she's the author of
``SlimFast Body, Mind, Life Makeover'' (Regan Books, $24), which
came out this month.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you encounter Hutton's mug, you can't help but notice
the gap between her front teeth. David Letterman has a gap; so do
Madonna, Maya Angelou, Sandra Bernhard, Ernest Borgnine, Laurence
Fishburne and Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutton's is surely the most famous and most ironic, given
her status as one of the late 20th century's great beauties.
</P>
<P>
   Her modeling career has spanned from the mid-'60s, when Vogue
editor Diana Vreeland declared that she had ``quite a presence,''
until today. Just last fall, she showed up again on a Vogue cover
with fellow mannequins Iman, Kate Moss and Gisele Bundchen. Her
number of Vogue fronts: 26.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, her spaced-out smile, beaming from beneath
those stratospheric cheekbones and clear blue eyes, inspired debate
over standards of beauty in the modeling industry.
</P>
<P>
   The medical term for a gap between the front teeth is
``diastema,'' and the condition is not unusual among people who
have never visited the orthodontist.
</P>
<P>
   It's common enough to have its own Web site. At
www.gap-toothed.com (the slogan: ``everybody needs a little
space''), Hutton has been crowned Queen Lauren. ``This, this is a
woman who knows how to make it work,'' the site says. ``Lauren
Hutton makes it obvious: Truth is beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   According to filmmaker Les Blank, who celebrated diastema in his
1987 film ``Gap-Toothed Women,'' several African tribes regard a
gap between a woman's teeth as a sign of fertility. Other cultures
view it as a sign of good fortune or frequent travel.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the lusty Wife of Bath in Chaucer's
``Canterbury Tales,'' who never lacked suitors: ``She knew much of
wandering by the way/Gap-toothed was she, truthfully to say ...''
</P>
<P>
   In modern-day America, the gap is largely regarded as a flaw
that needs fixing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people feel more comfortable with their appearance having
the gap closed,'' says Richard Masella, associate professor of
orthodontics at the College of Dental Medicine-Nova Southeastern
University in Fort Lauderdale. ``A few regard it as a defining
personal trait and don't want it closed. I think Miss Hutton falls
in the latter category.''
</P>
<P>
   Masella says he has heard of some Asian cultures where a space
between the front teeth is considered positive. And, ``in Western
culture, sometimes there's a family history of having this gap, and
subsequent generations view it as a mark of their family and don't
wish to disturb it.''
</P>
<P>
   (He adds, kids and teenagers often enjoy having diastema: It
allows them to spit with authority.)
</P>
<P>
   So what causes diastema?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the upper front teeth are extremely narrow. Sometimes
they have straight sides when they should be curved. And sometimes
the pressure from a person's bite pushes the teeth apart.
</P>
<P>
   To correct the space, patients can get braces to move the teeth
together or be fitted for crowns that would increase the width of
each tooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly an aesthetic concern,'' Masella says. ``I really
don't see a risk to dental health given a space between the front
teeth.''

BLOCK BY BLOCK, TITANIC TETRIS GAME FELL INTO PLACE AT BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: R.I.)   (Circuits)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started as a hallucination. In describing the reasons for
re-creating the classic videogame Tetris on the side of the
Sciences Library at Brown University, Keith Dreibelbis, a computer
science major, wrote, ``For anyone who has ever played way too much
Tetris, and looked at squarish buildings, it is easy to start
hallucinating Tetris blocks in them.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, after months of planning and working with other
students, Dreibelbis, a senior, was able to see his vision become a
reality. Powered by 14 custom-built circuit boards, a data network
that traveled several hundred feet and 10,000 Christmas lights, a
10-story version of Tetris was played on the facade of the
decidedly squarish library on the Providence, R.I., campus.
</P>
<P>
   The Tetris installation had been conceived as a prank by
Technology House, a residence for Brown students interested in
science and technology, including Dreibelbis. The idea had been
kicking around for a couple of years before Nik Lochmatow, a Tech
House member and art student, got permission to go ahead with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that if we did it as a prank, it would only be
able to work for a short time and would get us all expelled,''
Lochmatow, a junior, said. ``So we got permission to do it
legally.''
</P>
<P>
   Tetris was developed 15 years ago by Alexey Pajitnov, a Russian
mathematician, and involves manipulating four shapes (each made up
of four blocks) as they fall down the screen to form horizontal
rows, which disappear when they are complete. The object of the
game is to keep clearing out rows as the falling blocks speed up.
</P>
<P>
   Tech House began the installation in January on the south side
of the 14-story library. Floors 4 through 13 were used for the
game, and each floor has five windows across the facade. The
students built 100 4-by-4-foot wooden frames, wrapped each one with
strings of Christmas lights and installed two of them in each
window.
</P>
<P>
   Each frame had a small relay that was connected by a cable to a
circuit board, in a dumbwaiter shaft on each floor. The circuit
boards controlled the lights on each frame based on the signals
they received from a computer on the third floor, with each lighted
frame forming one block of a four-block shape. Lower floors were
lighted in turn, giving the illusion of the shape's falling down
the library's facade.
</P>
<P>
   The circuit boards were connected to the computer by 24 cables
running up and down the dumbwaiter shaft. The computer on the third
floor was connected to a computer in another building, MacMillan
Hall, a building directly across from the Sciences Library, where
the game was played.
</P>
<P>
   Soren Spies, projects manager for Tech House, estimated that
about $750 was spent on materials, including wood for the frames,
Christmas lights, relays, hooks, circuit boards and 3,000 feet of
cable.
</P>
<P>
   During the two weeks that the game was played, people gathered
every night at midnight, which is when the library closed. The game
was not played during library hours because the relays on each
floor made clicking noises that distracted the students.
</P>
<P>
   Players sat on the steps of MacMillan Hall with a laptop
computer that was connected to the computer inside, and they used
the arrow keys to maneuver the Tetris pieces as they fell from the
13th floor. Each player's turn typically lasted four minutes, about
the time it took to move through the game's two skill levels.
</P>
<P>
   Powering the system posed one of the biggest challenges, said
Neel Joshi, a senior who was involved in the installation. ``The
circuitry was the most technically difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people came each night during the last week of
installation, Spies said. A klezmer band also showed up for a few
nights to play music from the original version of Tetris.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think Tech House is the biggest bunch of non-fun people
in the world,'' Spies said. ``But they also thought this was the
coolest thing. They've been very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was partly dismantled on Saturday. It will probably be
reactivated during commencement week in May, he said.

MUSLIM WOMAN IMPRISONED FOR TRYING TO MAIL NEWSPAPERS TO HER
HUSBAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A Muslim businesswoman was dealt an eight-year prison
sentence last month mainly because she tried to mail back copies of
local newspapers to her exiled husband, a newly available
transcript of the court verdict confirms.
</P>
<P>
   The businesswoman, Rebiya Kadeer, 53, was convicted on March 10
in her home province of Xinjiang in western China for ``revealing
state intelligence'' abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the newspapers she had collected, the court document
says, Kadeer had marked official speeches and articles concerning
the government's fight against ethnic separatism.
</P>
<P>
   When the harsh sentence was announced in March, her case became
an international cause, and human rights groups and some Western
governments insist that there is no evidence that Kadeer committed
any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Press reports in Xinjiang said that Kadeer had tried to mail
newspapers, including marked articles about ethnic separatism, to
her husband, Sidik Rouzi, who since 1996 has lived in political
asylum in the United States. Rouzi, who got into trouble for his
writings on the oppression of the Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim
group that formerly dominated Xinjiang, has criticized Chinese
policy on the U.S.-sponsored Radio Free Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The March verdict provides more details of the charges against
Kadeer and appears to confirm that her prosecution violated
international standards of legal rights. An English translation was
made available by people with close knowledge of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most outrageous use of the `state secrets'
legislation I have come across in many years,'' said Arlette
Laduguie, a China specialist with Amnesty International in London,
who has seen the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has tried to contain a budding
nationalist spirit among the Uighurs and is battling a small but
tenacious terrorist movement of Uighur separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Kadeer's rags-to-riches story was previously touted by the
government as that of a model Uighur, and she served on high-level
government panels. But she fell from official favor after her
husband moved abroad, and she was arrested last August in Urumqi,
the capital of Xinjiang, as she was driving to meet visiting staff
members from the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to the March 10 verdict of the Urumqi People's
Intermediate Court, Kadeer, in response to a telephoned request
from her husband, collected local newspapers for him.
</P>
<P>
   She purchased 27 months' worth of the Kashgar Daily, published
from 1995 to 1998, the court said, and marked speeches and other
news relating to the government's fights against separatism and
terrorism. She also bought an unspecified number of copies of
another public newspaper, the Xinjiang Legal News.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, Kadeer tried to mail these newspapers to her
husband, the court said, but the package was intercepted by
authorities. Subsequently, the verdict states, Kadeer also
collected 10 back issues of the Ili Daily and the Ili Evening News
for her husband and gave them to a third party to hold.
</P>
<P>
   Kadeer's final transgression, according to the court, was to try
to deliver to the visiting Americans a list of 10 people who had
run afoul of authorities for their pro-Uighur activities, along
with other undescribed materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the crime of illegally giving information across the
border, defendant Rebiya Kadeer is sentenced to eight years
fixed-term imprisonment,'' the verdict concludes.

   (UNDATED) _ Vietnam was an unmitigated disaster, the only war
the U.S. has ever lost. It took the lives of 58,000 Americans and
an estimated 2.5 million Vietnamese. It cost untold treasure,
destroyed a presidency, and incited the protest of a generation at
home and around the world as no event since. And for what? Vietnam
fell, but the dominoes didn't. Today, Communism survives in a few
pockets such as Cuba, North Korea and Vietnam itself, but the

where up to 2,000 civilians were massacred by Israel's Lebanese
Christian allies in 1982. I've been there perhaps a hundred times
since the slaughter, yet the place never ceases to horrify me. If I
lived there, I always think, I'd go mad. Is it any wonder that the
Arabs are losing the Middle East's war of words? That American
liberals fail to understand the real dangers of their hopelessly
biased policy in the region? Or that America and the Sabra Chatila
refugee camp are a million miles apart?...By Robert Fisk, The

   Which means that, unless authors and publishers work out a new
pay structure (or e-books remain as expensive as print),
technophiles will mostly be reading test patterns or a lot of
college fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, say bibliophiles who are unwilling to part with their
book jackets and bindings, there is another way.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry watchers say that not only will e-books at best be
a niche product, but recent advances in printing technology in this
digital age will usher in a new golden era of old-school
publishing. The emerging process is called ``print on demand,''
which Random House's Applebaum says ``is getting less attention
(than e-books) but is very interesting.'' The process, in short, is
making it faster, cheaper and easier to print books than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   Print on demand makes use of high-speed laser printers and
cutting-edge publishing software that eliminates many of the most
expensive, time-consuming steps in the printing process.
Previously, it was far too expensive for a printing company to
produce just 10, 50 or 100 copies of a book, but the new process
can produce limited runs inexpensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big offset press that everybody uses for traditional
printing can't print profitably under about 2,000 copies,'' says
Paul Hilts, technology editor for Publishers Weekly. ``Print on
demand is a wonderful boon because you can profitably print tiny
orders of one book _ 10 books, less than a cartonload.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hilts, retail chains such as Barnes &AMP; Noble and
Borders Books and Music are experimenting with placing
print-on-demand stations in their stores: If the book you want
isn't on the shelf, the store would be able to print and bind it
for you in about five minutes. But print on demand won't just make
it easier to pick up a new paperback copy of an out-of-stock
bestseller. Hilts thinks it will lead to an explosion of
small-press publishing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Don DeHart, president of DeHart's Printing Services in Santa
Clara, Calif., which offers print on demand, says he has seen the
explosion begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get requests for it daily,'' he says. ``I've had half a
dozen requests today from people who are interested in having us
print anywhere from 25 copies of a book to several hundred.''
</P>
<P>
   DarkTales Publishing, founded last year by three horror fans,
has jumped on the print-on-demand bandwagon, printing eight novels
and short-story anthologies.
</P>
<P>
   Although DarkTales' most popular book has sold only about 1,000
copies, the low cost of on-demand printing has kept the company in
the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to spark a renaissance in literature,''
says Keith Herber of Mt. Prospect, Ill., one of DarkTales'
founders. ``You no longer have to kowtow to the publishers and
write something they want to sell. If you've got a book you want to
publish, you can do it yourself for $250.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which, to be sure, is likely to hold off the rise of
e-books, especially for kids already more comfortable with laptops
and Palm Pilots than printed books. But it does suggest that
Gutenberg's adherents won't go without a fight.  &QL;

<P>
   The movies couldn't do it. Radio couldn't do it. Even television
couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   With each great leap forward in communications, pundits have
prophesied the death of the lowly, old-fashioned paper book. Now
it's the Internet's turn, as growing numbers of technophiles claim
that Internet ``e-publishing'' will deliver the death blow to
paperbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, touting its e-book reading software, predicts that
e-book sales will overtake paper by 2009. Bill Gates and other
high-tech aficionados say digital books will be significantly
cheaper than printed titles, because there won't be costs related
to printing, binding and shipping. And, they say, as newly designed
reading devices (some of which will be hitting stores by Christmas)
replace eyestrain with ease, consumers will flock to them.
</P>
<P>
   E-enthusiasts point to the success of Stephen King's ``Riding
the Bullet,'' a 67-page novella published in mid-March as an
``electronic-only'' book. When the story became available,
Amazon.com averaged one consumer download per second for it. Within
three days of its release, more than 500,000 King fans either paid
$2.50 for the story or took advantage of downloads offered free by
some Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   That phenomenal commercial performance led to a ``Time''
magazine cover story and a lot of I-told-you-so's from e-book
proselytizers. Now, they say, all the revolution needs for ultimate
success is some clever design work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the (current) e-book devices are not ready for prime
time, but that is changing,'' says Jeff Bezos, chief executive
officer of Amazon.com. ``It's not a matter of whether (they'll
penetrate the market), it's a question of when.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the news media hype and ambitious publishing plans,
there are holes in this scenario. For one, King _ one of a few true
name-brand authors _ is a phenomenon unto himself. No matter what
format he uses, people will buy his work. (Lost in all the
excitement of ``Riding the Bullet's'' success is the very real
possibility that if the novella had been offered in print as well
as online, the unprecedented tide of electronic sales would have
been reduced to a trickle.)
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Applebaum, senior vice president of Random House, says
``Riding the Bullet'' is probably an aberration, at least in
today's book market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe right now one of the most popular full-length
e-books is Peter Abraham's `Crying Wolf,' and that has maybe
downloaded 1,000 copies,'' Applebaum says. ``We are not
unenthusiastic about e-books, but we're not in the front lines of
those saying they will replace bound books in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, what's good for publishers _ and consumers _ isn't
necessarily good for writers. Author royalties are based on the
retail price. On a $20 book, a 15 percent royalty _ the typical
percentage _ earns the writer $3. If the e-book version has a
drastically reduced price, as its proponents claim it will, authors
lose out. (Royalties on a $2 sale, for example, are 30 cents).
</P>
<P>
   And because so few authors sell books by the crate as King does,
``They're not going to go along with that,'' predicts Phyllis
Grann, president of Penguin Putnam. (MORE) nn

FINDING THE PERFECT RING FOR A CELL PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)  (Circuits)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the quest for the perfectly personalized wireless phone, the
choice of ring tones is about as crucial as whether to go with a
customized faceplate or a flip-up or sliding model.
</P>
<P>
   If you are bold enough to select what is known in the cell phone
business as a ``ring melody'' _ the opening notes of ``Fur Elise''
or Pachelbel's ``Canon in D Major,'' for instance _ brace yourself
for a little snickering from fellow commuters or neighbors in
Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   But at least that's better than the contemptuous glares that
usually greet a ringing cell phone in a public place. And it will
help avoid the sometimes comic scene of people fumbling through
their jackets and bags thinking the ringing phone is their own.
</P>
<P>
   David Drucker, a writer in Los Angeles, said his Ericcson phone
was programmed to play the theme from ``The Sting'' when it rang.
``I came to despise a normal ring,'' he said. ``All of those shrill
rings made me feel like I was on an electronic leash. The song kind
of makes me laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Most wireless-phone manufacturers now incorporate anywhere from
five to 30 different choices of ring tones and melodies into each
model. But with the release of new wireless phones with Internet
connectivity, consumers will have even more ring choices in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia and Samsung are among the manufacturers who are designing
phones that will let users log onto Web sites set up by the
companies for composing and downloading ring melodies.
</P>
<P>
   The downloading features are being built into the handsets, but
they will work only after the software is upgraded for cell-phone
networks. Such changes are expected to be in place before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about the possibility of downloadable ring
melodies,'' said Mike Courtney, messaging manager for Nokia
America's new-business development. ``It's something that all the
manufacturers have been preparing for.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsung will offer downloadable ring features on new phones that
make use of the Wireless Application Protocol, a new standard for
wireless communications. The company is setting up a site to make a
variety of tunes available, said Muzibul Kahn, a spokesman for
Samsung. Once the melodies are downloaded, Kahn added, users will
also be able to adjust the bass and treble to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to build the phone like a stereo equalizer,'' he
said. ``We think there's a group of people, mostly the younger
generation, who will think it's a cool feature. It's another way to
differentiate themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Goetter, a spokesman for Kyocera Wireless Corp., which
manufactures Qualcomm phones, said it would introduce downloadable
ring features only if a number of customers asked for the service.
Qualcomm plans to release two wireless Internet phones, the QCP
2035 and QCP 3035, later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the choice between blending in and
differentiating oneself from the rest of the wireless pack has
become such an excruciating one that many people opt out of the
decision altogether and put their phones on vibrate mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally embarrassed by my ring,'' said Jay Mandel, a
literary agent in New York who uses a Sprint PCS Touchpoint phone.
``I love the idea of not having anyone know when my phone is
ringing. I'll look at the Caller ID under the table and decide what
to do, without interrupting whomever I'm with.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandel added that he had noticed that men had an unfair
advantage when it came to using the vibration feature. ``Women have
handbags and can't tell when it goes off if they keep their phones
in there,'' he said.

 &HT;     (For release Sunday, April 30)  
 &HT;     Commentary   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Here in America's heartland, where farmers
are engaged in their spring ritual of plowing fields and planting
corn, an argument is under way over the proposed display of the Ten
Commandments in the state Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Neal Schuerer wants to post the Ten Commandments in
the chamber because he believes that ``government is not an
invention of man, it is an extension of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the separation of church and state, which is guaranteed in
the First Amendment to the Constitution, has become a volatile
issue in Iowa, where religion and education are of paramount
importance. Iowans who oppose Schuerer's stand are as vehement in
their position, as the proposal's supporters are in their advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the importance of the debate over Schuerer's plan,
the Des Moines Register, Iowa's premier newspaper, printed on
Easter Sunday six thoughtful, well-reasoned letters from readers
who are against the posting of the Ten Commandments in the Senate
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kelly Sargent, of Ankeny, wrote that Schuerer's
proposal ``convinced me that it has become essential for the
citizens of Iowa to institute a mandatory American history
examination, which anyone elected to the Legislature must pass
before being allowed to take office. He (Schuerer) has apparently
forgotten that this country was founded by men and women who risked
all to escape the religious tyranny of the majority in their
homelands.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Herwig of West Des Moines, wrote: ``Every Christian child
I know has to memorize the Ten Commandments in Sunday school, and
this is an appropriate venue for posted reminders. However,
government is of, by and for all the people, and not all are
Christian. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   As always in our republic, debate over the issue of church and
state has generated anger. It has been that way since the first
settlers came to America to escape religious despotism in Europe.
But once here, some of the settlers decreed that refusal of
individuals to attend church on Sunday was an offense punishable by
incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over church and state is not confined to any one
state. Ohioans are involved in a dispute over the display of their
state motto, ``With God, all things are possible.'' A federal
appellate court has ruled the motto unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   When the founding fathers added the Bill of Rights to the
Constitution, they recognized the need for religious freedom in the
young republic. The first of those ten amendments declared that
Congress ``shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his death on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the
Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson designed his own
tombstone and wrote its inscription: ``Here was buried Thomas
Jefferson, Author of the Declaration of Independence, of the
Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, and the father of the
University of Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   To Jefferson, those achievements apparently were more important
than his eight-year tenure as president, his purchase of the
Louisiana Territory, or his commissioning of the monumental Lewis
and Clark expedition across the unchartered land from the Missouri
River to the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, the religious issue arose in the battle
for the Republican presidential nomination. It was during the South
Carolina primary campaign that Texas Gov. George W. Bush accepted
an invitation to speak at Bob Jones University, a religious
institution with a reputation for being anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush formed a firm political alliance with the
Rev. Pat Robertson, a pillar of the religious conservatives who are
intolerant of individuals who do not adhere to their policies,
including opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's action was denounced by Arizona Sen. John McCain, who at
the time was still in the race for the Republican presidential
nomination. In a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, Bush
apologized for appearing at the university and denied that he was
anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bush was adhering to one of Richard Nixon's basic
principles of conduct for Republican presidential hopefuls: run as
a doctrinaire conservative while seeking the party's nomination,
but move to the political center once you have won it.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what Bush has done. After currying favor with
religious conservatives, he triumphed over McCain and sealed his
hold on the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bush began courting gays, African-Americans and other
constituencies that traditionally have been aligned with the
Democrats. He has not cut himself loose from the religious right,
but he has decided that if he is to win the presidency, he must
broaden his appeal to win the voters who helped elect Bill Clinton
in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans become irate when the courts decree that efforts
to inject religion into non-religious aspects of our lives are
unconstitutional. But in doing so, the courts simply perform a
basic duty that prevents any single religious sect from dominating
life in the United States.

GOING INTO THE WEB TO GET OUT OF THE WOODS

<P>
   How to find yourself? No, this is not about existential
navel-gazing, religion, talk shows or get-a-life books by people
with initials after their names.
</P>
<P>
   This is about just plain being lost, preferably in the woods by
one's own choice, and the fun of finding one's way out. People who
like this sort of thing may not rival Oprah's audience in numbers,
but judging from the orienteering clubs and information on the Web,
they are just as enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orienteering is the sport of navigation with map and
compass,'' begins the home page of the U.S. Orienteering Federation
(www.us.orienteering.org). The International Orienteering
Federation (www.orienteering.org) describes the sport even more
succinctly as ``running while playing chess.''
</P>
<P>
   The national federation's Web site takes a viewer step by step
through a color-coded orienteering trail map. There are teacher
guides and special pages for children. The federation site also has
links to its 71 member clubs and estimated 8,000 to 10,000 members,
plus Canadian clubs and the international federation.
</P>
<P>
   There are also pages for specialties: ski, canoe, horseback and
mountain bike orienteering and Trail-O, a form of orienteering for
wheelchair users and other disabled people that emphasizes precise
map reading over speed. (Anne Braggins, a Briton who heads the
International Orienteering Federation's Trail-O Committee, has a
site at dialspace.dial.pipex.com/vision/trailo.
</P>
<P>
   And there is rogaining, which is named for its founders and has
nothing to do with hair but everything to do with endurance and
speed: finding as many checkpoints as possible in a given time.
There are online links to supply shops; orienteering maps are
different from the more familiar government topographic maps
(which, by the way, are available online at www.topozone.com.)
</P>
<P>
   There's something deceptive about a map and a compass. These
tools may be neglected until they are badly needed, which is the
wrong time to get an education.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to name the one thing that is the hardest for most
people, I would say it is learning to trust the map and the
compass, and realizing that this trust may often mean that your
perception of where you thought you were traveling is wrong,'' said
Jonathan D. Nash, director of media relations for the federation,
in an e-mail note.
</P>
<P>
   There are other common mistakes besides not believing your map
and compass, Nash wrote. One is ``making a 180'' _ setting your
compass upside down, with the wrong end of the needle pointing
north, and charging off in the exact opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Orienteering, Nash wrote, got its big push in the United States
in the 1970s from two transplanted Scandinavians. Fittingly, the
education link off the federation's home page, How to Use a
Compass, is a Norwegian site by Kjetil Kjernsmo
(www.uio.no/(TILDE)kjetikj/compass).
</P>
<P>
   The English is not perfect, but it is worth putting up with that
for the vital explanation of an orienteering compass and the
mysteries of declination, the difference between true north and
magnetic north.
</P>
<P>
   Kjernsmo's site includes pages on navigating in foggy
conditions, the danger of white-out and what to do if you are
really lost and don't have a compass. If the sun is shining, you
can figure directions with just your wristwatch (analog, please,
not digital). No watch? You can use a stick. Night? Use Polaris.
</P>
<P>
   Orienteering's courses range from white, for people who may just
want to walk, look at the birds and familiarize themselves with a
map, to blue, for people who are willing to push themselves seven
miles or more looking for off-trail markers with a compass as a
crucial guide.
</P>
<P>
   People who love orienteering have a common denominator, Nash
wrote: ``They all like to solve things.''

IN BIRMINGHAM, A HEALING PLACE STANDS IN TESTAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ ``You're not going to ask me about Frank
Cherry?'' the Rev. Christopher Hamlin asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Cherry?'' I repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I understand he might be indicted tomorrow on a rape
charge,'' Hamlin says. ``But that's just a way to get him back
here. The next step is an indictment for the bombing of our
church.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin smiles, happy that justice might finally come to members
of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. In 1977, Ku Klux Klansman
Robert Chambliss was convicted of murder in the bombing, which took
the lives of four little girls 14 years earlier. He died in prison.
Another suspect, Herman Cash, died in 1994. The targets of the
reopened case, Tommy Blanton of Birmingham and Cherry of Mabank,
Texas, have denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The news makes my heart soar, even though my reason for being in
Birmingham had nothing to do with the church and that old crime. I
had walked across Kelly Ingram Park, where hundreds of student
demonstrators were blasted with water hoses and chased by police
dogs in years past. I'd visited the Birmingham Civil Rights
Institute across the street, purchased souvenir T-shirts and clocks
for my daughters. I stared at the church.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just three hours before I had to catch a plane to Fort
Worth, I stood outside wondering whether I should go inside.
</P>
<P>
   I felt I had to breathe the air, see where an earlier generation
of children had stood their ground in the fight for equality in the
'60s, where Martin Luther King Jr. spoke, where demonstrators
gathered to sing after the civil rights leader was jailed, and
where tragically, hate and dynamite took four innocent lives.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be like entering a room where a loved one died? Do the
hateful images linger like ghosts? Or do you just try not to think
about it, focusing on the present and progress?
</P>
<P>
   When I finally climbed the stairs leading to the churchs
administrative office, Hamlin was on the phone. I waited.
</P>
<P>
   He was only 3 years old and living in Macon, Ga., when Sixteenth
Street Baptist was bombed in 1963. It wasn't until five years
later, when King was assassinated, that Hamlin even heard of the
church, let alone its importance in the struggle for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Now 41, Hamlin shares this history with more than 80,000
visitors annually to the church.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in 1990, Hamlin says, church membership had
fallen to about 125, compared with 1,200 at the peak of its
popularity. Even though the church was the heart of the community,
there was much internal bickering over the years. Pastors came and
went, membership dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hamlin works to restore the luster. He wants the church to
be a beacon for reconciliation. ``We're getting there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the church, which is open for tours Tuesday through
Saturday, has about 600 active members and is beginning to host
community forums on a variety of issues, particularly race.
</P>
<P>
   The first such forum was in 1993, when Washington Booker, Ricky
Powell and other people involved in the demonstrations as youths
were invited to talk about their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are few outward hints of the racial strife that
gripped Birmingham that summer, Hamlin believes there is a great
need for healing here, to bring people together to discuss issues
and seek solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to me that after shootings like those that
occurred in Columbine and Oklahoma, counselors are made available
for people,'' he says. ``People here have never been invited to
talk about the movement and how it impacted their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin said he hopes to create a church center for
reconciliation where people can come and discuss race issues and
community conflict. ``That's what happened in '63,'' he says.
``People rallied to work out some really crucial issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, while in the church sanctuary, I imagined what those
meetings might have been like and marveled at my surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteenth Street Baptist is a beautiful edifice designed and
built by African-Americans. Its stained glass windows are
spectacular. So is the pipe organ installed in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sturdy old building,'' Hamlin says. Wallace Rayfield
designed it right. Thomas Windham built it right, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, it will take an additional $2 million to make
needed repairs to the church exterior.
</P>
<P>
   As we walk back outside, TV reporters stand in Kelly Ingram
Park, cameras trained on the old church. A young woman runs over to
ask Hamlin about Frank Cherry and the bombings. He says it's too
early to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin says that he understands the need for justice, but that
his church members don't want to go through it all again. Most,
like the visitors to the church, want healing.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane back to Fort Worth, it occurred to me that I had
come for healing as well.

PREPARING FOR THE COLLISION OF WIRELESS SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., D.C. area)   By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If wireless networks proliferate as fast as many researchers
predict, is it possible for the airwaves to become overloaded? Cell
phones and some handheld organizers transmit and receive scores of
messages a day. With laptop computers and other devices added to
the mix, will there eventually be one big wireless traffic jam?
</P>
<P>
   ``These are questions that the industry takes very seriously,''
said Jeff Abramowitz, president of the Wireless LAN Association, a
nonprofit group established by companies that build technology for
wireless local area networks, or LANs. In the next few years,
analysts say, these wireless LANs will become an integral part of
office and home networks, enabling people to gain high-speed
Internet access from laptop computers without having to plug into a
phone line or cable connection.
</P>
<P>
   But wireless LAN companies are not the only ones worried about
interference. Engineers in a range of wireless industries are
conducting mathematical studies and field tests to determine
whether interference will be a real problem.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the focus is on the 2.4-gigahertz band of the radio
spectrum. The band, which stretches from 2.4 to 2.483 gigahertz,
has become more and more crowded in the past few years, used by a
variety of devices that do not require licenses from the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Technologies occupying the space include wireless LANs, some of
the latest cordless phones and handheld devices that use Bluetooth,
a standard being developed to enable gadgets to communicate without
wires.
</P>
<P>
   Another system operating in the 2.4-gigahertz range is Ricochet,
a wireless network for urban areas. Ricochet is currently available
in Seattle, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The company is
installing more iterations of the network, which will offer faster
access.
</P>
<P>
   Most people using Ricochet are spared the problem of
interference by the system's design. The only pieces of the system
that use the 2.4-gigahertz spectrum are the network's access
points. Attached to utility poles, outdoors and hanging at least 30
feet above the ground, the access points are out of the way of most
other wireless traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The signals sent between a laptop and an access point in the
Ricochet network use the 900-megahertz band _ a lower section of
the radio spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't bump into each other that much,'' said Tim Yankey,
director of product marketing for Metricom, which makes Ricochet.
</P>
<P>
   Microwave ovens also use waves in the 2.4-gigahertz range,
though ovens are the least of researchers' problems. Microwave
ovens are designed to prevent the emission of electromagnetic waves
outside their boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Cordless phones that operate in the 2.4-gigahertz band are more
of a potential problem. Most of the phones are designed, however,
so that they can be set at one of several narrow frequency bands to
avoid interference with neighbors' phones. Others are configured so
that the signals hop from one frequency to another to prevent
interference. Those design elements, some engineers say, enable
their signals to be kept separate from other wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Bluetooth technology that may interfere most with
wireless LANs, and vice versa. Imagine, for example, a day when an
employee is using a Bluetooth cell phone and a laptop that is
connected to the Internet via a wireless LAN. At the moment that
the employee tries to download phone numbers from phone to laptop,
the Internet connection could slow down or the phone transmission
stall.
</P>
<P>
   What could be happening is that packets of information are
colliding with other packets, similar to traffic problems on a
wired network. In such a case, the devices would continue to resend
the data packets until they make it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end user will see it as a delay of service,'' said Steve
Parker, product line manager for new mobile platforms at 3Com,
which is developing Bluetooth devices. ``But it is not as
problematic as you may think.'' Such a collision is ``statistically
very unlikely to occur,'' Parker said, because both existing
wireless LANs and forthcoming Bluetooth technologies are designed
to spread their signals across the 2.4-gigahertz spectrum before
joining again at the receiving end.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bluetooth runs at a range of a few yards, whereas
wireless LAN's cover hundreds of feet. That means, Parker said,
that Bluetooth devices will rarely affect LAN transmissions in
nearby offices.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, said Skip Bryan, director of technology market
development for Ericsson, new hardware and software will be
developed that enable these wireless devices to peacefully
co-exist. Devices could be designed to detect each other's
presence, for example, enabling software to switch between the
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know about the problem well enough in advance,'' Bryan
said, ``that there will be minimal impact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be alert,'' said Richard Favara, president of
Expedition Networks, a company that sets up networking systems for
corporate and educational clients. ``But do we need to be worried?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some Bluetooth proponents can see a day when the two
networks will not only co-exist, but also communicate.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a bigger concern than interference may be low
bandwidth, which limits the rate at which data can be sent.
Currently, wireless network speeds are not as fast as wired ones,
but the more people use multimedia on their wired computers, the
more they may try to send and receive the same large files on their
wireless ones. And like most networks, wireless LANs and Bluetooth
networks become incrementally slower as more people use them.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, for example, a day when airports are equipped with
wireless networks and hundreds of people in the waiting areas are
typing away on laptops, checking e-mail and surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   If planes are on time and people are moving through the airport
at a normal pace, Abramowitz said, the networks will probably be
able to handle the load. But if the airport terminal begins to
become crowded, because of delayed or canceled flights, he said,
``then you have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are already developing wireless systems with broader
bandwidth. And some are even considering moving out of the heavily
populated territory of 2.4 gigahertz. A standard called HiperLAN,
which is being developed in Europe, uses the 5.3-gigahertz band.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we think there will be a longtime use'' of the 2.4
spectrum, Bryan said, ``even if we populate the world with millions
of Bluetooth devices.''

BOOTING UP FOR SUMMER CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WINDA BENEDETTI  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer camp. Those two words inspire images of youngsters
tromping down forest trails, paddling canoes across sparkling lakes
and singing ``Kumbaya'' while roasting marshmallows over a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Get with the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Today's cutting-edge summer camps are held on college campuses,
not in forest meadows. Time-honored activities such as whittling,
archery and macaroni art are out.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, video game programming, 3-D animation and digital
movie production are in. And you can forget campfires. Kids huddle
around computer screens instead.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech camps are cropping up around the country with the
tenacity and frequency of summer dandelions. Here kids learn about
Internet navigation, Web page design, robotics, computer animation
and multimedia programs. But do kids actually like this stuff? Do
they really want to sit in front of computers, learning while other
kids are outside playing?
</P>
<P>
   Michelle and Monica McQuaid of Seattle wanted to attend computer
camp about as much as most teens want to be seen at the mall with
their parents. That's to say, they were none too thrilled last
summer when their mom signed them up for the Cybercamps program at
the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be some geeky computer thing,'' 15-year-old
Michelle says, describing her dismay at the idea of spending a week
staring at a glowing screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my friends that I was going to computer camp and they
all made fun of me,'' says 13-year-old Monica. ``It seemed kind of
nerdy and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, at first glance, computer camps sound ... well ... they
sound booooring. But camp organizers, parents and even the kids
insist that isn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sooo much fun,'' Monica enthuses, explaining that she's
thrilled to be returning to the Cybercamps program this summer. Her
sister echoes her sentiments. ``I loved it. I thought it was a
great experience,'' says Michelle, who now counts Cybercamps among
her favorite summer camps. And she's been to a few _
horseback-riding camp, soccer camp, etc.
</P>
<P>
   So what gives?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a generation growing up with a mouse in their hands,''
says Peter Findley, CEO and founder of the Kirkland-based
Cybercamps. ``Every kid wants a Web page. And kids want to learn
programming because they want to program video games for
Nintendo.''
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, the lessons offered to these kids aren't
humdrum. Tech camps teach kids about computers by teaching them
about things they already love _ movies, cartoons, robots and video
games.
</P>
<P>
   One of InternalDrive Tech Camp's most popular courses is digital
video and movie production. ``They're writing the scripts, they're
shooting the footage. They come into the lab and edit it and add in
the sound and graphics,'' says president Pete Ingram-Cauchi. ``By
the end of a week, they've actually finished a movie. It's great
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Michelle speak enthusiastically about learning to
write programs that made a calculator work and a rocket move across
their computer screens. They had so much fun at the camp, they're
planning to take a course this summer on how to be computer-camp
counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fundamental philosophy is that human brains learn better
if they're having fun,'' Findley says.
</P>
<P>
   Findley was attending the University of Washington in 1997 when
he wrote the business plan for Cybercamps. That summer he held his
first camp at the UW with 122 kids. This year he expects more than
8,000 kids to attend Cybercamps at 27 different colleges around the
country _ UCLA, Georgetown University and the University of
Maryland among them.
</P>
<P>
   Findley isn't the only one who's seen enrollment blossom.
Ingram-Cauchi (also a UW graduate) started the California-based ID
Tech Camps last summer on four campuses. This year he's expanded to
21 campuses around the country and expects enrollment to increase
from 500 students to 2,000. The Atlanta-based American Computer
Experience now offers computer camps at 80 locations around the
United States and United Kingdom. They started with 100 students in
1993 and expect 20,000 to attend this summer.
</P>
<P>
   These three computer camps offer courses suitable for kids ages
7 through 18 and classes suitable for a broad range of skill levels
_ from kids who've never laid hands on computers to kids who could
build them out of tinfoil and toothpaste. They also offer the
option of attending camp during the day only or overnight, with
enrollment ranging from a few days up to several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For those parents who worry tech camps would have their kids
spending too much quality time with a beige box, Cybercamps, ID
Tech Camps, and ACE all set aside time for outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to computer-specific camps, regular summer camps
also have begun incorporating a technological element. The
Northwest School is a private middle and high school that also
offers a summer program with 54 classes for kids to choose from.
This year, in addition to courses in baking, photography and
ceramics, the school will offer classes in Web page design, desktop
publishing and multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers are such an important part of daily life and they're
only going to become more important,'' says Susan Mueller, summer
program director for The Northwest School.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly why parents are flocking to computer camps _
despite the steep enrollment fees (often more than $500 for a
week). Parents are concerned about their children's ability to
survive and compete in an increasingly technical world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you choose a camp for your child, you're choosing life
activities that will help them in the long run,'' says Kathy
McQuaid, mother of Michelle and Monica. ``If they focus on computer
science, I feel they'll have a really good job. And Cybercamp makes
it so fun, they don't even know they're learning.''
</P>
<P>
   TO LEARN MORE
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of summer computer camps where kids learn
everything from Web page making to game programming. Campers can
stay for a few days or for weeks, during the day only or overnight.
Many camps offer scholarships as well as discounts for families
that sign up more than one child. For more information:

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have to install some shelves and hang a number of pictures,
plus a mirror, on the walls of my new condominium apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The walls are made of painted drywall and I have only a few
basic hand tools.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of hollow wall anchors or similar mounting fixtures
should I use that will be quick and simple for an inexperienced
amateur to use and install, particularly since I own no power
tools?
</P>
<P>
   A: Auger type anchors that look like large, fat screws, and are
made of plastic or some type of zinc alloy, are probably the
quickest and easiest to install.
</P>
<P>
   They require no drilling of pilot holes and they work well in
all wall panels of almost any thickness. In addition, they are also
easy to remove when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   You drive them into the wall with an ordinary Phillips type
screwdriver until they are tight (they make their own hole and
expand inside the wall after being tightened).
</P>
<P>
   A matching size screw is then inserted into the center and
serves to actually attach the shelf bracket or hook to the anchor.
</P>
<P>
   For heavier loads there are also combination toggle type auger
anchors that are installed the same way _ again without need for
drilling a pilot hole.
</P>
<P>
   Once in place a machine screw is inserted into the center and
tightened. This flips open a built-in toggle at the inside end so
it forms a right angle to the anchor body, thus causing it to lock
securely against the back side of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My hardwood floor has several dark urine type stains left by
the previous tenant's dog. Is there any way I can get these stains
out of the wood?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only sure way to lighten such stains is to use a wood
bleach, but this only will work on raw or unfinished wood. This
means that the floor will undoubtedly have to be completely sanded
down, then the bleach can be applied before the floor is
refinished.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a rectangular hole in one wall where an electric
switch was removed. How can we patch and refill this hole before we
repaint that wall?
</P>
<P>
   A: One simple way to cover up or patch a hole of this kind is to
cut a scrap piece of drywall the same size as the opening, but
slightly oversize so it will be a tight fit when pushed into place.
</P>
<P>
   After the patch is in position, apply a thin layer of joint
cement around the edges then cover this with joint tape and apply
another thin layer of joint cement over the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Allow this to harden, then smooth over where necessary with a
thin application of spackling compound, evening it out with a wide
spackling knife.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A number of double-hung wood windows in my old house have
broken sash cords and some of the sash units fit so loosely that in
the winter they allow cold drafts to enter.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot spend the money needed for installing new windows, but
was told there are replacement units that I can install myself.
</P>
<P>
   Have you heard of such items that a do-it-yourselfer can
install?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the sash units are still in good enough condition to reuse
them, you can buy replacement window jambs (also called window
channels) that are made of plastic or metal _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   They can be ordered from many lumber yards and home improvement
centers and can be installed by an experienced do-it-yourselfer.
(They usually come with complete instructions and illustrations.)
</P>
<P>
   These are made to fit inside your present window frames in place
of the existing window channels and make use of the original window
sashes.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement jambs contain built-in weather-stripping to seal
out drafts, and they eliminate the need for sash cords or separate
balances.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     SPIRITED DEBATE SHOWS VULNERABILITY OF MEXICO'S RULING PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After a debate that was notable for its vigor,
Mexico's longtime ruling political party is in the unusual position
of defending its wobbly record against a strutting opposition
candidate seen increasingly as presidential material.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's televised event with six presidential candidates
had little substance but plenty of punch, mostly stinging blows
aimed at the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, that has
been in power since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, a tall northern rancher with a cool demeanor and
deep voice, was seen as the victor in the debate. Likening his
candidacy to democracy movements that altered the world, Fox stayed
clear of personal attacks that have marked much of his heated
contest with the PRI's staid candidate, Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former governor of Guanajuato state and executive of the
Coca-Cola Co., is the candidate of the conservative National Action
Party (PAN), the nation's strongest opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he wanted to build the country's first democratic
transition government, and compared the efforts at winning the
presidency on July 2 to those of South Africa's Nelson Mandela and
Poland's Lech Walesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one imagined that Mandela, a farmer, or Walesa, a worker,
could break the chains of oppression and authoritarianism,'' Fox
said during the debate. ``No one imagined that students or
housewives, with their own, hands, would knock down the Berlin
Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Fox, 57, is only a few percentage points behind
Labastida in the most contentious presidential race in Mexican
history. Analysts believe that for the first time, an opposition
party has the chance to beat the PRI in a clean election.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, 57, an experienced economist and career public
servant who has held a wide range of jobs in the government,
conceded his party has made mistakes, but said he was committed to
changing an often corrupt and undemocratic system.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to incorporate the values of Luis Donaldo
Colosio, the young, popular PRI candidate who was slain in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many politicians have failed people. That's why we have to
change politics,'' Labastida said. ``I am promoting change in my
party, changes in favor of democracy, and changes to fight for
honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Labastida's candor, overnight opinion polls indicated
most television viewers thought Fox had won the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico City daily Reforma said 44 percent of people
questioned by telephone thought Fox had won. Only 14 percent of
respondents thought Labastida was the winner.
</P>
<P>
   In another poll, conducted by the daily El Universal, 54 percent
said Fox had won, compared with 28 percent for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was more a series of speeches, with each candidate
allotted 14 minutes spread over 90 minutes. No questions were
asked, no major issues or proposals were addressed, and it remains
to be seen whether it will change the minds of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Although six candidates are competing, the race has shaped into
a showdown between Labastida and Fox. A debate with just the three
main candidates will be held at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the
left-center Democratic Revolutionary Party, could not advance his
third-place position, trailing at 12 percent in polls after the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Fox and Labastida men cut from the same official cloth,
Cardenas aimed at Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he is the candidate who represents the corruption of
the regime, who represents complicity with drug trafficking,''
Cardenas said.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only other contender who made an impact was Gilberto Rincon
of the Social Democratic Party, which has not figured prominently
in Mexican politics.
</P>
<P>
   He called for better treatment of minorities, and urged viewers
to see his party as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a party that could have impact,'' said
political analyst Erick Fernandez. ``He addressed minorities,
women, the handicapped, the indigenous population. After all,
Mexico is a country of minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fox's standing in the polls, he still will have a hard
time defeating Labastida, who has the formidable strength of the
PRI machine that controls and influences much of the country.
</P>
<P>
   A former agriculture secretary and governor of Sinaloa state,
Labastida appealed to the poor, rural vote that is easily
influenced and which usually sides with the PRI in elections. Much
of the countryside views PAN as the party of the rich business
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicente Fox, you remind me of the old PRI. Talk of change is
easy; producing it is not,'' Labastida said. ``When Fox was
governor of Guanajuato he dedicated himself to travel. ... What is
not clear is what the state gained.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who has much sway with the middle class, which has become
increasingly fed up with crime and corruption, responded that his
travels brought employment and business to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the backing of other parties could be just what he
needs to close the small gap between him and Labastida, Fox asked
for the support of two other candidates _ Manuel Camacho Solis, a
former mayor of Mexico City and a one-time PRI member, and veteran
politician Porfirio Munoz Ledo. Both took part in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manuel and Porfirio, I need you in the final round,'' said
Fox, who already has an alliance with the environmental Green
Party. ``Because what I am proposing is a transition government ...
a change.''

   VIETNAM-MCCAIN (Hanoi, Vietnam) _ As he strode Wednesday through
the shadowy hallways and incongruously sunny courtyards _ gesturing
here, pointing to a detail there _ Sen. John McCain might have been
a father showing a son his alma mater. Except the landmarks on this
tour were dank cells like the one where McCain spent two years in
solitary confinement, and leg irons, which he once wore as a
punishment for insulting the guards. McCain took his wife and
13-year-old son Wednesday to see the jail where he spent the
darkest days of his life as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. It
was an emotional capstone of the senator's visit to mark the 25th
anniversary of the end of the war, and McCain was
characteristically blunt about his raw feelings a quarter of a
century later. By Mark Landler.

   SCOTUS-BOYSCOUTS (Washington) _ The question before the Supreme
Court on Wednesday was whether the Boy Scouts have a constitutional
right to exclude gay members, but the justices did not seem
particularly interested in either Boy Scout policy or the future of
gay rights. Rather, what clearly concerned the court were the
implications of ruling for one side or the other. If the Boy Scouts
cannot exclude homosexuals, can they still exclude girls, the
justices wanted to know. More generally, the justices asked, if an
organization deems a particular kind of exclusivity to be central
to its identity, must courts take that assertion at face value? If
not, by what standard are they to judge it? If so, might that not
be the equivalent of giving a free pass from the
anti-discrimination commands of civil rights law? By Linda

   Let the stunts begin. The four-week May ratings sweep _ the most
anticipated of the three ``sweeps'' periods because it incorporates
the season finales of most regular series _ starts Thursday, with
the first salvo of blockbuster programming scheduled this weekend
on ABC, CBS and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Two are four-hour miniseries, which is the networks' way of
killing two nights with one millstone. The other _ the best bet of
the three choices _ is a standard two-hour movie about a deceased
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   None will be remembered as memorable moments of the new
millennium, unless some crafty film historian combines them into
``Take Me Home to the Arabian Nights of the '70s.'' Until then,
they remain completely separate and titled as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Arabian Nights
</P>
<P>
   Sunday and Monday on ABC
</P>
<P>
   Parental guideline rating: TV-14
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the glossiest miniseries yet from the Robert Halmi
Sr./Jr. fantasy factory, ``Arabian Nights'' holds up reasonably
well the first night. But as a two-night, four-hour homage to the
therapeutic value of storytelling, it commits the storyteller's
cardinal sin of not knowing when to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Halmi projects, ``Arabian Nights'' has a boatload of
special effects, ranging from sophisticated to sophomoric. More
important are the performances _ mostly good _ from a good cast.
</P>
<P>
   Mili Avital is especially pleasing as the ingenious sultana,
Scheherazade, who avoids execution at the hands of her mad husband
by telling him a story each night and _ in perfect May-sweeps
cliffhanger style _ withholding the final act till the following
night. In this manner, Scheherazade runs through five tales, among
them ``Aladdin and the Lamp'' and ``Ali Baba and the Forty
Thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   John Leguizamo injects humor, maybe a tad too much, playing two
different genies in the Aladdin segment. Alan Bates adds wry wisdom
as Scheherazade's storytelling mentor: ``If your audience isn't
interested,'' he advises, ``you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Halmis and ABC might have taken Storyteller's advice
and compressed ``Arabian Nights'' into three hours on one night, as
the network does when it airs big theatrical movies. That way, they
could avoid the inevitable nodding off of viewers on the second
Arabian night.
</P>
<P>
   Take Me Home: The John Denver Story
</P>
<P>
   Sunday on CBS
</P>
<P>
   Parental guideline rating: TV-PG
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B (B+ for Denver fans)
</P>
<P>
   ``The John Denver Story'' has all the markings of another Sunday
night biopic destined for the biohazard pile. But with performances
that raise the pedestrian material to unexpected heights, Chad Lowe
(``Now and Again'') and Kristin Davis (``Sex and the City'') render
the usual obscurity-to-fame-to-obscurity ride of a pop star
watchable if not riveting.
</P>
<P>
   From his dead-on lip-syncing (using Denver's original music) to
an amiable interpretation of the singer's gee-whiz public persona,
Lowe, better known these days as Mr. Hilary Swank, helps make
``Take Me Home'' less rigid than most biographies of the recently
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, however, is the real star. She imbues Annie _ Denver's
first wife and his one true love _ with a glowing strength of
character that generously spreads luster to everyone within her
sphere.
</P>
<P>
   The camera likes Davis a lot, and director of photography Mike
Fash wisely gives the lens sufficient time to register the nuances
in her expressive face. In one scene, when Denver is driving off in
his Porsche for yet another extended period away from his wife and
kids, Davis' eyes wring love, bitterness, frustration, wistfulness
and determination from the moment without benefit of a single word.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Denver's 1994 autobiography, ``Take Me Home: The John
Denver Story'' is an affectionate treatment that still manages to
examine the singer's difficult struggle for acceptance from his
taciturn father. It doesn't ignore the rough spots in his first
marriage, the time he chain-sawed the furniture in a fit of anger,
or his driving while drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS film doesn't recreate Denver's death, which occurred in
1997 when the small airplane he was piloting crashed into the
Pacific Ocean. Instead, viewers are left with a high-sucrose moment
backed by one of the 15 Denver songs featured in the movie. Though
corny in the extreme, it's a fitting ending to a story about the
boyish songwriter who, as a man, discovered he was much like his
father but found a measure of redemption in tuneful messages of
hope, inspiration and love.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s
</P>
<P>
   Sunday/Monday on NBC
</P>
<P>
   Parental guideline rating: TV-14
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Not a single John Denver song is included in the soundtrack of
``The '70s,'' even though 13 Denver songs, in aggregate, spent more
than two years on Billboard's Top 40 list in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Probably doesn't matter. No amount of poems, prayers and
promises could help this rambling follow-up to ``The '60s,'' one of
NBC's success stories from the February ratings sweep last year.
Like its predecessor, ``The '70s'' follows four individuals through
an entire decade, spotlighting their ``journeys of self-discovery''
against a backdrop of the big events of the period, including
Watergate, Richard Nixon's resignation, the end of the Vietnam War,
the women's movement, the rise of disco and the ascension of Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with their days at Kent State University, the four
amigos follow divergent paths after National Guardsmen kill four of
their fellow students on May 4, 1970. One goes to law school and
then to Nixon's re-election campaign committee. One sheds her
conservative ways and embraces the fight to gain equal rights for
women. Another tries modeling before heading west and dabbling in
every self-improvement fad available. The fourth, a guardsman who
fired upon his fellow students, runs away to Los Angeles and
eventually finds the leader within himself in the black power
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The acting in ``The '70s'' turns out to be a lot like the music
of the era: mostly forgettable. If anyone stands out, it's Vinessa
Shaw as the budding feminist. The writing is equally vapid, with
this revelatory line, uttered near the end of the second night,
serving to capture the purported essence of the film: ``I guess
none of us are the same people we used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, ``The '70s'' tries to cover too much ground as it
bounces from one story to the next, and thus fails to make its
character development convincing, or even plausible.

A GEORGIA DAUGHTER'S LULLABY OF THE PINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNE RAVER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAXTER, Ga. _ ``This probably won't be too thrilling to you, a
wrecking yard like this,'' Franklin Ray said, stepping out of his
jumbled homemade house and leading the way through piles of tires
and aluminum cans, decades of rusting cars and tractors, entwined
in wisteria and wild grapevines, sunk to their hubcaps in years of
pine needles and magnolia leaves. Like Mayan ruins slumbering in
the Yucatan, the detritus of a civilization is piled here in his
back yard, awaiting some archaeologist _ or daughter _ to reveal
its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, what are you going to do with this boat?'' Janisse Ray,
a poet and nature writer, asked, narrowing dark eyes at a cabin
cruiser in her path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' he said, walking past a tricycle perched on a
1958 Chevrolet Biscayne, past the old yellow school bus where his
children played church, baptizing one another in imaginary water,
past the pond where they floated on discarded gas tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, 37, was born in this junkyard. In her first book, ``Ecology
of a Cracker Childhood,'' part memoir, part clarion call to save
the longleaf pine, published in December by Milkweed Editions, she
casts a loving but unflinching eye on growing up poor and
fundamentalist in southeast Georgia, with mental illness snaking
through her clan like a dark tributary of the Altamaha River. Her
daddy ran the junkyard (he still does), and his quicksilver mind
could just as easily resurrect a dead machine as answer the voice
of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear you, Lord,'' he shouted one morning, crashing through a
bedroom window, arms beseeching the sky, stumbling into the
wilderness of junk that stretches for 10 acres off Route 1, on the
edge of this town, population 3,800. His wife, Lee Ada, had to
commit him to the state hospital for months. When Ray read about
those bad years in ``The Ecology of a Cracker Childhood,'' he said,
``it jarred me around a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I made up my mind not to make up my mind until I had went
through it and digested as much of it as I could,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and courtly, with a head of white hair framing bemused blue
eyes, Ray looks more like a professor of junk or a folk artist than
a man who whipped his four children with a belt when they failed
his moral code, like standing, paralyzed with horror, as a neighbor
boy stomped a turtle to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ain't no sense in killing things for pleasure,'' he tells
them in the book, and metes out five licks to each, ``relentless
and unending.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this same man tapes a heron's broken leg and wing, letting
it perch for months in the living room, while he hopes, in vain, it
will heal.
</P>
<P>
   The Rays were descendants of the whiskey-loving, lawless Celts
who fled the border wars of Scotland and England for the Georgia
wilderness. They built their houses out of 100-foot pines and let
their hogs, known as pine woods rooters, forage unfenced in the
forest's thick wire grass.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Charlie Joe Ray, orphaned as a boy, raised himself in
the woods and swamps. He could ``tickle'' fish _ catch them
barehanded _ and tree raccoons better than a hound. Granny Ray sold
bathtub gin and ran a cafe until her husband wrecked it in a fight
with a boxer. He beat his children in rage, and his wife committed
him, too, when his violence scared her.
</P>
<P>
   But it was C.J., as Charlie Joe Ray was known, who taught
Janisse to love the woods, showing up at the door with iris bulbs
dug from the swamp. He taught her irony, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus wept, Moses slept, and Peter went afishin','' he would
say, when it was his turn to recite a Bible verse at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In alternate chapters, Ray tells of a land that existed long
before the likes of the ``wild McRaes'' settled southern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, in the 1700s, a magnificent forest of longleaf pine,
100 feet tall, with great spreading limbs, marched across 85
million acres of coastal plain, from Virginia to Florida. Cushioned
by wire grass, which evolved along with the resin-soaked pines to
survive fire, this elegant ecosystem harbored nearly 200 species of
plants and animals, like gopher tortoises, cockaded woodpeckers,
indigo snakes and salamanders.
</P>
<P>
   That was before 1818, Ray writes, when the Creek Indians were
bloodily defeated and ceded their land to Georgia, and her kin
fanned out over the wilderness, cutting down trees for pastures and
cropland, timber, turpentine and paper.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of what they entered is scrawled on my bones, so that
I carry the landscape inside like an ache,'' Ray writes. ``The
story of who I am cannot be severed from the story of the
flatlands.''
</P>
<P>
   Early one April morning, Ray barreled down a state road toward
the Fort Stewart Military Reservation near Hinesville, to show a
visitor a healthy longleaf forest, only a fragment of which still
exists. Dressed in a white T-shirt and farmer's overalls, she
leaned forward at the wheel of her truck, thin, intense, every
fiber of her body turned up to high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have 3,000 acres of virgin forest left in Georgia,''
she said, driving by row upon row of slash pine, a fast-growing
tree that is now farmed on plantations like corn. ``Because of the
spotted owl and pressure from environmentalists in the Northwest,
tree cutting has swung around to the Southeast, so we're in the
middle of a cutting cycle worse than at the turn of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   A pine plantation is not a forest, she kept repeating like a
mantra. The land is plowed up and herbicided, destroying natural
vegetation and driving out most of its creatures. Machines then
plant a single species, usually a fast-growing tree like slash pine
or loblolly, in row after row. So little light falls through the
canopy that not much else can grow.
</P>
<P>
   A longleaf pine forest, however, is widely spaced, with hundreds
of species thriving on its wire grass floor. It evolved to thrive
on fire, started by lightning or humans, scattering its seeds in
the rich mineral ash, and getting a leg up on other pines and
hardwoods that grow faster but can't take the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Years of fire suppression gave these other species the upper
hand. Though the military periodically sets fire to parts of the
280,000-acre forest at Fort Stewart and does selective cutting of
longleaf trees, such efforts are rare in a state that sees its
trees as a cash crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longleaf pine is critically endangered,'' Ray said.
``We've cut down 99 percent of its natural stands.'' She's afraid
people won't know a forest from a pine plantation. Children will
have to go to a planetarium to see a starry sky. They won't know
the sound of silence.
</P>
<P>
   She knew all these things in the wilderness of the junkyard. Her
father never finished high school, but he read encyclopedias and
pondered the theory of relativity. There were rare moments of
paddling a leaky barge down the Altamaha with Daddy, going to sleep
under a full moon. And no one was prouder when she got a
scholarship to North Georgia College, a military school on the edge
of the Chattahoochee National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't wait to leave.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no doubt in my mind when I was growing up that I
would leave Baxley,'' she said. ``I knew how bound I was,
restricted. They did it out of love, really, but it was absolute
oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father forbade Janisse and her sister, Kay, to cut their
hair or wear pants, to visit other children or have them over.
</P>
<P>
   (``We set this TV out of the house when Kay was born in '58,''
Ray told me, nodding at a set in back of a '54 Chevy. ``Been here
ever since.'')
</P>
<P>
   His daughter said that when she got to college, ``I felt
socially retarded.'' She added: ``I'd never spent the night at
anybody's house. Never had a date or been to a dance or a football
game.''
</P>
<P>
   She gravitated to the writers and the hell-raisers, drinking
beer and sky diving, reading and writing poetry. She talked James
Dickey into coming to her little mountain school for a reading.
Then she went to Florida State University, in Tallahassee, to get a
degree in English, and fell in love with the hippie culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met this man at the food co-op who had a piece of land in
the country,'' outside Tallahassee, she said. She bought a piece
from him and built her own house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very simple design I came up with myself,'' said Ray,
who after all had spent her youth as the junk man's assistant. ``I
used old telephone poles and got sliding glass doors at Goodwill.
It was a six-sided house of windows, with a tin roof on the edge of
a ravine.''
</P>
<P>
   She could walk out the back door and down to a stream bordered
with mountain laurel and trillium. She'd watch foxes pass by her
windows.
</P>
<P>
   She fell in love with a woodworker, had a baby named Silas and
got married, in that order. But the marriage didn't last.
</P>
<P>
   She and Silas lived in the little glass house, doing farm jobs,
growing garlic, eating from her own big garden. They washed their
clothes in the creek. She still weeps at their hand-to-mouth
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loneliness of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she published poetry and studied with Wendell Berry, the
novelist and poet who came home to Kentucky to farm and to write.
In time, with a fellowship to the University of Montana, she earned
a master's degree in nature writing and environmental science and
wrote ``Ecology of a Cracker Childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to tell the story of the land,'' Ray said. ``And
because I had an interesting childhood, I thought it could be the
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   But most people weren't interested in trees. When the book was
sent to New York publishers, a number of them said they would take
it if she cut out all the natural history.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wouldn't do it,'' Ray said. To her, the two stories were
inseparable. ``With a child, we have the chance to help their
spirit flourish, just as we do with the landscape,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Milkweed, a small press in Minnesota devoted to
environmental writing, offered her a $20,000 contract. The book has
sold 10,000 copies, and is in its second printing.
</P>
<P>
   She came home ``as a matter of honor,'' she said, to be on the
frontlines of environmental activism. ``It's an illness of rural
areas that we teach our children if they want to be anything, they
have to leave and never come back,'' she said. ``And if you come
back, you've failed.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the next breath: ``On the other hand, I don't think I
could raise Silas here.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, as she works with the Nature Conservancy to save the
Moody Swamp, 3,100 acres along the Altamaha, where a virgin
longleaf forest still remains, and while she fights the chipping
mills that are chewing up the upland woods, another voice in her is
rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendell Berry returned to his Kentucky, but truthfully, I
think I'm failing at it,'' she said. ``You find that childhood is a
mythological place.''
</P>
<P>
   Silas, now 11, is going to a public school, where she has to
tell his teachers not to whip him, because corporal punishment is
the norm. They live in a little cabin of heart pine, surrounded by
azaleas and fragrant wisteria, where her maternal grandmother,
Beulah Mae Miller, let Janisse and her siblings do forbidden
things, like read the funnies and watch ``Wheel of Fortune'' until
they saw the lights of Franklin's car.
</P>
<P>
   A Mason jar of azaleas sits in her bedroom, and over the rickety
table she uses for a writing desk, she has tacked a penciled list
of ``Verbs from `Cold Mountain,''' and a note from a fellow nature
writer, Rick Bass, scrawled on the back of an envelope: ``The only
good writing I've ever done came from someone else pushing my hand
across the paper while I sat in the chair.''
</P>
<P>
   Her soul mates live everywhere else but here. And she concedes
that her next book, on rural communities, isn't going too well.
</P>
<P>
   She talks of moving to Vermont, so that Silas can be closer to
his father. Of writing poetry again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to write about longing,'' she said, as she drove by
mile after mile of slash pine and trailer homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a book is so powerful, it holds its writer hostage.

STAYING IN SYNC: ALL THE DATA, UP TO DATE, ALL THE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE HUTSKO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens all the time: You arrive home from a long day at work
and realize you left something at the office. On your computer. In
a folder. Something you wish you had now, be it a memo you need to
revise, or maybe a recipe for Jamaican jerk chicken you saved as a
Web favorite while browsing during your lunch break. So much for
that exotic dinner you were going to fix.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, everyday life is often intricately tied to our
computers, whether they are at work or at home, or for most people,
both. E-mail, word processing and spreadsheet documents and
personal information like schedules and contacts have to be kept in
sync between home and office. And many people would like to move
digital pictures and MP3 music files back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   One way to do all that is to tote a notebook computer back and
forth. The same goes for owners of Palm and Windows CE-based
handheld computers _ apart from acting as organizers and miniature
Web and e-mail devices, handheld computers also synchronize data
between home and work. But there are even more alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   First, you need to decide what information to keep in sync.
Often it is just a couple of documents, like expense reports. For
that, a good old-fashioned floppy disk will do _ assuming that your
company doesn't have a rule against taking home things from your
computer and that your computer has a floppy drive. Apple's iMac
and iBook computers, for instance, do not.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to use e-mail. You can send home a file
as an attachment, but make sure that the home and office computers
can handle the same files. Both computers must, for instance, be
loaded with Microsoft Word if that was the program used to produce
the document. If the computers have different versions of Word,
there are extra steps, and sometimes it isn't worth all the fuss.
If the document is simple text, you can just cut and paste it into
the body of the e-mail; any special formatting like bold or italic
or tables would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   For larger files, like PowerPoint presentations and MP3 music
files, floppy disks and e-mail are less practical. Floppies are
generally too short on space, and e-mail is often too slow on the
receiving end. A 56K modem at home can make even text attachments
very slow to download. For these jobs a Zip drive or other
high-capacity device is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Iomega's latest Zip drive, which sells for $179.95, is as small
and thin as a Harlequin romance novel and packs 250 megabytes of
storage space per disk. Disks cost $20 each, or $100 for a pack of
six. The drive connects to a USB port on either a Mac or a Windows
machine and works very fast, because USB is many times faster than
the serial or printer port connection the older drives use to
connect to older computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Microtech Zip drive (about $170) is thinner and lighter than
Iomega's drive, but works only with 100-MB disks. Imation's
SuperDisk USB drive (about $150) can use both floppy disks and
disks that hold up to 120 MB. It's especially useful for Mac owners
without a floppy disk drive and works with Windows PC's, too.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller still but big on storage are compact flash cards, which
are matchbook-size memory chips that behave just like disks but
have no moving parts. Though compact flash cards cost more than Zip
disks, the card readers themselves, which are no larger than a pack
of cigarettes and are easy to carry, cost less than $50. Sandisk's
flash cards start at about $35 for 8 MB and go up to about $325 for
128 MB. Compact flash cards are especially suited to people who own
a digital camera that stores snapshots on compact flash cards; all
you need is the card reader to use the same storage cards with your
desktop computer, or an adapter to pop the flash card into the PC
card slot of your notebook computer.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of the Zip drive is its collection of easy-to-use
programs for backing up, restoring and keeping files in sync
between computers. The handiest is QuickSync, which will
continually back up your documents folder to the Zip drive any time
there is a change. Or you can use the very helpful file-sync
programs that come with all new and recent Macintosh and Windows
PCs, which, incidentally, also work with floppies.
</P>
<P>
   The Mac program is aptly called File Synchronization. It can be
found in the Control Panels folder. If it is not there, it may need
to be installed from the Software Installer CD that comes with the
Mac. File Synchronization benefits from a well-written,
step-by-step guide that explains how to choose and sync files.
Newer Macs equipped with FireWire and Ethernet ports (like the
latest G4, iMac and Powerbook models) can be connected to perform
the sync directly.
</P>
<P>
   Windows users get a clever sync program called Briefcase. If it
isn't already on the Windows desktop, it can easily be added: Click
the right mouse button on the Windows desktop, select New, then
Briefcase. (If Briefcase isn't a New option, run the Add/Remove
Programs utility in Control Panels and choose Windows Setup to add
Briefcase.)
</P>
<P>
   Briefcase works like a real briefcase, by letting you fill it
with items you want to carry between home and work. Once filled,
the Briefcase gets dragged to a floppy or Zip disk (or compact
flash card). Pop the disk into the other computer and drag to the
Briefcase onto the Windows desktop. Open it to work with the files,
and at the end of the day drag it back onto the Zip or floppy disk
to take back home, where it is then dragged back onto the desktop.
Right click on it and choose Update All and Windows does the rest,
figuring out which files have been added, removed or edited, then
updates accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Mac and Windows synchronization helper programs pay
attention to conflicts. Say, for instance, the same file gets
changed on both computers, either on purpose or by accident. The
helper programs will announce the conflict and offer to replace one
file with the other, in either direction, or will let you cancel
the exchange so you can double-check and ensure that you'll wind up
with the version you want.

 UNDATED: you want.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is critical to make sure the date and the time are set
correctly on both computers. A day or even a few hours off on one
or the other may make a file being synchronized appear newer than
the one it is replacing, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   There are also off-the-shelf synchronization programs.
LapLink.com's LapLink 2000 includes a combination serial and
parallel cable for connecting two computers and synchronizing
files. (An optional USB cable provides a much faster connection.)
The program creates dual window panes to show what is on both
computers; drag and drop files in either direction to move them
from one machine to the other. Custom options too numerous to cite
here make it possible to create sets of synchronization jobs,
depending on what you want to bring up to date and when. The
program can also dial up another computer to operate it remotely,
letting you transfer and work with files and programs as though you
were working in front of it. (Symantec's pcAnywhere is one of the
best-selling dial-up remote-control programs.)
</P>
<P>
   Puma Technology's Intellisync for Notebooks offers the same kind
of back and forth synchronization wizardry, but with more emphasis
on PIMs (personal information managers). It is especially practical
for people who must keep contact, schedule, e-mail and task data
absolutely up to date. The company gets its expertise from having
developed a version of the product for Palm and Windows CE handheld
computers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the handhelds that offer perhaps the best-kept secret of
desktop synchronization, acting as both electronic organizers that
do e-mail and Web browsing and, most important, as a data shuttle
for more than two computers. The Palm-based devices, which include
the new Palm IIIc color device and the competing Handspring Visor,
use a technology called HotSync. When the handheld computer is
placed in an accompanying cradle that is connected to the desktop
computer, pressing the cradle's HotSync button brings everything on
the little computer up to date with the desktop. Another HotSync
with the home computer at the end of the day brings updates that
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Handhelds running Microsoft's Windows CE or new Pocket PC for
palm-size devices use a program called ActiveSync. Like HotSync, it
synchronizes PIM data between the big and little computers and can
act as a bridge between home and work. It also readily synchronizes
Word and Excel files.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Web alternative. A number of sites offer
``virtual disk drives'' for stashing files for private or shared
consumption. Impressive among the free-service sites is i-drive.com
(www.idrive.com), which, besides storage space, offers an inventive
``clippings'' utility for snipping items like coupons and articles
for later viewing. The service's Sync program makes sure that what
is on your i-drive matches what is on your computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Apple offers a free service called iTools on its Web site, in a
members-only space where Mac owners can store up to 20 megabytes of
personal or shared data, as well as land a free
``yourname(at)mac.com'' e-mail address. The virtual drive appears
on the desktop, just like another hard disk. Next month i-drive.com
will offer the same kind of desktop icon for Windows users, with a
Mac version due in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   With so many options for synchronizing, the only remaining
challenge is actually locating the files you want to sync. Some
programs, like the elegant Palm Desktop software that Apple
thoughtfully includes with every new Macintosh, store PIM data in a
folder named after its user.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Outlook for Windows squirrels away the PIM file _
``outlook.pst'' _ like so: ``C:/Windows Local Settings/Application
Data/Outlook/outlook.pst.''
</P>
<P>
   With names and places like that, it's no wonder so many people
lead divided, out-of-sync digital lives.

FOOD CHARITIES ACROSS TEXAS SERVING MORE CLIENTS DESPITE STRONG
ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For years, Helen gave to charity. She cared for
disadvantaged children. She raised money for the arts. She walked
beside fellow breast cancer survivors in the Race for the Cure.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, she tries to keep a can of food in her car in case she
encounters someone in need.
</P>
<P>
   But when the 66-year-old grandmother and Southern Methodist
University graduate got in her car a few weeks ago and drove to
North Dallas Shared Ministries, she was not embarking on another
mission to help others.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in her life, she was asking for charity
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried all the way,'' she said. ``I didn't even want to go in
the door. I said, `Be yourself. See what they recommend.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she left, Helen had received some relief from her
utility bills, a few cans of a nutritional supplement and some
groceries. She hadn't asked for food _ only help with the light
bill _ but she was grateful to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Well, you need this and this,' and I didn't refuse
it,'' she recalled. ``I'm not Julia Child in the kitchen, but
things have been ...''
</P>
<P>
   She paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have gone to bed hungry,'' she said softly. ``I have
said, `Well, there is just nothing here this evening.' I really
shouldn't have gone hungry, but I have had shortages of food.''
</P>
<P>
   Too embarrassed to give her last name or allow her picture to be
published, Helen shared the account of her painful spiral downward
_ and reluctant plea for help _ during an often emotional interview
at a TGI Friday's restaurant in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   According to charity workers in Fort Worth-Dallas and beyond,
Helen has joined a growing number of Texans who are seeking food,
despite unparalleled nationwide prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   They are down and out in the best of times, locked in a largely
forgotten struggle while others marvel at widespread prosperity,
record-low unemployment rates and burgeoning government surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we're seeing every day. (Helen) is not the
exception,'' said Judy Rorrie, executive director of the
all-volunteer North Dallas Shared Ministries. ``She's the exception
only in that she had a little bit better circumstances to begin
with.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE YOUNG AND THE OLD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Food pantries call them ``clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Many are older people like Helen, who often have little left to
spend on food after buying medicine. Others are young, minimum-wage
workers with no health insurance _ and maybe a sick husband or
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Some are just getting into the work force, but not in a
well-paid job, after leaving the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their circumstances, their increasing reliance on
private food pantries was cited in a report to Congress last year
as evidence that the strong U.S. economy has done little to help
the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Although food stamp rolls have been slashed by a third since
1995, ``the need for food assistance has not diminished,'' the
General Accounting Office found. ``Rather, needy individuals are
relying on sources of assistance other than food stamps.''
</P>
<P>
   Charities are willing to help, but many agencies say the demand
is rising faster than they can respond. And they accuse
policy-makers of treating their emergency network like a permanent
safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that grab you hard are the children and the
elderly,'' said Melanie Gibson, executive director of Arlington
Charities. ``Elderly people, we have found, won't ask for help
until they are hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the children who come in often ask excitedly for
specific items, such as soup, cereal and milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a kid is asking, do you have this and this, and their
eyes are lighting up, you know that child has been hungry and he's
probably been eating just bread or what he got at school for a
while,'' Gibson said. ``That's very hard to deal with.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEMAND FOR FOOD SOARS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The increase in aid requests at Arlington Charities has been
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the agency received 20,742 requests for help. Last
year, that figure had more than doubled to 42,064, agency figures
show. Although the nonprofit organization offers clothing and other
help, about two-thirds of those seeking assistance requested food,
Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   The increased demand propelled Arlington Charities into grim new
territory in 1999: For the first time, the agency distributed more
than $1 million in food.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, we began to see a steady rise in requests, and it has
grown and grown and grown, until we can hardly keep up with it
anymore,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common refrain in Texas and across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A report late last year on hunger in 26 cities by the U.S.
Conference of Mayors showed that the demand for emergency food
assistance had risen 18 percent over 1998. The report also found
that 21 percent of the requests for food were going unmet.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the more than 120 million pounds of food distributed
to the 19 large food banks represents a 26 percent increase over
1996, according to the Texas Association of Second Harvest Food
Banks.
</P>
<P>
   And that figure does not include fresh produce, said Janet
Cocciarelli, director of the association, which helps acquire and
manage resources for the food banks.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Texas, food banks in Corpus Christi and Victoria
doubled their distributions in 1999 from the previous year, and the
Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley handled a 50 percent increase in
distributions, officials at those organizations said.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, distributions at the Tarrant Area Food Bank rose
15 percent between fiscal years 1997 and 1999 and are up 60 percent
at the North Texas Food Bank since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The North Texas group distributed 15.7 million pounds of food
last year and set two distribution records in the past few months,
handing out 1.5 million pounds of food in July and 1.6 million
pounds in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food bank system was set up to be a supplemental food
system,'' Cocciarelli said. ``We were not set up to meet the needs
of the chronically hungry. We can't keep up with that daily
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   `I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 5 percent of
Texas households experienced hunger between 1996 and 1998. Hunger
is defined as the uneasy or painful sensation associated with
inadequate food intake.
</P>
<P>
   More common than outright hunger is food insecurity, or
experiencing inadequate food supplies ar times. Nearly 13 percent
of Texas households fit that category during the same period.
MORE: &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS: the same period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mayors Conference report ranked Texas second and third,
respectively, in the two categories. It also touched off a
controversy when Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican
presidential nominee, questioned the accuracy of the report and
suggested that its release was timed to embarrass him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think the governor would know if there are pockets of
hunger in Texas,'' Bush said in a December ``Star-Telegram''
interview. ``I'd like to know who's going hungry in the state of
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question was obvious and painful to Jessie
Williams, a 52-year-old security guard from Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of nights I go to bed and I can't go to sleep
because I'm hungry,'' a teary-eyed Williams said after picking up
some groceries one recent afternoon at the Northside Inter-Church
Agency in Forth Worth.
</P>
<P>
   She blames the dramatic decline in her fortunes _ and food
supply _ on an injury she sustained at work. She hesitated to ask
for food, but Williams said she had little choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't come down here if I hadn't been hungry,'' she said,
her voice barely audible. ``I've never done anything like this in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe the contents of her pantry at home, Williams
responded: ``Slim to none.'' She said she mostly eats cereal with
the powdered milk she gets from the Northside charity.
</P>
<P>
   Williams can only fantasize about what she'd like to eat.
Cracking a smile as she formed a large circle with her hands, she
said, ``I'd do anything for a nice, round piece of steak.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `A LITTLE SOUP AND SOME BEANS' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sister Jean Thomas Dwyer _ she's affectionately known as
``Sister J.T.'' _ chuckles knowingly when asked whether she's ever
seen any hungry people. She said she sees them all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if there weren't pantries like this one, we'd have a lot
more,'' she said. ``Food stamps cannot feed the family for a month
in most cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Dwyer's office at the Catholic Charities Family
Assistance Center in Oak Cliff _ just southwest of downtown Dallas
_ sits behind thick, black burglar bars.
</P>
<P>
   She calls the place her ``hell hole.''
</P>
<P>
   A gaping hole in the plaster wall is covered with a board. The
office has no hot water or, for that matter, potable water. She
carries in the drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stressful job. Sister Dwyer took a sabbatical a few
years ago after developing shingles. She is also a cancer survivor.
</P>
<P>
   She is busy dealing with the many crises that visit poor
families. One of her current projects is the Martinez family.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus and Consuelo Martinez have five children, one born this
month with a serious heart ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Their income is limited because Jesus, who walks with the aid of
crutches, has a serious ailment. He's been told that it's
arthritis, although he's not sure. Whatever it is, it makes his
joints swell, particularly in the winter, and prevents him from
working full time.
</P>
<P>
   They have no telephone and are expecting to lose their borrowed
stove and refrigerator. They've applied for food stamps _ and
managed to get them for two months _ but they say their case has
been mishandled by the local food stamp office.
</P>
<P>
   At her ramshackle Dallas home, Consuelo, nine months pregnant at
the time of the interview, said the shelves are sometimes bare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we don't have anything,'' she said, stretching her
legs and grimacing with discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she does when she has no food, Consuelo said with
calm resignation: ``Well, the children cry because they're hungry.
Jesus will ask his brothers to bring something. Anything, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The children don't eat like they should. They don't eat like
they want to. They ask for a piece of meat,'' she said. ``We barely
have enough for a little soup and some beans. When we had the food
stamps, the kids ate well. But now they don't.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOD STAMP HASSLES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the Martinez family requested and eventually obtained
government assistance, they and others like them have discovered
that it is not always easy.
</P>
<P>
   They asked for ``emergency'' food assistance in December, one
week before Christmas, but they say food stamp caseworkers told
them there was no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they don't do emergency food stamps no more,'' said
Patricia Martinez, Jesus' bilingual sister-in-law, who went to the
state welfare office to translate for the couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expedited'' food stamps exist, and state guidelines call for
granting them within a day for those who qualify, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With the cold weather aggravating Jesus' condition and throwing
him out of work, Consuelo said, the family income had dropped to a
level that made them eligible for expedited food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they had a hard time getting that across to the
Department of Human Services, or DHS.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jesus nor Consuelo speaks English, and they said no
bilingual caseworkers were at the office to help them, despite
federal guidelines requiring translations when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Patricia Martinez telephoned on her
brother-in-law's behalf and was told that a Spanish-speaking
caseworker would help them. But when the couple arrived 15 minutes
later, they said, they were told that no Spanish speakers were
available.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, nearly a month after they applied, Consuelo said, she
received a $213 food stamp allocation. It helped tremendously _
while it lasted.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, the money was gone, something Consuelo said
she discovered only after a store clerk ran her benefit-dispensing
Lone Star Card through the register. She bought her son, Guillermo,
a treat with the 35 cents that remained. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DHS vs. INDIGENT TEXANS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DHS officials have been unable to confirm or deny the Martinez
family's account of their dealings with the agency. But Mario
Caballero, a lawyer with the Gulf Coast Legal Foundation, said he
has heard strikingly similar tales.
</P>
<P>
   He recently settled one lawsuit against DHS, and just filed
another, on behalf of indigent clients with food stamp problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got clients who come in and say, `I don't want food
stamps, it's too much of a hassle,' '' Caballero said. The chief
problem, Caballero said, is that DHS is so concerned about
ferreting out fraud that it overlooks the needs of legitimate
clients.
</P>
<P>
   DHS officials deny that assessment, saying the agency cares
about stopping fraud and helping the needy. MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS: helping the needy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Caballero's lawsuits featured complaints about illegal
delays in the processing of requests, and it accused officials of
granting too many short approval periods _ between one and three
months _ after which recipients must reapply.
</P>
<P>
   Before the case went to trial, DHS agreed in January to a
federal court order forcing the agency to provide better and more
timely services. DHS did not admit any wrongdoing in the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, the Fort Worth-Dallas area was out
of compliance about 20 percent of the time last summer _ worse than
the Houston area, which produced the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether some Texans might have gone hungry because of
caseworkers' documented slow response, DHS spokesman Chris Traylor
said, ``It's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A new lawsuit, filed March 31, accuses the department of
violating federal guidelines requiring translations for food stamp
applicants who need them.
</P>
<P>
   Traylor said he could not comment on pending litigation, but he
acknowledged, ``There are problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``State agencies have a very difficult time recruiting and
retaining bilingual staff,'' he said. ``We have undergone efforts
to do so, but in today's economy, bilingual staff are at a premium,
and it's difficult to recruit and retain staff.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   $10 A MONTH IN AID &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor say the hassle associated with food stamp
applications is one of the many reasons food stamp rolls have
dropped since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Between October 1995 and October 1999, the number of food stamp
recipients in Texas declined 45.7 percent, more than in any other
state during that period, according to USDA figures. That compares
with a national decline of 32.6 percent during those years.
</P>
<P>
   Many poor Texans who do not receive food stamps, including
former welfare recipients who may have lost other benefits, remain
eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
   In a few counties, including Collin and Denton, more than 90
percent of those eligible in 1999 did not receive food stamps,
according to an analysis of government data by the Center for
Public Policy Priorities, which lobbies for poor Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and DHS officials say they are trying to sign up all Texans
who are eligible for the federal food stamp program.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Bush said critics do not mention that he
signed a bill in 1999 appropriating money to fund an outreach
program so ``people can get on food stamps who are deserving to be
on food stamps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best place to address the hunger issue is to make sure
people who are eligible for food stamps realize there's a program
available for them, so we're doing that,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Friedman, the DHS' executive deputy commissioner, said the
agency distributed 265,000 fliers advertising the program at more
than 16,000 sites across Texas between December and April.
</P>
<P>
   He said people have moved off the rolls for many reasons, not
the least of which is an aggressive effort to get jobs for
recipients. New rules bar or restrict able-bodied adults and many
legal immigrants from receiving food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor: Some recipients are entitled to so little that
they feel that it's not worth the effort, officials said. The
elderly and disabled who receive food stamps, for example, get an
average of $10 a month in benefits, according to DHS.
</P>
<P>
   Although Friedman's goal is to sign up everybody who is eligible
for food stamps, he said that still wouldn't be enough. Those who
get help often need more assistance before the month is out, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are hearing is that food stamps will last two and a
half, maybe three weeks. There is a gap,'' he said. ``It was
intended as a supplement. It was never meant to be the sole
nutritional program.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EATING `JUST ONCE A DAY' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The limits of governmental and private help are not lost on Mary
Sandoval. A night cashier at Wal-Mart, Sandoval receives help from
the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) program and relies on
assistance from local charities.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough. Faced with food shortages, she said, she has
given sugar water to her 5-month-old baby when she didn't have milk
and skips meals herself to make the food last longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I eat just once a day, because we don't have enough
in the house for us to be eating all the time,'' said Sandoval, who
lives in a mobile home with her boyfriend in Pelican Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat just before I go to work so I won't get hungry at
work,'' she said. ``I don't want to sit there and watch other
people eat, and I can't afford to buy anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She is candid about her own failings. A former drug abuser, she
said she voluntarily relinquished custody of one of her children
because her addiction was getting the best of her.
</P>
<P>
   Sober for eight years, she is trying to make a go of it again.
Her boyfriend is unemployed, recovering from a serious work injury.
So she has to rely on her salary of $6.50 an hour to keep baby Rae
in diapers _ and fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sleep whenever I can,'' Sandoval said, choking back tears as
she comforted her fussy daughter. ``It's frustrating. It's real
frustrating. But every time I look at her and see her smile, it
just seems like everything is going to be OK.'' (Visit the

BLUE MAN JOINS THE VEGAS COLLECTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Thank God the Twinkie strike was so brief. Never
mind all those people with the shakes from involuntary withdrawal;
Blue Man's show was in trouble. One of the group's best acts is the
one with the Twinkies, the electric saw and Andrew Wyeth's
``Christina's World.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation was approaching crisis levels. At least Cap'n
Crunch, which Blue Man uses as a percussion instrument, wasn't
having any trouble with the Teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Man Group is the three-man performance troupe, the bald,
blue-headed guys who, though unspeaking (and occasionally
unspeakable), have been wreaking havoc on contemporary art in the
intervals between playing their own music on plumbing pipes at the
Astor Place Theater in Manhattan since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Before that they did their thing in living rooms and in Central
Park, once conducting a ``Funeral for the '80s'' for the late,
great postmodern and deconstructionist theories of art.
``Surprisingly,'' they write on their Web site (www.blueman.com),
``the funeral worked. The next day, artists all over the world
agreed to stop making art based on these misguided concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   The original Blue Men, Matt Goldman, Phil Stanton and Chris
Wink, were street performers who established their own Club Nowhere
on a sidewalk outside the Copacabana in the late 1980s. By now,
Blue Man has effected a corporate merger with himself. Thirty other
Blue Men have joined the troupe, plus two in training. On Third
Street in the East Village, Blue Man has an enormous rehearsal and
performance theater, plus a recording studio (its first CD,
``Audio,'' came out last year).
</P>

   ``Blue Man: Tubes,'' the New York show, is still going strong.
In 1995 it opened in Boston; it's going strong there, too. In 1997
it was Chicago, where, yes, it's still going strong. Last month,
Messrs. Goldman, Stanton and Wink opened in ``Blue Man Group: Live
at Luxor'' in Las Vegas, with a five-year contract. Long-term
thinkers, they hope to go on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas may seem like an unlikely site for hip and irreverent
performers up from the sidewalks of New York. But there's Blue Man,
drumming up trade at the Luxor, the pyramid in the American desert
that is the second-largest hotel in the country. The Luxor's lobby
space amounts to 29 million cubic feet, enough to shelter nine
Boeing 747s stacked on top of one another, if you had a mind to
stack up 747s, and heaven only knows how many mummies.
</P>
<P>
   Here, huge Egyptian goddesses with distinctly 21st-century
features guard the entrance to the sacred precinct of the casino.
Beyond (italics)that(end italics) is the Blue Man store, the
theater and a ladies' room, where sprightly recorded voices sing,
``bathroom, bathroom, bathroom'' and once again, ``bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Man's first show sent up the art scene, with paintings made
by splashing paint randomly off drums, a fish analyzed in the
thorny terms of art criticism: in-jokes for the downtown New York
crowd. If the art scene has outgrown the references, the audience
finds Blue Man so funny it doesn't matter. But will it play in
Peoria? Or Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. Blue Man has cut down the art references for the
Luxor show and replaced them with music and spectacle, but they
still make a couple of paintings every evening, which sell out in
their store.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas production was the third time I had seen the show
(which has a kind of cult following that comes back five and six
times, as if ranking Blue Man somewhere between the ``Rocky Horror
Picture Show'' and ``Star Wars'') and every time, the audience,
including me, laughed itself silly at the sneakily wise and
eminently clueless, determinedly deadpan glee of the art riffs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the polyvinyl-chloride-pipe instrument Blue Man
whomped up long ago, which rather resembles a xylophone attached to
a plumber's model of the intestinal system, the group has devised
enough clever new PVC-pipe instruments to put the pipe industry on
the charts.
</P>
<P>
   They say they are playing tribal rock, ``with kind of a
spaghetti western theme,'' as Chris Wink put it in a recent
interview, like ``the Magnificent Seven, the people who drift into
town.'' The show rocks, pulsates and percusses with the aid of a
16-piece band in fluorescent devil gear. They make compelling
jump-up-and-down music, and by the end a lot of the rock concert
habitues in the audience were doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   The group is still heavily invested in art, more on the Web than
in Vegas. Its site includes an updated history of modern art that
reveals important new information for art historians: It was Blue
Man who pushed Yves Klein out the window for his famous
flying-through-the-air photo; Blue Man who wielded most of the
paint cans in Jackson Pollock's studio; Blue Man whose spiral
painting inspired Robert Smithson's jetty.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas itself has recently embraced art in its very own Las
Vegas way: as entertainment. (Art is heading in that direction as
fast as it can in museums and galleries; Vegas just has
higher-octane fuel.) At Caesars Palace, people concentrate on the
slots under busts of the Roman emperors, and classical Venuses fill
all the niches in the shopping arcade except the ones with Elmer
Fudd and Wile E. Coyote.
</P>
<P>
   Cirque du Soleil's ``O,'' the under-and-over water fantasia at
the Bellagio, is a revue composed of acrobatic acts in the
costumes, settings and disguise of art theater, staged in a tank.
</P>
<P>
   The main attraction at the Bellagio, where the meeting rooms are
named Cezanne, Degas, Renoir and van Gogh, is Steve Wynn's $300
million art collection. The big sign in front of the Bellagio reads
``Now Appearing: Van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne and Picasso.'' They do
appear, in a manner of speaking, in two windowless rooms lined with
deep black fabric, each painting relentlessly lit by spotlights to
the point where textures seem flattened out and one or two might as
well have been airbrushed. Please welcome Vincent van Gogh, star of
stage and screen!
</P>
<P>
   In the kingdom of stars, spectacle reigns. (All right, it reigns
everywhere, but in Vegas it's the emperor.) Blue Man came out here
when he felt ready for the big time. Up to now, he has been playing
in theaters that hold 300 to 600 people; at Luxor, there are 1,250
seats at $55 or $65 a ticket, less than some other Vegas shows.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, as Matt Goldman said, ``was to make a show big enough
for an arena that would still seem small and intimate,'' as it did
in the vest-pocket theaters they have been playing in. (Though Las
Vegas' notion of intimacy is an escort service.) So a giant screen
sometimes duplicates the action at Luxor, or Blue Man and the band
loom large only as projected shadows behind cloth.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I confess I missed the close encounter of the first kind, but
the special effects in this $7 million production were as fetching
as special effects onstage have any right to be in the era of ``The
Matrix'' and ``Toy Story'': clumsy, bent-kneed statues suddenly
swayed and bobbed up and down in the staccato glare of precisely
timed strobe lights; neon stick figures did a disjointed shuffle
against a black backdrop, then imperceptibly stepped out of the
backdrop to accompany the band as fluidly as any majorette.
</P>
<P>
   The real ingenuity of this production lies in Blue Man's ability
to connect to a large audience and keep it participating in the
show. Electronic message boards with streaming messages warm things
up before the performance begins: ``OK, now everybody make that
noise they used to make on the Arsenio Hall show.'' Everybody does.
``OK,'' the sign says, ``that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   All three Blue Men periodically sprint up the theater aisles or
climb through the rows of spectators on chair arms and backs. Twice
they bring someone up onstage to join the antics; once they carry a
lighted tube over to a man on an aisle, open his mouth wide, shine
a light at his throat and project an entire endoscopy onto a
screen.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the performance the night I was there, when miles
of paper, oceans of sound and storms of flashing light rained down,
lots of people were on their feet dancing, waving, shouting. Rock
came to the Las Vegas tribe.
</P>
<P>
   If Blue Man seemed an unlikely choice for Las Vegas, it must be
pointed out that everything in Las Vegas is unlikely, and the city
has changed so much in recent years that it's unlikelier than ever.
Though even today there are some things that are as close to
eternal as a town built on roulette wheels could hope for: the
airport still has slot machines; the casinos still play a
repetitive, purling tinkle, kind of like Philip Glass on a
hurdy-gurdy but punctuated now and then by the chunk-chunk-chunk of
coins bouncing out of the slots.
</P>
<P>
   The cocktail waitresses in the casino still wear perilously
little and an ad for the ``Midnight Fantasy'' show pictures a pair
of bare legs in high-altitude heels and promises ``a place where
there is truth in the statement that less is more.'' But things
ain't what they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Vegas has become the very emblem of the contemporary,
computer-induced preference for the virtual over the real, the
special effect over the natural, fantasy and the fantastic over the
everyday. It has welded the lust for escape to the lust for sex and
money. The Strip is a new entity: the city as simulacrum, a global
fun house cum theme park, with the Eiffel Tower rising directly
across from a lagoon in Italy and Egypt connected by a walkway to
Mandalay.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of instant travel that was initiated by the railroad
and furthered by photography, film, the automobile and the airplane
is here translated into an amusement park, the current version of
the 19th-century world's fairs that brought Polynesian and African
villagers to the West and instructed them to act like Polynesians
and Africans for the edification of the paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Las Vegas obeys the basic rules of political correctness.
Only the monuments have been transported this time, and they have
been converted into giant toys, as if to say that everyone on the
premises is part of the game, and anyone can win.
</P>
<P>
   The city is a nutty mix of entertainments and intrusions, where
people scream on the roller coaster directly above a restaurant at
New York New York, and a taxi driver's radio proclaims Darwin
totally, scientifically wrong. It is the fastest-growing city in
the United States; almost 50,000 people move here every year. The
school system has a good reputation, the climate and prices are
right, the state has no income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas itself, of course, has become a major tourist
attraction; the Chamber of Commerce says there are 32 million
visitors a year. Chris Wink says: ``Las Vegas is like touring. The
tour comes to you every three and a half days, when the entire
population of Vegas changes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, 99 percent of visitors to Las Vegas came to
gamble, but by the mid-1990s only 87 percent did. Maybe they came
for the waters, but if so they were misinformed.
</P>
<P>
   They came for conventions _ 2,600 conventions in 1994, 3,800 in
1999 _ and for entertainment. Spending on entertainment, shopping
and dining rose more than twice as fast as gambling revenues
between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s. No wonder Spago, Chinois
and Le Cirque have opened branches. That's not chopped liver.
That's foie gras and lobster bisque for the new rich, the filthy
rich, the expense-account crowd and aging boomers with the mad, mad
urge to pay more than they have to.
</P>
<P>
   In the citadel of kitsch they can now get culture too, on
multiple levels, from a genuine Rubens to ersatz Michelangelos,
from the silicone breasts at the Folies-Bergere to Blue Man's
authentic plumbing pipes and marshmallow sculpture: the world's
greatest (and probably only) work of art crafted from marshmallows
lobbed from a distance into a Blue Man's mouth.

 &HT;    DEBATE GIVES MEXICAN OPPOSITION CANDIDATE BIG PUSH

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Vicente Fox, the cowboy-booted rancher who is
threatening to upset 71 years of one-party presidential rule in
Mexico, is relishing high poll marks and a burst of positive
publicity following a bitter presidential debate here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's performance appears to have at least consolidated his
position in a very close second to Francisco Labastida, candidate
of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The
race, which culminates in a July 2 election, is turning into the
most hotly contested presidential election in Mexico's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``After an exciting night and a caffeine-filled morning, it's
really hitting people today that Labastida might not win,'' said
Daniel Lund, who runs his own opinion survey company, MUND, here in
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   But the Labastida camp is downplaying an array of instant
opinion polls after the six-contender debate that declared Fox the
winner, often by a large margin. All polls, including some that
placed Labastida in first place, were conducted by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   And opinion surveys have shown in the recent past that Mexico's
rural communities and the less educated _ who are less likely to
have telephones _ remain a voting stronghold for Labastida and the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much can you trust polling that's done ... only among
people with telephones?'' said Sandra Fuentes-Berain, Labastida's
coordinator for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come out of the debate feeling like we're fighting the
media, too _ certain media,'' she said, declining to identify which
newspapers or broadcasters she was referring to.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's Reforma newspaper, which is often critical of the
government, conducted a telephone poll of 1,019 people in 190
cities and 105 smaller communities in all Mexican states after the
debate. It found that 44 percent of respondents thought Fox won the
debate. Twenty percent thought nobody won or didn't know, and only
14 percent thought Labastida won.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the percentage points were divided among the other
candidates, including just 7 percent for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the
center-left Democratic Revolution Party, who polls show trailing in
third behind Labastida and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Another major Mexico City daily newspaper, El Universal, and
some radio surveys also declared Fox the debate winner. Excelsior,
which is considered generally pro-government, published a poll it
had commissioned that showed Labastida the winner over Fox with 40
to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's campaign officials were ecstatic, however, with the
results in general.
</P>
<P>
   Press aide Gina Morris said the Fox campaign agrees that the
instant telephone polls conducted Tuesday night are not reliable
indicators of popularity when it comes to Mexico's countryside and
urban poor, who often don't have phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are conscious of that,'' Morris said. But for months, she
said, Fox _ a former governor of largely rural Guanajuato state _
has been trying to make inroads into parts of rural Mexico where
sympathy for him has not been strong.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Fox appealed to all Mexicans _ and even the
four rivals also competing against Labastida _ to join him in his
fight to win the presidency and build a ``pluralistic''
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Fox belongs to the conservative National Action Party, or PAN,
but one of his challenges is to convince the poor who don't like
the PAN and more liberal voters to make their votes count by
choosing him.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Mexican voter says she's buying the line Fox pushed
during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for young people to fight for a better country,''
said Jimena Ramirez, 18, a psychology student at Mexico's National
Autonomous University. ``Maybe Fox isn't the best option, but right
now he's the closest thing we have to one.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, who also looked pleased and claimed triumph after the
debate, told a Mexico City radio station that his campaign would be
conducting polls over the next week to come up with figures it
believes are more reliable than the instant surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Lund agreed with the notion that to measure widespread
public opinion, more in-depth surveys would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Because the debate wasn't broadcast on television channels that
attract the biggest audiences, ``basically, rural Mexico didn't see
this debate,'' Lund said.
</P>
<P>
   However, as much as 30 percent of the vote-rich urban zone of
the Valley of Mexico may have either seen or heard the debate,
according to preliminary internal estimates by INDEMERC, a Mexican
affiliate of the U.S.-based Louis Harris polling company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox beat them all,'' said INDEMERC director Vicente Licona.
``The debate gave him a tremendous push.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a computer game in which you follow all the rules, but
your characters still die, because someone has introduced a virus
into the game. Not only that, but the person who invented the game
is the one who is distributing the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly that is happening with Sims, the most recent creation of
Will Wright, the Sim City game designer. When Sims was introduced
earlier this year it immediately became a best seller. Wright's
earlier games had focused on planning cities and then watching them
come to life _ and frequently run amok.
</P>
<P>
   Sims operates on another scale. It zooms in on the people,
allowing players to create individual characters, build families,
furnish their homes and watch over a dollhouselike suburban world
on a PC. Only this time Wright, who co-founded the design company
Maxis, secretly decided to push the interactivity and realism of
the game one step further. Soon after the game was released, the
Sims Web site began offering components intended to enhance the
homes of Sims. Party balloons, plants, a pet guinea pig, a moose
head to hang on the wall, a cuckoo clock, wall lights and slot
machines could all be added to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Each item was, of course, a small software program specifying
how the object would fit into a living room or den and how it would
respond to the actions of game characters. None of this was
unusual. But what the players who downloaded these objects did not
know was that many of them were also Trojan horses. Wright had
quietly decided to introduce a little trouble into paradise.
</P>
<P>
   It took only weeks before Sims players discovered that the pet
guinea pig was carrying a potentially fatal virus that could kill a
human character in the game. In the world of the game the disease
spread from one species to another, and once loose in the human
Sims population, the virus could also infect other characters. But
in the underlying software code, the guinea pig was itself a
computer virus, a small, hidden program that surreptitiously
affected the game play. Wright was playing games with his game,
with the players and with the whole idea of a virus.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Sims bulletin board was full of lively debate over the
secret code. Some players agonized over the loss of game characters
that they had spent dozens of hours developing. The characters had
taken on the qualities of pets, and their creators reacted with
outrage and confusion to the plague.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the guinea pig is still causing confusion among some
players. As recently as last week a player who identified himself
as Malc wrote in a posting on the Web site: ``My Sims keep getting
a cold and dying. Has someone done something to my game or is this
possible? Can anyone help? Is there a way to cure them?''
</P>
<P>
   Others defended Wright in his decision to add secret features to
a game. ``Why some people are making such a big fuss about it is
beyond me,'' a player wrote. ``I had a family of eight who all came
down with this thing, and through common sense game playing they
all survived quite well and only one even missed a day of work.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone interview, Wright acknowledged that the
virus ``threw a lot of people for a loop. But then most of them got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like almost everything in the game, the guinea pig's function as
a disease vector was carefully simulated, Wright said. For example,
the guinea pig only spreads the disease if a Sims player neglects
to clean its cage, and only if a player reaches into the cage to
pet the software animal and is bitten will he get sick. Someone who
has gotten sick sneezes and coughs and will infect other human
characters in the game who come within several ``tiles'' distance.
</P>
<P>
   Death is not inevitable, Wright noted. A sick character will
return to health if given sufficient rest. Ignore the illness,
however, and your Sims family is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   PC game players seem to love the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great example of exactly how bizarre and wide-ranging
the ideas that are built into this game are,'' said Rob Smith,
editor in chief of PC Gamer, a computer gaming magazine. ``People
have yet to discover many of them. It's really quite amazing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wright acknowledges that there are other hidden features
awaiting Sims players. For example, the antlers on the moose are
supposed to serve as a global happiness meter, he said. The worse
the family situation in a player's home is, the more the antlers
will droop. There is also a way to hack the slot machine to get it
to produce free money to use in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no easy possibility that the guinea pig virus
will escape from Sims and cause havoc in the Internet world, the
specter of software viruses in the future of computer gaming is
real, Smith said. ``When they introduce a future multiplayer
version of Sims, it will create an interesting social dynamic,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a computer virus that is also a real virus appeared
in the 1992 science fiction novel ``Snow Crash,'' by Neal
Stephenson. Except that in the novel, real human beings in
old-fashioned real life die. ``Snow Crash'' was set in a world in
which an interconnected virtual reality is called the
``metaverse,'' and the virus could spread in that world, as
software, or in life as a real virus.
</P>
<P>
   Other science fiction, like John Brunner's 1975 novel
``Shockwave Rider,'' explore the consequences of software viruses,
and a virus in a computer context appears in David Gerrold's novel
``When Harley Was One'' (1972).
</P>
<P>
   And there have been other viruses in computer games. In 1984 a
virus appeared in Core Wars, an early game in which users created
programs that did battle in the memory of a computer, said Fred
Cohen, a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories who wrote early
computer viruses when he was a graduate student at UCLA. The
viruses Cohen wrote then were strictly experimental, done as a
research project and as a warning. Cohen discussed protection
against viruses in his research paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computing world is getting closer to the biological world
in every way,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of viruses and similar programs, known as worms,
into the multiplayer gaming world of the Internet appears
inevitable. (A worm is similar to a virus but is self-propelled
rather than moving by attaching itself to a host program.) Worms
preceded the virus work by a number of years. The first worm was
designed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although version 2.0 of Sims is still in development, Wright
acknowledged that it is almost certain to bring with it such a
brave new world.
</P>
<P>
   The program is intended to be modifiable, and at some point
Maxis, now a division of Electronic Arts, plans to make the
language it has created, known as Edith, available to the players.
Edith is designed to permit anyone with minimal programming skills
to extend the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he realized that such a language in the hands of
antisocial game players would create vexing problems.
``Hopefully,'' he said, ``they will be balanced by people doing
more creative things.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, gamers may have been forced to confront the
same challenges that face e-mail users whose computers are
frequently attacked by hostile programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it would be hard to convince a prosecutor to attempt
to convict someone for such a program, but that may change,'' said
Mark Rasch, a former assistant U.S. attorney who successfully
prosecuted a Cornell graduate student for releasing the first
Internet worm in 1989. ``These things become more important as
online gaming proliferates. With online gambling it will become
even more problematic.''

   But the network's big coup was Diane Sawyer's ``Good Morning
America'' interview with the boy, his 21-year-old cousin
Marisleysis and psychiatrist Gunther Perdigao. The interview ran
March 27 and 28 and was recapped March 29.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer, the experienced newswoman, elicits responses such as
``Hello. Hello'' and ``No'' from Elian, and tells us Elian scolded
her when she touched his teacher's paper flowers. This must be what
they mean by ``Must-see TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Marisleysis, who was interpreting, Elian talks about the
sinking of the boat _ occupied also by his mom and her boyfriend _
the dolphins that he said kept him afloat for two days, and the
prayer he said to his guardian angel.
</P>
<P>
   The most spirited (and often confusing) debate, however, has
been held the past two Sundays, on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, argued over whether there
was a search warrant and whether Saturday's predawn raid/seizure
was legal; DeLay promised congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, there was a search warrant (DeLay says there
wasn't), because it was shown on CNN on Monday. DeLay sounded at
times as if he were inspired more by a political agenda than the
seizure of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The previous week might have been more confrontational. Jose
Garcia-Pedrosa, one of the Miami family's many attorneys, said
there was ``ample evidence'' that Juan Miguel Gonzalez had a
``violent temperament'' and beat Elian and his mother. He stopped
just short of accusing Gonzalez of sexual molestation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Serrano, D-New York, fired back by asking why the
family has gone from characterizing him as ``a great father who
should stay in this country to a father who beats his child and
sexual molestation.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the conspiracy theory angle to be
introduced. It started when the photos of Elian with his father
were released by the U.S. government. The photos, Elian's Miami
relatives said, were doctored. This seemingly desperate theory,
floated most hysterically on Sunday by Marisleysis, contends that
the boy's hair is longer in the reunion photos than when he was
with the family in Little Havana less than 48 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Florida, said the
government was drugging and brainwashing the boy, based on seeing a
Band-Aid on the child in the reunion photos.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, a quick perusal of Internet search engine Yahoo
finds at least seven Web sites devoted to the controversy, fairly
evenly divided between he-should-stay and he-should-go.
</P>
<P>
   Web site www.pathtofreedom.com features two essays _ ``A Kick in
the Rear'' and ``A Pie in the Face'' _ and a poem called ``Soul
Wrecked'' by Jules Dervaes. It also runs a ``days in captivity''
tally and the phone and fax numbers of Reno, President Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and others for those wishing to express
their outrage that the boy is not already back in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   One opposing view is the bilingual libertyforelian.org site,
featuring photos and a pre-recorded e-mail message to Clinton and
the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Web site thesmokinggun.com contains official documents
pertaining to the case. The name ``Gonzalez'' has been mentioned in
10,913 Web pages found on Yahoo, mostly in reprints of newspaper
articles and/or photos.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, we can only say, in the unforgettable words of
boxer Roberto Duran, no mas.

IT'S ALL ELIAN, ALL THE TIME. STOP, POR FAVOR!

<TEXT>
<P>
   Of COURSE we want the world's most famous 6-year-old to be safe
and happy.
</P>
<P>
   Of COURSE we wish only the best for Elian Gonzalez and his cute
little puppy.
</P>
<P>
   Of COURSE. We may be reporters, but we're not heartless.
</P>
<P>
   But E-NOUGH already. We've had our fill of the saga of Elian
Gonzalez, and we suspect that many other Americans have, too.
</P>
<P>
   After a soap-opera-like five months, highlighted by the armed
federal raid last weekend _ ordered by Attorney General Janet Reno
_ that spirited the boy from the home of his Miami relatives and
reunited him with his father, the saga of the child/political
football has long since reached saturation point.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at how the print, broadcast and electronic
news media have covered All Things Elian:
</P>
<P>
   Print coverage has been led, as you might expect, by ``The Miami
Herald,'' which has printed 92 stories and dozens of court records
just in one week (April 17 to 24).
</P>
<P>
   The big days were Saturday (22 stories) and Sunday (23 stories).
The paper's coverage was so extensive that it included coverage of
reporters covering the events _ lowlighted by an ugly incident
involving a ``New York Post'' reporter accused of stabbing a local
cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herald'' columnist/novelist Carl Hiassen has written the most
incisive columns on the issue. Hiassen's clear tone has cut to the
core of several aspects of the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the same seven-day period, ``The New York Times'' did 32
stories, put the story on the front page five times, and did seven
columns or editorials; the ``New York Post'' printed 31 stories,
devoted Page One space to the story three times, and ran nine
columns; and the ``Star-Telegram'' ran 18 stories and had the story
on Page One three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time'' has put Elian on its cover three times, the latest
being this week's `` `Papa!,' '' which contained three stories. The
Jan. 17 headline was ``Where Does He Belong?'' and the April 17
cover story looked at ``Elian and His Dad.'' The magazine has run
38 stories, columns and info boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newsweek'' has been a bit less Elian-mad: He's made the cover
twice _ this week's ``Seizing Elian'' and April 17's ``Elian's
Ordeal'' _ and has been mentioned in stories 24 times.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not funny, the Elian saga has certainly inspired a
bevy of quips from the likes of David Letterman, Jay Leno and Conan
O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's April 6 Top Ten list was ``Top Ten Things Elian
Gonzalez's Dad Said His First Day in the United States.'' That was
funny, but Monday night's ``Top Ten Janet Reno Pet Peeves'' was
better:
</P>
<P>
   10. Having to brush up on Spanish just to read hate mail.
</P>
<P>
   9. Armed troops plus civilian resistance equals paperwork,
paperwork, paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   8. In the Elian TV movie, she'll probably be played by John
Lithgow.
</P>
<P>
   7. When she gets angry, she turns green and muscles burst
through clothes just dry-cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   6. No one believes, ``It was a chocolate gun pointed at Elian's
head.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Whenever she calls ``Playboy'' and offers to pose, Hefner's
``in a meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Saying, ``It's the tear gas'' when crying at ``Erin
Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   3. When Lenscrafters runs out of gigantic, outdated, poorly
fitted frames.
</P>
<P>
   2. Men who feel inadequate when she brings battering ram into
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   1. Constant political pressure to reunite Hall and Oates.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Leno, meanwhile, mentions Elian just about every night _ and
definitely on nights when there's been a significant development.
He has also done two skits involving the story: In one, he created
a fictitious program called ``Tonightline'' and played Ted Koppel,
interviewing actors looking like Reno and Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, and the boy's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
Gilbert Gottfried played Elian. In another, a spoof of the new
movie ``U-571,'' he played Bill Paxton's character; looking through
the periscope, he saw Elian on a raft. He also referred to Reno's
warning to the Miami relatives as ``Livin' La Vida Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   But the funniest stuff may be Michael Moore's open
letter/apology to Elian, which he posted on his site
(michaelmoore.com) March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please forgive me for writing to you in English,'' the letter
begins. ``Three semesters of Spanish, and I can't remember a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes on to criticize the Miami relatives and America's
foreign policy toward Cuba. A few choice moments:
</P>
<P>
   ``You are with a `great-uncle' and a `second cousin.' It's not
that they aren't blood-related but, let's face it, in our country
they and the third cousins-once removed are usually not sitting at
the Thanksgiving table and are only rarely heard from, when they
need bail money or part of the inheritance.''
</P>
<P>
   And:
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst that could be said is that, in Cuba, you were in
jeopardy of receiving free health care whenever you needed it, an
excellent education in one of the few countries that has 100
percent literacy, and a better chance of your baby brother being
born and making it to his first birthday than if he had been born
in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore ends his letter by hoping that Elian can come back to
America by the time he's 18 _ the Detroit Tigers, he notes, ``will
still be in desperate need of some good pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   TV coverage has been extensive, and nowhere more than at ABC's
``Nightline,'' which has done six segments on Elian since April 6,
the most recent being Monday night's Ted Koppel/Janet Reno
interview. Previous segments this month were run April 6, 7, 12, 13
and 19. MORE &QL;

FILLING THE STAGE WITH HER INVENTIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C.)   By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes the choreographer Trisha Brown likes to
dance an answer to a question.
</P>
<P>
   Looking elegant in a long, simple black dress on a late March
weekend, she rises to her feet to show how close her dancers come
to one another in ``Five Part Weather Invention,'' the first
section of a new three-part collaboration with the jazz composer
Dave Douglas, the visual artist Terry Winters and the lighting
designer Jennifer Tipton.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly she raises her arms above her head and then draws them
down close to her face as she gives her demonstration in a small
space between the rustic wooden table in the kitchen of her SoHo
loft and the sparsely furnished living area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get as close as weather,'' she says, her tall willowy
body curving like Saharan dunes. ``That's why the name.'' Even
though Douglas' score is not playing, its joyful spirit permeates
her movements.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room on the windowsill a couple of leafy plants soak
up the midday sun. The only other color comes from two yellow
captain's chairs and a clear glass vase full of bright orange
anemones, although a big, green porcelain ring gleams on Brown's
left hand.
</P>
<P>
   It's an appropriate setting for the 63-year-old choreographer,
whose finely structured dances unexpectedly overflow with life. Her
impromptu dance finished, she sits down to nibble on a croissant
and pour herself a cup of Georgian tea, a gift from her 35-year-old
son, Adam. He and her husband, the video artist Burt Barr, have
gone to the family's house in the Hamptons, leaving her to work.
</P>
<P>
   Both this piece and ``Rapture to Leon James,'' the second part,
will have their New York premieres when her 12-member troupe
celebrates its 30th anniversary with a two-week engagement at the
Joyce Theater, beginning on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the complete trilogy will be presented at the American
Dance Festival in North Carolina, which commissioned ``Rapture''
and the last untitled section. The first week at the Joyce, ``Five
Part Weather Invention'' will be accompanied by a recording, and
the following week Douglas and his Charms of the Night Sky ensemble
will play for ``Rapture.''
</P>
<P>
   The program also features three solos performed by Brown, a new
piece for the company and a film by Jonathan Demme. At the
company's gala on May 14, Mikhail Baryshnikov will dance her new
version of ``Homemade'' (1965).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hell bent right now,'' Brown says. ``The learning curve is
stretched so tight it's twanging. I'm discovering, questioning,
looking for solutions. I want to get out as much work as
possible.'' She smiles broadly and remarks, almost as an aside,
that she has changed. ``It's not surprising,'' she says. ``After
all, I've been a wife, a mother, a dancer, a choreographer, a
citizen in a radically changing world. I'm in my seventh decade.
Over time one gets rewritten by experience _ by loss, by death, by
accidents. All these things have made me think a lot about emotion,
about the shape of emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been Brown's gift over the years to incorporate a myriad
of influences without ever losing her striking identity.
Surprisingly, she did have a few old-fashioned dance moments
growing up in Aberdeen, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she take classes in tap and ballet, but she and her
older brother, Gordon, also acted out Broadway routines, imitating
the famous hoofers Marge and Gower Champion in the privacy of their
home. ``He owed me,'' she says. ``I played football with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after graduating from Mills College in Oakland, Calif.,
in 1958, she arrived in New York and wholeheartedly joined the
revolutionary Judson Dance Theater group. Setting out to do nothing
less than expand the dance vocabulary, she chose Merce Cunningham,
Robert Dunn and Louis Horst as her guides. ``I'd decided as a
child,'' she says, ``that I wanted to make a mark.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process of exploring the relationships between movement,
space and sound, she invented dances from simple skips, jumps and
runs and set some of them on roofs and floating rafts. In
``Equipment Pieces'' in the late '60s, she juxtaposed natural
movement with mechanical equipment; she based ``Accumulations'' in
the '70s on mathematical systems.
</P>
<P>
   In time, she produced larger theatrical works, combining forces
with the artists Robert Rauschenberg and Donald Judd and the
composers John Cage and Laurie Anderson. New York's downtown art
scene was flourishing and she thrived on it. While several years
passed before she gained substantial audience and financial
support, both grew in the '80s and in 1991 she became the first
female choreographer to win a MacArthur Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   Totally committed to experimentation and to dancing only in
silence or to soundscapes, Brown startled her fans five years ago
by beginning to choreograph to classical music, opera and jazz.
``Choreographing to music is something expected in the dance
world,'' she says. ``I had to try it and see if I could keep music
from dominating my choreography _ one reason I never had used it.
Music is so authoritarian.'' She had gotten a taste for working
with a score when she choreographed and danced in Lina Wertmuller's
production of the opera ``Carmen'' in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Although her goal was to return to opera, she approached it
indirectly through the music of Bach and Webern. For the first
time, she studied a polyphonic score. The pleasing result was
``M.O.,'' set to Bach's ``Musical Offering'' (1995). ``I discovered
dance could throw light into music,'' she says, ``and cause you to
hear it differently, and I saw that dance becomes illuminated in
the process.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she choreographed ``Twelve-Ton Rose,'' to Webern's
Opuses 5 and 28, described by Jennifer Dunning in The New York
Times as filled ``with mystery and beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally got her chance at opera when the Theatre Royal de la
Monnaie in Brussels invited her to direct and choreograph
Monteverdi's ``Orfeo,'' considered the first important opera in
Western music. With this work, she came to terms with narrative and
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``To develop the characters emotionally,'' she says, ``I had to
delve into my own emotional experiences. At first, I wasn't sure I
could.'' A critical success at its premiere in May 1998 in
Brussels, ``Orfeo'' had its American premiere at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music in June. ``Canto/Pianto,'' a series of formal
dances drawn from the production, will have its New York premiere
at the Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, she will direct the contemporary opera ``Luci Mie
Traditrici'' (``My Betraying Eyes'') by Salvatore Sciarrino at the
Monnaie. It comes to the Lincoln Center Festival next summer.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the influence classical music has recently had on
Brown, nothing matches the effect of African-American social dance.
More than anything, it has prompted her to be much more
transparently emotional. She speaks with awe of Leon James, a famed
dancer at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom in the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was dancing in a line with five or six other men,'' she
says, describing a film she saw three years ago, ``clearly the
leader, clearly doing African-based movement, performing a cagey,
rhythmical pattern with his hands and feet, and surveying the line,
with the biggest smile. He was the picture of ecstasy. How he
looked is why I dance.'' ``Rapture to Leon James'' had its premiere
at the Kennedy Center in Washington in February.
</P>
<P>
   Although James inspired Brown's entire jazz trilogy, she did not
begin it with her tribute to him but with ``Five Part Weather
Invention,'' which was commissioned by the Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival in Massachusetts and was first seen there last summer.
Douglas' music provided a perfect complement to her ideas for the
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trisha has a deep understanding of the music,'' he says,
``perhaps deeper than I have. I'd write a section thinking I was
giving her something specific and she'd come up with something very
different. She opens up the music in ways I couldn't have
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz encouraged Brown's natural style of movement. ``Isolated
gestures and undulating spine are my cup of tea,'' she says. ``We
boogie.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown often starts a piece by showing her dancers drawings of
what she wants. But with ``Five Part Weather Invention,'' she began
by asking Kathleen Fisher, a longtime company member, to put
together scraps of movement. Giving her dancers tasks to perform is
one of her basic working methods. ``Kathleen just took off, mixing
them up in such amazingly beautiful ways,'' she says, exclaiming,
``She's a Cuisinart, a veritable Cuisinart.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher had no idea she had succeeded. ``I do it differently
every time,'' she says, ``because every time I respond differently
to the musicians and to the set. Terry's drawings inspire me to
invent all kinds of gestures,'' she adds, speaking of the set
designs by Winters. Fisher sees the new freedom Brown gives her
dancers as a broadening of her expression. ``But Trisha will never
be literal,'' she says. ``When you're abstract, there's a lot more
room for metaphor and a much better chance of being universal.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Brown is after. ``I would hope my choreographies are
perfectly constructed and filled with life,'' she says, ``and
people would see in them models for their own lives.'' Suddenly
self-conscious after this declaration, she quickly switches the
conversation to how much longer she'll perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forever,'' she laughs, ``like Merce. He's the man.''

   George W. Bush's first fund-raising effort for the Republican
Party will collect a record $18 million at a black-tie gala
Wednesday night in Washington boasting a guest list that reads like
a Who's Who of interests with business before the government. AT&AMP;T,
the NRA and tobacco giant Philip Morris are just a few of the
companies and groups that will wine and dine with Bush and GOP
lawmakers. In all, 38 companies or individuals raised or donated at
least a quarter-million dollars for the Republican National
Committee, and an additional 16 shelled out at least $100,000,
according to a donor list obtained by The Associated Press. One
co-chairman, who raised or contributed at least $250,000, is
Kenneth Lay, head of the Texas-based energy giant Enron Corp. The
previous record for a political party in a single night was $14
million last year when Bush's father, the former president,
headlined the same event.
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE STATESMANSHIP FOR AN APPETIZER
</P>
<P>
   Before attending Wednesday night's GOP gala affair, George W.
Bush, whose foreign policy credentials have been questioned by
critics, met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, in
Washington to see President Clinton and other U.S. officials. Bush
and Ivanov talked of peace and progress though still disagreeing
over U.S. proposals to build a national missile defense system.
Bush and his wife, Laura, were also the keynote speakers on a
midday panel at a conference of Republican women leaders. In
addition, Bush met Wednesday with Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) to
discuss Social Security policy, a session advisers hoped would
highlight the Texas governor's pledge to bring a bipartisan spirit
to Washington. Cox News Service's Jena Heath and Ken Herman report
that Bush's speech Wednesday night will have an end-the-gridlock
message centering on ``changing the tone in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   GUNNING FOR GLORY
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, who runs the National Rifle Association, will
have a seat at the big spenders' table by virtue of his
organization's $250,000 pledge, The New York Times reports. In
fund-raising letters to its membership, the NRA has touted George
W. Bush's support of concealed-gun laws, asking members to
encourage him ``to continue his strong stance in favor of your
Second Amendment rights.'' The NRA also has switched from
hard-money donations to candidates to a ``soft money'' strategy,
the Times said, giving $540,000 to Republican Party election
committees this year. Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said
his boss couldn't be happier than to be an NRA-backed candidate.
</P>
<P>
   HE'S NOT A REAL DOCTOR, BUT HE GOES TO DRUGSTORES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore campaigned for increased government health care help for
the elderly Wednesday, standing with a 65-year-old woman and her
monthly supply of drugs at a pharmacy in East Hartford, Conn.
Shirley Kindle of Ansonia accompanied Gore to Pelton's drugstore
earlier for what he called ``an illustration'' for invited news
cameras: pharmacist Hal Schoen lining up on the counter Kindle's 12
different prescriptions and ringing up the total to $506.34. Kindle
told Gore the amount was ``more than I get from Social Security.''
She said her husband made a little too much money to qualify for
government assistance, at which point Gore chimed in: ``She was
advised if they got divorced she'd be eligible for some low-income
assistance, but she said after 35 years she's really not ready to
give him up.''
</P>
<P>
   MILKING THE UPSTATE FARM VOTE
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that farmers should be
given more breaks on estate taxes so businesses can be kept in the
family. Visiting a century-old dairy farm in Sheldon, N.Y., near
Buffalo, she said the exemption on family farms and family-owned
businesses should be raised to $1.75 million, up from the current
$600,000. (That figure is scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006.)
As some of the farm's 289 cows mooed in the background, the Senate
candidate said she would work to lower utility and labor costs, and
other taxes that make farming difficult in New York.
</P>
<P>
   HEY, GUYS, THAT WASN'T INTENDED FOR YOU
</P>
<P>
   New York Senate candidate Rudy Giuliani said he wouldn't
apologize for characterizing the federal agents who seized Elian
Gonzalez as ``storm troopers,'' adding that it was ``an appropriate
criticism'' directed not at the agents but at President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno. ``I'm not going to back down from
it,'' Giuliani said at Shea Stadium. ``I've been involved in law
enforcement for a very long time. I've never seen a situation in
which a 6-year-old was removed in that way.'' But Giuliani took
care to say that the term ``was not intended as a criticism of the
particular law enforcement officers carrying out the mission.''
Earlier, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a
nonpartisan group representing 17,500 federal agents and officers,
expressed ``strong disgust and dismay'' with the labeling of the
officers as storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   RUDY RUNNING WELL UPSTATE
</P>
<P>
   A new poll conducted by Zogby International for Colgate
University shows that Rudy Giuliani ``appears on his way to
controlling the upstate vote in his bid for the U.S. Senate,'' the
Washington Times reported. The poll, with a margin of error of 3.2
percentage points, shows Giuliani leading Hillary Clinton by 14.
Fifty-two percent of those polled said they would vote for
Giuliani, although Clinton has a slight lead in the state's
cities.``Giuliani is right where he needs to be right now,'' Zogby
said. ``But Hillary is campaigning vigorously in those cities,
where 40 percent of the vote is.''
</P>
<P>
   THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GENDER GAP
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has seen George W. Bush cut into the Democrats'
traditional support among female voters, but Gore also finds
himself distantly trailing Bush among men _ a situation that has
gotten less attention but presents a fundamental hurdle in White
House bid. In the latest USA Today-CNN-Gallup Poll, Gore and Bush
split the female vote evenly, but Bush led among men by 17 points _
and among white men by 26 points: 59 percent to 33 percent. USA
Today reported that independent pollsters calculate that Gore, to
win in November, must cut that gap among white men in half. Even
though he would still trail among men, he could win if he built an
advantage among white women and generated strong turnout among
African-Americans, the Democratic Party's most loyal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   TRYING TO CHANGE THE CONGRESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to make the environment a bigger political issue, the
Sierra Club began an $8 million TV and radio campaign aimed at five
Senate and 12 House races. The ads will be combined with other
activities, including voter guides and fliers at community events,
as the group attempts to elect a more pro-environment Congress. The
ads attack the environmental records of six Republican candidates
and praise those of 10 Democrats. Only one Republican, Rep.
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, is singled out for praise. Since
1996, Cox's Ken Foskett reports, the Sierra Club has become one of
the most aggressive and effective practitioners of unregulated
issue advertising in political campaigns.

   BUSH ATTACK, TIMES TWO
</P>
<P>
   An early Al Gore counterpunch to the George W. Bush compassion
campaign will be to remind voters of the deficits rung up under the
last Republican administration, according to The New York Times.
Gore said that eliminating the national debt by 2013 is a top
priority and warned Americans against the debtor days of Ronald
Reagan and George H.W. Bush, W's father. ``This is a test of our
memory,'' Gore was quoted as saying. ``Have we forgotten the
dangers of irresponsibility? Have we forgotten the virtues of
responsibility?''

<P>
   BRING ON THE `CYBER DEBATES'
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of a new nonpartisan political Web site hope it will be
the host for daily ``cyber debates'' between the presidential
campaigns this fall. The Markle Foundation is joining with 16
Internet traffic centers to produce Web White &AMP; Blue 2000, which
will also have links to political news and information furnished by
the participants. They include Internet giants America Online,
Microsoft and Yahoo!, major TV networks and some of the nation's
largest newspapers. ``The Web White &AMP; Blue 2000 sites will be a
collective resource for voters, for journalists and for those
citizens who usually sit on the sidelines,'' said Zoe Baird,
president of the foundation. The daily debates are scheduled to
begin in October at www.webwhiteblue.org

   BLACK FAVORITE IN THE BLUEGRASS
</P>
<P>
   A Louisville lawyer dropped his primary campaign against a woman
vying to become Kentucky's first black member of Congress. Ched
Jennings said he couldn't keep up with state Rep. Eleanor Jordan in
raising money. Jordan pulled ahead after getting endorsements from
Gov. Paul Patton, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
and some key labor groups. Jordan, the only African-American woman
in the Kentucky General Assembly, now has only minor opposition for
the May 23 Democratic primary. The Louisville-area district is
almost one-fifth black. Jordan is trying to unseat two-term
Republican Rep. Anne Northup. Republicans hold five of the state's
six congressional seats.

   HILLARY GET YOUR GUN
</P>
<P>
   Chicago police have recovered a gun stolen from a Secret Service
agent assigned to protect Hillary Rodham Clinton last October. The
gun ``allegedly landed in the hands of a heroin addict who has been
arrested 33 times,'' according to the Chicago Sun-Times. The agent,
Mary Drury, was sitting at the bar in Chicago's Fairmont hotel when
the weapon was taken from her purse. The Sun-Times said the Secret
Service would not say whether Drury was drinking at the time: Drury
was ``protecting the first lady at the Fairmont that day, but, for
security reasons, officials declined to say whether Clinton had a
room there.''
</P>
<P>
   DOUBTS ABOUT HILLARY'S DONORS
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani, in the wake of an Albany Times Union report
showing that Hillary Rodham Clinton has a higher rate of in-state
donations, has accused Clinton of concealing her ``soft money''
donors. Giuliani spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum said Clinton is hiding
unsavory givers by shifting money from her campaign accounts to
Democratic Party accounts that accept soft money. ``They hide it in
this committee and then they transfer it,'' Teitelbaum said. ``This
is classic Clintonian mathematics.'' The Times Union said its
analysis of contributions covered hard money, and did not examine
the soft-money donations to either Clinton or Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL CROWDS FOR BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign swing through Baton Rouge, La., that drew a total
of about 100 listeners at two events, Pat Buchanan talked about
trade with China, illegal immigration and the Elian Gonzalez
matter. On the Elian matter: ``It's a sad day in America when a
little boy whose mother dies trying to bring him to freedom in the
United States is picked up at gunpoint to bring him back to Fidel
Castro.'' The Baton Rouge Advocate reported that when asked if his
third-party bid would ``hand the White House to Gore,'' Buchanan
said, ``Conservatism is more than Clinton-bashing. People come up
to me and say, `You don't want Gore (to win), do you?' But no one
comes up to me talking about how excited they are about the dawn of
the George W. era.''

<P>
   HIGH-PRIORITY DISTRICT IN INDIANA
</P>
<P>
   An Indiana congressional seat that was held by the Democrats for
20 years before going into the GOP column with Newt Gingrich's
Republican Revolution six years ago is up for grabs in a wide-open,
11-candidate primary. By November, both parties could spend $2
million on the House seat, now held by conservative third-term Rep.
David McIntosh, who's stepping down to run for governor. Six
Republicans and five Democrats are vying for their parties'
nomination May 2. The GOP front-runners are former radio host Mike
Pence, who has strong name recognition, and state Rep. Jeff Linder,
who leads in fund-raising _ more than $291,000 as of March 31.
Indiana Democratic Party spokesman Doug Davidoff said there's no
clear front-runner in his party.
</P>
<P>
   HARD NUMBERS ON SOFT MONEY
</P>
<P>
   The raising of lightly regulated campaign ``soft money''
campaign money picked up speed in the first quarter of 2000 for
Democrats and Republicans. From Jan. 1 to March 31, Democrats
raised $26.7 million in soft money donations and Republicans took
in $27 million. In all of 1999, the Democrats raised $49.4 million
in soft dollars and the Republicans raised $57.8 million. In the
first quarter of 2000, 104 donors gave more than $100,000,
according to Public Disclosure, a Washington firm that tracks
donations, and 21 gave more than $250,000.

FORGET THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES: ATTACK BOOKS GO WAY BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He was excessively lustful. His constant sexual intercourse he
called bed-wrestling, as if it were a kind of exercise.'' Yet
another fresh cut about the president? No, this was from Suetonius'
biography of the Roman emperor Domitian, published circa A.D. 100.
It apparently sold pretty well then, and it's still in print. It
bashed the guy. Beating up on the subject works; it did then, and
it does now.
</P>
<P>
   Such books are more or less publishing's equivalent of negative
campaign ads; and while publishers say they don't like them (just
as candidates claim to dislike negative campaigning), they keep
buying them and publishing them. There's another similarity with
the ads. For these books to succeed, there has to be a large,
militant anti-constituency for which there is nothing so
extravagant that can be said about the politician they hate or
disdain that the writer's words wouldn't be gobbled up like salted
peanuts. (Yes, Jefferson and Lincoln were relentlessly attacked in
newspapers, but a quick check failed to uncover contemporary books
that went after them.)
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there were an awful lot of Romans who didn't like
Domitian. And Plutarch's great biographies were richly anecdotal,
but his accounts were not always known for their accuracy. So the
attack book has a lusty tradition. Therefore it is hardly
surprising that two such books in that formula, one by an
intoxicant from the right and another by a reveler from the left,
are selling well. Indeed, Peggy Noonan's ``Case Against Hillary
Clinton'' (ReganBooks/HarperCollins), a polemic, will be No. 4 on
The New York Times' best-seller list on May 4. And ``Shrub: The
Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush'' (Random House)
by Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose will remain on The Times' extended
list.
</P>
<P>
   For those publishers who cannot resist political-celebrity
books, little is more lamented than the paying of a goodly advance
for a book because of the prominence of the subject (e.g., a
politician constantly in the news) and then having that book fail
in the marketplace. With few notable exceptions that's what happens
and nearly always has. In this genre, John McCain's ``Faith of My
Fathers'' (Random House), Bill Bradley's ``Values of the Game''
(Artisan) and others that became best sellers were aberrant.
</P>
<P>
   Within the genre, if it can actually be called that, there seems
to be a bottomless pit for anti-Clinton books, despite the success
of Jeffrey Toobin's opposite tack in ``A Vast Conspiracy'' (Random
House). Thus it follows that with the retirement of President
Clinton, the election of Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Senate would
appear to be pretty nearly essential to the economic well-being of
book publishing.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at last count there were more than three dozen
books about Clinton in print, and more are on the way. Even a
psychoanalytic examination of the first lady, ``Hillary's Choice''
(Random House) by Gail Sheehy, had a brief buzz with her startling
conclusion that Clinton was addicted to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   John Sterling, president and publisher of Henry Holt, said,
``The secret is to identify the constituency and throw them some
red meat, and if you do that there's a good chance you'll sell a
lot of books.'' He added: ``It seems to be that if you really hate
the politician, you buy the books to get all riled up; it's a great
feeling to get all riled up. Just like the media finds stories for
people who want to get angry. It's a matter of identifying your
book buyers for the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling said that for years the conventional wisdom had been
that political attack books worked only for readers who were
politically conservative _ this started with ``The Way Things Ought
to Be'' by Rush Limbaugh (Pocket Books, 1993) _ ``but now you have
Molly Ivins' book selling well to people who have very strong
feelings about the presumptive Republican nominee.'' Sterling
hasn't published what he calls ``the red meat'' political book but
did publish Al Gore's best-selling ``Earth in the Balance'' at
Houghton Mifflin in 1992, which is being reissued. ``A lot of books
succeed because they have a strong ideological point of view,'' he
said, ``but I don't know if we can put out an endless number in the
genre and succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hirshey, executive editor at Harper/Collins, said he was
going to test whether ``red meat'' is indeed the necessary
ingredient for success in a political book. He is publishing
``Truth at Any Cost: Ken Starr and the Unmaking of Bill Clinton''
by Susan Schmidt and Michael Weisskopf, which arrived in bookstores
this week. It has a first printing of 60,000 copies, a healthy
number for such a book. ``It presents Starr, warts and all; the
reader will be like a fly on the wall in Starr's office, and learn
a lot about what went on in his mind,'' Hirshey said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, polemical books seem to have all the velocity these day,
like those attack ads. Nonetheless, Hirshey said: ``I hope we
didn't hurt its commercial potential by making it as balanced we
could. I think this will be an interesting litmus test, whether a
book about a highly charged political figure that is not a hate
book can succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how many sesterces Suetonius' monumental ``Lives of
the Caesars'' earned? What is clear, however, is that his capacity
for compelling prose was considerably heightened by tales of
cruelty and avarice rather than by dignity and gentleness. Quite
modern really.

 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You would become a white-wine drinker pretty quickly
if you lived in the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Show
House, as I did for three days last weekend. Or straight vodka.
You'd think twice about chocolate ice cream. The 28th annual show
house, at 1 E. 94th St., open through May 21, is packed to its
sixth-story rafters with white lambskin and goatskin rugs, pale
linen walls, cream-colored microfiber, ivory silk and white-peach
velvet. Red Burgundy and Bordeaux drinkers: Check your weapons at
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus-eaters, step right in.
</P>
<P>
   Designers, including the 16 represented here this year, like to
talk a lot about livability when discussing the ultimate success of
interior decoration: comfort, utility and amenity created in a room
as the true service to a client.
</P>
<P>
   We'll see. In a world rapidly developing other criteria for
happiness and health besides facial tissue boxes disguised beyond
discovery by leopard-prints and brocaded bows, it was time to
test-drive the show house.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday at 7 p.m., I checked into the house with my Kelty
backpack.
</P>
<P>
   Decorators treasure their gift for hiding things like light
switches. It took me 30 minutes to find them, under wallpaper,
trompe l'oeiled in murals, puzzled into moldings.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the impact of events like Kips Bay on people at
home, Charles Spada, a Boston-based decorator, said, ``All of that
has gone the way of the world.'' Spada, represented in the house
with a modest-looking, monochromatic study, added: ``People are so
savvy about how they want to live and don't want to live. Interior
design has shot itself in the foot, like the couture business. How
many times can you see a red room and get excited about it? Life
isn't about setting trends anymore. What's comfortable, what's
value for the money _ that's what's beautiful to clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The house quickly contradicted him. At least seven of the 16
rooms, including the smallest, would cost a client more than $1
million, retail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just comme-ca?'' Toni Raeymaekers asked anxiously. Her eyes
clock-swept the ``Shangri-La'' bedroom, counting: ``A million,
three; a million, four. But she's $750,000, all by herself _ Liz.''
She was speaking of the sphinxlike Andy Warhol silk-screen of
Elizabeth Taylor above the bed. The figure did not include fees for
the designers, Anderson, Papachristidis Raeymaekers Interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Jordan's painted contact-papered sitting room _ a kind of
Newport Lite, despite an $850,000 Persian rug _ was $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   What stylistic trends there were were of the deconstructed
variety. Traditional decoration trumped contemporary design, which
showed up with no news or radical views. Even at a price, formality
was less formal.
</P>
<P>
   The house, built in 1895, was redesigned in 1925 by Cass
Gilbert, the Woolworth Building architect. Mario Buatta, who chose
Gilbert's oval, wood-paneled Georgian dining room, created an
evening sitting room instead. Cost: $1 million plus. The most
formal space was a lounge: John Barman and John Levy's
plastic-mirror-paneled, 1970s-inspired disco stair-landing. It was
perfectly authentic to my worst nights as a 25-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   I love a quiet evening at home. By 9, I was pacing Beverly
Ellsley's Provencal, stone-floored eat-in kitchen, gobbling
microwave popcorn: a good sign. I pace at home. At 10, I marched to
the top of the house, two bags of Thai takeout in hand, to deploy
the late-model entertainment system in Richard Mishaan's atelier,
provided by Philips Electronics. Mishaan said the sleek skylighted
space was conceived as a home office for a plastic surgeon. It
included two flat-screen digital televisions, a DVD player, a
wireless keyboard and mouse, Web access and seven remote controls
that I happened upon, dumped in a white ceramic pot across the
room.
</P>
<P>
   There is much ballyhoo in the house this year about the seamless
ease that the newest technology is introducing into the home. I
lined the remotes up in a semicircle on Mishaan's coffee table,
pointing them at the wall-mounted screens like approaching tanks.
Two and a half hours later, the mango chicken sat cold in its box.
I had ``The English Patient'' without sound on the top screen. I
had no Internet connection, but I did have an Italian television
station whose programming turned smutty at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Not the designer's fault; but I had a few tips for Mishaan, too.
The fabulous room's recessed ceiling lighting was inflexible,
operated by two switches that turned the room on or off by halves.
Making warm pockets of light where the three inviting seating
groups were was a chore that involved moving lamps. Two
back-to-back sofas were too tall, segregating two sides of the
room. A pair of settees had no side tables to rest a glass on; the
leather ottoman between them would be a precarious surface.
Mishaan's plastic surgeon doesn't rest glasses. ``You never do,''
the designer explained, ``because at a cocktail party you can't
drink fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The room's bark-patterned carpet provided promised calm; the
artwork, including a Donald Baechler painting of an ice cream
sundae, propelled the probable cost past $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   I slept that night in the yellow-striped David Anthony Easton
Inc. bedroom, designed by Stewart Manger. I gave a $3,500 circa
1880 jasparware urn perched on a console a run for its money when I
skittled it briefly looking for a baseboard plug for my cellular
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Nested into two scalloped-edge European square pillows against a
bamboo headboard, I was awakened at 2 by an Unidentified Fringed
Object hitting me in the face: a $1,200 needlepoint reading pillow.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m., pigeons cooed at the windows. Inside, two standard
poodle-size topiaries sat like trusty dogs waiting for their master
to rise. I slammed my slippers on, making the four-floor spiraled
descent to the kitchen, past ``Shangri-La,'' past Barman's Studio
54, like breaks in a blackout hangover.
</P>
<P>
   I settled with coffee in Jordan's sitting room. The Russian
Empire mahogany writing desk and French Empire gilded armchair
proved, despite appearances, the best place to work in the house:
steady pieces of furniture for a laptop with an outlet next to them
and a visual command of the room, which is rich with intelligent
companionship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the room to be full enough of furniture so that if
one came in alone, you wouldn't feel lonely in the room _ no great
holes of space,'' Jordan said. The designer also chose fabrics that
were warm and inviting: mellow, antique-colored silks and velvets.
</P>
<P>
   The room is deceptively traditional, and younger than it looks.
Though the furnishings share a classical poise, they range in
period from a French 18th-century Louis XV bergere to two new resin
garden tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think we're braving new worlds? Not particularly,'' the
designer said. ``People aren't as afraid of luxury as they used to
be, but people want comfort, they want to live in all of their
rooms, because they cost money to build, they cost money to
decorate. They don't want show rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they want 11 pillows in bed with them? My lumbar lost track
at 6. I lounged in ``Shangri-La,'' under Liz's violet gaze, for
three hours, reading, napping and avoiding decisions, which the
huge coconut of a bed was perfect for.
(MORE)
nn
</P>
<P>
   Time flies when you're having a bon temps. I paid my American
Express bill in Michael Simon's very authentic French 18th-century
drawing room. ``I like very serene and peaceful, refined
environments,'' Simon, who is a trained composer, told me.
``Obviously, I'm a fairly academic person, and my work is not
trendy in any way.'' He was being modest; three Louis XVI armchairs
had ochre ostrich-skin upholstery, which he ran to ground at a
ranch in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As I wrote my checks, Simon's room reassured me that the money
would come from somewhere, that there was nothing that marriage or
a death in the family couldn't solve. I had a fight with Con Edison
on the telephone; the circa 1780 salon with the embroidered moire
walls stayed in my corner like a card-playing courtesan during the
recordings and the 12-minute wait.
</P>
<P>
   By 5, I was late for cocktails. I was the only guest. I dressed
in an Art Deco closet designed by DeBare Saunders and Ronald Mayne,
a narrow slipper of a space with shagreen-paper walls and two pink
fluorescent sconces _ ocean-liner salvage. Though mirrors stared
from both walls, there was not a full-length mirror for that last
head-to-toe.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. I was seated with a drink, in Buatta's oval sitting
room. The chatty arrangement of chairs, a back-to-back sofa, a bar
table, a framed photograph of the designer with Nancy Kissinger and
other mementos provides social encouragement, like a skilled host.
It is an art, like conversation, that decoration achieves, that
style can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at a house, or a room, after a party, to see where
everything landed, where guests moved things,'' Buatta told me,
earlier in the week. ``See the way your friends have rearranged
your furniture, so that they were comfortable. It's the way your
rooms really work best.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Buatta, for instance, where I would put my glass.
``Right here,'' he said, indicating a $60,000 China Trade table,
circa 1810. He got nervous. ``Use the ashtray for a coaster,'' he
said. The ashtray was an 18th-century tea saucer.
</P>
<P>
   Checking out of the decorated house at noon on Easter Sunday, I
walked to Fifth Avenue to flag a taxi. People jogged through
Central Park; couples bicycled by, wearing graphite helmets and
Spandex tights, children papoosed in plastic seats at their backs.
I could have been Rip van Winkle, crawling out of the cave of
another era. The smell of cut flowers faded in my clothes.
</P>
<P>
   After 40 hours inside sophistication's citadel, I was remarkably
rested, even spoiled, but I was as restless as the breeze to begin
living again.

BOOKS FOR LITTLE GARDENERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SANDY GUERRA-CLINE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This spring, you can go from watching your kids grow to watching
your kids grow things. And if you're lucky, they'll grow good
things to eat, like tiny tomatoes and crisp lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   Five children's books cover all aspects of the garden patch,
with fun projects to keep little green thumbs busy.
</P>
<P>
   1. ``The Kids Can Press Jumbo Book of Gardening'' by Karyn
Morris (Kids Can Press, $14.95). Gosh, it's pretty much all here _
from composting to ``building'' a sunflower fort _ with a
no-nonsense writing style and really fun illustrations. Neat
projects include a night-blooming garden and a birthday garden,
using the flower symbols for the months of your family's birthdays.
And a good project for dry areas: the Water-Saving Garden.
Recommended for ages 8 and older.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Better Homes and Gardens New Junior Garden Book'' by Felder
Rushing (Meredith Books, $15.95). Wacky illustrations will appeal
to kids, and wonderful projects using recyclables like 2-liter
plastic soda bottles will wow parents and educators. Cool projects
include: planting flowers in an old boot, making decorative
steppingstones with bits of broken tiles and such, and stringing up
wind chimes made from painted soda cans. Projects are on a skill
scale _ from one flower (easy) to three flowers (must drag Dad away
from the TV).
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Dig and Sow: How Do Plants Grow?'' by Janice Lobb
(Kingfisher, $10.95). If you've got a kid who loves to ask things
like ``Why is grass green?'' this is the book for you _ and him.
Part of the ``At Home With Science'' series, this book contains 12
garden-oriented experiments. They're easy and fun, and the
``special equipment'' never gets any more demanding than a
magnifying glass, food coloring and a clean jar. Recommended for
ages 5 and older.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Starting With Nature Plant Book'' by Pamela Hickman (Kids
Can Press, $5.95 in paperback). A fine introduction to plants in
the United States _ from wildflowers to endangered plants. Kids
will enjoy the pages on plant defenses and poisonous plants. Other
books in the series are devoted to bugs, trees and birds. Ages 7 to
11.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Are You a Ladybug?'' and ``Are You a Snail?'' (Kingfisher,
$9.95 each). Intelligent and easy-to-read, these books are aimed at
preschoolers and beginning readers (with a little help) and stuffed
full of fun facts. Did you know animals and birds won't eat
ladybugs because they taste terrible? You do now!

`GET HAPPY:' THE OVEREXAMINED LIFE OF THE `REAL' JUDY GARLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do Odysseus, Sir Galahad and pigtailed little Dorothy from
``The Wizard of Oz'' have in common? Answer: lonely quests through
hostile territory. But this is no parlor game. It's the high-minded
desperation that serves as ballast for ``Get Happy,'' Gerald
Clarke's scandal-seeking yet curiously wan biography of Judy
Garland. In the long shadow of the author's splendid portrait of
Truman Capote, ``Get Happy'' recalls James Agee's complaint that
``The Clock,'' a Vincente Minnelli film in which Garland starred,
``inspires ingratitude for not being great.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke puts himself at a serious disadvantage in moving from a
fresh, witty, reasonably unexamined subject like Capote to a woman
whose entire adult life unfolded in a climate of sob-sister press
scrutiny. Her triumphs and calamities were chronicled with tireless
vigor. ``I must say I never thought I'd live to see the day when
anyone would be tossed into the jug for saying Judy Garland had
problems,'' wrote the columnist Dorothy Kilgallen after another
reporter was briefly jailed for libel. Among the newspaper and
magazine articles that this book swallows as reliable source
material are ``The Real Me,'' ``I'm Judy Garland _ and This Is My
Story'' and ``Judy Garland Achieves New Level of Poignancy.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic trajectory of the star's life, from soulful baby
precocity (she sang torch songs in childhood) to MGM heyday to
descent into drug-addled misery, is thus well known. For instance,
it was set forth in Gerold Frank's credulous but thorough 1975
``Judy,'' from which ``Get Happy'' borrows frequently. When it
comes to an appreciation of Garland's talent, well, she herself
once offered one: ``I have a machine in my throat that gets into
many people's ears and affects them.'' Try as he will to evoke
mythology or Milton from time to time, Clarke has precious little
to add to that description.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, warrants this new look at the life of Judy Garland?
The opportunity to put her on the kind of pedestal that comes
complete with pigeon droppings. In keeping with today's appetites
for tabloid allegations couched as valuable data, Clarke devotes
inordinate attention to determining just how bisexual were many of
the men in Garland's life, just how many married men or father
figures she fooled around with, and just how foul she could be
while wallowing in substance abuse. The kind of nugget to be found
here is the interview with William Tuttle, who was once head of
MGM's makeup department and told Clarke of having dropped a
Benzedrine pill while in Garland's presence. ``Like a dog jumping
for a scrap,'' Clarke writes gracelessly, ``Judy grabbed it almost
before it hit the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Happy'' is thus ready to reel off incidents like Garland's
pitching a self-destructive fit while wielding a hot curling iron,
even if this episode comes secondhand, courtesy of a hairdresser
who described it to a friend. There's more in the same poisonous
vein, much of it accompanied by craven page notes that explain
``the friend who told me the story has asked me not to reveal her
name,'' or ``the lover made that boast to a source who requested
anonymity.'' Rock bottom is reached with an anecdote about a
wastebasket used as a chamber pot. Just how far over the rainbow
need the reader go to get away from stuff like this?
</P>
<P>
   One nominal justification for this book is Clarke's access to
previously unavailable autobiographical material from Garland
herself. It's true that the tenor of her recollections _ a
childhood trauma here, a grope from Louis B. Mayer there _ is just
right for the author's purposes. Quoted in the book only briefly,
her audiotaped rantings are excruciating, fueled by the raging
bitterness and pathos that shaped her final years. ``I'm an angry
lady! I've been insulted! Slandered! Humiliated!'' Clarke describes
her as screaming. And: ``I hate anybody's guts who used me, because
I wanted to be a nice girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, there is an art to the clever exploitation of
such pain. Throw enough biographical mud against the wall, and a
coherent picture may just take shape. But an author with a fondness
for words like rutilant, cunctatory and exundant, and with a
tendency to sound more like a perfunctory chronicler than a
muckophile, is apt to lack the bare-knuckles brutality that the
genre increasingly demands.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke winds up wavering awkwardly between the tut-tut outing of
Garland's secrets and the clammy hyperbole of the reverential fan.
When Garland's hand and footprints were immortalized in the
sidewalk at Grauman's Chinese Theater, he declares that ``like the
image of some girl of Pompeii, immortalized by a belch from
Vesuvius, her lithic impression would remain long after she herself
was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Happy'' leaves the Garland legend in need of a sharper
lithic impression than this. As Clarke all too persuasively
demonstrates, a yellow brick road paved with anguish-peddling
anecdotes may not lead anywhere. For all its new embellishments,
the life story told here sounds bleak and weary. It might have
found more to work with had it gone on to consider the cult of
unflagging adoration Garland has inspired, the larger implications
of her lonely legend, and the Marilynization of her victories and
frailties into the essence of a durable show business icon.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there is her music, which tells a gut-wrenching
life story of its own and remains magnificently evergreen in ways
that ``Get Happy'' never begins to fathom. There will always be a
deeper thrill in the astonishing drama of that voice than in the
most tone-deaf (``Who finally introduced her to the pleasures of
sex, and where and when, is a question without an answer'') of
biographical observations.

A UNIVERSE WHERE IDEAS CAN TRUMP ACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it possible for a computer game to have the intellectual heft
and emotional impact of a good book while remaining as captivating
as a well-paced film? If so, the first candidate may well be
Planescape: Torment.
</P>
<P>
   Planescape, a role-playing game, breaks many of the conventions
that have distinguished the genre since it emerged two decades ago.
Planescape is not especially difficult, but it is written for ages
13 and older and may be inappropriate for younger children.
</P>
<P>
   The game features poignant storytelling and engaging interaction
with digital characters, not to mention a healthy dose of good
old-fashioned play. Picking up where path-clearing games like
Fallout began, Planescape could well herald a new wave of games
that are valued as much for their artistic merit as they are for
their technical brilliance and the fun they offer.
</P>
<P>
   Planescape is like other role-playing games in that the player
directs an alter ego, along with a band of companions, through
fantastic environments and against fearsome foes as they try to
complete their quest. Like some other role-playing games,
Planescape is based (loosely) on the rules of Advanced Dungeons and
Dragons, the most popular pen-and-paper role-playing game.
</P>
<P>
   That is where most of the similarities to most other games end,
both in design and execution.
</P>
<P>
   Most computer role-playing games take place in a medieval
fantasy environment, complete with elves, goblins and, of course,
dragons. Planescape mostly takes place in the bizarre city of
Sigil, a place that sits at the intersection of infinite planes of
existence. In the Planescape multiple universe, ideas are often
more powerful than actions, and an entire city can move from one
plane to another when the beliefs of its inhabitants change.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a gleaming hero, the player controls a scarred,
shambling figure known only as The Nameless One. Instead of chain
mail, he wears magical tattoos for protection. Instead of typically
heroic companions, he may be joined by things like a floating
skull, a demoness or a disembodied suit of armor, each with its own
set of often-disturbing neuroses.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of the game's design is that
the main character is immortal. That is a boon for most players
because death at the hands of a monster or trap is generally only a
minor inconvenience in Plane-scape. In fact, dying is essential to
solving at least one of the game's puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that the main character's immortality is
actually his biggest problem; the game's story revolves around his
quest to discover its cause and annul it so he may finally rest in
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, The Nameless One discovers that at least some of
his prior incarnations were deceitful, manipulative cretins who
destroyed the lives of relatively innocent beings and who tricked
others into sacrificing themselves for his benefit. In the game,
the player struggles for redemption, despite the actions of his own
earlier incarnations, while wrestling with the unexpected
consequences of his immortality.
</P>
<P>
   The game's level of detail and its emotional impact have
prompted some players to cast about for literary peers. ``As a
piece of literature, it blows away `Lord of The Rings' for my
$34.99,'' wrote one person in an Internet games newsgroup. ``And
that was a childhood favorite.'' Planescape, the person wrote,
``fills the same niche for my adult life.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the game's lead designer, another person wrote that
computer role-playing games ``may not have seen their Shakespeare
yet, but I think in Chris Avellone and the rest of his team, and in
Planescape, we may have seen the like of Christopher Marlowe and
Dr. Faustus.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the literary allusions are apt because most of
Plane-scape's story is conveyed in text. Planescape has beautiful
(if slightly unsettling) graphics, but most of the dialogue and
important plot elements are conveyed with words. Planescape
includes about a million words of text, but because it includes
multiple paths to success, only a fraction of those will be
displayed in any particular game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things we were trying to convey would have
required 400 or 500 people to achieve graphically,'' Avellone said.
``It became apparent that we could achieve the same effect with a
paragraph of text. When you watch a movie, your imagination is
basically being supplied for you, whereas in a book you're creating
it yourself. The same thing applied here: What you recreate in your
own mind is more powerful than what we can supply for you. Plus,
it's just fun to write.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps partly because the game is so text-intensive,
Planescape's system requirements are fairly low: Windows, a
200-megahertz processor and 32 megabytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most important requirement is an ability to
think new thoughts about just what a computer game can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of intelligent games out there,'' Avellone
said. ``But people who really don't play a whole lot of games, if
they just see certain first-person shooters they assume it's all
mindless.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to games from other companies, he added: ``If you look
at Final Fantasy 7 or Half-Life or Homeworld, for instance, there
are a whole lot of games that aren't mindless at all. So you say,
`Wow, this is making me have certain emotions, this is making me
feel a certain way. I'm really enjoying this.' Maybe people should
just play more games.''

GLUING: MORE TO IT THAN YOU THINK

<P>
   Many beginning woodworkers think that gluing is simple and
straightforward, requiring only squirting glue on mating surfaces,
then clamping the pieces together until the glue cures.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the task is a lot more complicated. First it is
important to use the right glue. While it might seem that all glues
are pretty much alike, they differ in a number of important
properties: cost, convenience, assembly and setting time, and
application.
</P>
<P>
   For woodworkers, the most familiar glue is yellow woodworker's
glue, also called carpenter's glue. It's an aliphatic resin, much
like the household white glue, but it is formulated to dry faster
than white glue. Both white and yellow glue can be sanded after
they dry (although yellow glue does not clog sandpaper as much as
white glue). They both clean up with soap and water, and they have
good holding power.
</P>
<P>
   Neophyte woodworkers may find that the longer drying time of
white glue allows them more time to assemble pieces. As they become
more experienced, they will want to move up to the faster-setting
woodworker's glue.
</P>
<P>
   Another glue that is ideal for woodworkers is liquid hide glue.
It is a favorite with professional furniture manufacturers because
it has a longer setting time than the aliphatic resins. This makes
it a good choice for assembling complicated projects like antique
furniture. Like aliphatic resins, it can be cleaned up with soap
and water.
</P>
<P>
   These glues are fine for indoor applications but they are not
waterproof, so they cannot be used on exterior jobs or projects
that will be exposed to moisture. Here, you will have to switch to
a waterproof glue, like epoxy resin. Epoxy consists of two separate
liquids that must be mixed in equal portions just prior to
application. It takes anywhere from five minutes to five hours to
cure (depending on the formula), and it dries to a rock-hard,
glossy finish. Since it is impervious to water, it is an ideal
bonding agent for putting together window boxes, planters and
outdoor furniture. On the downside, epoxy is difficult to sand and
more expensive than other glues. Epoxy can be cleaned up with
lacquer thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Even the strongest glue will produce a weak joint if it is not
applied correctly. Surface preparation is important. Both gluing
surfaces should be clean, dry and relatively even or else the glue
will not bond properly. This means that newly sawed surfaces must
be smoothed to remove the ridges left by the saw blade. The best
tool to use for this is a plane or a sharp wood chisel. Sandpaper
isn't very good for this because it clogs the wood pores, which
prevents the glue from penetrating.
</P>
<P>
   Before applying the glue, test fit all the pieces together and
inspect all joints for gaps, out-of-square edges and alignment
problems. These flaws should be corrected before spreading any
glue.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mistake neophyte woodworkers make is in using too
much glue. When the project is clamped together, the excess glue
will ooze from the joints onto the workpiece. Not only will this
require extra cleanup; the glue will penetrate the wood and leave
stains. Unlike ordinary stains that darken and discolor wood
fibers, glue stains are not apparent until a finish or stain is
applied. Then they show up as unsightly light spots where the
finish or stain did not soak in. The only way to remove them by
sanding them out.
</P>
<P>
   The glue should be spread with an applicator in thin layers on
both surfaces. You can use an inexpensive bristle brush, but be
sure to wash the bristles afterward. Low-cost foam paint brushes
and serrated plastic picnic knifes make ideal disposable
applicators. Sometimes it is tempting to spread the glue with your
fingers, but this is not a good practice because you are likely to
put glue fingerprints all over the work surface. No matter how you
spread the glue, keep it at least one-quarter inch from the edges
of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   After applying the glue, wait a few minutes before joining the
pieces. This will minimize slippage when the pieces are pushed
together. Clamp the work and keep the joint under pressure for at
least 24 hours. Be sure to place scraps of wood under the clamp
pads to protect the workpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the surfaces on a piece of wood bond equally well. The
ends of a board, commonly called end grain, are more porous than
the other surfaces. The end grain readily absorbs the glue and
reduces its holding power. When gluing the end of a board to
another surface, it is necessary to reinforce the joint with
dowels, glue blocks or wood screws.

ALT-COUNTRY'S ROBBIE FULKS VEERS FROM FUNNY TO SERIOUS TO
WORLD-WEARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robbie Fulks' latest CD is called ``The Very Best of Robbie
Fulks,'' and right there we know his cynical sense of humor has not
betrayed him.
</P>
<P>
   First, this is not a greatest-hits collection, because the
37-year-old alternative-country musician has never had any hits;
mainstream country radio stations won't come near him. And second,
even though some of these songs are 10 years old, few have been
released before.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in a way, the title rings true: ``Very'' is classic
Fulks, which is to say he can be winsomely funny (there are paeans
to actress Jean Arthur and Bangles hottie Susanna Hoffs) and turn
around and do a song such as ``Parallel Bars'' (a duet with Kelly
Willis) that rings with an authentic love of classic honky-tonkers
such as George Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He'll trash self-satisfied retro-rock fans on ``Roots Rock
Weirdos,'' turn right around and write a stinging put-down to an ex
``(I Just Want To Meet the Man)'' and then do a bluegrass
instrumental such as ``Hamilton County Breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like odds-and-ends records, such as Elvis Costello's
``Taking Liberties,'''' says Fulks, munching on a noontime pizza as
his 7-month-old son, Tennessee, (his third child) naps nearby. ``I
realized I wasn't ripping off my fans once I listened to it in
different orders. And I wanted to put out an album this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Fulks just doesn't like to be categorized; he'll be
stone-cold serious on one song and sarcastically funny on the next,
and he'll mix different genres.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where ``Weirdos'' _ one of the CD's standouts _ comes
from: When asked if he isn't putting down some of the very people
who go see his shows, he's quick to answer in the affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, definitely!'' he says. ``But that's why it's fun to
do _ it's a much riskier thing to do than just put down Nashville.
My tastes are out of date and old-fashioned, so in a way I'm one of
them. I've always played for a rock audience _ I play country for
noncountry people. I'm never gonna play at a state fair opening for
Lorrie Morgan. I see them as my people, but when they get a little
fussy, I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he readily acknowledges that there is a
certain world-weary point of view at work in much of his writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes from being 37 years old and divorced and Southern,''
Fulks says. ``It's a useful tool. Having a jaundiced eye helps you
get through the storms of life. It deepens and broadens as I grow
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not just part of my personality. It's also because so
much country is sappy; it's important for me to say, `Let's get
real here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fulks grew up in Pennyslvania, Virginia and North Carolina, and
in 1983 joined the Chicago-based Special Consensus Bluegrass Band:
That's him on guitar on their Grammy-nominated 1989 CD ``Hole in My
Heart.'' After forming the rock 'n' roll Trailer Trash Revue, he
went solo and released two very entertaining CDs, ``Country Love
Songs'' and ``South Mouth,'' on the Chicago alt-country Bloodshot
label.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 he left, signed with Geffen, and released ``Let's Kill
Saturday Night,'' which had more of a rock/pop feel than
``Country'' or ``South.'' ``Kill'' was a very good CD, but Fulks
was dropped from the label; he re-signed with Bloodshot and
released ``Best'' in January.
</P>
<P>
   But while ``Best'' is often the equal of any of his three
previous CDs, he says it's also a ``capstone'' to the first stage
of his solo career. His next CD, he says, will be ``totally
serious,'' without the cuter songs, such as ``Weirdos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've done the Bakersfield shuffles and novelty songs
as well as I can,'' Fulks says. ``I'm not going to leave country
behind, but I don't think I need to do another CD of old-sounding
stuff with cussing on it. I don't even think I'll be a footnote in
the country reference books, but I'd like some of the songs to
outlast me _ that's what I'm shooting for.''

THE SUBTEXT BARELY HIDDEN BY THE BEACH BLANKET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface ``to'' in 4th graf should be italicized.) 
 David Bahr's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
filmmaker Paul Morrissey.  
 By DAVID BAHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Santa could make a list and check it twice, but he would still
have trouble labeling Frankie and Annette naughty or nice. As
moviegoing cats old enough may recall, Frankie Avalon and Annette
Funicello (whose screen name was Dee Dee _ really) cavorted in
cagey camp classics like ``Muscle Beach Party'' (1964), ``Beach
Blanket Bingo'' and ``How to Stuff a Wild Bikini'' (both 1965).
</P>
<P>
   Wearing scanty swimsuits and perky smiles, Frankie and Dee Dee
shook their derrieres and shimmied their shoulders while singing of
love, heartache and going all the way. With a wink-wink and a
nudge-nudge, they wallowed in wordplay with a decidedly suggestive
tang.
</P>
<P>
   Take these lyrics to the theme song of ``Beach Blanket Bingo'':
``Every lad and every lassie/ when they're down by the shore/
looking smart and looking classy/yeah, they're learning the
score.''
</P>
<P>
   Or was that learning  &UR; to &LR;  score? Given all the half-naked
smooching going on during that opening number, it would be an easy
mistake to make. Surely one intended by the filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these movies, it's not always easy to separate what's
innocent from what's a calculated attempt to make everything as
sexual as possible,'' says Robert Lee King, the director of
``Psycho Beach Party,'' an affectionate satire of '60s surf flicks
that is due out in August. ``But I do know the stock and trade of
those movies was innuendo and a lot of heavy breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the beach movie genre is generally considered to have
begun with ``Gidget'' (1959) _ starring Sandra Dee as an affable,
late-blooming teen-ager reluctant to go on her first surf-and-sun
``manhunt'' _ it wasn't until the successful release of American
International Pictures' ``Beach Party'' (1963) that film studios
began to fully exploit the economic rewards of niche marketing. And
with two-thirds of all filmgoers being between the ages of 16 and
24 by the late 1950s, the intended target was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanine Basinger, chairman of film studies at Wesleyan
University, says that teen-agers and young adults were a
significant part of Hollywood's intended audience as far back as
the silent film era. The difference is that with films like ``Beach
Party,'' teen-agers were now targeted without the folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Films like `A Date With Judy' and `Two Weeks With Love' were
basically aimed at the teens but also a wider audience,'' Basinger,
referring to movies released in 1948 and 1950, respectively.
``These were family movies. But the beach films specifically went
after kids going to the summer drive-in. They suddenly perceived
they could speak directly to the teen-age psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   As AIP discovered, teen-agers' psyches and their hormones are
often inseparable. And the beach films _ of which there are, gulp,
seven, including ``Bikini Beach'' (1964), ``Pajama Party''(1964)
and ``The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini'' (1966), skillfully
straddled the line between lasciviousness and chastity. Thoroughly
titillating and cornball, they catered both to teen-agers' fleshy
fantasies and to the moral concerns of allowance-providing parents.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the beach films have a schizophrenic feel,
occupying a cinematic place between the virginal heroics of Doris
Day and the permissive culture represented by ``Midnight Cowboy''
(1969) and ``Klute'' (1971). Feminism, homoeroticism and
socioeconomic class conflict are all broached by the beach movies,
only to be buried beneath insipid story lines and fairy tale
endings.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the genre's darker subtext, say the creative talents
behind ``Psycho Beach Party,'' that begged to be explored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to avoid the sort of nostalgia that accompanies most
contemporary movies about that period: that life was so simple back
then,'' says Charles Busch, the New York drag performer who adapted
the screenplay from his Off Broadway play and appears in the film
as the police captain Monica Stark. ``Our take is that maybe life
wasn't so simple and that there always was an active sexuality, of
every kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Basing his script on ``Gidget'' and psychological melodramas
like ``Spellbound'' (1945) and ``Marnie'' (1964), Busch employed
broad camp to soften its rendering of teen-age sexual inadequacy,
closeted homosexuality, mental illness and mass murder. ``There had
to be something childlike about this material or else it would have
been kind of ugly,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Malibu in 1962, ``Psycho Beach Party'' follows the pert
and peppy Chicklet (Lauren Ambrose) in her struggle to become a
surfer; win the guy of her dreams, Starcat (Nicholas Brendon); and
overcome a multiple personality disorder that encompasses a
sadomasochistic dominatrix and a black urban homegirl.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are subplots about two surfer dudes who can't
stop wrestling, a sexually frustrated mother with a shady past and
a wheelchair-bound vixen with an evil streak. Oh, and there's a
serial killer on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its silly bent, ``Psycho Beach Party'' definitely
tackles the era's cinematic sexual conflicts. One scene shows the
boyish Starcat detailing his erogenous zones to Chicklet, causing
her to flee in panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to make the audience as conscious of the beach
movies' sexual subtext, and if possible, a little bit
uncomfortable,'' King says. ``We wanted to recreate it and then
take it one step farther. And that fits in exactly with what those
films are about, which is exploring repressed sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for many, there's a certain comfort in all those
mixed messages and cheesy double entendres. As Basinger observes,
Frankie and Dee Dee did try to have it both ways and therein lies
their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, Hollywood has always made a living off
ambiguity and ambivalence,'' she says. ``And these films are a
continuation of that successful formula. You can see these beach
movies lasciviously or innocently, heterosexually or homosexually.
The films make room for that. And that's their genius.''

THE ONGOING ADVENTURES OF MOOSE AND SQUIRREL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANZ LIDZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deep into the Eisenhower era of my youth, Donald was a sitting
duck. My father and two of his brothers, lapsed and unlapsed
socialists, used to lounge around our living room taking shots at
Walt Disney.
</P>
<P>
   My father: ``He's a capitalist!''
</P>
<P>
   My Uncle Danny: ``He's a fascist!''
</P>
<P>
   My Uncle Arthur: ``That's funny, I thought he was a
cartoonist.''
</P>
<P>
   It is with great glee then that I recall a Saturday morning on
the cusp of the Kennedy era when the four of us crumpled over in
laughter at the appearance on the television screen of an animated
prince with a cigarette-slim moustache. He looked deliciously like
dear old Uncle Walt.
</P>
<P>
   While galloping through a forest, the prince had stumbled upon
the castle of Sleeping Beauty. Withholding his magic kiss, he let
her snooze and greedily envisioned franchise possibilities: ``I can
see it now,'' he said in the patter of Sgt. Bilko selling a tank
out of the motor pool. ``Sleeping Beauty comics!''
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping beauty hats! Sleeping Beauty bubble gum! And, biggest
of all, Sleeping Beautyland. Though the amusement park opened boffo
at the box office _ a Variety headline screamed: ``DOZE DOLL DUZ
WIZ BIZ'' _ the mercantile prince didn't live happily ever after.
His own dream was shattered by a pixie who demanded 50 percent of
the gross.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Fractured Fairy Tale'' was one of the many wicked satires
from ``Rocky and His Friends,'' the smartest, dumbest, simplest and
most complex cartoon ever made for television (and, yes, that
includes ``The Simpsons'').
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Universal Pictures will resuscitate the flying
squirrel and his pals on the big screen in ``The Adventures of
Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' what studio flacks are calling a
``live-action/animated comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing the filmmakers is to give the
three-dimensional actors (Robert De Niro, Rene Russo, Jason
Alexander) as much depth as the two-dimensional drawings had.
</P>
<P>
   From its premiere on ABC in 1959 to its lamentable demise on NBC
five years later (as ``The Bullwinkle Show''), the show chronicled
the adventures of a rodent named Rocky with a soft rasp of a voice,
a goggled aviator cap and a penchant for collecting nuts: foremost,
Bullwinkle, the walleyed, muddle-minded moose.
</P>
<P>
   An alumnus of Wossamotta U. who had ``more brains in his little
finger than he had in his whole head,'' Bullwinkle liked nothing
better than to curl up in front of a fire with a pile of books
(``They burn so nice and slow.'')
</P>
<P>
   Crudely drawn, but sharply written, the cartoon was wacky with
wincing wordplay _ ``airy persiflage,'' the ubiquitous narrator
called it _ that flew faster than Rocky himself. The gifted voicers
airing this persiflage (June Foray, Paul Frees and William Conrad,
to name three) surrendered to every pun possible (a jewel-encrusted
toy boat not only floated on Veronica Lake, but was called the
``Ruby Yacht of Omar Khayyam'') and impossible (``For a powerful
magnate,'' Rocky told a tycoon, ``you sure don't pick up things too
quickly.'')
</P>
<P>
   The punning even extended to come-ons for the next exciting
episode: ``The Show Must Go On, or Give 'Em the Acts,'' ``All in
Fever Say Aye, or the Emotion is Carried'' and ``Transatlantic
Chicken, or Hens Across The Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this punishment, Rocky and Bullwinkle
battled mechanical metal-munching moon mice; discovered a rich lode
of the antigravitational element, upsidaisium; and searched for the
elusive Kerward Derby, which turned even the antlered Bullwinkle
into a genius.
</P>
<P>
   But their most enduring struggle was with Boris Badenov and
Natasha Fatale, a couple of monumentally inept Slavic schemers from
Pottsylvania. One of the pair's most fiendish plans involved
thwarting a campaign to make Moosylvania the 51st state by
disguising Butte, Mont., as Washington, D.C. Their plot got
twisted, however, when it turned out that the nation's capitol had
already been disguised as Butte by the Montana Musk Melon Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Populated entirely by spies, secret agents and saboteurs,
Pottsylvania was the one place where the Cold War never thawed. Its
highest honor was the Double Cross, and its newspaper, The
Pottsylvania Eavesdropper, was printed in invisible ink. The only
place ``Rocky and His Friends'' was taken seriously was the Soviet
Union, where it was deemed anti-Soviet propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   The impresarios of this amusing agitprop were a left-leaning
``Mr. Magoo'' scriptwriter (Bill Scott) and a right-leaning Harvard
MBA (Jay Ward). Rather than condescending to kids and teaching them
Valuable Lessons, they enlisted them in a conspiracy against
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   They were sort of premature yippies, smart alecks tweaking the
military, the government, Eisenhower complacency, even network
censors, who ignored the implicit racism of cooking Rocky and
Bullwinkle in cannibal pots but blanched at the excessive cruelty.
When the cannibal episode aired, Rocky trumped the censors by
masking the cooking pot with a network memo that declared it
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Later, with Moose and Squirrel tied to a stake, the show's
narrator breathlessly intoned: ``And the network-approved flames
leaped higher and higher!''
</P>
<P>
   Rocky and his friends not only jawed with each other but with
viewers as well.
</P>
<P>
   To keep their audience, Bullwinkle once told kids at home to
pull the knobs off their television sets so ``we'll be sure to be
with you next week.'' Networks complained about that, too.
Bullwinkle's response was to tell the kids in another installment:
``You can put the knobs back on now. Use glue _ and make it
stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Busting yet another cartoon convention, the characters were
aware they were only comic inventions: Natasha spies Bullwinkle and
exclaims, ``Boris, is moose you said you killed in previous
episode!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his show,'' Boris says, insouciantly. ``If he vants to be
hard to kill, let him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the killing fields of 21st-century Hollywood, Rocky and
Bullwinkle have been remade and remodeled with high-tech animation,
their colors ``brightened'' to enhance merchandising potential.
Wadded with cute cameos and topical wisecracks, the trailer for the
$76 million ``Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' doesn't leave
many hints of great promise.
</P>
<P>
   Will Loose Moose Do Wiz Biz? Tune in this summer for the next
exciting episode: ``Building a Better Moosetrap, or Studio
Squirrels Away Fortune.''

 &HT;    McKesson HBOC shares hit 52-week low
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA McKesson HBOC shares hit a 52-week low Wednesday as
reduced sales at its Alpharetta-based health-care information
technology unit hurt earnings for the fifth consecutive quarter.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson's fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations,
before special items, fell 52 percent to $61.4 million, or 22 cents
a share, from $127.1 million, or 45 cents, the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based McKesson missed the average estimate of 29
cents by analysts polled by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Shares dropped to a 52-week low of $16.68 before closing at $17,
down $1.93 in heavy New York Stock Exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson's overall sales rose to $9.3 billion from $8.3 billion
for the same period in 1999. But sales at the software and services
unit, which employs about 2,000 here, fell 29 percent, with
software revenues alone tumbling 48 percent. The unit's operating
profit dropped to $15.3 million from $68.7 million in the quarter a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McKesson, the leading U.S. drug wholesaler,
recorded a pre-tax charge of $229.9 million in the quarter related
to its recently announced suspension of some health-care software
products. The software revamp also led to 260 job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame the decline in our profitability solely on the
performance of our information technology business,'' said McKesson
spokesman Larry Kurtz. The operating profit from its supply
management business also dropped 16 percent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Michael Krensavage of Brown Brothers Harriman said, ``It
was another disappointing quarter. The turnaround is not completed,
that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's troubling that problems at HBOC have affected the
distribution business as well,'' Krensavage added.
</P>
<P>
   Financial trouble has continued to swirl around the former
Atlanta-based HBO &AMP; Co. business since McKesson acquired it in
January 1999. Accounting improprieties found at the unit led
McKesson to restate fiscal 1999 earnings by $152.2 million. The
announcement of accounting problems a year ago sent the share price
plunging almost 50 percent in one trading day.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder lawsuits and government investigations followed. An
executive shakeup included the firing of Chairman Charlie McCall,
who had spearheaded HBO &AMP; Co.'s rise to become the leading
health-care software and services firm.

&HT;     BUSH DOES WASHINGTON FOR FIRST TIME AS CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush made the rounds in the
nation's capital for the first time as the likely Republican
presidential nominee, meeting Russia's foreign minister, appealing
for the women's vote, and replenishing the GOP's financial war
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was the centerpiece of a black-tie gala that raised a
record $15 million for the Republican National Committee. The
previous record for a political party's take in a single evening
was $14 million, raised last year when the candidate's father,
former President George Bush, headlined the GOP gala.
</P>
<P>
   The money will help Republicans run television ads this fall
that take aim at Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic
nominee, without directly endorsing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will win the White House; we will hold the House; we will
hold the Senate,'' Bush said in remarks prepared for delivery at
the gala. ``And come January, Vice President Al Gore will have one
last official duty: To swear in Senator Rudolph Giuliani of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is fighting First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton in a titanic struggle to succeed Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The gala gave Bush his first opportunity as the all-but-official
GOP presidential nominee to address the Republican Party
establishment and its business-oriented backers. The event featured
high-profile Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi and House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois,
and business contributors from AT&AMP;T, the Philip Morris Cos., and
United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   With National Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne
LaPierre serving as the gala's co-chair, Bush's appearance drew
Democratic fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much for George W. Bush's moderate makeover,'' said Gore
campaign press secretary Chris Lehane. ``Time and time again, when
he's had to choose between the gun lobby and our children, he has
stood with the gun lobby. He has supported guns in churches, and
opposed closing the gun show loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush said LaPierre's role in the gala did not
trouble him in the least. ``I know what I believe,'' he told
reporters. ``I support reasonable laws to keep the guns out of the
hands of people who shouldn't have them. I believe we ought to
enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Bush met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov, who was in Washington for meetings with President Clinton
and other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his second term as governor of Texas, is potentially
vulnerable to critics' charges that he is a lightweight on foreign
policy. The meeting with Ivanov game him a chance to ``talk with
him about some of the views he's expressed on the campaign trail,''
according to Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among these was Bush's support for rolling back the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which prohibits both nations from
creating shields of defensive weapons to shoot down incoming
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia adamantly opposes any such changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of principle, my job as president is to provide
stability in the world, to protect our homeland and our citizens,''
Bush told Ivanov, according to Hughes. ``I don't view your country
as the enemy, and you should not view our country as the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the two had ``a very frank, a very forthright''
discussion, adding that Ivanov ``made his country's position
clear'' on revisions to the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to build an image of bipartisanship amid the
constant back-and-forth with Gore, Bush met with Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb., and Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., to talk about preserving
Social Security. Earlier in the week, Bush took four Democratic
Texas legislators _ all Bush supporters _ to a campaign event in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``recognizes that solving problems as president requires a
bipartisan effort,'' Hughes said. ``Today he began that process by
meeting with Republican and a Democrat to discuss an area that's
going to require a bipartisan consensus Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an appearance calculated to bolster Bush's appeal to
women voters, Bush also attended the Republican Women Leaders Forum
with his wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the usual podium, Bush spoke from a livingroom-style
stage set that resembled a daytime television talk show. Flanked by
leading Republican lawmakers, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas
and Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, Bush talked about his efforts
to improve educational standards in Texas, and his determination to
be a president ``that our children can respect,'' as Dunn put it.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing moral values as a top concern of voters, Bush
is engaged in a not-so-subtle effort to contrast his character and
23-year marriage to those of the impeachment-bruised president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country needs a leader who will bring honor and dignity to
the White House and, in turn, ask for the best from American,''
Bush told the Republican women's gathering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats dismissed Bush's strategy as an effort to make it
appear as though he's running against Clinton, not Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who knows Al and Tipper Gore knows what a strong moral
guy Gore is and how committed he is to his family,'' said Jennie
Backus, spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Among women voters, Gore narrowly leads in most polls. But
Bush's appeal to women far surpasses that of the 1996 Republican
candidate, former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll earlier this month by Emily's List, which raises money
for female Democratic candidates who favor abortion rights, Gore
led Bush in a sample of women voters 44 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But among white married mothers with children at home _ a
variation of the ``soccer moms'' who dominated the polling world in
1996 _ Bush is ahead of Gore 47 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The polls prove that although women voters have favored
Democrats in the past two presidential elections, ``we are not
one-size-fits all,'' said Republican co-chair Patricia Harrison.
``That doesn't work with bathing suits, and it certainly does not
work with women.''

   JONESES _ ATLANTA _ For nearly four decades, there has been a
member of the Jones family either playing or coaching the Albany
State University basketball team. Oliver Jones arrived in south
Georgia from McGehee, Ark. in 1961 and five of his younger brothers
(Melvin, Wilbert, Caldwell, Major and Charles) also played at
Albany State before moving into professional basketball. Oliver has
been head coach at Albany State since 1972, and is the one of the
winningest coach in school history. But after 24 losses last
season, Jones has been forced out as coach. Next season will be the
first in 40 years that one of the Jones brothers has not been
associated with the Albany State program. (Reese, Atlanta

INTERNET GIVES HIGHWAY PHOTOS A WAY TO BE SEEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thanks to the Internet, a 42-year-old engineer from
Texas named Matt Frondorf has done the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Frondorf's highway snapshots of his coast-to-coast auto trip
have been put on the Web, singly and in slide-movie form, and
instead of inspiring a race to the door, they have turned the
mundane into a work of art.
</P>
<P>
   About seven years ago, Frondorf, of San Antonio, who drives a
lot around West Texas in the oil business, got the idea of
memorializing the landscape from New York City to San Francisco by
rigging a camera to take photographs from his car exactly one mile
apart. His first attempt, using interstate highways, was
unsatisfactory; they bypassed too many small towns, and there were
too many pictures of rock faces and concrete walls instead of
vistas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't get a good view of what was really there,'' he
said. ``I wanted to see the Rockies rise out of the wheat fields of
Western Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1993, with a camera attached to the front passenger window
of a Ford Explorer, and following older roads like federal Highways
30, 40 and 50, he took 3,304 pictures, starting with Nos. 1 and 2
(Lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty, which he took standing
in Jersey City, N.J.; they were his only shots on foot) and ending
with the Golden Gate Bridge from the Marin Highlands. Each night,
as the sun set, he marked the spot where he took his last photo and
went looking for a motel. In the morning, he would return to the
same spot.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs languished in several suitcases while he sought
in vain to interest a publisher. Then he wrote to Eastman Kodak
Co., which was looking for photo features for its Web site, and it
arranged for Second Story Interactive Studios, a Web production
company in Portland, Ore., to put it online a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The feature, ``American Mile Markers,'' can be accessed off
Kodak's home page (www.kodak.com, and click on ``previous
features''), where it is listed along with photographic adventures
like Shackleton's ``Endurance'' Antarctic voyage and the space
program.
</P>
<P>
   By themselves, the photographs are uninteresting, Frondorf
admits. Together, they are an epic, greater than the sum of its
parts. They are what Frondorf calls statistical photography:
showing everything and letting chance, not an editor, sort out the
highlights. Everything has equal weight, he noted: the homeless
person in New Jersey and the cowboy in Nevada, the trailer house in
the desert and the World Trade Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to create a continuum that would be a panoramic
cross-section of the country, that would be totally objective and
totally candid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures grow on you, as Frondorf wrote in an introduction,
``with city streets flowing into farms and prairies, parched
deserts flowing into forests and mountains, and thunderstorms
rolling into azure skies.'' Mile 30: Honest Al's used car lot on
Market Street in Paterson, N.J. Mile 234: a Civil War statue at
Gettysburg, one of the few photos where Frondorf cheated by a few
yards to get a better shot. Mile 1504: a grain elevator in Bavaria,
Kan. Mile 2811, east of Eureka, Nev.: cowboys in a roundup; they
are branding a calf, and one rider has his lasso in the air. Mile
3099: Stevens Peak, the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures can be viewed singly, or at 25-mile and 100-mile
intervals. They can also be viewed in quick succession in movie
form.
</P>
<P>
   Frondorf's original idea was to present the photographs as a
panoramic strip, and he is still looking for a publisher. But while
some claims for the Internet may be out of proportion, he said the
medium seemed perfect for this project. The United States may be
unique for this kind of a travelogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really the only place in the world where you can drive
3,000 miles and it isn't a wild adventure,'' he said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow fell in parts of southeastern New England on Wednesday as a
cold storm drifted north along the coast. The storm will reach the
Canadian Maritimes on Thursday. This storm track would normally
result in drier air reaching the Northeast, but a contorted flow of
the jet stream will force some of the storm's moisture westward,
causing clouds and spotty showers across the interior Northeast on
Thursday. Flurries are also possible in the mountains of New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms will occur across
North Texas as humid air from the Gulf of Mexico intercepts an
approaching cool front. A few light showers will also fall farther
north in the Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A band of showers will accompany a cold front advancing into the
Pacific Northwest. Isolated thunderstorms are possible late
Thursday over interior Washington and Oregon.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FUNNEL CLOUDS
</P>
<P>
   Several funnel clouds were observed in northeastern Kansas on
Tuesday. Often the forerunner of tornadoes, funnel clouds are
typically outgrowths of severe thunderstorms. When the wind changes
speed and direction as altitude increases, updrafts _ the rapidly
rising currents of air that sustain thunderstorms _ can begin to
rotate. Air rushing into the spinning updraft cools and its water
vapor condenses to form a funnel cloud. If a funnel touches the
earth, dust and debris are swept upward and a tornado is born. &QL;

 &HT;    Many Vietnamese recall U.S. role with sadness
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Master Sgt. Chieu Q. Phung served seven years in the
U.S. Marine Corps, fighting to keep the communists from taking over
South Vietnam. When the Marines pulled out in 1972, Phung switched
to the South Vietnamese Army to keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   And 25 years ago this Sunday, Phung tried to reach the roof of
the U.S. Embassy in Saigon to catch a helicopter ride out of the
country. The throngs of people already on the building made it
impossible, and South Vietnamese First Lt. Phung could only stand
and watch as the last U.S. helicopter lifted off and flew away.
</P>
<P>
   It was, he said, a terrible sight to see. The United States
abandonment of South Vietnam was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Every year on April 30, Vietnamese in the Atlanta area get
together to observe the day. People share stories of the war and
how they fled Vietnam. More importantly, they talk about the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a quarter of a century later, Phung, 64, lives a happy life
in Doraville. He has been a U.S. citizen since 1989. He is deputy
director of the local chapter of the International Rescue
Committee, an agency that works with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But, like many Vietnamese in the Atlanta metro area, he still
looks back at the end of U.S. involvement in his native land with
sadness. They had felt so certain that the United States, with all
its weaponry and manpower, would never let the communists win the
war. But, Phung said, they were betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt very bad about the United States leaving one of
its allies in the lurch,'' he said. ``A lot of victims were left
behind and put in communist hands and in re-education camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Phung spent 4 1/2 years in a re-education camp in the central
part of the country, near Tuy Hoa. He worked 10 or 11 hours a day
in the fields on little food and then was forced to say that he had
not done enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to say something you don't want to say,'' he
recalled. ``That is mental torture.''
</P>
<P>
   After his release, he tried three times to leave on a boat, but
was intercepted. Then his former wife, who was living in Italy,
used diplomatic channels to get him out of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe my life to her,'' Phung said.
</P>
<P>
   When the wheels of the plane lifted off the runway at Tan Son
Nhut airport, Phung was swept with relief. He couldn't believe it.
He would survive.
</P>
<P>
   He misses the landscape of Vietnam and the sights of his youth.
But he has never been back. Nor will he go while the communists
still hold power.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta resident Victor Nguyen Vinh has never returned, either.
</P>
<P>
   Vinh, 67, the owner of Asian Business Community Services,
remembers April 30, 1975, vividly. It is the day he left Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was trying to get out that day,'' he said. ``It was
chaos. We didn't have time to weigh any decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinh had been a military judge in Saigon for 17 years. If he
stayed, he feared he would be sent to a re-education camp, as
happened to many of his friends. He and a son jumped on a ship and
left the country, leaving behind his his wife and two other
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult time for me,'' he said. ``We had to do
whatever we could to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife and family joined him in Atlanta in 1980. Though it has
been 25 years, he wants one day to visit Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to visit the cemetery where my ancestors are
buried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as relations have warmed between the U.S. and the communist
rulers of Vietnam _ and as U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has paid
a friendly visit this week to the country where he was once held as
a prisoner of war _ many expatriate Vietnamese retain an
uncompromisingly anti-communist point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Lilburn resident Tom Nguyen, 37, who is president of the
Vietnamese Community Association of Georgia, was 12 when Saigon
fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was complete panic and chaos,'' he said. ``There were
people running everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He will never go back while the communists hold power. ``They
treat people like non-human beings,'' he said. ``We cannot freely
believe in God or Buddha. There is no freedom of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will Thanh Cao, 67, return. The Alpharetta resident was a
captain in the South Vietnamese Army and spent nine years in
prison. The U.S. betrayal, he said, made him feel as if he had
fought for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling that South Vietnam was betrayed is not limited to
people who were living there at the time. Monsignor Francis Pham
Van Phuong, 60, of Our Lady of Vietnam Catholic Church in
Riverdale, spent the last three years of the war in Connecticut,
where he was earning his master's degree in counseling at Fairfield
University.
</P>
<P>
   So, like many Americans, Pham, 60, spent the early 1970s
transfixed by television coverage of the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the TV every minute,'' he said. ``I followed it
closely. My family _ my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters
_ were home in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   He was angered by the images of people protesting U.S.
involvement in Vietnam, whom he feels were misled by news reports.
Those accounts made it seem as if the U.S. effort was not a worthy
cause, when Pham strongly believes that it was.
</P>
<P>
   And that day 25 years ago, when the last chopper lifted off the
rooftop as people still tried to clamber aboard, was terrible, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not stand it,'' he said. ``I cried all the time. It
was heartbreaking, even for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Pham has returned to Vietnam several times. ``I could not say
the mass in Vietnam, even today,'' he said. ``They say you are a
priest from outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Thi Hang, 57, who owns Cha Gio restaurant in Midtown, escaped
the turmoil of the U.S.'s final week in Vietnam.

   ``I worked for the government, so I knew we would be evacuated
at any time,'' she said. ``We knew we were leaving, but we didn't
know when or how or where we were going.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days before Saigon fell, Hang and her husband and nine
children left Saigon on a military flight. They flew first to the
Philippines, then to Guam and on to Hawaii. Then they were sent to
a refugee camp in Fort Chaffee, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   They were some of the first people there. ``Then thousands
started arriving,'' she said. ``And thousands more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hang has done well here. All nine of her children have graduated
from college. One daughter is on the U.S. Olympic fencing team. One
son is a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Some expatriate Vietnamese believe those refugees _ while they
were forced to leave their homeland by air, by boat or any way they
could _ ultimately prevailed. They brought the world the truth
about communism, helped change the political climate in the United
States and other countries, and contributed to communism's global
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but to Hang, the war itself accomplished nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a waste,'' she said. ``It is an awful thing when you
die without a reason.''

   Other than forest ranger or possibly professional surfer, no
occupation has more romance to the cubicle-bound daydreamer than
surveyor: the great outdoors, the hard hats and, most of all, the
cool gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   The Leica LRF 800 Rangemaster enables anyone to become an
amateur surveyor, although it does not have quite the same accuracy
as the professional models. With a laser beam and an optical
rangefinder system, the device instantly measures distances between
33 feet and a half-mile. Users sight their targets through a
monocular viewfinder with seven times magnification. The distance
to the object is projected in the viewfinder _ in either yards or
meters _ by light-emitting diodes that automatically adjust to the
ambient light.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rangemaster's readings are only accurate within 40 inches
either direction, the $449 hand-held device is not suitable for,
say, bridge building. But Roger Horn, president of Leica Camera
Inc., the German company's U.S. agency, said that level of
precision is more than enough for hunters, golfers or gardeners
laying out plots.
</P>
<P>
   There is one type of outdoor enthusiast, however, that may have
some trouble with the device. ``I've had a lot of boaters say this
would be great,'' said Horn. ``But it would be very difficult
keeping it steady to take a reading in a moving boat.''

   Judge Backs Search Engine's Use of Copyrighted Images
</P>
<P>
   When Leslie A. Kelly, a photographer in California, discovered
last year that several pieces of his work were being used on the
Web without his permission, he did what many artists would do: He
sued the Web site's company to stop posting pictures without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   His case, however, came with a twist. The company that used his
images was not just a Web site; it was an image-based search engine
using thumbnail versions of his photographs as part of its index.
Ditto.com, as the company is now called, includes millions of such
images. And its officials argue that making copies of these images
is, in legal terms, fair use of the copyrighted material because
they are not trying to sell the images; they are simply using them
to build their search engine.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in California has ruled in the company's favor.
Gary A. Taylor, a judge for the U.S. District Court in central
California, ruled last month that Ditto.com's use of Kelly's images
was ``less exploitative'' than traditional commercial uses would
be. Even though Ditto.com is using the images commercially, Taylor
wrote, the company's use of them as part of a search index was
different enough to be considered fair use.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Willis, president and chief executive of Ditto.com, said
the ruling established that ``impeding search would be a huge
disservice to all Internet users who rely on search to help them
find what they are looking for.'' He added that Ditto.com no longer
uses Kelly's images.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawsuit is hardly over. Kelly has appealed the ruling to
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is expected to hear
his case in the next year. One of his complaints is that Ditto.com
has changed its practices since he sued. When the company first
posted his images, he said, it was not only using his material for
its index but also was giving users an easy way to download the
images without any indication that the material was copyrighted.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he is worried about Web sites' taking Ditto.com's
lead if the judge's ruling stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continue to harvest images without permission for their
commercial use,'' he said. ``The outcome of this case will define
use of images by surfers or businesses for quite some time.''

   Microsoft Offers A Dictionary That Talks
</P>
<P>
   If you're baffled by the upside-down characters and odd accents
most dictionaries use to show pronunciation, you're not alone.
``It's a very widespread perception,'' said Richard Bready,
managing editor of the Microsoft Encarta Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's answer, which went online this month, is a
dictionary that talks. About 60,000 of the roughly 100,000 word
entries posted on the Encarta World English Dictionary site
(www.encarta.com) contain a small speaker icon. When clicked, it
produces a tiny audio clip of what Bready and his 300
lexicographers have determined to be a word's most common
pronunciation in the United States. The emotionless male voice that
supplies the pronunciations for the dictionary's sound clips
belongs to an actor ``chosen primarily for his clarity of speech,''
said Jeffrey Smith, the group product manager for Encarta.
</P>
<P>
   The online version of the dictionary is available at no charge
to users. However, it does not contain additional reference works
like a thesaurus and a style guide that are packaged in the $59.95
CD-ROM version.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative pronunciations for words used in other
English-speaking countries are currently on the Web site only in
text form. But Smith, who was born in Canada, said audio clips of
those versions may be offered in the future.

   Going From Carmen Sandiego To an Online Recruiting Site
</P>
<P>
   What do you do if you are a software engineer looking for life
after Broderbund Software, the computer game company of Myst and
Carmen Sandiego fame?
</P>
<P>
   Why, start an online recruiting site, of course.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem counterintuitive, but that is precisely what a group
of Broderbund engineers, including Broderbund's co-founder, Douglas
Carlston, did after Broderbund was bought by the Learning Co. in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The well-financed Web site, called ICplanet (IC stands for
independent consultant), which went online Wednesday, uses a
sophisticated search technology to match recruiters and managers
with temporary contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The company's main focus is on information technology workers.
Some of the other job categories that ICplanet focuses on include
marketing, business development, training and finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ugly truth is that it can be very frustrating for
recruiters to find qualified technical consultants,'' said Jeffrey
Walker, ICplanet's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the site is its search
technology (patent pending), which works with the use of pull-down
menus instead of search terms typed in by the user. Carlston said
the search engine learns as it goes and gradually begins making
suggestions to the user for refining a search.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could come back to you and say if you expand the radius of
your search, you'll get 20 more people in the database,'' Walker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlston said ICplanet is not as far afield from Broderbund as
one might think, as its main strength is its software. ``A group of
eight technologists started the company,'' Carlston said. ``It
wasn't started by marketing people. That's what attracted me to the
company.''

   George W. Bush's first fund-raising effort for the Republican
Party will collect a record $18 million at a black-tie gala
Wednesday night in Washington boasting a guest list that reads like
a Who's Who of interests with business before the government. AT&AMP;T,
the NRA and tobacco giant Philip Morris are just a few of the
companies and groups that will wine and dine with Bush and GOP
lawmakers. In all, 38 companies or individuals raised or donated at
least a quarter-million dollars for the Republican National
Committee, and an additional 16 shelled out at least $100,000,
according to a donor list obtained by The Associated Press. One
co-chairman, who raised or contributed at least $250,000, is
Kenneth Lay, head of the Texas-based energy giant Enron Corp. The
previous record for a political party in a single night was $14
million last year when Bush's father, the former president,
headlined the same event.
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE STATESMANSHIP FOR AN APPETIZER
</P>
<P>
   Before attending Wednesday night's GOP gala affair, George W.
Bush, whose foreign policy credentials have been questioned by
critics, met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, in
Washington to see President Clinton and other U.S. officials. Bush
and Ivanov talked of peace and progress though still disagreeing
over U.S. proposals to build a national missile defense system.
Bush and his wife, Laura, were also the keynote speakers on a
midday panel at a conference of Republican women leaders. In
addition, Bush met Wednesday with Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) to
discuss Social Security policy, a session advisers hoped would
highlight the Texas governor's pledge to bring a bipartisan spirit
to Washington. Cox News Service's Jena Heath and Ken Herman report
that Bush's speech Wednesday night will have an end-the-gridlock
message centering on ``changing the tone in Washington.''

<P>
   GUNNING FOR GLORY
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, who runs the National Rifle Association, will
have a seat at the big spenders' table by virtue of his
organization's $250,000 pledge, The New York Times reports. In
fund-raising letters to its membership, the NRA has touted George
W. Bush's support of concealed-gun laws, asking members to
encourage him ``to continue his strong stance in favor of your
Second Amendment rights.'' The NRA also has switched from
hard-money donations to candidates to a ``soft money'' strategy,
the Times said, giving $540,000 to Republican Party election
committees this year. Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said
his boss couldn't be happier than to be an NRA-backed candidate.
</P>
<P>
   HE'S NOT A REAL DOCTOR, BUT HE GOES TO DRUGSTORES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore campaigned for increased government health care help for
the elderly Wednesday, standing with a 65-year-old woman and her
monthly supply of drugs at a pharmacy in East Hartford, Conn.
Shirley Kindle of Ansonia accompanied Gore to Pelton's drugstore
earlier for what he called ``an illustration'' for invited news
cameras: pharmacist Hal Schoen lining up on the counter Kindle's 12
different prescriptions and ringing up the total to $506.34. Kindle
told Gore the amount was ``more than I get from Social Security.''
She said her husband made a little too much money to qualify for
government assistance, at which point Gore chimed in: ``She was
advised if they got divorced she'd be eligible for some low-income
assistance, but she said after 35 years she's really not ready to
give him up.''
</P>
<P>
   MILKING THE UPSTATE FARM VOTE
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that farmers should be
given more breaks on estate taxes so businesses can be kept in the
family. Visiting a century-old dairy farm in Sheldon, N.Y., near
Buffalo, she said the exemption on family farms and family-owned
businesses should be raised to $1.75 million, up from the current
$600,000. (That figure is scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006.)
As some of the farm's 289 cows mooed in the background, the Senate
candidate said she would work to lower utility and labor costs, and
other taxes that make farming difficult in New York.
</P>
<P>
   HEY, GUYS, THAT WASN'T INTENDED FOR YOU
</P>
<P>
   New York Senate candidate Rudy Giuliani said he wouldn't
apologize for characterizing the federal agents who seized Elian
Gonzalez as ``storm troopers,'' adding that it was ``an appropriate
criticism'' directed not at the agents but at President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno. ``I'm not going to back down from
it,'' Giuliani said at Shea Stadium. ``I've been involved in law
enforcement for a very long time. I've never seen a situation in
which a 6-year-old was removed in that way.'' But Giuliani took
care to say that the term ``was not intended as a criticism of the
particular law enforcement officers carrying out the mission.''
Earlier, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a
nonpartisan group representing 17,500 federal agents and officers,
expressed ``strong disgust and dismay'' with the labeling of the
officers as storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   RUDY RUNNING WELL UPSTATE
</P>
<P>
   A new poll conducted by Zogby International for Colgate
University shows that Rudy Giuliani ``appears on his way to
controlling the upstate vote in his bid for the U.S. Senate,'' the
Washington Times reported. The poll, with a margin of error of 3.2
percentage points, shows Giuliani leading Hillary Clinton by 14.
Fifty-two percent of those polled said they would vote for
Giuliani, although Clinton has a slight lead in the state's
cities.``Giuliani is right where he needs to be right now,'' Zogby
said. ``But Hillary is campaigning vigorously in those cities,
where 40 percent of the vote is.''
</P>
<P>
   THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GENDER GAP
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has seen George W. Bush cut into the Democrats'
traditional support among female voters, but Gore also finds
himself distantly trailing Bush among men _ a situation that has
gotten less attention but presents a fundamental hurdle in White
House bid. In the latest USA Today-CNN-Gallup Poll, Gore and Bush
split the female vote evenly, but Bush led among men by 17 points _
and among white men by 26 points: 59 percent to 33 percent. USA
Today reported that independent pollsters calculate that Gore, to
win in November, must cut that gap among white men in half. Even
though he would still trail among men, he could win if he built an
advantage among white women and generated strong turnout among
African-Americans, the Democratic Party's most loyal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   TRYING TO CHANGE THE CONGRESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to make the environment a bigger political issue, the
Sierra Club began an $8 million TV and radio campaign aimed at five
Senate and 12 House races. The ads will be combined with other
activities, including voter guides and fliers at community events,
as the group attempts to elect a more pro-environment Congress. The
ads attack the environmental records of six Republican candidates
and praise those of 10 Democrats. Only one Republican, Rep.
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, is singled out for praise. Since
1996, Cox's Ken Foskett reports, the Sierra Club has become one of
the most aggressive and effective practitioners of unregulated
issue advertising in political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH ATTACK, TIMES TWO
</P>
<P>
   An early Al Gore counterpunch to the George W. Bush compassion
campaign will be to remind voters of the deficits rung up under the
last Republican administration, according to The New York Times.
Gore said that eliminating the national debt by 2013 is a top
priority and warned Americans against the debtor days of Ronald
Reagan and George H.W. Bush, W's father. ``This is a test of our
memory,'' Gore was quoted as saying. ``Have we forgotten the
dangers of irresponsibility? Have we forgotten the virtues of
responsibility?''
</P>
<P>
   BRING ON THE `CYBER DEBATES'
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of a new nonpartisan political Web site hope it will be
the host for daily ``cyber debates'' between the presidential
campaigns this fall. The Markle Foundation is joining with 16
Internet traffic centers to produce Web White &AMP; Blue 2000, which
will also have links to political news and information furnished by
the participants. They include Internet giants America Online,
Microsoft and Yahoo!, major TV networks and some of the nation's
largest newspapers. ``The Web White &AMP; Blue 2000 sites will be a
collective resource for voters, for journalists and for those
citizens who usually sit on the sidelines,'' said Zoe Baird,
president of the foundation. The daily debates are scheduled to
begin in October at www.webwhiteblue.org
</P>
<P>
   BLACK FAVORITE IN THE BLUEGRASS
</P>
<P>
   A Louisville lawyer dropped his primary campaign against a woman
vying to become Kentucky's first black member of Congress. Ched
Jennings said he couldn't keep up with state Rep. Eleanor Jordan in
raising money. Jordan pulled ahead after getting endorsements from
Gov. Paul Patton, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
and some key labor groups. Jordan, the only African-American woman
in the Kentucky General Assembly, now has only minor opposition for
the May 23 Democratic primary. The Louisville-area district is
almost one-fifth black. Jordan is trying to unseat two-term
Republican Rep. Anne Northup. Republicans hold five of the state's
six congressional seats.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY GET YOUR GUN
</P>
<P>
   Chicago police have recovered a gun stolen from a Secret Service
agent assigned to protect Hillary Rodham Clinton last October. The
gun ``allegedly landed in the hands of a heroin addict who has been
arrested 33 times,'' according to the Chicago Sun-Times. The agent,
Mary Drury, was sitting at the bar in Chicago's Fairmont hotel when
the weapon was taken from her purse. The Sun-Times said the Secret
Service would not say whether Drury was drinking at the time: Drury
was ``protecting the first lady at the Fairmont that day, but, for
security reasons, officials declined to say whether Clinton had a
room there.''
</P>
<P>
   DOUBTS ABOUT HILLARY'S DONORS
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani, in the wake of an Albany Times Union report
showing that Hillary Rodham Clinton has a higher rate of in-state
donations, has accused Clinton of concealing her ``soft money''
donors. Giuliani spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum said Clinton is hiding
unsavory givers by shifting money from her campaign accounts to
Democratic Party accounts that accept soft money. ``They hide it in
this committee and then they transfer it,'' Teitelbaum said. ``This
is classic Clintonian mathematics.'' The Times Union said its
analysis of contributions covered hard money, and did not examine
the soft-money donations to either Clinton or Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL CROWDS FOR BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign swing through Baton Rouge, La., that drew a total
of about 100 listeners at two events, Pat Buchanan talked about
trade with China, illegal immigration and the Elian Gonzalez
matter. On the Elian matter: ``It's a sad day in America when a
little boy whose mother dies trying to bring him to freedom in the
United States is picked up at gunpoint to bring him back to Fidel
Castro.'' The Baton Rouge Advocate reported that when asked if his
third-party bid would ``hand the White House to Gore,'' Buchanan
said, ``Conservatism is more than Clinton-bashing. People come up
to me and say, `You don't want Gore (to win), do you?' But no one
comes up to me talking about how excited they are about the dawn of
the George W. era.''
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-PRIORITY DISTRICT IN INDIANA
</P>
<P>
   An Indiana congressional seat that was held by the Democrats for
20 years before going into the GOP column with Newt Gingrich's
Republican Revolution six years ago is up for grabs in a wide-open,
11-candidate primary. By November, both parties could spend $2
million on the House seat, now held by conservative third-term Rep.
David McIntosh, who's stepping down to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Six Republicans and five Democrats are vying for their parties'
nomination May 2. The GOP front-runners are former radio host Mike
Pence, who has strong name recognition, Jeff Linder, a state
representative. Pence leads in fund-raising, with more than
$291,000 as of March 31. Indiana Democratic Party spokesman Doug
Davidoff said there's no clear front-runner in his party.
</P>
<P>
   HARD NUMBERS ON SOFT MONEY
</P>
<P>
   The raising of lightly regulated campaign ``soft money''
campaign money picked up speed in the first quarter of 2000 for
Democrats and Republicans. From Jan. 1 to March 31, Democrats
raised $26.7 million in soft money donations and Republicans took
in $27 million. In all of 1999, the Democrats raised $49.4 million
in soft dollars and the Republicans raised $57.8 million. In the
first quarter of 2000, 104 donors gave more than $100,000,
according to Public Disclosure, a Washington firm that tracks
donations, and 21 gave more than $250,000.

&HT;     COURT HEARS ARGUMENTS IN GAY BOY SCOUT CASE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wading into one of the country's most volatile
cultural battlefields, U.S. Supreme Court justices struggled
Wednesday over the question of whether the Boy Scouts of America
can bar avowed homosexuals from serving as troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about the freedom of a voluntary association to
choose it's own leaders,'' said Scouts' attorney George A.
Davidson, arguing that the organization had the right to oust New
Jersey troop leader James Dale after learning he is homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said the Boy Scouts' strong belief in a ``moral code of
conduct'' had become so ingrained in the nation's consciousness
that the phrase, ``He's a real Boy Scout,'' had entered the
American idiom.
</P>
<P>
   By publicly admitting his homosexuality, ``Mr. Dale had created
a reputation for himself'' that would harm his ability to be a role
model for Scouts, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Evan Wolfson, Dale's lawyer, said his client did nothing to
wrong under the Scouts' moral code, which does not specifically ban
homosexuals from the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``They removed him for being a homosexual, but their policy says
nothing about being a homosexual,'' said Wolfson, adding that Dale
never attempted to use his position as a Scout leader to advocate
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said the Scouts kicked Dale out simply because he was
a homosexual, not because he was an advocate for gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is based on the identity of Dale and not on his
advocacy of gay rights,'' Wolfson argued.
</P>
<P>
   Dale and his parents listened to the arguments from the
courtroom audience.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1989, when Dale, then 19 years old, applied to
be an adult Scout leader of a troop in Matawan, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he had been an exemplary Boy Scout and had attained the
Eagle Scout Badge _ Scouting's highest award _ when he was a member
of a troop in Middletown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   His application for a leadership role was accepted and he served
16 months as an assistant scoutmaster for the Matawan troop.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Dale was attending college at Rutgers University.
There, Dale served as co-president of the university's Lesbian/Gay
Alliance and acknowledged his homosexuality in a speech in July
1990. His speech _ dealing with the needs of lesbian and gay
teenagers _ was reported in a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Later that month, Dale received a letter from the Boy Scouts
severing his relations with the organization. When Dale wrote back
demanding an explanation, the Scouts replied that his acknowledged
homosexuality was ``contrary to the values of the organization''
and that the Scouts ``specifically forbid membership to
homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale sued the Scouts for reinstatement under a New Jersey law
that forbids discrimination in ``public accommodation'' on the
basis of race, gender, religion or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   He lost in a New Jersey state trial court which ruled in 1992
that the Boy Scouts of America was not a place of public
accommodation. The court concluded that it would be
unconstitutional to force the Scouts to accept Dale because it
would be ``contrary to the BSA's rights to association.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1999, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned that
decision and handed Dale a victory. The state Supreme Court
rejected the argument that the Boy Scouts was a private membership
organization and had First Amendment rights of ``intimate'' and
``expressive association.''
</P>
<P>
   The court referred to the Scouts as a ``quasi-public entity''
because of its partnerships with public institutions and
facilities. The Scouts appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court.Throughout Wednesday's arguments before the high court, the
justices attempted to find a balance between the right of
homosexuals to have equal access to mainstream organizations, with
the right of Americans with similar ideas to form groups that
exclude people who don't share those ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David Souter questioned Davidson on one of the Scouts'
major arguments: that Dale was a ``gay-rights activist'' who
wouldn't be able to ``communicate Scouting's moral values.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter asked how Dale's ``mere admittance'' of being gay made
him an advocate of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Souter also pointed out that Dale repeatedly has said that he
would not advocate gay rights or homosexuality as a Scout leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Dale is not asking to carry a banner he's saying, 'I'm not
going to carry a banner,''' Souter said.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson responded that Dale ``put a banner around his neck'' by
leading a college campus gay-rights organization and by talking
with the media about homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the man was in Time magazine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Souter followed up, asking, ``So if a troop leader just told
other Scout leaders he was gay instead of a newspaper, he wouldn't
be excluded?''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said it would depend on the ``circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told Davidson that ``it sounds like
the Boy Scouts have a `Don't ask, Don't tell' policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson responded, ``I don't know if I'd call it that, but
something similar, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson also fielded a number of critical questions.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia asked him why the Scouts should be
required to accept as a leader ``someone who embodies a
contradiction of their message, whether the person wears a sign or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said there would be no contradiction if that ``person is
only saying, `I'm gay, here I am.'''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy quickly asked, ``Who is better
qualified to determine the expressive purpose of the Boy Scouts _
the Boy Scouts or the New Jersey courts?''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson answered, ``It depends.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's argument was the last for the current term, and the
justices will decide by July whether the Scouts had the right to
oust Dale.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court has straddled similar issues in the past, with
decisions that could favor both the Boy Scouts and Dale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the court let the private sponsor of Boston's St.
Patrick's Day Parade exclude a group of gays and lesbians. Parades
are a ``form of expression'' and private sponsors cannot be forced
to include a group promoting a message the sponsors oppose, the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in a trilogy of cases in the mid-1980s, the
court rejected claims by all-male organizations, including the
Jaycees and the Rotary Club, to a First Amendment right to continue
excluding women.

REEL-LIFE ADVENTURE IN THE SEARCH FOR SHANGRI-LAWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB DAVIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three acres of some grass, lots of weeds and a lawn mower
without an engine? OK, where are the Fox TV guys?
</P>
<P>
   This scenario seems like a pilot for one of those reality-based
programs _ ``When Good Gardeners Go Bad.'' But this is more than a
gimmick designed to keep some Bubba's backside glued to the couch.
</P>
<P>
   It is an inner struggle. A turf war of the soul, if you will. A
battle of saving the planet vs. being a real guy. Hugging a tree
vs. mowing it down with my gas-guzzling mower. Will I be Captain
Planet _ or Mr. Douglas, bopping along on that tractor in the
opening scene for ``Green Acres?''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for my conflict is simple enough: The air in parts of
North Texas is dirty. The air is full of pollutants that scientists
say cause health problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's so dirty that unless it gets cleaner, the Environmental
Protection Agency could inflict drastic measures. (Hint: Say
goodbye to those highway funds.)
</P>
<P>
   Don't think Fort Worth-Dallas is the only part of the state with
dirty air; Houston has replaced Los Angeles as the city with the
most smog in the country, so it's worse off than we are.
</P>
<P>
   While various local government entities are fighting over who's
to blame and what can be done, the idea occurs that my big, old
nasty garden tractor isn't helping matters. Estimates predict that
some gas-powered mowers pollute as much as 50 to 350 times more
than a car does in an hour. If only I, and a few thousand others in
North Texas, cut back on our gas-powered mower addiction, the air
quality might be improved.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the reel mower, also known as a ``push mower'' or a
``rotary mower.'' No engine. No pollution. No problem?
</P>
<P>
   Well, one problem: I like my tractor. It's not a really big
tractor, only one of those small souped-up riding lawn mowers that
Sears sells. It's dependable over my rough-hewn 3 acres. It mulches
leaves and knocks down any kind of foliage in its way. It's your
basic ``guy's toy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nowhere near the size of my grandad's big Ford tractor, the
one he used to sit me on top of when I was just a pup. That
monstrosity pulled a Bush Hog and cut huge swaths through the
countryside. (Even today, he pays lip service to my ``garden
tractor,'' but I suspect all the while inside he's thinking I
should have to wear a dress while mowing with such a puny little
thing.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite its shortcomings, my little garden tractor is a big hit
with my 18-month-old daughter. She likes to sit in my lap for short
rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those precious memories, and it pollutes, too.'' That's
what the little green voice would whisper every time I cranked up
the mower.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever seen a reel mower, it was probably in an old
movie. According to the industry leader American Lawn Mower, that's
changing, with sales more than doubling since the mid-1980s. The
costs range from $100 to $250. Home Depot had ours _ a Scotts brand
for $100 _ on a high shelf, with very little in the way of signage
directing you to it.
</P>
<P>
   If you go shopping, be prepared: These Earth-friendly devices
are still stuck on the back of the retail bus. You'll probably have
to check in some out-of-the-way places for a reel mower unless you
go online.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits are plentiful for making that extra effort. Reel
mowers are quieter than gas-powered versions. They eliminate the
need for lugging that gas can to the local filling station or
getting the regular engine tuneup. They are easier to push,
although that is balanced with the fact that instead of horsepower
it's using you-power.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the fitness benefit of burning more than 500
calories per hour using the reel mower. Pushing one will give your
arms and legs a workout. Reel mowers are lighter than the motorized
kind, but don't kid yourself; they still weigh about 30 pounds, and
pushing one around your yard is not a day at the beach.
(Gas-powered mowers weigh about 70 pounds.)
</P>
<P>
   I tried the experiment of sprinting about 50 yards at a clip
with the reel mower. My legs got real tired real fast. Besides,
that's not very safe. Slow and steady pushing makes the job a
little more strenuous than pushing a standard-size wheelbarrow
half-filled with rocks or a stroller filled with a curious
18-month-old.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drawback is that a reel mower is meant for grass _
and well-behaved grass, at that. It doesn't do well whacking down
weeds or tall grass. The rotating blades get stuck in the tall
stuff, and you have to pull the mower back to get the thing
unjammed.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, a reel mower is best suited for small (half-acre or
less) lawns in the suburbs. (Do you think we can find a few of
those around here?)
</P>
<P>
   On my little plot of uneven ground populated by more clover,
weeds and dandelions, I would be better off with another
Earth-friendly device: a slingblade.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have a small plot of grass and a desire to go green
plus keep your neighborhood quiet, a reel mower might be for you.
</P>
<P>
   Can a real man be a reel man? I think so _ and that little green
voice agrees.

INTERMEDIARIES STEP INTO PRIVACY VOID
</HEADLINE>
 (Circuits)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shopping online or visiting a Web site that requires
registration usually means surrendering some privacy _ providing a
name, e-mail address and other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet users bristle at the notion that Web sites gather
such data, no matter how safely tucked away the companies say the
information is. On the other hand, some people are not bothered at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Just how concerned Web users should be about privacy, and how
much of it they should have to give up when they go online, is a
heated topic among Web companies, consumer advocates, and users
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the growing discomfort about how personal
information might be used without a person's knowledge, several
companies, including Enonymous, PrivaSeek and Zero-Knowledge
Systems, have developed ways for people to exert tighter control
over who knows what about them. The companies, which call
themselves ``infomediaries,'' act as intermediaries, collecting
personal information from a user and providing it to other sites
with the user's approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that consumers are concerned about privacy
but that very few people get involved and actively watch what's
being done with their information,'' said Tim Kane, director of
privacy for Enonymous, San Diego. ``It's something they care about,
but they don't walk 10 feet for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But some privacy advocates say these intermediaries are part of
the problem rather than a solution because they could profit from
the very information they are protecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The infomediaries are just more third parties who can change
their mind while holding your information, or who could be bought
by somebody else who has a different privacy policy,'' said Lauren
Weinstein, co-founder of People for Internet Responsibility, an
organization in Woodland Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among the first things that a user does at an
intermediary's Web site is provide personal information. Surfers
can go to Enonymous.com, for example, and download a software
program called Enonymous Adviser. When launched, the program asks
the user to provide information including name, date of birth,
shipping and billing addresses, e-mail address, phone number,
credit card number and preferred method of contact.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the user goes shopping online or visits a portal or
other site that requires registration, Enonymous checks to see what
rating it has given the site's privacy policy _ whether and under
what circumstances it will share information it receives with third
parties, for example. The company has a team of site raters who
have given from one to four stars to more than 30,000 Web sites,
Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   If the site has a low rating or has not been rated, the
Enonymous Adviser sends a pop up message alerting the user. If, on
the other hand, the site has an adequate privacy policy, the
software retrieves the necessary data from the user's hard drive
and fills in the blank fields when the user registers or makes a
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Users can set up several different information packets. One can
contain only a name and e-mail address, for example, while another
can contain credit card information and a shipping address. The
user can then instruct the program to enter more or less
information as desired.
</P>
<P>
   Although the automatic form filler component is similar to other
``digital wallets'' offered by companies including Gator.com and
CyberCash.com, the ability to pick and choose the information
released based on a site's privacy policy gives users more control,
Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Enonymous get in exchange for all this
conscientious watchdogging? Nothing, yet. Kane said the company
isn't yet profitable, but that it expects to enter into
partnerships with other Web sites so that it can offer e-commerce
links, for example, at its site.
</P>
<P>
   Enonymous is hoping to make money by persuading users of its
software to give up some of their privacy to it. The site currently
beckons users to visit the ``Enonymous Community'' and fill out a
marketing survey regarding their hobbies, their shopping
preferences, and how they like to be contacted. Kane said Enonymous
will sell only this volunteered information. ``If we get a million
people who like this, we'll be able to charge merchants for the
information we give them,'' he said. Delivering banner
advertisements and e-mail messages to people who answered the
survey is also part of the company's plan. About half of the
100,000 people who have downloaded the software have participated
in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   PrivaSeek, Broomfield, Colo., assumes that customers are willing
to reveal some information about themselves as long as they get
something in return. The company's PersonaValet program functions
as a digital wallet, storing a user's information at a data center
(not on the user's hard drive), and letting the user pick and
choose what data a site can have. Privaseek does not rate sites,
assuming that users will read a site's privacy policy. Once a user
sets up an account, PersonaValet maintains for the user a record of
sites visited, on what date and what personal information was
submitted.
</P>
<P>
   The company has formed partnerships with several online
merchants, including ShopNow.com and RMI.net. In return for
PrivaSeek's services, users will see advertisements and special
offers geared to their interests and shopping tastes when they
visit partner sites, based on the information they have given to
PrivaSeek. ``Web sites are making a lot of money off of selling
this information,'' said Steve Lucas, chief information officer at
PrivaSeek. ``We believe consumers should profit from this exchange
too,'' he added, by getting discounts and other offers that are not
available to people who don't provide personal information.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom program from Zero-Knowledge Systems gives a Web
surfer anonymity by protecting identifiable information within the
network of the company's servers.
</P>
<P>
   People who download the Freedom software can create several user
identities, or pseudonyms. In addition to encrypting data so that a
person or another computer cannot read it, Freedom routes the
information through the company's network of servers so that it
cannot be traced to a user's computer. The information is invisible
even to Zero-Knowledge, said Austin Hill, president of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled a lot with how to build privacy into a protocol
that's never had privacy built in before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each pseudonym costs $10 per year and the software can be
downloaded at www.freedom.net. Hill said that Zero-Knowledge also
markets Freedom to companies that wish to protect their clients'
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly a market of users who are willing to go out
and pay for privacy,'' Hill said. ``But businesses are starting to
realize that privacy matters to their users.'' For example, he
said, if health care companies wanting to put individual medical
information online would have to be concerned with protecting
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Digitalme.com from Novell, which offers automatic form filling
in exchange for a customer's agreement to accept e-mail
advertisements from its partners, and Anonymizer.com, a portal that
sends users to its partner sites _ all of which have approved
privacy policies and which deliver banner advertisements based on
surveys the consumer has filled out _ are more variations on the
intermediary theme.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the intermediaries say that the companies fail to
provide enough protection and that they have the potential to
exploit what they are supposed to be protecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The infomediaries are a patchwork solution,'' said Chris
Kelly, an associate analyst at the Internet research firm Forrester
Research. ``They're taking the privacy issue far enough so that the
government doesn't come down hard, but even as far as they've come,
there are still privacy breaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein of People for Internet Responsibility said that
instead of using intermediaries, Web surfers should stop providing
sites with information if they don't necessarily have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should start saying no to these information requests,''
he said. ``Because in the end we're finding that very often the
information is being abused, sold, manipulated, or just plain
corrupted. It's just not worth it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Apart from the intermediaries, efforts to develop industry-wide,
enforceable privacy standards have been proceeding slowly. For the
past few years, the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization,
based in Washington, that sets standards for the Internet, has been
working on the Platform for Privacy Preferences initiative, known
as P3P. The initiative includes plans for a software program that
would let Web browsers automatically read a Web site's privacy
policy and compare it with the user's privacy preferences.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear how P3P will work with existing intermediary
programs, and whether browser companies and Web developers will
incorporate it into their products.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics of P3P say it does nothing to improve existing
privacy policies, or breaches of them. ``These companies have no
compelling reason not to pass on personal information to someone
who will pay for it, and P3P doesn't say that it shouldn't go on,
it only says you should know about it,'' said Andrew Shen, policy
analyst at Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.
``What we really need are higher privacy standards and
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   After a recent privacy conference, Richard Purcell, director of
corporate privacy for the Microsoft Corp., said the company was
working toward developing a P3P compliant program for businesses
and people before the end of the year. ``It will automatically
compare a Web site operator's privacy practices to the consumer's
preferences, and inform the consumer of any nonconformance or
mismatch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Cranor, chairwoman of the P3P specification working
group, said Web developers would see a working version of P3P this
summer. ``There are some who've been critical of the whole idea,
but it's not meant to solve all privacy problems,'' Cranor said.
``It's aimed specifically at providing consumers with notice about
a site's policy.''  &QL;

A RECIPE BANK THAT CHEFS CAN CUSTOMIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a world not too far in the future, where voice-activated
computers are installed in kitchens everywhere. Suppose the family
cook is throwing a dinner party: ``Computer! The recipe for beef
Bourguignon with fettuccine. Scale ingredients up for 15 people.
And give me a wine suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is probably a working model of such a computerized
kitchen somewhere, the recipe software is already here. Food fans
may want to take Sierra Home's The Best of MasterCook for a spin.
</P>
<P>
   This latest version of the popular MasterCook series
incorporates 10,000 recipes, culled from Betty Crocker cookbooks
and Cooking Light magazine and from the MasterCook Deluxe archives,
onto a set of two CD-ROMs. The program is more than a computerized
recipe index; it also provides a complete nutritional analysis of
each recipe and menu planning. Users can edit and add their own
recipes and send them to friends via e-mail, and they can drag and
drop recipes found on the Web into the program's database.
</P>
<P>
   Short videos showing some of the finer points of food
preparation are included with the program. If you're planning a
meal for more than the number of servings listed in a recipe, you
only need to click on the Scale icon and type in the number of
servings you need, and the program will do the math for you.
Templates for printing favorite recipes are also available.
</P>
<P>
   As you select recipes, the program helpfully keeps track of the
ingredients with a shopping list of the necessary items and
quantities required. The program's MealPlan function will let you
also drag-and-drop recipes into a dining strategy for the whole
day. Combined with the shopping-list function, that trip to the
grocery store can be completed with surgical precision.
</P>
<P>
   MasterCook's interface is easy to figure out because the names
of the tool icons pop up on the screen if your mouse lingers over
them. For those who find security in paper manuals, the program
comes with a hefty one.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are intimidated by 200-plus-page manuals may be a
little nervous around MasterCook's book, but the authors seem to
have taken a tip from the creators of those instructions for
dummies/idiots/morons books and written the program guide in clear
English with plenty of screen shots to guide the reader. When you
start the program for the first time after installing it, a box
pops up on the screen and asks you if you'd like to take a quick
tutorial of the software.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for recipes containing specific items can be very
slow, as the basic search function seems to go through each of the
33 cookbooks in the database individually. You can choose to search
specific cookbooks in the collection if you have a better idea of
where to look. There probably won't be any double-fudge brownie
instructions in the Hot Off the Grill section, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The Advanced Search feature is quite powerful. You can search
for recipes based on foods to avoid or include, the ingredients you
have in your kitchen (provided you have added your pantry's
inventory into MasterCook's database), the type of cuisine or the
recipe category.
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect from the Betty Crocker content, the recipes
in The Best of MasterCook are fairly mainstream. But more
imaginative dishes, like eggplant matzo lasagna, are sprinkled
throughout, and there are some nice selections from international
cuisines, particularly Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs with a sweet tooth will find plenty of cookies, cakes and
other desserts. Before-and-during libations are also included in a
cocktail guide and a wine-advisory section.
</P>
<P>
   On the technical side, you'll need a computer using Windows 95
or 98 to run The Best of MasterCook with, at a bare minimum, a
90-megahertz processor, 16 megabytes of RAM and 98 megabytes of
free hard drive space. When you install it, MasterCook gives you
three options for the amount of space it will grab from your hard
drive. Besides the minimum 98 megabytes, you can opt just to
install the cookbooks you are interested in, or you can install the
whole enchilada in exchange for 426 megabytes of your disk space.
</P>
<P>
   The Best of MasterCook is available on the Web at
www.sierrahome.com, in stores or by calling (800) 757-7707.
</P>
<P>
   Until computers invade kitchens, cooking programs are unlikely
to live up to their potential, but The Best of MasterCook could
make life easier for cooks and foodies. And with 10,000 recipes
easily on hand, ``what's for dinner?'' might have a lot more
answers.  &QL;

 &HT;    Female politician ruffling many in Republic of China on Taiwan
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most newly elected officials enjoy a political
honeymoon for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Not Annette Lu. Honeymoons aren't her style.
</P>
<P>
   Schooled in law at the University of Illinois and Harvard, Lu is
by anyone's definition a remarkable woman. A leading advocate for
women's rights at home and abroad, she also has been a determined
campaigner for expanding Taiwan's democracy. Her courageous
activism, while Taiwan was ruled under martial law, cost her 5 1/2
years in jail but also earned her recognition from Amnesty
International as a prisoner of conscience. Since then, she has
served in Taiwan's legislature and as a crusading anti-corruption
county governor.
</P>
<P>
   On March 18, at the age of 55, Lu was catapulted into a new role
as the first woman ever to be elected vice president of the
Republic of China on Taiwan or, for that matter, any state with a
Confucian cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Another politician might be basking in the symbolism of the
moment. But in the past month, Lu _ who will take office May 20 _
has not only feuded with members of her own party but become
embroiled in a high-stakes game of name-calling across the Taiwan
Strait that separates this island from China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, it was hard to say who had annoyed her
more: the ``male chauvinists'' of Taiwan or her critics on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that she had been treated like a ``forgotten concubine,''
Lu has complained loudly and repeatedly that she was shut out of
the process of choosing the new Cabinet. If anyone thought she
would settle for the role of ``political wife'' for the new
president _ her longtime Democratic Progressive Party ally, Chen
Shui-bian _ they were mistaken, she said.
</P>
<P>
   DPP Chairman Lin I-hsiung has responded publicly that ranking
party members _ and everyone assumed he meant Lu, in particular _
should study Taiwan's constitution and ``be circumspect in their
words and behavior to avoid damaging the party's image.'' When Lu's
name came up in an interview last week, the party leader chuckled
and said the vice president has no real power and is only a reserve
president if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Other party members have chimed in that the incoming vice
president should use internal communications, not interviews with
the media, if she has complaints. And even the future first lady,
Wu Shu-chen, has spoken out. Wu said Lu should stop pushing the
president-elect so hard, that she was the real ``forgotten
concubine,'' and that if people put too much pressure on her
husband he might ``go crazy and Lu would have to take his seat.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Lu has been making waves at home, she has unleashed a
tsunami across the strait. Tensions between Taiwan and the mainland
have been high because Chen and Lu will be the first politicians
from the independence-minded DPP to control the government.
</P>
<P>
   Though their party has long advocated independence from China,
both candidates pledged during the campaign not to push the issue.
Chen even said last week that some kind of loose alliance or
confederation with China might be a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Lu, however, triggered a barrage of criticism across the strait
this month when she told a Hong Kong station that Taiwan already
had ``independent sovereignty'' and repeated a remark she has often
made: the people of Taiwan and China are ``distant cousins and
close neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   China sees the people of Taiwan as anything but distant cousins.
And, in response to Lu's comments, Beijing's New China News Agency
editorialized that she is not only the ``scum of the (Chinese)
nation'' but a ``traitor'' and ``hideous.'' She was ``insane,''
too, the Liberation Army Daily added. And to the People's Daily,
she sounded like a ``lunatic leader'' who was propelling Taiwan
toward catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Far from retreating, Lu _ who has earned the nickname the ``Iron
Lady'' _ has fired back as she sat in her office talking with one
journalist after another.
</P>
<P>
   Though her duties in the new administration remain
``ambiguous,'' she said she has no quarrel with the president-elect
but does have complaints about some other officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these male chauvinists really made me angry,'' she said.
``Just because I'm a woman everybody asks me to shut up. ... I am
the second national leader. How can you treat me that way just
because I'm a woman?''
</P>
<P>
   And though she said she worries that the mainland government
could do something ``irrational,'' she was equally dismissive of
her critics in Beijing. No one in China should be upset, she
contended, because her message has emphasized peace and good will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are neighbors, so let's co-exist peacefully for mutual
development,'' she said, adding that the Chinese just ``don't know
how to react at all.''
</P>
<P>
   If her roiling of the waters in the Taiwan Strait should have
ripple effects across the Pacific in the United States, Lu didn't
seem to mind. The United States and Taiwan have strong economic
ties, and the U.S. is committed to providing the island with the
means to defend itself from any attack. Last week, the Clinton
administration stopped short of selling the Taiwanese the advanced
destroyers they wanted but did agree to sell long-range radar to
detect missile launches as well as provide training and technical
help. A bill, which passed the House in February and is now pending
in the Senate, would deepen the military ties.
</P>
<P>
   But more than weapons, Lu said, Taiwan needs the United States
to engage in preventive diplomacy. Not only should the U.S. tell
the Chinese they will pay a high price if they start a war, she
said, but President Clinton also should try to arrange Camp
David-style peace talks between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   While she was on the subject of American policy, Lu also raised
what she called a ``minor but significant issue:'' She and Chen
have been told through official U.S. sources not to plan to visit
the United States after they take office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that correct? Is that justified?'' she asked. ``Is China's
policy America's policy as well?''
</P>
<P>
   Such statements are not likely to calm Lu's critics in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Yawei Liu, a Chinese professor of history at Georgia Perimeter
College, cited her request for the United States to mediate between
the two sides as just one of several stances she has taken that
make Chinese leaders ``very nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kellee Tsai, a China watcher at Emory University, said that
in Beijing ``there is grave concern that if Chen Shui-bian passed
away, she would become president and become more open in advocating
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year when former President Jimmy Carter spoke in Taiwan, Lu
publicly demanded that he apologize for normalizing relations with
China in 1979. Carter turned paler the more she spoke, Lu recalled
with relish. But he refused to apologize, and Lu said she still
considers him ``very arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, when a group of mainland scholars visited
Taiwan, Lu demanded that they apologize for the statement from the
Chinese media that she is the ``scum of the nation.'' They refused,
too, and Lu called them ``arrogant'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lu doesn't always get what she wants. But in her three decades
as a leader of Taiwan's opposition, she has never hesitated to
disturb the peace. She insisted that as a member of the government
she will not be ``voiceless.'' And that is one pledge she seems
determined to keep.

TIME TO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the diplomatic detours have been traversed, all the bluffs
and delays played out, all the international maneuvering completed.
The time has finally come for Israel and the Palestinian Authority
to forge an agreement on the thorny issues of land, refugees, and
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have shown each other draft documents that state
their preferences and thus clarify the differences to be bridged
through negotiation. They have agreed to meet this Sunday in the
Israeli port of Eilat for intensive discussions in the presence of
American envoys who will take a more active mediating role than
they have until now, even being prepared to offer positive
suggestions to resolve disagreements between the principals.
</P>
<P>
   As the Israeli government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority grapple with the issues they
have postponed until the final stage of the Oslo peace process, it
should be clear to all that Israel is by far the stronger party.
The only cards Arafat has to play are gestures of renunciation and
reconciliation. In the name of the Palestinian people, he may
renounce property claims and declare an intention to live alongside
Israelis peacefully, as a good neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Barak may decide how much land the Palestinians
will recover, where that land is located, what the capital of the
Palestinian state shall be, what the limits will be on that state's
sovereignty, and to what degree more than 4 million Palestinian
refugees will enjoy either a right to return home or compensation
for their forced exile.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of the refugees, it is in Israel's long-term
interest to reach a solution to alleviate the profound grievances
of the Palestinian diaspora. Possibly nothing short of an absolute
right of return to homes and villages within pre-1967 Israel will
satisfy many dispossessed Palestinians. There are already signs
that members of the Palestinian diaspora are preparing to resist
anticipated backsliding by Arafat on the refugee issue. But the
more Israel can do now to help create a viable Palestinian state
and to make up for the injustices of the past, the more authentic
will be the peace they make.

didn't even know what she did in her off-hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just this quiet girl who came into class and left when
school was over,'' she recalled during a recent telephone interview
from a restaurant near her home in Baltimore. ``I didn't get to
stay for the fun things. I had to go right back to the skating
rink.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about everything has changed in the world of figure skating
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Now, competitions are on television nearly every weekend, and
young stars like Michelle Kwan and Tara Lipinski are household
names, making millions while performing triple jumps that Hamill
never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when Hamill steps into the spotlight to perform in the
John Hancock Champions on Ice Summer Tour 2000 show, which will
make a Houston stop May 2 at Compaq Center, she consistently
receives a warm reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always amazes me. I feel like the dinosaur out there, and
the people are just wonderful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the ancient age of 43, Hamill is old enough to be the mother
of many of the skaters on the tour. Of those affiliated with
Champions on Ice, only Brian Boitano, at 36, approaches her in age
and ice-skating longevity.
</P>
<P>
   The famous Hamill wedge haircut is flecked with gray now,
although she laughingly says that she has ``lots of help from my
hairdresser so you wouldn't know it unless you caught me between
hair colorings.''
</P>
<P>
   If photographs are any indication, she maintains a youthful look
that matches her attitude. She joked that perhaps spending all that
time indoors on the ice kept her skin from being damaged in the
sun. But she also believes skating is great exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were competing against the youngsters, I wouldn't be able
to (continue to) do it (as a profession),'' she said.
``Fortunately, my sport is also entertainment. One is able to do it
longer than a gymnast, who has to be 14 years old and a little
rubber band.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep in shape, Hamill skates for several hours six days a
week and does weight-training at least three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's not a luxury anymore; it's a necessity. If I don't
work out that much, I cannot even stay at a fit level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Hamill has remained largely injury-free throughout her
career, she recently hurt a couple of muscles while performing. She
returned to Baltimore to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred after she didn't warm up properly before a
performance because a reception for tour sponsors ran longer than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only had 10 minutes to put on make-up and warm up for the
opening number, and that's not nearly enough time,'' she said.
``Unfortunately, I had to learn my lesson. Those things are going
to have to take a back seat. I was disappointed. I was skating
well.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Hamill plans to perform two ``straightforward
skating'' numbers to music by Patti Lupone.
</P>
<P>
   She said the younger skaters on the tour don't often ask her
advice. ``And I don't know if I have any advice I could give them
that would be helpful because it's so different now. They have so
much pressure on them at such a young age.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, competition revolves around the ability to do a large
number of difficult triple jumps. When Hamill competed, jumps were
not so important.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she spent five hours a day tracing figure-eights on the
ice for a part of the competition known as compulsory school
figures. These were abolished in 1990, so now skaters devote their
time to perfecting triple jumps.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``There's so much more to skating than jumping and
spinning,'' Hamill said. ``I still think the art of skating is very
much in its infancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamill remains competitive with herself. She continues to do a
double lutz like she did when she won the Olympic medal and is
working on putting the double axel back in her repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   The double axel was the hardest jump in her Olympic performance,
and she is aiming to perfect it again to mark the 25th anniversary
of her Olympic victory next year.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult part of Champions on Ice, Hamill said, is
being away from her daughter, Alexandra. The 11-year-old joins
Hamill on the tour on weekends and returns to Baltimore on Sunday
nights to attend school the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill has been seeing a ``very nice young man'' for three
years. But having been through two painful divorces, she said she
has no plans to get married again.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't know how much longer she will skate professionally.
Her doctor tells her that she can continue for another 10 years if
she takes care of her body.
</P>
<P>
   But even if she chooses to end her professional career sooner
than that, ``I think I will always skate, no matter what,'' she
said, ``because I love it.''

WAITING FOR HARRY POTTER IN LONG LINES ON THE NET
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   417.
</P>
<P>
   According to my calculations, that is the number of times a day,
on average, that my 9-year-old daughter, Ella, asks me when we will
be able to buy the fourth book in the Harry Potter series.
</P>
<P>
   416.
</P>
<P>
   That is how many times I respond in a reasonable tone,
explaining patiently that we will have to wait until July 8, the
worldwide publication date for all English language versions.
</P>
<P>
   1.
</P>
<P>
   That is how many times _ usually after supper but before the
dishes are washed, while her little sister is mashing red Play-Doh
into the dog's tail _ that I say: ``Leave me alone about the Harry
Potter book! I can't take it anymore! I can't take it, I tell
you!''
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine, then, that it came as a relief recently when
Ella said she wanted to ask a different question. Until she asked
it. ``Mom, can I have your credit card number?''
</P>
<P>
   The question arose because my daughter, like generations of
intrepid young hackers before her, had begun to address her
repetitive questions to an authority figure infinitely more patient
_ and logical _ than the average parent. She had turned to the
computer. In an exhaustive question-and-answer session at the Ask
Jeeves search site, Ella had typed, ``How can I buy the fourth
Harry Potter book?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of countering that if she wanted an answer, she had
first better go make that bed and put away that stack of clean
laundry that had been sitting on her dresser for three days, the
wise computer offered Ella what seemed like a solution. It told her
that a number of online booksellers were already taking orders.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Amazon, which took advance orders last year before the
publication of the third Harry Potter book, a number of Internet
booksellers are following suit this time around. Ella compiled a
list of comparative prices that included not only Amazon (which is
discounting the book's $25.95 list price to $18.17), but also eToys
($20.76), Borders ($18.17), 1Bookstreet ($17.56) and Barnes &AMP; Noble
($18.16).
</P>
<P>
   The book, described on Amazon only as ``Harry Potter (NU)4,''
was the site's second-best-selling title one day last week. And at
Barnes &AMP; Noble, said Debra Williams, the company's director of
corporate communications, ``people have been asking us for the book
for months, and thousands have placed orders, both online and at
our stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a person who reserves a table at a trendy restaurant
several weeks before it's time to eat the meal, I figured that I
could get some peace of mind by placing an order online. And on
Amazon, where I make the bulk of my online book purchases, it would
not cost me anything because Amazon does not charge a buyer until
an order is shipped. And yes, I entered the credit card number
myself.
</P>
<P>
   But as Ella and I agonized over delivery options _ she thought
it would be reasonable to pay an additional $10.99 for overnight
delivery, while I favored the more frugal $3.99 standard shipping
option (three to seven business days) _ I began to feel the first
twinges of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   That is because I realized that placing an online order would
probably not get the book to us faster. In fact, we might get a
copy sooner if we just walked into a bookstore on the release date
and grabbed one from the ceiling-high stacks that the publisher
plans to distribute nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we were opting for convenience. Online booksellers must
wait _ like everyone else _ for the book's release date before
shipping. An Amazon spokeswoman told me that the company would ship
from its seven regional distribution sites ``after midnight on July
8.'' So the earliest an Amazon customer could get a copy would be
on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Did we really need the book any sooner? Truthfully, no. Because
then we would just finish it that much faster and Ella would start
asking me when we could buy the fifth book in the series. It seemed
more valuable for Ella to have a talisman. She wrote our Amazon
order number in her official Harry Potter notebook. It's on the
page with questions she is compiling for the author, J.K. Rowling,
who I hope will be prepared to discuss such minutiae as the details
of Harry's prescription for eyeglasses if Ella ever tracks her
down.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it was enough to know that a copy of the book would be
ready and waiting for Ella on the release date. She had a
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   But did she? I started thinking about a number of recent
disasters that occurred after shoppers flocked online to place
orders for long-anticipated, highly publicized products, like
Handspring's Visor personal digital assistant and Palm Computing's
collapsible keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Handspring had to halt online sales temporarily
because of unexpectedly high demand. And there is currently a wait
of at least two weeks for the Palm keyboards, which made their
debut in February. The company is scrambling to speed up production
to meet demand, but as of last week it had no firm date for when
the backlog would end.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Garrigus, a Palm spokeswoman, told me last week, ``We
knew it would be popular, but the demand has exceeded
expectations.'' The problem is, she said, that ``you have to have
enough bandwidth on your assembly line to make it, as well as
enough components to build it.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Scholastic Books, the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter
books, face similar problems? I called to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jacobs, the senior vice president of Scholastic's trade
division, tried to reassure me. ``Yes, it's been beyond our wildest
expectations,'' Jacobs said. ``But we're taking every possible
measure we can to anticipate how large the demand is going to be
and to meet it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he declined to say exactly how many copies Scholastic
planned to print, Jacobs said the figure was in the millions.
``It's big,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Online orders give the publisher an advantage in calculating the
size of the first printing. That's because the return rate, the
number of unsold books that retailers send back to the publisher,
is lower for online sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people have put their money down on these books, or their
credit cards, it's almost guaranteed that the copies are in fact
spoken for,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we'll get our copy right away?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do our best,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted that answer for now. I wonder if he would mind if I
called him back 416 more times.

   RUSSIA-U.S.-ARMS (Washington) _ The Russian foreign minister,
Igor Ivanov, laid down a challenge Wednesday, saying in a vivid
speech here that the Clinton administration should not follow
through on national missile defense and make the ``fatal mistake''
of changing the basic arms control treaty of the Cold War. Just
hours before Ivanov spoke Sen. Jesse Helms said that if President
Clinton succeeded in persuading the Russians to amend the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the deal would be
``dead-on-arrival'' in his committee. Helms derided the president
for wanting a ``final photo-op'' with Russians before leaving the
White House. By Jane Perlez.

<P>
   MATH-SCHOOLS (Undated) _ Three years ago, one of New York City's
most innovative school districts set out to tackle a nagging
problem: the math phobia that afflicts many students, and the
disparity between the test scores of white middle-class and Asian
students and their poorer black and Hispanic counterparts. The
district, stretching from the wealthy Upper East Side to immigrant
Chinatown, embraced a new ``constructivist'' curriculum without
textbooks, which preaches that it is more important for children to
construct their own solutions than to learn the standard
theoretical rules. Now the district is at the center of a rebellion
by parents, mathematicians and many mathematics teachers over how
to teach math that has shaken the education establishment from New
York City to Plano, Texas, and Lincoln, Mass. A special report by
Anemona Hartocollis.

<P>
   SCOTUS-BOYSCOUTS (Washington) _ The question before the Supreme
Court on Wednesday was whether the Boy Scouts have a constitutional
right to exclude gay members, but the justices did not seem
particularly interested in either Boy Scout policy or the future of
gay rights. Rather, what clearly concerned the court were the
implications of ruling for one side or the other. If the Boy Scouts
cannot exclude homosexuals, can they still exclude girls, the
justices wanted to know. More generally, the justices asked, if an
organization deems a particular kind of exclusivity to be central
to its identity, must courts take that assertion at face value? By

   SCI-COSMOLOGY (Undated) _ Astronomers are both elated and
puzzled over the first clear pictures ever taken of the infant
universe, before stars and galaxies formed and space was filled
with hot, turbulent gases. The images, produced by a balloon-borne
telescope that captured radiation emitted when the universe was a
mere 300,000 years old, were unveiled Wednesday at a NASA press
briefing. The images, which are being published in the journal
Nature, along with a separate commentary, hold both reassurance and
surprises for scientists trying to understand how the universe came
about in what they believe was a giant explosion, called the Big
Bang, some 13 billion years ago. By James Glanz.

   OBIT-MERRICK (Undated) _ David Merrick, the producer whose gift

Rich. (3200 words, with a separate and shorter version of about one

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush made the rounds in the
nation's capital for the first time as the likely Republican
presidential nominee, meeting Russia's foreign minister, appealing
for the women's vote, and replenishing the GOP's financial war
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was the centerpiece of a black-tie gala that raised a
record $15 million for the Republican National Committee. The
previous record for a political party's take in a single evening
was $14 million, raised last year when the candidate's father,
former President George Bush, headlined the GOP gala.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will win the White House; we will hold the House; we will
hold the Senate,'' Bush said in remarks prepared for delivery at
the gala. ``And come January, Vice President Al Gore will have one
last official duty: To swear in Senator Rudolph Giuliani of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is fighting First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton in a titanic struggle to succeed Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The gala gave Bush his first opportunity as the all-but-official
GOP presidential nominee to address the Republican Party
establishment and its business-oriented backers. The event featured
high-profile Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi and House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois,
and business contributors from AT&AMP;T, the Philip Morris Cos., and
United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   With National Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne
LaPierre serving as the gala's co-chair, Bush's appearance drew
Democratic fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much for George W. Bush's moderate makeover,'' said Gore
campaign press secretary Chris Lehane. ``Time and time again, when
he's had to choose between the gun lobby and our children, he has
stood with the gun lobby. He has supported guns in churches, and
opposed closing the gun show loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush said LaPierre's role in the gala did not
trouble him in the least. ``I know what I believe,'' he told
reporters. ``I support reasonable laws to keep the guns out of the
hands of people who shouldn't have them. I believe we ought to
enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Bush met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov, who was in Washington for meetings with President Clinton
and other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his second term as governor of Texas, is potentially
vulnerable to critics' charges that he is a lightweight on foreign
policy. The meeting with Ivanov game him a chance to ``talk with
him about some of the views he's expressed on the campaign trail,''
according to Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among these was Bush's support for rolling back the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which prohibits both nations from
creating shields of defensive weapons to shoot down incoming
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia adamantly opposes any such changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of principle, my job as president is to provide
stability in the world, to protect our homeland and our citizens,''
Bush told Ivanov, according to Hughes. ``I don't view your country
as the enemy, and you should not view our country as the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the two had ``a very frank, a very forthright''
discussion, adding that Ivanov ``made his country's position
clear'' on revisions to the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to build an image of bipartisanship amid the
constant back-and-forth with Gore, Bush met with Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb., and Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., to talk about preserving
Social Security. Earlier in the week, Bush took four Democratic
Texas legislators _ all Bush supporters _ to a campaign event in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``recognizes that solving problems as president requires a
bipartisan effort,'' Hughes said. ``Today he began that process by
meeting with Republican and a Democrat to discuss an area that's
going to require a bipartisan consensus Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an appearance calculated to bolster Bush's appeal to
women voters, Bush also attended the Republican Women Leaders Forum
with his wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the usual podium, Bush spoke from a livingroom-style
stage set that resembled a daytime television talk show. Flanked by
leading Republican lawmakers, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas
and Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, Bush talked about his efforts
to improve educational standards in Texas, and his determination to
be a president ``that our children can respect,'' as Dunn put it.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing moral values as a top concern of voters, Bush
is engaged in a not-so-subtle effort to contrast his character and
23-year marriage to those of the impeachment-bruised president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country needs a leader who will bring honor and dignity to
the White House and, in turn, ask for the best from American,''
Bush told the Republican women's gathering.

   Democrats dismissed Bush's strategy as an effort to make it
appear as though he's running against Clinton, not Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who knows Al and Tipper Gore knows what a strong moral
guy Gore is and how committed he is to his family,'' said Jennie
Backus, spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Among women voters, Gore narrowly leads in most polls. But
Bush's appeal to women far surpasses that of the 1996 Republican
candidate, former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll earlier this month by Emily's List, which raises money
for female Democratic candidates who favor abortion rights, Gore
led Bush in a sample of women voters 44 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But among white married mothers with children at home _ a
variation of the ``soccer moms'' who dominated the polling world in
1996 _ Bush is ahead of Gore 47 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The polls prove that although women voters have favored
Democrats in the past two presidential elections, ``we are not
one-size-fits all,'' said Republican co-chair Patricia Harrison.
``That doesn't work with bathing suits, and it certainly does not
work with women.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, GOP DRAW BATTLE LINES OVER MEDICARE COVERAGE OF DRUGS
 &HT;    690&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and his Republican foes drew
sharp battle lines Wednesday over competing election-year plans for
adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare, the federal health
insurance program for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was ``encouraged'' that Republicans have
proposed such benefits, and he insisted that they and congressional
Democrats should be able to work out compromise legislation this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the president blasted the GOP proposal as too limited,
calling it a ``phantom'' plan that could not be paid for under the
huge tax cut that congressional Republicans endorsed two weeks ago
in their $1.83 trillion budget resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would leave nothing left for a prescription drug benefit,''
Clinton said at a White House event to spotlight the issue. ``Any
prescription drug plan that is not adequately financed is not
available in fact, is not affordable to all, and therefore is not a
real plan at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan calls for $40 billion over five years to
help pay for prescription drugs for low-income Medicare recipients.
It calls for subsidies for other Medicare recipients who opt for
privately run prescription drug insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   The approach is expected to be woven into a broader approach to
Medicare reform to be taken up by the Senate Finance Committee as
early as May.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, working closely with the White House, are finishing
up their own proposal for a plan to spend $195 billion over 10
years, providing a prescription drug benefit to any Medicare
recipient who wants the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   By covering millions of Medicare beneficiaries, the White House
claims, the plan would let recipients take advantage of the same
sort of volume discounts that drugstores give participants in large
private insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have criticized that approach as too large and
unneeded. The GOP plan provides help to those who most need it, the
nation's poor, said House Republican Conference Chairman J.C.
Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans want to help seniors who rely on prescription
drugs but simply cannot afford them,'' Watts said in a prepared
statement. ``We want to protect Medicare, not recklessly bankrupt
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts said the White House approach to volume purchases and the
discounts that come with them reflected a ``socialist mentality''
that ``does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton countered that the Republican plan, by limiting the bulk
of its benefits to low-income recipients _ those with incomes below
$12,500 a year in the case of individuals _ it would exclude nearly
half of all the Medicare beneficiaries who currently lack
prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials also argue that political support for
Medicare would be weakened if important benefits were withheld from
those who paid the most payroll taxes to support the program.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties accused the other of using the issue to shore up
the support of senior citizens ahead of November's presidential and
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats insist on making life-saving drugs a campaign
issue,'' said Watts.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said Republicans had
embraced the idea of prescription drug coverage _ first put forward
by Clinton more than a year ago _ only in recent weeks, after polls
showed that Democrats led Republicans nearly 2 to 1 in voters'
perceptions of which party showed greater interest in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, we're close enough to the election next fall that
Republicans have decided that they can't continue simply to
stonewall on prescription drug coverage,'' Gephardt told reporters
at the White House. ``Unfortunately, their program is fundamentally
flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem of rising prescription drug prices was highlighted
by the release of a report showing that prices for the 50
prescription drugs most widely used by seniors have risen, on
average, twice as fast as the inflation rate over the past six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 11 drugs rose four times faster than inflation,
according to research compiled by Families USA, a non-profit
Washington-based organization that claims to represent health care
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also of high concern to AARP, the nation's largest
retiree group. Its data show that one-fourth of Medicare recipients
over the age of 65 spent an estimated $3,000 of their own money
last year on medical expenses not covered by their Medicare
insurance plans. A large portion of those out-of-pocket expenses
went to purchase prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk is cheap. Prescription drugs are not,'' said Gephardt.
``They're expensive, and they're getting more expensive every day.
Seniors need help now.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related move, Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., announced plans
to introduce legislation that would prohibit drug makers from
charging higher prices to Americans than they charge for comparable
medications sold abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said his office has done research showing that
prescription drugs are often sold in Canada, Mexico and elsewhere
around the world for a fraction of the prices charged in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he said, is that drug manufacturers seek to recoup
their production costs, as well as their research and development
costs, through their U.S. sales, while only hoping to recover
manufacturing costs through their sales overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the research and development work that leads to new
drugs, however,
</P>
<P>
   is funded through U.S. government grants or by the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., said Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current system leaves Americans feeling ripped off,''
Gorton said at a Capitol Hill news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies counter that they price their products in
accordance with local markets.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's bill would amend a 65-year-old law that forbids price
discrimination from one state to another. His legislation would add
to that bill price discrimination between U.S. and overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans should not pay higher prices for their prescription
drugs in order to allow foreign customers to pay lower prices for
precisely the same drug,'' said Gorton. ``My bill is aimed at
curing that.''

 &HT;    REBEL STATE EDUCATORS ENDORSE GOP EDUCATION PLAN
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rebelling against their peers, eight state
superintendents and commissioners of education Wednesday endorsed a
Republican proposal to give states much more flexibility in
spending federal education dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``State education agencies on average are forced to use over 40
percent of their staff time to deal with paperwork required by
federal programs, which make up only 6 percent of their education
budget,'' Virginia Secretary of Education Wilbert Bryant said as
the Education Leaders Council became the first national group of
educators to endorse the GOP approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``States want much more flexibility with all their federal
funds, including Title I,'' which consists of funds currently
earmarked by the federal government for use only in schools with
many low-income students, Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan endorsed by the eight-state council is called the
Academic Achievement for All Act, or the Straight A's Act. It is in
a major education bill that the Senate will take up next week.
</P>
<P>
   Today, federal grants are earmarked for specific purposes such
as reducing class size, educating children of migrants, educating
the disabled, opposing drug abuse or boosting the budgets of
schools in which most of the children come from poor families.
</P>
<P>
   The Straight A's Act would give each state the option of
choosing to ignore most federal restrictions when it decides how to
spend its federal grants. States that choose that option would have
to set academic standards for their students, with the risk of
losing federal funds if their students don't reach those standards
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a state leader, and someone offered to hand me a
check and say the only condition is that you have to tell me in
five years whether it did any good, I'd love it too,'' said Michael
Cohen, assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight A's doesn't require any tough-minded intervention in
low-performing schools, which is the hallmark of real
accountability for results,'' Cohen charged.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said the act's sponsors welcomed the
endorsement by the officials from Arizona, Colorado, Florida,
Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia, who oversee
the education of more than 14 million students, or 30 percent of
those in American public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But he conceded that virtually all other national education
organizations _ including the older, 46-state Council of Chief
State School Officers, to which some of the rebels still belong _
oppose the Straight A's Act.
</P>
<P>
   Carnie Hayes, director of federal-state relations for the
46-state group, said, ``a lot of this is just general revenue
sharing or block granting, in which the federal money wouldn't be
targeted to the neediest places or connected to national
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that unless the Straight A's portion is deleted, her
organization will oppose the entire bill.

US TO UNDERTAKE `NORTHWEST PASSAGE' VOYAGE THROUGH CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ America's newest military icebreaker, the
Coast Guard's USCGC Healy, is preparing to undertake a politically
sensitive voyage through Arctic waters claimed by Canada, officials
confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has secured permission from Ottawa,
the journey through the legendary Northwest Passage is likely to
trigger public controversy in Canada, which regards the labyrinth
of usually-frozen channels of its huge northern archipelago as an
internal waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The United States asserts the Northwest Passage is an
international waterway and that commercial and military vessels
should have the right to free navigation of the icy lanes linking
the North Atlantic to the rich markets of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the United States enraged its northern neighbor by
sending the icebreaker Polar Sea through the passage in a direct
challenge to Canadian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the United States apparently hopes to avoid a
confrontation with its close ally and largest trading partner.
Washington asked permission to send the powerful cutter through the
passage in July on its maiden voyage to its home port in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mutual agreement has been reached through an exchange of
diplomatic notes,'' said Buck Shinkman, spokesman for the US
Embassy in Ottawa. ``There has been no settlement of the overall
question (of the status of the Northwest Passage), but there is a
go-ahead for this particular voyage.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently completed at the Avondale Industries shipyard in New
Orleans, the 420-foot Healy, which displaces 16,000 tons, is the
first icebreaker built by the United States in a quarter-century,
said Philip McGillivary, science liaison for Coast Guard icebreaker
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ship is unarmed,'' he said. ``Although capable of search
and rescue, its primary mission is high-latitude scientific
research.''
</P>
<P>
   The vessel, which carries a crew of 75 and up to 35 scientists,
is undergoing sea trials off Greenland and next month will commence
ice tests off Canada's Baffin Island before heading west along the
treacherous sea route first charted by Norwegian explorer Roald
Amundsen in 1903-05.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the Northwest Passage looms as a potentially bitter
international controversy pitting Canada against not only the
United States, but the maritime nations of Western Europe and Asia.
In the past, Canada's insistence that it owns the passage was an
abstract matter, since the waterways running across the top of the
world are so clogged with ice as to make commercial navigation all
but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But global warming is thinning the ice packs, and many
scientists and military analysts predict that within a decade or so
the sea lanes of the Canadian Arctic will be passable for much of
the year by ordinary vessels, including oil tankers, freighters,
vacation cruise ships and regular naval craft. That could bring
about one of the most important changes in international shipping
since completion of the Panama Canal in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Plying the Northwest Passage between Europe and Asia shaves more
than 4,500 nautical miles off the journey by way of the Panama
Canal, saving shipping companies enoromous sums. Such an opening,
too, might finally make the transport of crude oil from the fields
of Alaska's North Slope to the cities of the American northeast,
including Boston, economically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But Canada is alarmed that commercial use of the passage would
inevitably lead to shipwrecks and oil spills in one of the planet's
most fragile _ and unspoiled _ ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the environmental worries are basic issues of national
security. Some Canadians fear the opening of northern waters to
world shipping could undermine the country's claim to vast Arctic
domains rich in resources but populated by only a few thousand
Eskimos and guarded by just 200 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's sovereignty over the Arctic is so sensitive that the
resolutely peaceful nation has pledged to use military firepower to
enforce its claim to the Northwest Passage, if necessary.
``National security, the safety of native coastal communities, and
the protection of an extremely vulnerable ecosystem are at stake,''
Col. Pierre Leblanc, commander of Canada's northern military zone,
recently told The Globe. ``We will defend our interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But Canada's Foreign Ministry insisted Wednesday that the
government is not disturbed by the voyage of the Healy since the
United States sought permission. ``This mission is not a
provocation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Reynald Doiron told
reporters in Ottawa. ``The United States has sought and obtained
Canadian consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Canadian officials will be aboard the Healy as observers
as it threads its way from Baffin Bay to the Beaufort Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Dorion stressed that Canada is not backing away from its claim
to the waters, and said that the United States, by seeking
permission, was effectively showing respect for the Canadian claim
``even though they dispute that claim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Healy's voyage will only be the third complete transit
through the passage openly undertaken by an American military
vessel since the two countries signed a 1988 agreement on
scientific cooperation in the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed by military analysts, however, that US
submarines regularly tresspass on Canadian northern waters, as do
the underwater vessels of Russia and France.

VIOLENCE RULES IN `FIGHT CLUB' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If Seven, The Game or even Alien 3 made you a fan of
director David Fincher, you should be enthralled by Fight Club, his
most audacious _ and violent _ work yet.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface it looks reprehensible. But if you can distance
yourself from its grim mayhem, the film can be intriguing _ at
first.
</P>
<P>
   In it, men disturbed by society's corporate bent and
materialistic mind-set vent their frustrations by flailing at each
other in secret brawls, then licking twisted liberation from their
cracked lips in the form of their own spilled blood.
</P>
<P>
   Their leader is Tyler (Brad Pitt), a revolutionary soap salesman
(don't ask _ it fits) who intellectually seduces miserable
white-collar worker Jack (Edward Norton).
</P>
<P>
   Soon Jack is living with Tyler in a decaying house, where Tyler
trysts with the troubled Marla (Helena Bonham Carter).
</P>
<P>
   Others join, and Tyler becomes the virtual fascist dictator of
an army of street fighters turned anti-establishment terrorists.
For Jack _ and the viewer _ things get out of hand, and it only
gets worse, as the film degenerates into a bloody blur.
</P>
<P>
   But the leads are superb. Pitt is persuasively articulate with
his charismatic swagger, while Norton is a study in defiant,
fiercely focused anger.
</P>
<P>
   As for Fincher, he keeps the pedal to the metal with a darkly
exhilarating style, even when it is used at the service of
sickening scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The fights will be too brutal for some, but fast-forward
controls should make the film easier to digest on video. And that's
a good thing, for despite its bloody mess, Fight Club offers food
for thought.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, after an absorbing first half, those thoughts
are engulfed in a flood of blood and yet another gimmicky plot
twist. It's as if Fincher wants to one-up The Sixth Sense, The
Usual Suspects and The Crying Game in one delirious swoop.
</P>
<P>
   He also falters via reliance on mere violence in response to
society's false values. Violence is just as false, and no film that
wallows in it can pretend to be hostile toward it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fight Club's carnage is emblematic of Hollywood's own
false values, which are no less driven by commerce than those of
the heartless car manufacturer for which Jack toils.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, violence sells. In the '30s it was feel-good
musicals. Today it's spectacular violence.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the ratings board. If movies were rated as
stringently for violence as they are for sex, violence would be
toned down and manageable. But they aren't, and the limits for
violence are continually pushed.
</P>
<P>
   Even such mainstream directors as Steven Spielberg have upped
the ante toward explicit gore while still making millions in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, violence has become a narrative cure-all for box-office
uncertainties. It's as much of a cliche and a cop-out as the
mass-market products Fight Club ridicules and reviles.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to be that way. In the far more turbulent
'60s, The Graduate's Dustin Hoffman didn't respond to youthful
disenchantment with ``plastic'' society by detonating bombs but by
pursuing reckless romance.
</P>
<P>
   And in the far more materialistic '80s, the yuppies of Lost in
America (Albert Brooks and Julie Hagerty) took an amusingly naive,
Easy Rider-style jaunt to free themselves from work-world tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers today seem to want no part of either approach. They
take the sadly safe commercial route of increasingly vivid
violence. Fincher hasn't made a nonviolent movie yet, and even his
themes are getting repetitious.
</P>
<P>
   In Fight Club, as in The Game, he shows a man stifled by
capitalism who comes alive only by facing mortal danger. Fincher's
answer to everything seems to be make-believe battles and gallons
of fake blood.
</P>
<P>
   The big baby. Fight Club may preach growth and liberation, but
it's utterly dependent on juvenile infatuations with thrill-ride
catharses to rub that message in your face.

DARKNESS FINDS NO ASYLUM FROM TV'S REALITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Are there some network series, no matter how well
received by critics, that are doomed by their gritty themes?
</P>
<P>
   To Peter Berg, who created ABC's ``Wonderland,'' about patients
and doctors in the psychiatric unit of a New York hospital, the
answer is an unmistakable yes. The series, which was heavily
promoted and earned strongly favorable reviews, was abruptly
canceled after its second episode on April 6 because of a
precipitous decline in its ratings.
</P>
<P>
   To Berg the cancellation was ``completely irrational.'' He said
that ABC executives aborted ``Wonderland'' without warning, even
before the show had a chance to find an audience as it faced the
enduring NBC powerhouse ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ABC executives said that as proud as they
were of the unsettling series, ``Wonderland'' was simply rejected
by audiences, who probably found it too dark and harrowing. Those
executives said that viewers were turned off by the show and that
neither protests from mental health professionals nor the
skittishness of some advertisers had any bearing on their decision.
ABC had ordered eight episodes, which leaves six unseen on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to interpret the behavior of ABC
executives,'' said Berg. ``I'm not privy to what goes on behind
closed doors at their meetings. But I know that when I was told by
Stu Bloomberg, the co-chairman, that the show was not able to find
an audience and was in the process of being rejected by audiences,
I literally had to laugh. I thought he was kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling me that the show could not find an audience
after two episodes while it was being pitted against one of the
most popular series in the history of television,'' said Berg, a
film and television actor who spent nearly seven months researching
the show at the forensic psychiatric unit of Bellevue Hospital in
Manhattan. ``It's absurd. The behavior of ABC in regards to
`Wonderland' is completely irrational by any standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Even rival television programmers said that ABC may have acted a
bit quickly but that such action was justified. The days of letting
a series ``breathe,'' or take its time to find an audience, are
just about over, those executives said. And this was especially
true of a dark drama like ``Wonderland.'' Although hit shows like
``Seinfeld,'' and ``The Practice'' began slowly and were able to
snare audiences, they said, those series hardly came with the
baggage of ``Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   So will the failure of a show like this one make it harder for
others with dark themes to prevail on network television?
</P>
<P>
   ``By their very nature most risky shows will probably not
work,'' said Lloyd Braun, co-chairman with Bloomberg of the ABC
Entertainment Television group. ``But you will, at some point, have
a breakout hit by taking those types of risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The show itself, which was made in an abandoned wing of the
Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens, took viewers into the lives
of patients with severe emotional and chemical disorders, some of
them violent. The show starred Ted Levine as the stern and
thoughtful head of a criminal psychiatry department. In the opening
episode a patient tries to harm himself with a syringe, and in the
scuffle that follows the needle pierces the stomach of a pregnant
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Caryn James, reviewing ``Wonderland'' in The New York Times,
called it gripping and dazzling. ``The uncompromising `Wonderland'
is worth every demand it makes,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Its premiere episode on March 30 was not a ratings disaster. It
was No. 2, with an average of 13.2 million viewers, behind a rerun
of ``E.R.,'' which had 14 million viewers. Nonetheless ABC
executives were alarmed by warning signs: in the show's first
half-hour, 14.8 million viewers tuned in. But by the episode's
second half-hour _ after the pregnant doctor was injured _ the
audience had dropped to 11.5 million, a 22 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   In its second week ``Wonderland'' was floundering. It lost about
20 million viewers delivered by its lead-in, ``Who Wants to be a
Millionaire,'' the No. 1 show in the nation, and wound up with an
audience of 7.5 million viewers. (The show did perform somewhat
better than CBS' Mafia series, ``Falcone,'' which also is no longer
on the air.)
</P>
<P>
   To ABC executives the decision to kill ``Wonderland'' was
plainly an uneasy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very up front with Peter,'' Braun said. ``Everyone
knew it was a challenging time slot. However, we had the benefit of
`Millionaire' as a lead-in. We were able to launch the show. We
could not have devoted more promotion resources to the show. A lot
of people tuned in the first week. But unfortunately the tune-out
was very significant. The following week was even more significant.
We saw nothing to gain by continuing in that time slot.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun said that there had been some backlash among advertisers
because the show was so bleak, but that this played no role in the
network's decision. Nor was the network swayed by complaints from
groups including the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill that
``Wonderland'' reinforced stereotypes about mental illness, he
said. (``Wonderland'' earned the cooperation of top doctors at
Bellevue's forensic psychiatric service.)
</P>
<P>
   Braun said that ABC took pride in the show, an offbeat one for
network television. The network spent heavily on producing and
promoting the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very proud of the work Peter did on the show, and we
have no second thoughts about our decision to air it,'' said Braun.
``Clearly `Wonderland' pushed the envelope in a way few shows have
done, and I hope we will continue to take these types of chances in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg said he was now working on two series for HBO but declined
to discuss their subjects. That cable network is the home of some
of the most provocative series on television, including ``The
Sopranos,'' about a Mafia family in New Jersey, and ``Oz,'' a
prison drama. Executives there indicated that there was a slim
possibility that the setting for ``Wonderland'' could be used for
an HBO series.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives at ABC and elsewhere said it would be unfair
to regard the early death of ``Wonderland'' as a symbol of
television's indifference to serious shows. Successful series as
different as NBC's ``West Wing,'' ABC's ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' and Fox's
``Party of Five'' tackle serious issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't `Law and Order' a serious show?'' asked Leslie Moonves,
CBS' president and chief executive. ``Isn't `E.R.' a serious show?
Isn't `Judging Amy' serious? A show that's dark and bizarre may
have trouble. But there are plenty of serious shows on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly Karey Burke, executive vice president of prime-time
series development at NBC, said: ``Of course you can tackle serious
shows. The only standard is it has to be a satisfying viewing
experience. We're broadcasters. This is network television. The
goal is to try to reach as many people as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said that the ``gold standard'' was a show like ``E.R''
because ``it tackles very serious subject matter and is the No. 1
series on television and manages to do so in a way the people want
to come back every week.'' Shows like ``My So-Called Life'' have
struggled to tackle important issues, she said, but for one reason
or another never found audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the huge success of ``E.R.'' was based partly on a
sense that the doctors on the show, while personally flawed, were
heroic and saved lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe it comes down to a show about heroes,''
she said. ``It's also wish fulfillment. Everyone's nightmare is
getting sick or injured and winding up in an emergency room. Well,
if you wind up in an emergency room, you'd better believe that you
want Dr. Greene treating you.'' (Dr. Mark Greene is the noble
doctor played by Anthony Edwards on ``E.R.'')
</P>
<P>
   To ABC executives and rivals, one flaw in ``Wonderland'' was
that viewers could not identify with its troubled patients and
doctors. But Berg said that future episodes were to have been far
lighter and funnier than the first two. One was to include the
hospitalization of a comedian played by Jeremy Piven, and the
healthy birth of the child of the doctor who was stabbed with a
syringe in the first episode. ``The majority of `Wonderland,''' he
said, ``was in no way depressing.''

GIRLS SAY ELIAN `LOOKED SAD' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNIE DELINSKI   
 TimesDaily, Florence, Ala.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Ala. _ Two young Alabama sisters who shared pizza with
Elian Gonzalez over the weekend said the young Cuban ``looked
sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls, 6-year-old Ashlie Fristoe and 9-year-old Brittanie
Fristoe, were staying with their grandparents at an Andrews Air
Force Base hotel when they had the encounter Saturday, the day that
federal agents grabbed the 6-year-old from his Miami relatives in a
pre-dawn raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my Nanny's friends called us that morning and said
where we were on the news, and we turned it on and we saw our car
on TV,'' Brittanie said during a Tuesday telephone interview while
the girls continued vacationing with their grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel at Andrews was swarming with federal agents, the girls
said. The girls and their grandparents asked the agents if the
girls could visit with Elian, said their mother, Diane Fristoe, who
stayed behind in the family's Muscle Shoals' home during her
daughters' trip. The agents asked Elian's father, who said yes.
</P>
<P>
   The girls said Elian seemed nice but didn't say much, and they
had to use an interpreter during the visit, which lasted a few
minutes. ``He looked sad,'' Brittanie said.
</P>
<P>
   Brittanie enjoyed the experience. ``I was excited,'' she said.
``We talked about our brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father gave them some pizza they were eating, and
Brittanie gave Elian a stuffed animal that had ``WWJD'' on it. She
had received the stuffed animal as an Easter gift. The initials
stand for ``What Would Jesus Do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he knew what it meant,'' Brittanie said.
</P>
<P>
   When they left, Elian gave Ashlie a kiss on the cheek and his
father hugged Brittanie. ``I didn't know people gave sugar to
people they don't know,'' Ashlie said.
</P>
<P>
   Brittanie and Ashlie's grandparents said Elian's room was in the
Generals' Quarters and had a cast-iron fence around it.
</P>
<P>
   When she first heard about the meeting, Diane Fristoe admits she
was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe them when they called me,'' she said. But
once she realized they were serious, ``I actually told my mother
they need to stay in another hotel because somebody might bomb that
one, with everything going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Fristoe home-schools her daughters and they had discussed
Elian during lessons. Brittanie said ``I feel lucky'' to have met
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were vacationing in Washington with their
grandparents. Their grandmother, July Zills, is area manager for
the Army and Air Force Exchange Service in the Washington area and
arranged a private White House tour.
</P>
<P>
   During the White House visit, Ashlie and Brittanie petted
``first dog'' Buddy. And, Ashlie said they saw President Clinton,
``close up, playing golf'' while at the White House. They also took
part in the annual Easter Egg hunt on the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've learned so much from this weekend,'' Diane Fristoe
said. ``It's one thing to study about the White House but another
thing to visit Elian and pet Buddy.''

EAST MEETS IRISH IN ENGLISH FILM ABOUT PAKISTANIS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ A big hit English movie.
</P>
<P>
   A cast of Pakistani characters.
</P>
<P>
   A first-time Irish director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Born and bred in Dublin,'' Damien O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell fully understands why people are surprised that a
fellow who has spent almost his entire life in Ireland directed
East Is East, a comedy-drama about a Pakistani family trying to
cope with the cultures of the father's homeland and the family's
adopted country, England.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell didn't even see a foreigner until grade school.
``Ireland is famous for exporting people, but we're not very good
at returning the favor,'' O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   East Is East features Indian film star Om Puri, (familiar from
such movies as My Son the Fanatic and The Ghost and the Darkness)
as George Khan, a hard-nosed father determined to make his children
follow traditional Pakistani culture, even though they have a
British mother and have been raised in swinging England.
</P>
<P>
   The film, set in the disco-era 1970s, roller coasters between
hilarity and dark drama as George becomes increasingly determined
to force his will. Each child, in turn, tries to find his or her
own way in the world. The tiny film became a mainstream English
hit, winning the Korda Award for best British film and several
other English and European awards.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the subject matter, O'Donnell was pretty surprised
when he was approached with the script, which was based on a small,
partly autobiographical play by Pakistani-English actor Ayub
Khan-Din (My Beautiful Laundrette).
</P>
<P>
   Several well-known directors had already been approached,
including Stephen Frears (High Fidelity, My Beautiful Laundrette).
Frears suggested that Khan-Din find a first-time director, and the
writer took his advice.
</P>
<P>
   But how did the writer-actor end up with an unknown Irishman?
</P>
<P>
   Since graduating from film school, O'Donnell and some
film-school partners had made mostly commercials and low-budget
``pop videos'' for Irish bands. That was fine for a time _ he was
getting paid to learn his craft. But ultimately those outlets
proved to be unsatisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a falling out with about every record company there
was,'' O'Donnell said. ``We were highly opinionated, and we had our
principles. We took quite a hammering over it for three or four
years. We gave up pop videos and commercials and went back to short
films.''
</P>
<P>
   He produced an award-winning short, and with the prize money, he
directed a short called 35 Aside, which won several European
festival prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (screen) writer's girlfriend was watching TV one night
when 35 Aside came on. It's quite a visual film. She suggested,
`Why don't we talk to this guy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell may have been taken aback when he was approached about
East Is East, but any hesitation he had disappeared when he read
the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I liked was its humanity. It had great heart and soul,''
he said. ``I didn't know it had been a play, and I didn't know it
was autobiographical. But I knew reading it that whoever was
writing it was writing about events in his or her life _ things
that actually happened. Ayub had quite a traumatic childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the author's character is the youngest son; the
character always wears a parka with the hood over his head, indoors
and out, whatever the weather. It's a kind of security blanket
against the uncomfortable world around him.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, O'Donnell felt that having never directed a
feature film also acted in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an attraction of first-time filmmakers,'' he said.
``People who have made two or three films that haven't been
successful are less attractive (to producers), even though they've
had that experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the irony of filmmaking. The least experienced person
on the crew is usually the director, if you talk about time on the
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was exactly that man. I had shot three short films at that
stage. (On this film) I was working with (cinematographer) Brian
Tufano _ who had done Trainspotting and The Lords of Discipline and
Quadrophenia _ and a lot of other people with huge experience.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell set out to establish himself early as a director in
charge, ready to put his own stamp on the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first day I walked on the set to assert my
authority,'' he said. ``I tripped over a cable and fell on my nose
in front of the cast and the crew. Whatever mystique I'd tried to
develop just evaporated in one go.''

   &UR; Alicia Bay Laurel &LR; , who in 1971 hand-drew and hand-wrote
``Living on the Earth,'' has created a 30th anniversary edition
(Villard Books; $16.95) of the hippie manual. The new book looks
like its forebear, with a line drawing of a dancing nude on the
cover, but promises new organic recipes and environmental
preservation tips among these old standbys: how to tune your
Autoharp, how to deliver a baby, how to make your own moccasins.

DAVID MERRICK, BROADWAY PRODUCER AND MASTER PUBLICIST, DIES AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A shorter version will move as MERRICK-OBIT-SHORT) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Merrick, the producer whose gift for creating Broadway
hits was matched only by his genius for attracting publicity and
making enemies, died Tuesday in his sleep at St. George's Rest Home
in London. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   For a quarter century that ended with his last blockbuster, the
musical ``42nd Street,'' in 1980, Merrick was the dominant showman
in the Broadway theater. When Time magazine put him on its cover in
1966, it estimated that 20 percent of Broadway's work force was in
his employment. In a typical season during the 1960s he produced a
half-dozen or more plays and musicals, on occasion as many as four
in a single month. His parallel record of productivity and
profitability has been unmatched by any single impresario in the
history of New York's commercial theater.
</P>
<P>
   His headlines were nearly as numerous as his hits. Merrick was
famous for baiting critics, his own stars and his fellow producers,
all to promote his wares. Frequently likened to legendary
predecessors like P.T. Barnum and David Belasco, he preferred to
glory in his image as ``the abominable showman.'' A study in
darkness _ with his tailored suits, sleek black hair, thin
mustache, dark wit and low, insinuating voice _ he went out of his
way to resemble a villain out of Victorian melodrama. When Al
Hirschfeld drew a particularly unflattering caricature of him as a
grinch-like Santa Claus, Merrick reproduced it on his annual
Christmas card.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick produced some of the most popular musicals of his era,
including ``Gypsy,'' ``Hello, Dolly!'' and ``Promises, Promises,''
as well as ``42nd Street,'' his longest running show and one of the
half-dozen longest-running productions in Broadway history. He
introduced Woody Allen to Broadway as a playwright (``Don't Drink
the Water'') and actor (``Play It Again, Sam'') and produced the
1962 musical (``I Can Get It For You Wholesale'') that catapulted a
19-year-old supporting player, Barbra Streisand, toward stardom.
</P>
<P>
   His productions also gave signature roles to Ethel Merman (Mama
Rose in ``Gypsy'') and Carol Channing (Dolly Levi in ``Hello,
Dolly!''), and he worked with nearly every major songwriter of the
Broadway musical's last heyday: Jule Styne, Harold Arlen, Stephen
Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Harold Rome, Bob Merrill and the teams of
John Kander and Fred Ebb, and Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrick didn't only produce high-gloss entertainment. He
also presented Laurence Olivier's most celebrated postwar
performance (as Archie Rice in ``The Entertainer''), the
breakthrough dramas of John Osborne (``Look Back in Anger''), Brian
Friel (``Philadelphia, Here I Come!'') and Tom Stoppard
(``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'') and two epochal Royal
Shakespeare Company productions directed by Peter Brook
(``Marat/Sade'' and ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''). When few
commercial producers would touch the declining Tennessee Williams
in the '60s and '70s, Merrick took on his doomed projects,
including a revival of one play, ``The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here
Anymore,'' that had failed under another management only a season
earlier. (It failed again.)
</P>
<P>
   The producer's secretive private life was as complex and
contradictory as his theatrical credits. ``I was born on Nov. 4,
1954, the night my first big show, `Fanny,' opened on Broadway,''
Merrick once said. In truth he was born in St. Louis on Nov. 27,
1911, as David Margulois, the youngest child of a hand-to-mouth
salesman, Samuel, and his wife, Celia. His parents were divorced
when he was 7 _ ``It was like living on the set of `Virginia
Woolf,''' he once recalled _ and the young David bounced among
relatives through a grim but stagestruck adolescence which he
called Dickensian but never revealed in detail. Years later he said
he refused to take flights whose routes passed over St. Louis, lest
he be forced to land in the despised city of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   A good student, he won a scholarship to Washington University,
where he said he won second prize in a playwriting contest that
Tennessee Williams, another underclassman, also entered. The young
Margulois then went to St. Louis University, where he studied law,
a trade that would prove handy in his notoriously tough theatrical
contract negotiations. In law school, he haunted a student
playhouse, winning the role of Tubal in ``The Merchant of Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon graduation he did become a lawyer, but, more crucially, he
married a woman he had met in school, Lenore Beck, whose modest
inheritance allowed the young couple to flee St. Louis for New York
in 1939. A year later, he walked into the office of Herman Shumlin,
a prominent Broadway producer, and offered to invest $5,000 in a
forthcoming comedy, ``The Male Animal.'' The play was a hit, and
David Merrick, taking a new name inspired by the great 18th-century
English actor David Garrick, was born. Excused from war service
because of ulcers, he later went to work for Shumlin.
</P>
<P>
   Of his early, minor producing efforts, the most revealing was a
comedy called ``Clutterbuck'' in 1949. Though the show received
indifferent notices, Merrick kept it alive for six months with
discount tickets and a publicity stunt: each night during the
cocktail hour of 5 to 6 p.m. he called hotel bars and restaurants
all over town to page a fictional ``Mr. Clutterbuck.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was ``Fanny,'' five years later, that elevated him to
Times Square stardom.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Marcel Pagnol's cinematic trilogy set on the
Marseilles waterfront could make a musical, Merrick flew to France
three times to persuade Pagnol to give him the rights. After a
bitterly unconsummated effort to enlist Richard Rodgers and Oscar
Hammerstein II to write the score _ a campaign that would lead to a
lifelong feud with Rodgers _ he settled on Harold Rome. The
Broadway titans Joshua Logan and Ezio Pinza served as director and
star.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanny'' did not get glowing reviews, and Merrick himself was
said to be disappointed in it. But he sold the show relentlessly,
plastering men's room mirrors in midtown with suggestive stickers
reading ``Have You Seen Fanny?'' He also ran radio and television
spots long before they were commonplace and took the first
full-page newspaper ads ever for a Broadway show. And he hired a
sculptor to create a life-sized nude statue of the show's belly
dancer, Nejla Ates, installed it in Poet's Corner in Central Park
late at night, then alerted policemen and reporters so they could
discover it at daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity bred theatergoers, and ``Fanny'' made back its
investment in a remarkably fast 17 weeks, then ran nearly another
two years. Thanks to a shrewd rental deal Merrick had extracted
from the Shuberts for the Majestic Theater, ``Fanny'' was on a
weekly basis the most profitable show in Broadway history up to
that time.

   Four back-to-back hits followed, including Thornton Wilder's
``The Matchmaker,'' directed by Tyrone Guthrie, and Peter Ustinov's
``Romanoff and Juliet.'' The Merrick pattern of hoopla was set.
When ``Look Back in Anger'' showed signs of faltering only four
months after its 1957 opening, its box-office fortunes were
transformed when a distraught woman in the audience jumped on stage
at the Lyceum Theater and slapped Kenneth Haigh, who played the
misogynist antihero Jimmy Porter, on behalf of wronged women
everywhere. The story raged in the newspapers for three weeks
before Merrick confessed he had hired the woman for $250. But by
then ``Anger'' was on its way to running another 15 months on
Broadway and the road.
</P>
<P>
   Many more public relations master strokes were yet to come, most
famously and successfully the replacement of the entire cast of
``Hello, Dolly!'' with an all-black company headed by Pearl Bailey
and Cab Calloway when its audiences began to wane in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When Merrick judged the prospects dim for a lesser musical,
``Subways Are for Sleeping,'' in 1961, he turned to the phone book
to find men with the same names as the then-seven daily newspaper
critics _ a stunt he had long plotted but could never execute until
the retirement of The New York Times critic with a one-of-a-kind
name, Brooks Atkinson. Merrick took the critical impostors, among
them a mailman and a shoe salesman, to a preview and dinner, then
got them to endorse the show with such encomiums as ``the best
musical of the century.'' The full-page ad he drew up trumpeting
these ``raves'' was rejected by The Times, but it ran in one
edition of The Herald-Tribune before editors killed it. That was
enough to garner international headlines and keep ``Subways'' on
the boards for a nearly profitable season.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat less benign was Merrick's manipulation at the opening
of ``42nd Street'' in 1980. Gower Champion, the musical's director
and choreographer, had died early on the day of the opening, at age
59, of a rare blood cancer. But Merrick kept the news secret so he
could announce it from the stage at the curtain call, to the
screams and tears of a devastated cast and first-night audience.
Again the show's notoriety and success were assured, but an ugly
aftertaste lingered.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Though Champion had guided many Merrick hits, including ``Hello,
Dolly!,'' the two strong-willed men, while desperately needing each
other professionally, had always had a tempestuous personal
relationship. Merrick referred to the director as ``the
Presbyterian Hitler'' and, during the troubled tryout of the
musical ``Sugar'' in the 1970s, the producer's wife at the time,
Etan Aronson, had gone so far as to remove her knitting needles
from a hotel suite for fear the men might assault each other. Now
that Champion was gone, Merrick minimized the director's billing
posthumously on ``42nd Street'' and fought to minimize royalties to
his estate (and to the show's other authors) as well.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This nasty side of Merrick had always been apparent. When Anna
Maria Alberghetti missed performances in the hit ``Carnival!'' in
1961, the producer announced he would challenge his star's claims
of ill health by administering a lie detector test to her in the
hospital. When out of town with a production in trouble, he would
humiliate the creative personnel with tirades belittling their
work, pit collaborators against one another, threaten to close a
show and then bring in other writers behind the authors' backs.
Such was his detestation of Richard Rodgers that even after the
composer's death, he took revenge on his elderly widow by seating
her in the upper balcony at ``42nd Street.'' Once asked why he was
reputed to be so mean, Merrick replied, ``Because I am mean _ what
else?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He was especially hostile toward actors, whom he likened to
``unruly children,'' and the press. In the 1960s he sought to put
Walter Kerr on the defensive by accusing him of being overly
influenced by nudges he received from his wife, Jean, on opening
nights. (When I was drama critic of The Times, he recycled the same
stunt with me and my soon-to-be wife, Alex Witchel, to generate
publicity for a poorly received revival of ``Oh, Kay!'' some 25
years later.) When Stanley Kauffmann was drama critic for The Times
in 1966, Merrick prevented him from reviewing a preview of Brian
Friel's ``Philadelphia, Here I Come!'' by canceling the performance
and announcing that ``a rat'' was loose in the theater's generator.
The story made Page 1 _ publicity well worth the price of the
tickets the producer had to refund.
</P>
<P>
   His taunting of Howard Taubman, the Times' critic prior to
Kauffmann, was particularly notorious. What began as a funny tirade
on Johnny Carson's ``Tonight'' show _ Merrick accused the critic of
removing ``Wet Paint'' signs on benches in Central Park _ escalated
when the producer descended into Nazi analogies. After Taubman
threatened to sue, Merrick issued a rare apology.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The producer's known humanitarian gestures were few, but, as a
consistent foe of racism, he forced the backstage unions to
integrate their crews on ``Jamaica,'' a 1957 musical with Lena
Horne and a largely black cast, by threatening to jettison the
production if they did not. He also had a keen respect for his
audiences. After the out-of-town ministrations of both Abe Burrows
and Edward Albee failed to save a 1966 musical version of Truman
Capote's ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' Merrick closed it during New
York previews despite an advance sale of $1 million (a mammoth
amount for that time) that would have kept it alive for months. He
refused to subject theatergoers to what he pronounced ``an
excruciatingly boring evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his fellow producers, he was contemptuous. ``There's a
horse's ass for every light on Broadway,'' he told the writer
William Goldman in 1968. He refused to belong to the producers'
league and at various times likened himself to a ``lone wolf'' and
to an ``alley cat that's not quite trustful, that's always watching
for someone to leap on him.'' Merrick didn't mind if people hated
him as he battled his way to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he was not without his fans in the theater. Woody
Allen, Arthur Laurents and Jerry Herman, among others, have praised
his professionalism through the years.

   ``He's the only man I know who's made a vice of honesty,'' said
the playwright N. Richard Nash. But Merrick had no close friends
among Broadway's elite, whom he felt never accepted him. At the
theater-district hangout, Sardi's, he always insisted on sitting at
a table in the back, with the tourists, rather than with other
theatrical royalty up front.

<P>
   Among his toughest industry critics, Merrick was chastised for
not only his misanthropy and financial ruthlessness but also for
being an importer and packager rather than a truly creative
producer who initiated shows from scratch. But if many of his
successes were indeed from London, his biggest hits, like ``Dolly''
and ``42nd Street,'' were his own inspirations, and often his
imports benefited from improvements born of his obsessive attention
to every detail of production and promotion. Though Merrick was
also faulted for producing his riskiest dramas through the tax
dodge of a foundation, his eye for fresh theater was such that even
some of those experiments, like the Brook ``Marat/Sade,'' turned
out to be box-office sensations.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of ``42nd Street,'' which brought Merrick back to
New York after a brief and fruitless Hollywood sojourn producing
movies like ``Rough Cut'' and ``The Great Gatsby'' during the
1970s, his Broadway had disappeared. He and the few other surviving
lone wolves among Broadway producers _ most notably Alexander H.
Cohen, who died Saturday _ were relics from a bygone time. Almost
all Broadway shows were now imports of productions previously seen
in London, regional theaters or off-Broadway. In place of a single
tyrannical producer who ruled by gut instinct and took sole
responsibility for financing, mounting and promoting a production,
there were committees of producers, often investors and theater
owners.
</P>
<P>
   These new producers were ``bereft of ideas, vitality and
imagination,'' Merrick said. ``They're just businessmen who happen
to be in the theater.'' By the 1980s the leading theatrical showmen
aspiring to Merrick's stature were Joseph Papp and Cameron
Mackintosh, a vocal Merrick admirer. But Papp worked primarily in
the non-commercial confines of off-Broadway while Mackintosh
initiated his shows in London's West End and rarely produced more
than one a season, if that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Merrick had a stroke, which curtailed his freedom of
speech and movement as well as his professional activities. He had
long since given up his famous office, decorated in the bloody
color known in the trade as ``David Merrick Red,'' high above the
St. James Theater down the block from Shubert Alley. On the weekend
after New Year's, 1989, ``42nd Street'' closed simultaneously at
the St. James in New York and the Drury Lane in London. After that,
the compulsively litigious producer devoted much of his time to
truly Dickensian legal conflicts arising out of both his theatrical
finances and his stormy domestic history. Using a wheelchair and
often reduced to communicating in grunts, he was frequently in the
company of a young woman named Natalie Lloyd, who served as his
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his marriage to Leonore Beck, Merrick was married
to Jeanne Gilbert, whom he met when she was doing press relations
for the Savoy Hotel in London; Etan Aronson; Karen Prunczik, a
dancer who played Anytime Annie in the original cast of ``42nd
Street''; and then again to Aronson. All five marriages ended in
divorce, the fifth last year after a marathon decade of litigation.
Zack Manna, executive/artistic director of the David Merrick Arts
Foundation, said that Merrick married Lloyd last November.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick is also survived by his children, Cecilia Ann Merrick,
whose mother was Jeanne Gilbert, and Marguerita Merrick, daughter
of Etan Merrick.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The last of his nearly 90 shows, a 1996 stage version of the
1945 Rodgers-and-Hammerstein movie ``State Fair,'' was actually
produced by others, but Merrick took it over by making a large and
impetuous investment during its pre-New York tour. It flopped on
Broadway, though not before the frail showman made a brief ruckus
by suing the Tony Awards for ruling part of its score ineligible
for Tony consideration.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though Merrick's final promotional stunts on Broadway were an
embarrassingly faint and farcical replay of his old tricks, they in
no way diminished the judgment made by the producer Herman Shumlin,
who gave the young David Margulois his start in 1940. Shumlin had
observed before his own death in 1979 that David Merrick's career
was ``a milestone in our modern theater, where the exploitation of
plays has become a lost art.''
</P>
<P>
   But that lasting professional verdict still left unanswered the
question of motive, which had obsessed Broadway for decades: What
made Merrick run? For all the money he earned, and for all his
efforts to keep every last dollar of it, there is no evidence he
enjoyed his fortune. He lived furtively, often in unpretentious
midtown apartments, and was not a party-giver or goer. He
frequently spoke of being depressed.
</P>
<P>
   One friend recalled a rare occasion in the early '70s when
Merrick briefly let down his guard and explained why even his
enormous success had failed to lighten his spirit. ``I'll tell you
what it's like to be No. 1,'' the producer said. ``I compare it to
climbing Mount Everest. It's very difficult. Lives are lost along
the way. You struggle and struggle and finally you get up there.
And guess what there is once you get up there? Snow and ice.''

TAKE YOUR FEMINISM TO WORK DAY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface ``Children'' in 10th graf should be italicized.) 
 By LISA BELKIN 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 19 million girls are expected to play hooky
from school on Thursday for a lesson their parents consider even
more important.
</P>
<P>
   It's the eighth annual Take Our Daughters to Work Day, which was
created to give adolescent girls a peek at a limitless future.
</P>
<P>
   I used to be a girl. And as books that had not even been written
back then would have predicted, I lost much confidence in myself _
and all interest in math _ at the stroke of age 12. (Most of the
confidence has come back; not so for the math.) As a former girl,
and as a feminist and defender of girls, I am thrilled by Take Our
Daughters to Work Day. But as the mother of two young sons, I am
torn.
</P>
<P>
   I do not for a moment question that this is good for girls.
``It's a national intervention,'' said Marie Wilson, the president
of the Ms. Foundation for Women, which started the day for girls.
``It sends a positive message to girls and focuses on their
potential.'' That message is heard, she added, only ``if the boys
are not there _ otherwise, the boys take over and everyone reverts
to the behaviors we are trying to address in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's stop for a moment and talk about those boys. If we as a
country have learned anything in the last year, it is that they
also are in trouble. They are shooting, and being shot, using drugs
and being medicated for behavioral disorders, far more than their
sisters. As parents we are frightened for them.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mary Bray Pipher, author of ``Reviving Ophelia: Saving the
Selves of Adolescent Girls'' (Ballantine Books, 1995), warns that
it is time to pay more attention to the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``An event like this comes out of a certain place and time,''
she says, treading carefully, trying not to directly attack Take
Our Daughters to Work Day. ``But the farther you get from that
place and time, the less likely it is to be fitting and
appropriate. No one would make the argument now that boys have an
easy time in middle school and high school.''
</P>
<P>
   What I'm wrestling with, I admit, is less the welfare of all
boys than the specific needs of two particular boys: a
kindergartener who recently insisted that girls can't be doctors
(even though two of his pediatricians are women) but who is
fascinated by the fact that one of my editors is a ``he'' and one
is a ``she''; and a third-grader who loves to compare the
techniques I use in my articles with the ones he uses when writing
his reports on the Arctic and the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Every night they ask me, ``How was your day?'' Would it be a
boon or a blow to feminism if, I show them?
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, the mother of three sons and two daughters, believes it
would be a little of both. Although she is all for raising feminist
sons, she warns that the trend toward companies' opting for ``Take
Our  &UR; Children &LR;  to Work'' days is diluting the point. The Ms.
Foundation, she explains, has created a separate program _
``Working It Out: Especially for Boys'' _ to be taught to those who
are left in the classroom while the girls head to the office. But
if my children's school is at all typical, the program is not
widely used, and the day is a wasted one for the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't teach anything new that day,'' says my older son's
teacher. Adds his principal, in her strictest principal voice:
``Why on earth do they schedule this during the school year? You
know, it's not a legal absence.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but, done right, it can be an educational one.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is at The New York Times, where each year hundreds
of daughters energize the building with their presence and produce
their own remarkable newspaper. It is called Girls' Times, and
three years ago, its lead editorial was an impassioned plea to end
a practice it called ``needlessly discriminatory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed,'' the girls wrote. ``Daughters already
know they can become lawyers, engineers or golf professionals. Sons
as well as daughters can benefit from seeing what their fathers and
mothers do at work.'' In the title of their editorial, they
advised: ``Take Your Sons to Work, Too.''
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to the principal, I plan to take that advice.
</P>
<P>
   My older son will spend the day helping me conduct interviews
for a magazine piece, then joining me back home in my office where
we'll each write an article about what we learned.
</P>
<P>
   Next year _ fair is fair _ it will be his brother's turn.

DAVID MERRICK, BROADWAY PRODUCER AND MASTER PUBLICIST, DIES AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A full-length version has moved as MERRICK-OBIT) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Merrick, the producer whose gift for creating Broadway
hits was matched only by his genius for attracting publicity and
making enemies, died Tuesday in his sleep at St. George's Rest Home
in London. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   For a quarter century that ended with his last blockbuster, the
musical ``42nd Street,'' in 1980, Merrick was the dominant showman
in the Broadway theater. When Time magazine put him on its cover in
1966, it estimated that 20 percent of Broadway's work force was in
his employment. In a typical season during the 1960s he produced a
half-dozen or more plays and musicals, on occasion as many as four
in a single month. His parallel record of productivity and
profitability has been unmatched by any single impresario in the
history of New York's commercial theater.
</P>
<P>
   His headlines were nearly as numerous as his hits. Merrick was
famous for baiting critics, his own stars and his fellow producers,
all to promote his wares. Frequently likened to legendary
predecessors like P.T. Barnum and David Belasco, he preferred to
glory in his image as ``the abominable showman.'' A study in
darkness _ with his tailored suits, sleek black hair, thin
mustache, dark wit and low, insinuating voice _ he went out of his
way to resemble a villain out of Victorian melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick produced some of the most popular musicals of his era,
including ``Gypsy,'' ``Hello, Dolly!'' and ``Promises, Promises,''
as well as ``42nd Street,'' his longest running show and one of the
half-dozen longest-running productions in Broadway history.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick also presented Laurence Olivier's most celebrated
postwar performance (as Archie Rice in ``The Entertainer''), the
breakthrough dramas of John Osborne (``Look Back in Anger''), Brian
Friel (``Philadelphia, Here I Come!'') and Tom Stoppard
(``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'') and two epochal Royal
Shakespeare Company productions directed by Peter Brook
(``Marat/Sade'' and ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'').
</P>
<P>
   The producer's secretive private life was as complex and
contradictory as his theatrical credits. ``I was born on Nov. 4,
1954, the night my first big show, `Fanny,' opened on Broadway,''
Merrick once said. In truth he was born in St. Louis on Nov. 27,
1911, as David Margulois, the youngest child of a hand-to-mouth
salesman, Samuel, and his wife, Celia.
</P>
<P>
   A good student, he won a scholarship to Washington University,
and then went to St. Louis University, where he studied law.
</P>
<P>
   Upon graduation he did become a lawyer, but, more crucially, he
married a woman he'd met in school, Lenore Beck, whose modest
inheritance allowed the young couple to flee St. Louis for New York
in 1939. A year later, he walked into the office of Herman Shumlin,
a prominent Broadway producer, and offered to invest $5,000 in a
forthcoming comedy, ``The Male Animal.'' The play was a hit, and
David Merrick, taking a new name inspired by the great 18th-century
English actor David Garrick, was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanny,'' five years later, elevated him to Times Square
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanny'' did not get glowing reviews, and Merrick himself was
said to be disappointed in it. But he sold the show relentlessly,
running radio and television spots long before they were
commonplace and taking the first full-page newspaper ads ever for a
Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity bred theatergoers, and ``Fanny'' made back its
investment in a remarkably fast 17 weeks, then ran nearly another
two years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat less benign was Merrick's manipulation at the opening
of ``42nd Street'' in 1980. Gower Champion, the musical's director
and choreographer, had died early on the day of the opening, at age
59, of a rare blood cancer. But Merrick kept the news secret so he
could announce it from the stage at the curtain call, to the
screams and tears of a devastated cast and first-night audience.
Again the show's notoriety and success were assured, but an ugly
aftertaste lingered.
</P>
<P>
   The producer's known humanitarian gestures were few, but, as a
consistent foe of racism, he forced the backstage unions to
integrate their crews on ``Jamaica,'' a 1957 musical with Lena
Horne and a largely black cast, by threatening to jettison the
production if they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Of his fellow producers, he was contemptuous. ``There's a
horse's ass for every light on Broadway,'' he told the writer
William Goldman in 1968. Merrick didn't mind if people hated him as
he battled his way to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he was not without his fans in the theater. Woody
Allen, Arthur Laurents and Jerry Herman, among others, have praised
his professionalism through the years.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By the time of ``42nd Street,'' which brought Merrick back to
New York after a brief and fruitless Hollywood sojourn producing
movies like ``Rough Cut'' and ``The Great Gatsby'' during the
1970s, his Broadway had disappeared. In place of a single
tyrannical producer who ruled by gut instinct and took sole
responsibility for financing, mounting and promoting a production,
there were committees of producers, often investors and theater
owners.
</P>
<P>
   These new producers were ``bereft of ideas, vitality and
imagination,'' Merrick said. ``They're just businessmen who happen
to be in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Merrick had a stroke, which curtailed his freedom of
speech and movement as well as his professional activities. On the
weekend after New Year's, 1989, ``42nd Street'' closed
simultaneously at the St. James in New York and the Drury Lane in
London. After that, the compulsively litigious producer devoted
much of his time to truly Dickensian legal conflicts arising out of
both his theatrical finances and his stormy domestic history. Using
a wheelchair and often reduced to communicating in grunts, he was
frequently in the company of a young woman named Natalie Lloyd, who
served as his spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his marriage to Leonore Beck, Merrick was married
to Jeanne Gilbert, whom he met when she was doing press relations
for the Savoy Hotel in London; Etan Aronson; Karen Prunczik, a
dancer who played Anytime Annie in the original cast of ``42nd
Street''; and then again to Aronson. All five marriages ended in
divorce, the fifth last year after a marathon decade of litigation.
Zack Manna, executive/artistic director of the David Merrick Arts
Foundation, said that Merrick married Lloyd last November.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick is also survived by his children, Cecilia Ann Merrick,
whose mother was Jeanne Gilbert, and Marguerita Merrick, daughter
of Etan Merrick.
</P>
<P>
   Shumlin, the producer who gave the young David Margulois his
start in 1940, had observed before his own death in 1979 that David
Merrick's career was ``a milestone in our modern theater, where the
exploitation of plays has become a lost art.''
</P>
<P>
   But that lasting professional verdict still left unanswered the
question of motive, which had obsessed Broadway for decades: What
made Merrick run? For all the money he earned, and for all his
efforts to keep every last dollar of it, there is no evidence he
enjoyed his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   One friend recalled a rare occasion in the early '70s when
Merrick briefly let down his guard and explained why even his
enormous success had failed to lighten his spirit. ``I'll tell you
what it's like to be No. 1,'' the producer said. ``I compare it to
climbing Mount Everest. It's very difficult. Lives are lost along
the way. You struggle and struggle and finally you get up there.
And guess what there is once you get up there? Snow and ice.''

COMMENTARY: DANGEROUS SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In six weeks, the cock-of-the-walk president of
Russia and the lame-duck president of the United States will hold
what Churchill called ``a parley at the summit'' in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The central subject: Russia's need to cut the cost of
maintaining thousands of missiles aimed at the United States, and
America's need for limited defense against rogue-nation missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to American cities is no longer from the huge Soviet
missile arsenal, as it was when the Antiballistic Missile Treaty
was signed three decades ago. That's when the superpowers agreed to
stay vulnerable, each largely defenseless against the other's
nuclear weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Today the growing threat comes from rogue states and terrorists.
Defense Secretary William Cohen made the case Wednesday: Saddam
Hussein could build a nuclear bomb, buy a missile from North Korea
and invade his neighbors on the presumption he could act with
impunity _ because he could credibly threaten to kill millions of
Americans if we dared to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this potential blackmail threat, Congress passed and
President Clinton signed a proposal to develop a defense against a
few missiles. This is not the space-based shield derogated as
``Star Wars'' to block an all-out Russian attack, but a necessary
precaution against a terrorist's nuclear blackmail or any
accidental launches.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has promised to decide this summer (after his meeting
with Vladimir Putin) whether to move beyond development to deploy a
national missile defense. His announced criteria: Will it work?
Will it upset the world? Is it worth the money?
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? It's not easy to shoot down a missile with another
missile; one test succeeded, another flopped. But many who insist
it will never work were doubtful our technology could ever put a
man on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   World opinion? The Russians, the Chinese, the U.N.'s Kofi Annan,
joined by Britain's Tony Blair, have all come out against the
United States achieving safety against terrorist nukes.
</P>
<P>
   Worth the money? The Congressional Budget Office just put out an
estimate that this plan, adding in all conceivable bells and
whistles, might cost $60 billion over the next 15 years. Sounds
expensive, but that annual $4 billion is less than two-tenths of 1
percent of the federal budget _ not a bad insurance premium to pay
for protecting a city's population.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's gambit at the summit will be to offer Clinton this
package: Russia will finally go along with Start II, reducing the
Russian and U.S. stockpiles of missiles, provided (1) the United
States agrees to slash its stockpile in half again in Start III,
and (2) Clinton adheres to the ABM treaty and allows U.S. cities to
remain vulnerable to attack from rogue states and China.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty shrewd opening, because Russia cannot afford to keep even
its reduced missile force operational, and wants the United States
to weaken itself beyond prudence in Start III. By making a big deal
out of not touching the ABM treaty, Putin cleverly puts his
counterpart with the stronger hand at a disadvantage: the
legacy-hunting Clinton will be tempted to cave on one or the other
_ ABM or Start III _ to make a deal that he can say is historic.
</P>
<P>
   Putin knows that a limited missile defense poses no threat to
Russia's deterrent. But what he has done is to create a valuable
bargaining chip out of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is being snookered by it. His new security spokesman,
Mike Hammer (to gun-toting La Femme Nikita at Justice, now add
Mickey Spillane's hero at the White House), told Wednesday of ``our
efforts to preserve the ABM treaty'' by amending it.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton response to Putin's gambit is likely to be a plea
for a minor modification in the ABM treaty that would lock us into
a puny, not just a limited, defense. When Putin oh-so-reluctantly
accedes to this, all those resentful of U.S. power will applaud his
statesmanship. Clinton would then match the Russian's concocted
``concession'' by slashing our missile force in Start III, which is
Putin's other goal.
</P>
<P>
   A better deal is no deal at all. Go to Moscow; work the fence;
sign environmental stuff, and kick the can of worms that is serious
national missile defense down the street to the next president, who
will have a fresh mandate to ensure American safety.

NETWORKS GEAR UP FOR MAY SWEEPS

<P>
   You can travel back in time to the days of Jesus, Jason and the
Argonauts, Ali Baba and his 40 thieves, or to the more recent past
when Watergate and Vietnam and ``The Brady Bunch'' took over the
news and television sets.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the May ratings sweeps, and in addition to those
``extra-special'' episodes of your favorite shows, along with
season and series finales, you'll find the major broadcast networks
offering a range of mini-series and one-night movies basking in a
historical glow.
</P>
<P>
   Networks vie for viewers during sweep periods, when ratings are
crucial in the pricing of commercials for an entire business
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brady Bunch'' is the subject of two behind-the-scenes
movies during the month, and ``Diff'rent Strokes'' also is
remembered in a one-hour film.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is offering a week of celebrity editions of ``Who Wants to
be a Millionaire,'' that will run May 1-5, with such stars as David
Duchovny and Rosie O'Donnell trying for a chance in the hot seat
and to win money for charity.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will bid farewell to its long-running ``Beverly Hills,
90210'' and ``Party of Five,'' both of which have more than worn
out their welcomes. ``Party of Five'' ends its six-year run on May
3, while the former high school students on ``90210'' say goodbye
in a two-hour finale on May 17, after a one-hour special look back
on May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Fletcher is back in a two-hour movie, Drew Carey sings
in ``Gepetto,'' Chad Lowe pretends to sing as John Denver, and
Michael J. Fox bids his own farewell to his hit comedy ``Spin
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some sweep's highlights.
</P>
<P>
   April 28
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosby,'' 8:30-9 p.m. CBS. Hilton (Bill Cosby) and Ruth
(Phylicia Rashad) say goodbye after four seasons by looking back on
how they've survived 30 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   April 30
</P>
<P>
   ``Arabian Nights'' 9-11 p.m. ABC. Schariar (Dougray Scott) plans
to kill his new wife, Scheherazade, who saves her life by capturing
his imagination with tales from the Arabian Nights. The large cast
in this Robert Halmi, special-effects laden mini-series includes
Alan Bates, Jason Scott Lee, Rufus Sewell and John Leguizamo. The
special concludes at 9-11 p.m. May 1.
</P>
<P>

COUNTRY LEGEND PAID THE PRICE FOR BEING HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout his 50-year career, Texas-born singer Ray Price has
been viewed as a maverick, often vilified for opening doors that
eventually broadened the appeal of country artists, among them
contemporary chart toppers such as the Dixie Chicks, Shania Twain,
Faith Hill and Tim McGraw.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1957, when Price crossed over from country to the pop
charts via the No. 1 hit ``Crazy Arms,'' some bigwigs in Nashville
branded him a traitor and showered him with criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would spit on me as I was walking into a show,'' says the
75-year-old singer, who was born in the East Texas town of
Perryville and lives in Mount Pleasant. ``They claimed that I had
deserted country music.''
</P>
<P>
   Price offended purists by using drums on one of his records _
which, at that point, was unheard of in country. The industry
insiders balked.
</P>
<P>
   Price's experimentation with drums and percussion, however,
eventually led to the invention of the 4/4 shuffle beat, now a
country-music staple that's often referred to as the ``Ray Price
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, when Price ditched his cowboy garb and started
glazing his songs with string arrangements, the industry turned up
its nose again. But then Price scored a No. 1 hit with a
string-laden version of Kris Kristofferson's ``For the Good
Times,'' setting a precedent for the mingling of strings and steel,
which is now a Nashville norm.
</P>
<P>
   So it shouldn't really surprise anyone that Price is still doing
things a little differently. His forthcoming disc is not a country
effort at all.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, ``Prisoner of Love,'' due May 16 on the Buddha/Justice
record label, is a collection of pop songs: covers, standards and
Price favorites (and a lone new track) coated in strings and
orchestra arrangements, big-band style. It's his first so-called
pop album.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's really not that different than what I've been doing
for years,'' says Price, who has more than two dozen Top 10
singles, a good chunk of which went to No. 1. ``The songs are
different, the music really isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Prisoner,'' on which the velvet-voiced singer performs
interminable tracks such as ``What a Wonderful World, Fly Me to the
Moon'' and ``Better Class of Losers,'' as well as the Beatles' ``In
My Life,'' was produced by Randall Jamail, an in-demand studio whiz
whose credits include Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra. The orchestrations were configured by
renowned arranger David Campbell, father of pop bohemian Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the muscle and money that Buddha/Justice has sunk
into ``Prisoner,'' the label's undoubtedly hoping that Price will
follow in the footsteps of another comeback success story, George
Jones, whose career was revived last year. Jones took home a Grammy
in February for his song ``Choices,'' which won in the Country Male
Vocal category.
</P>
<P>
   But Price's expectations for the new record are modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope my fans like it,'' he says. ``At the very least,
it's something a little more refreshing than what's coming out of
Nashville these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Price speaks freely, and often angrily, about Nashville and the
current state of country music. On stage at the South by Southwest
music-industry conference in March, Price criticized country radio
stations for not playing material from performers over age 45; he
also trashed cookie-cutter acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry thinks you gotta be a young stud that appeals to
the girls sexually,'' Price says. ``It worked for a while, but it
doesn't seem to be working now. People are tired of having 'em
crammed down their throats. Very few stars made it, but the
industry made tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even listen to the radio anymore,'' he says. ``I don't
want to be punished, so I don't listen. That's self-abuse. I'm
against that.''
</P>
<P>
   Price has had a stormy relationship with Nashville throughout
his career, stemming from the days when he wouldn't conform. He has
the Grand Ole Opry and
</P>
<P>
   Hank Williams _ who pushed Price to perform at the Opry _ to
thank for giving him air time even though he didn't have a record
deal. But even after scoring with 23 Top 10 hits, he left
Nashville, frustrated by the country-music industry's inability to
understand or accept the artistic direction he wanted to take.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point, in the late '60s, that Price started
tinkering with smooth, orchestrated sounds. Thus, when most country
singers were going for a harder, rawer vibe, Price was seen as
going soft. He was a martini to everyone else's shot of whiskey.
``I was just trying to make my songs sound prettier,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the industry's surprise, four of Price's
orchestral-country songs went No. 1, starting a stampede of
imitators. Even though the sound faded in the '70s, Price has stuck
to his symphonic guns; he still tours with a mini-orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fans still want that,'' he says. ``And they have never
deserted me. At my age, that's a blessing from God.''

<P>
   PARIS _ The heirs of a Jewish art collector whose home was
looted by German occupation troops in October 1940 believe that one
of hundreds of paintings seized on that occasion now hangs in the
Museum of Modern Art in New York. The painting, Picasso's ``Still
Life: Job,'' of 1916, is among 15 works recently identified by the
museum as having incomplete provenance records from the World War
II era.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Warin, who represents the heirs of Alphonse Kann, one of
France's most important prewar collectors, said that he had
photographs showing the small Cubist work on the wall of Kann's
home in St.-Germain-en-Laye outside Paris in the late 1920s. He
said there was no evidence that the oil was sold on the market
before the Nazi raid on the house, in which Kann's entire
collection of more than 1,000 works was seized.
</P>
<P>
   Warin raised the possibility that the Picasso belonged to the
Kann estate in a letter last year to Glenn D. Lowry, the director
of the Museum of Modern Art. Lowry said in an interview Wednesday
that he had since been working closely with Warin to research and
clarify the case. Warin in turn praised Lowry's ``exemplary way of
handling this.'' Both parties agreed that a solution was not
imminent, since crucial evidence was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Warin, a retired television producer, has spent the last five
years trying to trace artworks taken by the Nazis from Kann, who
was his great uncle. Warin was first alerted to the problem by
``The Lost Museum,'' a book by an American journalist, Hector
Feliciano, that asserted that the French authorities had been less
than diligent in finding the true owners of looted works recovered
after the Allied victory. The book was published in English in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kann, who fled to Britain in 1939 and never returned to France
before his death in 1948, had a particularly strong collection of
early 20th- century art. However, because Kann did not keep a
detailed inventory of his collection, Warin has had to rely on
German wartime records, French postwar documents, photographs and
other archives to put together a list of works he believes ended up
in the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Kann estate has begun a lawsuit against the Georges Pompidou
Center in Paris for the return of a 1914 Cubist painting by Braque
called ``Le Guitarriste,'' and it is claiming two paintings by Juan
Gris also owned by the Pompidou Center. It has already regained two
Picasso oils from French and Swiss collections and has initiated
claims to another Picasso, ``Tete de Femme,'' owned by a French
regional museum; Leger's ``Fumees sur les Toits,'' at the
Minneapolis Institute of Arts; and Matisse's ``Riviere aux Aloes,''
at the Menil Collection in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Last July Kann heirs filed a lawsuit in New York state Supreme
Court in Manhattan against the Wildenstein family, among the art
world's best-known dealers, asserting that the Wildensteins stole
eight rare manuscripts worth about $15 million that had been looted
by the Nazis. A lawyer for the Wildensteins termed the suit
``baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These claims show that there are probably many other claims to
come in the United States from looted European families,''
Feliciano said in an interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Still Life: Job,'' long research usually follows
claims for restitution. In this case, the Museum of Modern Art
notes on its Web site (www.moma.org/menu/provenance.html), which
also includes photographs and descriptions of 15 other paintings
with incomplete provenance, that the contested Picasso was donated
to the museum in 1979 by Nelson A. Rockefeller, who acquired it
from the Carstairs Gallery in New York in 1950. It also notes that
the painting belonged at one point to Rolf de Mare, a Swedish dance
director and art collector who lived in Paris from 1926 to 1942,
although it is not clear how he acquired it or when he sold it.
</P>
<P>
   Warin said the lack of provenance before de Mare was suspicious
because any prewar collector would have been proud to mention Kann
as a prior owner. The most likely explanation, he said, was that
the painting was bought from some dealer who had acquired it from
German spoils of war. Warin and Lowry believe that the answer may
lie in de Mare's archives, currently held by the Dans Museet in
Stockholm. ``We know he kept a ledger book,'' Lowry said, ``but we
have not been given access to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowry said that so far no claims had been made to any of the
other paintings posted on the museum's Web site (including works by
Leger, Klee, Grosz, Braque and Bonnard). ``I think it very, very
unlikely that others will turn out to be problematic,'' he added.
``We have admitted that one, the Picasso, has a question mark, but
we're far from knowing conclusively. There is inconclusive evidence
in both directions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can say is that there will be no contention over
this,'' he went on. ``And Francis Warin and I agree on this. We
will push our research until we agree we have gone as far as
possible. Then we will sit down and find the right solution. I
don't know what it will be, but I do believe Francis Warin has a
legitimate right to think it may have belonged to Alphonse Kann.''

AT CRUCIFIXION SITE, A PROFOUND DISCOVERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the coming of Easter, my thoughts flash back to last month
when I had an ultimate experience of that holy period commemorating
Christ's death, burial and Resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   On a cool morning in March, I arose early to walk from my hotel
in Israel to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, inside the Christian
quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Before I began reporting on Pope John Paul II's visit to Israel,
I wanted to visit the domed church, which has been identified for
centuries as the place where Jesus was buried and rose from the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The usually crowded streets of the Old City were almost empty.
</P>
<P>
   As I wandered through the maze of narrow streets _ very similar
to those of Jesus' time _ I lost my way. Luckily, a robed priest
whisking past was going in the same direction. I asked him the way
to the landmark church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just follow me,'' he said. ``I have to be there in just a few
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   He was on his way to celebrate a Roman Catholic Mass in a part
of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   I followed the priest, asking no questions because he seemed in
a hurry, for one thing, and also because my early-morning trek
wasn't a search for interviews. It was a personal journey.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Helena, mother of the Roman Emperor Constantine, ordered
the first church built there in the fourth century, after early
Christians informed her that it was the place where Christ died,
was entombed and arose. She also believed she had found a piece of
the true cross in a cave near that site.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of the Holy Sepulcher is built over a rock formation
that, since A.D. 336, has been identified as the place of the
skull, or Golgotha _ the site of the Crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Although the church is inside the walled city, archaeologists
have concluded that the site was in a rocky area outside the walls
during the time of Jesus. Executions and burials were not held
inside the walled city at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Brisco, a professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Fort Worth and author of the ``Holman Bible Atlas,''
states that archaeologists have concluded the area under the church
was used as a quarry, with numerous tombs cut into the rock during
Jesus' time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circumstances fit the biblical description, but the
authenticity of the site cannot be established conclusively,''
Brisco writes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Brisco says, there is even less evidence for the
authenticity of an alternative site for the Crucifixion and burial
_ a picturesque area north of the Old City known as the Garden Tomb
and Gordon's Calvary, so named because of its support by British
Gen. Charles Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The church is shared by six Christian groups, and they sometimes
get into intense arguments over control of various portions.
</P>
<P>
   When I walked into the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, only one or
two people were kneeling at a stone slab, believed to be the place
Jesus' body was laid after he was crucified. After they left, I
also knelt at the holy slab.
</P>
<P>
   Then I climbed the winding stone steps that lead to Golgotha.
Pope John Paul II would laboriously climb those same stairs in an
unscheduled stop on the final day of his pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As I gained the top of the stairs, music filled the old church.
A group from Germany sang hymns in the chapel where many believe
Christ was nailed to the cross. Next to that chapel is one of the
holiest places in Christendom _ a chapel marking the place where
the cross stood.
</P>
<P>
   I was alone in the chapel of the Crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   As I knelt before an ornate image of Christ, I saw something I
had never seen in past visits to the church: a glass wall revealing
a massive white rock formation underneath the altar: Golgotha.
</P>
<P>
   I was able to touch a piece of marble directly above a hole in
the rock some believe is the exact place soldiers planted a cross
in those ancient stones on a fateful day a little less than 2,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment of Easter before Easter began.

ROBBIE FULKS AT HIS `VERY BEST' 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When dealing with alternative country rebel Robbie
Fulks, it doesn't hurt to read between the lines on song titles and
record packaging. Beneath his freckle-faced Opie Taylor innocence
is the humor of a biting satirist.
</P>
<P>
   Fulks is the honky-tonk strummer whose 1996 debut solo album,
Country Love Songs, featured such touching heart-wringers as We'll
Burn Together and She Took a Lot of Pills (and Died).
</P>
<P>
   The follow-up, South Mouth, was highlighted by a
talking-out-of-school country-punk track. The title alone _
unprintable in this family newspaper _ blasted Nashville as a home
of country money-makers, not music-makers.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be surprising, then, that the 37-year-old
Chicago-based singer-songwriter has put out an album called ``The
Very Best of Robbie Fulks'' _ featuring none of these songs.
</P>
<P>
   The cover art is a smiling portrait on canvas, but it would be
more accurate had the painter planted Fulks' tongue firmly in his
cheek.
</P>
<P>
   In Fulks' world, ``very best'' doesn't necessarily mean the
hits. It couldn't, because he's never really had one. The album is
not really a retrospective either, since nearly half of the 14
songs were just recorded for this release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the very best of the stuff I had lying around that
hadn't been released,'' Fulks said. ``I can't really claim that I
gave much thought to how the songs worked together. It was just
kind of a personal odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulks won't even promise that he'll play many of the songs
during his performance April 28 at McGonigel's Mucky Duck in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But he will swear that the album was perhaps the most satisfying
record project of his career. If anything, ``Very Best'' represents
the buffer zone between the entertainer's stay with a major label
and his current search for more creative distribution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Fulks moved from New York City, where he was attending
Columbia University, to Chicago to become a member of the Special
Consensus Bluegrass Band. He stayed with the group the rest of the
decade and played on its 1989 Grammy-nominated album, ``Hole in My
Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he left the band and joined the cast of a
regional production of the play ``Woody Guthrie's American Song.''
</P>
<P>
   His final act of group participation was with the comically
low-brow Trailer Trash Revue, a loose rock band featuring go-go
dancers. Within another two years, Fulks decided to put his own
name above the marquee and go solo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got to the point where I was writing all these songs
and I wanted to take credit for them,'' Fulks said. ``I didn't want
it to be some Dire Straits situation with one guy writing all the
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the release of his first two albums on the
Chicago-based indie label Bloodshot Records, Fulks finally got a
stab at national exposure when Geffen picked him up and released
his finest album, ``Let's Kill Saturday Night.'' A fine mix of
traditional country and pop tunes, the album features guest spots
by Vince Gill, Lucinda Williams and mandolin specialist Sam Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Fulks was heading down the eclectic yet
accessible country path of such artists as Rosie Flores and BR5-49.
Last spring, however, the large record industry beast that he'd
been wary of in that earlier song finally came around to bite him.
</P>
<P>
   With the merger that resulted in the creation of Uber-label
Universal-Polygram, Geffen was swallowed whole, then picked apart.
Along with bigger names like 10,000 Maniacs and Cowboy Junkies,
Fulks was shown the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of stupidity to complain or laugh about (in the
music business),'' Fulks said. ``The mega-mergers caused a loss of
interest in niche acts, but I just don't think that can stay true
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulks believes that sooner or later focus will cycle back to
more exotic artists, but only after small labels start making money
off the big-fish castoffs. Songwriters like Aimee Mann, who was
also axed by Geffen but came back with a Grammy for the
``Magnolia'' soundtrack earlier this year, are held up as the
poster children for the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Fulks will continue to book his own gigs, tour about
100 days a year and personally prepare packages of his CDs, which
can be ordered online: www.robbiefulks.com.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in lieu of a record deal, Fulks has found the Internet
to be an invaluable tool in managing his own career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredibly fortunate time now that this great new
sales tool has come along that provides for direct contact with
consumers,'' Fulks said of response to his Web site. ``Right now,
67 million Americans have computers. That number will double in the
next couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulks is preparing a disc of all-new music to follow up ``Let's
Kill Saturday Night.'' He is in the process of shopping it to an
interested label, though contracts haven't been signed.
</P>
<P>
   The recording is tentatively titled ``Couples in Trouble.''
Fulks describes it as a theme record on the rise and fall of
relationships. Until then, ``The Very Best of Robbie Fulks'' will
have to keep fans satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   With the continuing extinction of vinyl, there really isn't any
such thing as a ``B-sides'' collection of recordings anymore, but
the odds-and-ends ``Best'' set features one song from when such
items still existed. The buoyantly bent notes of ``Jean Arthur''
provided the flip side of Fulks' first solo 7-inch single, ``Little
King.''
</P>
<P>
   Also not to be missed is ``That Bangle Girl,'' his red-faced
love-song crush on Susanna Hoffs and the '80s hit queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's actually less of a smart-aleck element to that song.
The Bangles were just great pop singers in tradition of Ronnie
Spector.'' Fulks said, ``and they were kind of seductive, hot
girls.''

JILL SOBULE CAN AFFORD TO KISS NOVELTY SONG GOODBYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get this out of the way: Jill Sobule is the woman who sang
1995's controversial ``I Kissed a Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's the song that got her on MTV and a few gigs on the
Lilith Fair second stage, but also got her banned on some Southern
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the song, she acknowledges, that's responsible for
her 15 minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Duly noted.
</P>
<P>
   But it's time to move on, because Sobule certainly has, which is
clear when you listen to her fourth _ and probably best _ CD,
``Pink Pearl.'' Released this week, her debut on independent label
Beyond Music ends the Denver native's three-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   With a mix of acoustic folk, bossa nova and a touch of hip-hop
on the first single, ``One of These Days,'' ``Pink Pearl'' is more
wide-ranging musically than Sobule has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   But her ability to pen incisive (and sometimes wickedly funny)
portraits and observations is undimmed: ``Heroes'' addresses the
imperfection of such icons as Dorothy Parker and Pablo Picasso;
``Lucy at the Gym'' looks at a sad, compulsive, weight-obsessed
woman; and ``Mary Kay'' is her take on the strange case of Mary Kay
Letourneau, who was convicted of child rape after an affair with a
junior high school student.
</P>
<P>
   All the CD's positives, she says, stem from recording at a slow
pace _ thanks to being unemployed and broke since she was dropped
by Atlantic Records after her third CD, ``Happy Town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my time was up with Atlantic when I was on the Lilith
tour in 1998 and I was playing at 4 p.m. and the ticket said the
show was starting at 5,'' Sobule says with a laugh. ``They thought
I'd give them another I Kissed a Girl,' and I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one guy from Atlantic ever called me _ they were so cold.
I mean, I know I was dropped but they could have treated me more
like a human being and less like just a ... I don't know ... a
content provider.''
</P>
<P>
   So she dealt with her bitterness (''I'd be like, `Why is this
person on the radio and not me?' ''), took several months off and
then began playing guitar in Lloyd Cole's band, the Negatives.
</P>
<P>
   And every so often, she'd swing into Nashville and record a
couple of tracks at a small studio owned by Brad Jones and Robin
Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like doing demos,'' she says. ``They let me record
for free, 'cause I was broke. There was no feeling of risk _ it
wasn't like I had to go in and do a record. It all sort of just
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Sobule says she had more time to contemplate, to
look at the world around her and into herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``One'' came from reading old junior high journals and realizing
that she was writing the same things she had written way back then;
``Heroes'' was the product of reading biographies of Picasso and
Parker, and so on. The CD's forlorn ender, ``Rock Me to Sleep'' _ a
simple declaration of loneliness and needing human contact _ was
done at home on a four-track tape recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm attracted to troubled, lonely women in my writing,'' she
says. ``Even if you write about another character, you put yourself
into the point of view. I spent about a year in high school with
this eating/exercising disorder, and it's a lonely existence and a
big waste of time. So `Lucy' isn't about me, but part of me is her.
And `Mary Kay' I saw as a great modern Greek tragedy _ it's about
the love you can't have, and we've all felt that.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the humorous ``Heroes.'' A roll call of famous,
talented people, it also looks at their real or imagined faults _
``Orson Welles peaked at 25, ballooned before our eyes and he sold
bad wine/Heard Babe Ruth was full of malice/Lewis Carroll I'm sure
did Alice'' _ and ends with Sobule deciding to ``get drunk and
depressed'' upon reflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just an exercise I did after reading biographies of
Dorothy Parker and Picasso,'' she says. ``She just wasn't a nice
person, and neither was he. I can see where the music business has
made me bitter and depressed, but I don't want to go there. It's
toxic to be bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be Dorothy Parker! I will fight against it!'' she
says, laughing again.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, she doesn't have to fight that hard. Her new
label, she says, is a good fit for her: It's smaller, and there's
virtually no pressure to come up with a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an easy thing; I don't fit in anywhere easily,'' she
says. ``I was just a novelty act to Atlantic. Beyond (Music) can
figure out what to do with me more.''
</P>
<P>
   What she plans to do, she says, is hit the road hard; she
recently completed Warren Zevon's tour and plans to stay on the
road for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna do the grassroots thing, 'cause you can't rely on
them record companies,'' Sobule says, adopting a hick Southern
accent and giggling.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, she will be doing ``Kissed;'' after all this time,
she's learned to appreciate the song again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to re-embrace it because it did get me on MTV, which
I don't think will ever happen again,'' she says. ``And I've had so
many people write to me, thanking me and telling me, `I was 13 when
I heard that and it made me feel better about having a crush on my
girlfriend.' So in a way it was a great thing. I don't play it
every night, but I will if people ask for it.''

COMMENTARY: MAXIMUS PUNISHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's axiomatic. If you cross Rudolph Giuliani, he will come
after you.
</P>
<P>
   City Comptroller Alan Hevesi spent years avoiding any serious
confrontations with the mayor. Why mess with a hornets' nest?
Hevesi, a Democrat with a studiously low-keyed demeanor, apparently
made up his mind very early on that he would get along with
Giuliani, a Republican who is about as keyed up and combative as
any politician you'll ever see.
</P>
<P>
   If there were disagreements, they could be handled quietly,
gentlemanly, with a phone call or an explanatory memo. No need for
unpleasantness. That was Hevesi's way. And it seemed just fine with
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   This peaceful coexistence ended in January, when the comptroller
came across big-league irregularities in the mayor's
welfare-to-work contracts and refused to sign off on them. The
contracts should have been competitively bid but were not. And, in
Hevesi's view, a Virginia consulting company that was gobbling up
most of the money, Maximus Inc., was the beneficiary of blatant
favoritism and cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the individuals who stood to benefit from the contracts
(worth at least $104 million and potentially a lot more) was
Richard J. Schwartz, a former adviser to Giuliani who just happened
to have designed the mayor's welfare-to-work program.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's objections were communicated to the mayor
quietly. The mayor, in his usual dismissive way, told the
comptroller he was wrong and insisted the contracts be approved.
Not only did Hevesi refuse to approve the contracts, he spelled out
his objections publicly, saying he believed the process for
awarding the contracts had been corrupted, and he referred the
matter to the Manhattan district attorney's office and the U.S.
attorney's office for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He might as well have put a sign on his chest that said ``Hit
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the mayor hit him. Giuliani's rosy budget for the
upcoming fiscal year had lots of goodies to toss around, and nearly
all of the city's elected officials were spared budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you think happened to the comptroller? Ah, yes. Alan
Hevesi's budget was slashed by nearly $5 million. It was the first
time his budget has been cut since Giuliani became mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Can you spell retribution?
</P>
<P>
   Back in December, before the Maximus dispute erupted, the mayor
had proposed a budget cut of $4.3 million for Hevesi's office. But
that was considered routine, no different from similar proposed
cuts in prior years. In those years the money was always restored
after some negotiating. Additional revenues and savings were found.
Accommodations were made. That's the way the budget process works.
</P>
<P>
   But not this year. Not for Alan Hevesi, who dared to cross the
mayor. When Giuliani's preliminary budget proposal was announced in
January, the proposed cut for Hevesi's office had increased to $4.8
million. This, perhaps, still could have seemed routine. The budget
process is complex, an annual, almost sacred ritual of give and
take that is difficult to analyze before it is completed.
</P>
<P>
   What happened this year is that the City Council, as usual,
restored some of the cuts imposed by the mayor. It sent the budget
back to Giuliani with restorations in the following areas:
libraries, arts and cultural institutions, the City Council's own
budget, and Hevesi's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani OK'd all the restorations, except the one for Hevesi.
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor announced his final budget proposal last week,
the cut in the budget of the comptroller's office stood at $4.86
million. Hevesi had officially been punished.
</P>
<P>
   What was happening with Maximus during this extended budget
negotiating period? Well, the mayor took Hevesi to court in an
effort to force him to register the contracts, but that backfired.
A judge ruled two weeks ago that there was ``compelling evidence
that the contracting process has been corrupted,'' and that Maximus
had misled the city about Schwartz's role.
</P>
<P>
   The city is appealing. Meanwhile, officials at the mayor's
Office of Management and Budget denied Wednesday that Hevesi's
budget cut had anything to do with the dispute over Maximus.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Transkaryotic Therapies Inc., which is challenging Amgen Inc. in
a major patent dispute, saw its shares plunge more than $4 after
procedural ruling by US District Court Judge William Young in
Boston
</P>
<P>
   Amgen's shares, however, rose $2.9375 to $57.25 while TKT stock
closed at $28 a share, down $4.125.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy stock trading in both companies Wednesday came after a
two-hour hearing when the judge ruled that TKT violated a claim on
one Amgen patent for the production of Epogen, an anemia drug that
is the world's biggest-selling biotechnology therapeutic product.
The ruling was sought by Amgen in preparation for a May 15th
nonjury patent trial before Judge Young. The trial is expected to
last through late June.
</P>
<P>
   For Amgen, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., the nation's largest
biotech company, the stakes are significant. Last year its Epogen
sales were $1.8 billion of its $3.3 billion in revenues. Epogen is
used by kidney dialysis patients to stimulate the production of red
blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with the court's ruling said Amgen chief
executive Gordon Binder.
</P>
<P>
   TKT has questioned the validity and enforceability of Amgen's
Epogen patents as it prepares, with its pharmaceutical partner
Aventis Pharma (the pharmaceutical company of Aventis SA), to
market a version of Epogen using a different technology and
manufacturing process. Amgen insists the TKT/Aventis plans to sell
the equivalent of Epogen in the United States violates 18 claims on
five Amgen patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``To draw any conclusions from Judge Young's decision is
premature,'' said Daniel E. Geffken, TKT vice president and chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The procedural ruling is expected to narrow the scope of the
trial on whether Amgen's patents are valid, said several Wall
Street analysts who traveled to Boston for Judge Young's ruling.
Some said his decision was a modest win for Amgen while others
believed it would benefit the biotech giant at the upcoming patent
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be a disappointment for TKT because Young's
decision does weight heavily in Amgen's favor,'' said Elise T.
Wang, biotechnology analyst at Paine Webber. ``He has narrowed the
scope on the issues for the trial and that will require TKT to
prove that Amgen's patents are invalid and cannot be enforced _ a
tough burden of proof for Amgen and Aventis.''
</P>
<P>
   Her views are similar to other Wall Street analysts who follow
both companies. However, a few analysts maintain that TKT will
ultimately prevail because its technology and manufacturing process
for making the equivalent of Epogen is significantly different from
Amgen's patents and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was Amgen I would be disappointed going into the trial,''
said Jonas V. Alsenas, biotechnology analyst at ING.Barings Ltd.
``For all their huffing and puffing the judge only ruled that there
is some product overlap, probably the most vulnerable part of the
patent. But he did not rule on whether TKT's way of making their
product violated Amgen's patents. He left that for the trial. The
key issue is how broadly Judge Young will interpret the Amgen
patents.''
</P>
<P>
   TKT maintains it has developed another way of making a version
of Epogen. The method is called gene-activation technology, which
uses all human cells that have a complete set of genes. That
approach, say TKT officials, is different from Amgen, which uses a
gene-splicing technology. Amgen inserts the gene for making Epogen
into Chinese hamster ovary cells, which then make the protein.
</P>
<P>
   And while TKT insists the two processes are different, Amgen
maintains that its patents cover all versions of the drug made in
cells of vertebrates, including humans. TKT and Aventis say that
definition is too broad and should not include human cells.
</P>
<P>
   TKT is not the first company to challenge Amgen. Genetics
Institute of Cambridge battled Amgen in the federal courts in the
mid-1990s when both were developing the same drug that Amgen calls
Epogen. Amgen won that patent battle. Genetics Institute was later
acquired by American Home Products Corp.

 &HT;    FLORIDA'S GRAHAM IN TOUGH POSITION OVER ELIAN SITUATION, BUT
REMAINS UNBOWED
 &HT;    With ELIAN-GRAHAM-0427.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Bob Graham, a moderate Democrat who counts his
friendship with President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno
in decades, finds himself in an unusual position in the fallout
over Elian Gonzalez _ aligned with conservative Republicans who are
harshly critical of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Graham's high-profile, emotional split with Clinton
and Reno comes amid what may be his best, and last, chance to break
through on the national political stage. The 63-year-old Graham has
been frequently mentioned as a possible running-mate for Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, in a interview with Cox News Service, said he has not
weighed the potential political impact of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not given one second's thought to the political
consequences of this,'' Graham said. ``My responsibility is to the
people of Florida and the national issues raised by this case, and
I have been trying to carry out my responsibilities to the best of
my ability.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore campaign advisor said it's too early to assess the impact
of Graham's actions this week on his prospects for being selected
as a running-mate but speculated that ``they won't help or hurt
him.'' The advisor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that
the highly personal selection of a vice presidential candidate
probably won't be finalized until August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go,'' the advisor said.
</P>
<P>
   Two well-known Washington political analysts said they did not
believe Graham's split with the administration _ a position similar
to that taken by Gore _ would hurt the senator politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there are sharp differences in Florida among the
Cuban and the non-Cuban community, I don't think you are going to
see the non-Cuban community turn against Graham,'' said Norm J.
Ornstein, an analyst with the non-partisan American Enterprise
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is so much less shrill than (others) that it's not
going to offend people even if they disagree,'' Ornstein said,
adding that ``this gives him a little more national visibility. I
doubt it has caused a schism between Graham and Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cook, publisher of the independent Cook Political
Report, said national politicians understand that ``any statewide
elected official in Florida has to take the positions (Graham) has
taken and do what he has done. I can't imagine any of the
Democratic leaders begrudging him what he has done. It's what you
have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who has been one of the biggest
defenders of the administration's actions, said Graham ``has
impressed people like me who disagree with him ... being honest,
consistent and compassionate should not hurt somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Graham statements over the past four days have put him
sharply at odds with Clinton and Reno.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday and at a Capitol
news conference Tuesday, Graham testily accused Clinton of going
back on a commitment not to conduct a night-time raid on the house
of Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who said there was ``an insensitivity and a crudeness''
to the pre-dawn raid the day before Easter, said he did not know
what was ``motivating the administration to act in such a perverse
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's comments were disputed by White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart who portrayed Clinton's statement as more of a desire than
a promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Joe Lockhart was not in the room when the statement was
made,'' Graham responded when asked about Lockhart's comments at
the Tuesday news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida senator's rise to a potential No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket is due to a combination of geography and ideology
and personality.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, Graham has to be considered by the Gore because
Florida's 25 electoral votes is one of the largest blocs in the
Electoral College, where 270 votes wins the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A former two-term governor now in his third term as senator,
Graham has dominated Florida politics for nearly a quarter century
and is still immensely popular throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Most political observers put Florida in the Republican column
this year for two years: Florida has a post-World War II tradition
of voting Republican for president _ eight out of 12 times in the
past half-century; and the presumptive GOP nominee, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush is the brother of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But adding Graham to the ticket could put the outcome in Florida
in doubt, forcing Bush to spend precious time and money there
instead of other states around the country, Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Ideologically, Graham has built a solid moderate base, which he
demonstrated most recently as one of the primary organizers of a
group of moderate Democratic senators.
</P>
<P>
   Gore followed Graham's lead initially in splitting with the
Clinton administration over whether the fate of the 6-year-old
Cuban rafter should be decided by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service or by a state court specializing in custody
matters.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's position _ espoused by Clinton and Reno _
is that the issue is an immigration matter and only Elian's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, can speak on his behalf. The father has
repeatedly said he intends to return the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gore joined Graham and Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., in supporting a
bill that would grant Elian and his father permanent residency
status in the United States _ a move that would take the case out
of federal jurisdiction and allowed the boy's Miami relatives to
challenge custody in state court.
</P>
<P>
   But while Graham has been outspoken, almost bitter, about
Saturday's events, Gore has been more reticent _ although he said
he would not have ordered the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who has previously indicated he would be eager to serve
as Gore's running-mate, dismissed suggestions that his recent
behavior might have knocked him out of consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a job that I love and find to be very challenging _
more challenging in the last five days than I would hope to be the
norm _ and I am not looking for any other occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Graham said he would prefer to have positive relations
with Clinton and Reno, ``the three of us are all adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Reno have known each other for 40 years. Both Miami
natives cut their political teeth in Dade County, Fla., politics.
Reno was state attorney in Dade County when Graham was governor and
Graham was instrumental in persuading Clinton to consider her for
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were probably times when Janet was state attorney and I
was governor that she disagreed with what I did. That's the nature
of a long-term relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Graham first met Clinton after they were elected governors of
their respective states in 1978. The two were among the early
moderate Democrats who formed the Democratic Leadership Council.
Graham was reportedly on Clinton's short list of possible
running-mates in 1992 before the nod finally went to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a friend of Janet for 40 years and a friend of the
president for 22 years, and I intend to continue to be friends.''

 &HT;    GOP TREADING IN DANGEROUS, FAMILIAR WATERS WITH ELIAN HEARINGS
 &HT;    With ELIAN-GRAHAM-0427.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans, in scheduling hearings
into the pre-dawn raid to seize Elian Gonzalez from the home of his
Miami relatives, are once again defying public opinion and the
advice of their own political experts.
</P>
<P>
   The warning from some of the GOP's top analysts is that the
hearings on the Elian Gonzalez case could backfire on the party the
way the impeachment of President Clinton led to the loss of five
Republican seats in Congress in the 1998 election and the
resignation of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the architect of the
GOP takeover of Congress four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, one lesson we learned from the impeachment process
is that we blew what should have been a very strong election year
by politicizing the process,'' said Ed Goeas, president of the
Tarrance Group, one of the most successful Republican polling and
strategy teams.
</P>
<P>
   The political calculations went on as the Elian Gonzalez drama
continued on several fronts Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In Atlanta, the father of the Cuban shipwreck survivor filed a
motion with a federal appeals court seeking the sole right to speak
for his 6-year-old son before the courts. ``This father beseeches
this court with all the emotion and fervor of a parent protecting
his son to let him raise his child in peace,'' the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In Havana, Elian's 10-year-old cousin Yasmany Betancourt
Valentin and his former kindergarten teacher Agueda Cecilia Fleitas
Miranda left Jose Marti International Airport for a reunion with
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In Washington, a child psychiatrist, Dr. Paulina F. Kernberg
of Cornell University, who Tuesday interviewed Elian for the
government recommended postponing any visit by the Miami relatives
until they reconcile with Elian's father. ``She believes that
before the Miami relatives see Elian they need to work out their
differences with Juan Miguel,'' said Justice Department spokeswoman
Carole Florman.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In Queenstown, Md., satellite trucks, television crews, state
troopers and a handful of protesters gathered near the secluded
estate where the Cuban child and his family were staying. Heavily
armed U.S. marshals patrolled the property's perimeter and Coast
Guard launches on the Wye River chased away boaters who strayed too
close to the 1,100-acre grounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In Miami, shops reopened and people returned to work, a day
after a general strike in Little Havana to protest last weekend's
pre-dawn seizure of Elian. But about 80 people left for Washington,
D.C., in a caravan of cars and buses. Messages written on the
windows read: ``Justice for Elian,'' ``Elian's S.W.A.T.'' and
``We'll never forget you Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also in Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Peter Romero
said Cuban President Fidel Castro has ``manipulated'' the case for
his own political purposes. The administration vowed to continue
efforts to isolate Cuba. The comments were the most strident by an
administration official since Elian arrived in South Florida last
November after being rescued at sea during an ill-fated boat trip
that claimed the life of his mother and 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   And as the five-month-old international tug-of-war over the
little boy heads for congressional hearings next week, it is
rapidly evolving into an election-year issue for the GOP despite
the counsel of caution from within party ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an issue to be politicized,'' Goeas said. ``Let
people come to their own gut conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   But does the Republican Party really have a choice?
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban exile community has been one of the most loyal GOP
voting blocs for decades, historically voting 80-90 percent
Republican. And the Cuban American vote is pivotal in Florida, a
key state in the Republican strategy to reclaim the White House
after Bill Clinton's two terms.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Republicans in Congress appear to be marching
in near unison once again to express outrage over acts committed by
the Clinton administration. And they know what to expect in the way
of Democratic criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone knows the spin that the White House is going
to put on this ... You know, 'there go the Republicans again',''
said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., even as he pressed for hearings. ``I
think we ought to move ahead and we ought to be prepared that we're
going to be attacked, saying that this is more political witch
hunt,'' added Mack, who is not seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   However, a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll shows overwhelming approval
of the federal raid that led to the reunion of 6-year-old Elian
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Sixty percent approved of
the raid while 35 percent disapproved.
</P>
<P>
   And 68 percent of those polled in the days following the
military-style raid in Miami expressed opposition to congressional
hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Independent pollster John Zogby had similar results in his poll.
Sixty-two percent opposed hearings while 30 percent supported them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this could be is the impeachment debacle all over
again,'' Zogby said. ``Regardless of the merits of the issue one
way or another, you get a strong sense here that voters are sick of
it, and that any effort to prolong this could really hurt
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Trent Lott of Mississippi, in announcing the
hearings, dismissed such polls. ``I don't believe the American
people approved of the kind of action they saw Saturday morning,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Republican-led Congress already has a reputation of
preferring to ``investigate rather than legislate,'' said Celinda
Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``The American people are wondering
what Congress has actually done.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the impeachment of Clinton, the GOP leadership of
Congress has also conducted highly publicized investigations of
Clinton real estate dealings, Clinton-Gore campaign fundraising,
the suicide of former Clinton White House aide Vince Foster and the
federal raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess the effect of possible GOP campaign ads
featuring television footage of the raid on Elian's Miami
relatives's home, Lake insisted it would help Democratic efforts to
win the six seats needed to regain control of the House. ``It would
put the House in play,'' she said.

   RUSSIA-U.S.-ARMS (Washington) _ The Russian foreign minister,
Igor Ivanov, laid down a challenge Wednesday, saying in a vivid
speech here that the Clinton administration should not follow
through on national missile defense and make the ``fatal mistake''
of changing the basic arms control treaty of the Cold War. Just
hours before Ivanov spoke Sen. Jesse Helms said that if President
Clinton succeeded in persuading the Russians to amend the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the deal would be ``dead on
arrival'' in his committee. Helms derided the president for wanting
a ``final photo-op'' with Russians before leaving the White House.

problem: the math phobia that afflicts many students, and the
disparity between the test scores of white middle-class and Asian
students and their poorer black and Hispanic counterparts. The
district, stretching from the wealthy Upper East Side to immigrant
Chinatown, embraced a new ``constructivist'' curriculum without
textbooks, which preaches that it is more important for children to
construct their own solutions than to learn the standard
theoretical rules. Now the district is at the center of a rebellion
by parents, mathematicians and many mathematics teachers over how
to teach math that has shaken the education establishment from New
York City to Plano, Texas, and Lincoln, Mass. A special report by

Court on Wednesday was whether the Boy Scouts have a constitutional

gay rights. Rather, what clearly concerned the court were the
implications of ruling for one side or the other. If the Boy Scouts
cannot exclude homosexuals, can they still exclude girls, the

 &HT;    FLORIDA'S GRAHAM IN TOUGH POSITION OVER ELIAN SITUATION, BUT
REMAINS UNBOWED
 &HT;    With ELIAN-GRAHAM-0427.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Bob Graham, a moderate Democrat who counts his
friendship with President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno
in decades, finds himself in an unusual position in the fallout
over Elian Gonzalez _ aligned with conservative Republicans who are
harshly critical of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Graham's high-profile, emotional split with Clinton
and Reno comes amid what may be his best, and last, chance to break
through on the national political stage. The 63-year-old Graham has
been frequently mentioned as a possible running-mate for Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, in a interview with Cox News Service, said he has not
weighed the potential political impact of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not given one second's thought to the political
consequences of this,'' Graham said. ``My responsibility is to the
people of Florida and the national issues raised by this case, and
I have been trying to carry out my responsibilities to the best of
my ability.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore campaign advisor said it's too early to assess the impact
of Graham's actions this week on his prospects for being selected
as a running-mate but speculated that ``they won't help or hurt
him.'' The advisor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that
the highly personal selection of a vice presidential candidate
probably won't be finalized until August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go,'' the advisor said.
</P>
<P>
   Two well-known Washington political analysts said they did not
believe Graham's split with the administration _ a position similar
to that taken by Gore _ would hurt the senator politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there are sharp differences in Florida among the
Cuban and the non-Cuban community, I don't think you are going to
see the non-Cuban community turn against Graham,'' said Norm J.
Ornstein, an analyst with the non-partisan American Enterprise
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is so much less shrill than (others) that it's not
going to offend people even if they disagree,'' Ornstein said,
adding that ``this gives him a little more national visibility. I
doubt it has caused a schism between Graham and Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cook, publisher of the independent Cook Political
Report, said national politicians understand that ``any statewide
elected official in Florida has to take the positions (Graham) has
taken and do what he has done. I can't imagine any of the
Democratic leaders begrudging him what he has done. It's what you
have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who has been one of the biggest
defenders of the administration's actions, said Graham ``has
impressed people like me who disagree with him ... being honest,
consistent and compassionate should not hurt somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Graham statements over the past four days have put him
sharply at odds with Clinton and Reno.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday and at a Capitol
news conference Tuesday, Graham testily accused Clinton of going
back on a commitment not to conduct a night-time raid on the house
of Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who said there was ``an insensitivity and a crudeness''
to the pre-dawn raid the day before Easter, said he did not know
what was ``motivating the administration to act in such a perverse
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's comments were disputed by White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart who portrayed Clinton's statement as more of a desire than
a promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Joe Lockhart was not in the room when the statement was
made,'' Graham responded when asked about Lockhart's comments at
the Tuesday news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida senator's rise to a potential No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket is due to a combination of geography and ideology
and personality.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, Graham has to be considered by the Gore because
Florida's 25 electoral votes is one of the largest blocs in the
Electoral College, where 270 votes wins the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A former two-term governor now in his third term as senator,
Graham has dominated Florida politics for nearly a quarter century
and is still immensely popular throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Most political observers put Florida in the Republican column
this year for two years: Florida has a post-World War II tradition
of voting Republican for president _ eight out of 12 times in the
past half-century; and the presumptive GOP nominee, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush is the brother of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But adding Graham to the ticket could put the outcome in Florida
in doubt, forcing Bush to spend precious time and money there
instead of other states around the country, Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Ideologically, Graham has built a solid moderate base, which he
demonstrated most recently as one of the primary organizers of a
group of moderate Democratic senators.
</P>
<P>
   Gore followed Graham's lead initially in splitting with the
Clinton administration over whether the fate of the 6-year-old
Cuban rafter should be decided by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service or by a state court specializing in custody
matters.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's position _ espoused by Clinton and Reno _
is that the issue is an immigration matter and only Elian's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, can speak on his behalf. The father has
repeatedly said he intends to return the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gore joined Graham and Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., in supporting a
bill that would grant Elian and his father permanent residency
status in the United States _ a move that would take the case out
of federal jurisdiction and allowed the boy's Miami relatives to
challenge custody in state court.
</P>
<P>
   But while Graham has been outspoken, almost bitter, about
Saturday's events, Gore has been more reticent _ although he said
he would not have ordered the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who has previously indicated he would be eager to serve
as Gore's running-mate, dismissed suggestions that his recent
behavior might have knocked him out of consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a job that I love and find to be very challenging _
more challenging in the last five days than I would hope to be the
norm _ and I am not looking for any other occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Graham said he would prefer to have positive relations
with Clinton and Reno, ``the three of us are all adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Reno have known each other for 40 years. Both Miami
natives cut their political teeth in Dade County, Fla., politics.
Reno was state attorney in Dade County when Graham was governor and
Graham was instrumental in persuading Clinton to consider her for
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were probably times when Janet was state attorney and I
was governor that she disagreed with what I did. That's the nature
of a long-term relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Graham first met Clinton after they were elected governors of
their respective states in 1978. The two were among the early
moderate Democrats who formed the Democratic Leadership Council.
Graham was reportedly on Clinton's short list of possible
running-mates in 1992 before the nod finally went to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a friend of Janet for 40 years and a friend of the
president for 22 years, and I intend to continue to be friends.''

 &HT;    GOP TREADING IN DANGEROUS, FAMILIAR WATERS WITH ELIAN HEARINGS
 &HT;    With ELIAN-GRAHAM-0427.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans, in scheduling hearings
into the pre-dawn raid to seize Elian Gonzalez from the home of his
Miami relatives, are once again defying public opinion and the
advice of their own political experts.
</P>
<P>
   The warning from some of the GOP's top analysts is that the
hearings on the Elian Gonzalez case could backfire on the party the
way the impeachment of President Clinton led to the loss of five
Republican seats in Congress in the 1998 election and the
resignation of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the architect of the
GOP takeover of Congress four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, one lesson we learned from the impeachment process
is that we blew what should have been a very strong election year
by politicizing the process,'' said Ed Goeas, president of the
Tarrance Group, one of the most successful Republican polling and
strategy teams.
</P>
<P>
   The political calculations went on as the Elian Gonzalez drama
continued on several fronts Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In Atlanta, the father of the Cuban shipwreck survivor filed a
motion with a federal appeals court seeking the sole right to speak
for his 6-year-old son before the courts. ``This father beseeches
this court with all the emotion and fervor of a parent protecting
his son to let him raise his child in peace,'' the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In Havana, Elian's 10-year-old cousin Yasmany Betancourt
Valentin and his former kindergarten teacher Agueda Cecilia Fleitas
Miranda left Jose Marti International Airport for a reunion with
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In Washington, a child psychiatrist, Dr. Paulina F. Kernberg
of Cornell University, who Tuesday interviewed Elian for the
government recommended postponing any visit by the Miami relatives
until they reconcile with Elian's father. ``She believes that
before the Miami relatives see Elian they need to work out their
differences with Juan Miguel,'' said Justice Department spokeswoman
Carole Florman.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In Queenstown, Md., satellite trucks, television crews, state
troopers and a handful of protesters gathered near the secluded
estate where the Cuban child and his family were staying. Heavily
armed U.S. marshals patrolled the property's perimeter and Coast
Guard launches on the Wye River chased away boaters who strayed too
close to the 1,100-acre grounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In Miami, shops reopened and people returned to work, a day
after a general strike in Little Havana to protest last weekend's
pre-dawn seizure of Elian. But about 80 people left for Washington,
D.C., in a caravan of cars and buses. Messages written on the
windows read: ``Justice for Elian,'' ``Elian's S.W.A.T.'' and
``We'll never forget you Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also in Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Peter Romero
said Cuban President Fidel Castro has ``manipulated'' the case for
his own political purposes. The administration vowed to continue
efforts to isolate Cuba. The comments were the most strident by an
administration official since Elian arrived in South Florida last
November after being rescued at sea during an ill-fated boat trip
that claimed the life of his mother and 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   And as the five-month-old international tug-of-war over the
little boy heads for congressional hearings next week, it is
rapidly evolving into an election-year issue for the GOP despite
the counsel of caution from within party ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an issue to be politicized,'' Goeas said. ``Let
people come to their own gut conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   But does the Republican Party really have a choice?
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban exile community has been one of the most loyal GOP
voting blocs for decades, historically voting 80-90 percent
Republican. And the Cuban American vote is pivotal in Florida, a
key state in the Republican strategy to reclaim the White House
after Bill Clinton's two terms.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Republicans in Congress appear to be marching
in near unison once again to express outrage over acts committed by
the Clinton administration. And they know what to expect in the way
of Democratic criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone knows the spin that the White House is going
to put on this ... You know, 'there go the Republicans again',''
said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., even as he pressed for hearings. ``I
think we ought to move ahead and we ought to be prepared that we're
going to be attacked, saying that this is more political witch
hunt,'' added Mack, who is not seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   However, a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll shows overwhelming approval
of the federal raid that led to the reunion of 6-year-old Elian
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Sixty percent approved of
the raid while 35 percent disapproved.
</P>
<P>
   And 68 percent of those polled in the days following the
military-style raid in Miami expressed opposition to congressional
hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Independent pollster John Zogby had similar results in his poll.
Sixty-two percent opposed hearings while 30 percent supported them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this could be is the impeachment debacle all over
again,'' Zogby said. ``Regardless of the merits of the issue one
way or another, you get a strong sense here that voters are sick of
it, and that any effort to prolong this could really hurt
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Trent Lott of Mississippi, in announcing the
hearings, dismissed such polls. ``I don't believe the American
people approved of the kind of action they saw Saturday morning,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Republican-led Congress already has a reputation of
preferring to ``investigate rather than legislate,'' said Celinda
Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``The American people are wondering
what Congress has actually done.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the impeachment of Clinton, the GOP leadership of
Congress has also conducted highly publicized investigations of
Clinton real estate dealings, Clinton-Gore campaign fundraising,
the suicide of former Clinton White House aide Vince Foster and the
federal raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess the effect of possible GOP campaign ads
featuring television footage of the raid on Elian's Miami
relatives's home, Lake insisted it would help Democratic efforts to
win the six seats needed to regain control of the House. ``It would
put the House in play,'' she said.

 &HT;    Civil rights group alters agenda as it celebrates 80 years
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In its incarnation as the Commission on Interracial
Cooperation, the Southern Regional Council sought to end obstacles
blacks faced on tenant farms, in schools and in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Atlanta-based SRC became the brain power for
front-line activists in the civil rights movement. Its scholars and
researchers documented the plight of blacks in the South. The
unraveling of the Deep South's desegregation in the 1960s helped
stir the region into the melting pot it is today.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Southern minorities face more complex, but less graphic,
encumbrances, says SRC President Charles S. Johnson. At the group's
80th anniversary celebration tonight at Swissotel in Atlanta,
Johnson will outline the changes and provide a signpost for SRC's
direction in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson will be among those honored
during tonight's ceremonies. The organization will present its
journalism award to Brad Warthen, editorial page editor of The
State newspaper in Columbia, S.C. Warthen has been an outspoken
supporter of those who want the controversial Confederate battle
flag removed from the Statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   In the confrontational days of the 1960s, the violent opposition
of white officials _ like infamous Birmingham, Ala., Police Chief
Bull Connor, who let loose dogs on civil rights demonstrators _
helped demonstrate the depth of racial separation, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when, in a lot of ways, the problems were
more stark,'' said Johnson, whose grandfather was the first
chairman of the SRC's executive committee in 1944. ``The problems
were problems about which it might have been easier to prick the
conscience of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more difficult for people to grasp the problems that come
from electoral districts that are malapportioned, or are
apportioned in a way to minimize black voter participation. ... You
can't draw a picture or show a photograph that dramatizes those
kinds of problems. They require a lot more explaining, and
sometimes the remedy is a lot more technical than direct action.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, Johnson's address will be a reintroduction of SRC _
once the pre-eminent voice for social change and one of the first
groups to form a biracial coalition in the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has the high profile it once had,'' said John
Shelton Reed, director of the Howard Odum Institute for Research in
Social Science at the University of North Carolina. A sociologist
at UNC, Odum became SRC's first president in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was conspicuous because it was one of the voices of
dissent,'' Reed said. ``These days, it's one civil rights group
among many, and the agenda is not as clear as it once was. Once
upon a time, they were a single-issue group, and that issue was
race relations.''
</P>
<P>
   As the conspicuous clues of racial segregation have disappeared
_ no more whites-only bathrooms, no more whites-only schools _ the
rudder of the civil rights movement has wavered. There's cause to
step back and chart the possible paths, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've continued to try and be a think tank for the movement,
recognizing that the focus of the movement _ if you could find a
focus _ has certainly changed and become more diffused,'' said
Johnson, a lawyer at the Atlanta firm Holland and Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, for instance, the SRC began its voting rights program.
For the next 15 years, the program helped shape fair redistricting
plans for more than 2,000 jurisdictions in the South. Today, SRC is
reaching out to growing minority populations, including Latinos and
Asians, trying to forge new coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, civil rights groups have re-energized
themselves in the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People has launched a tourism boycott in the state until
the Legislature removes the Confederate battle flag from the top of
the Statehouse dome. On Tuesday, the state House Judiciary
Committee approved a bill that would do just that.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the NAACP organized an 11,000-person march in
protest of Gov. Jeb Bush's order that ends racial set-asides in
state hiring and admission to public universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two issues kind of illustrate where we are,'' Johnson
said. ``In a lot of ways, the flag is a symbolic issue. It's hard
to show how the presence of a particular flag over the Capitol in
Columbia affects anybody's life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't affect what somebody takes home in their paycheck
or how they live on a daily basis or their access to education. It
may, however, affect their perception of whose society this is,''
Johnson said. ``Are folks who are not descended from Confederate
veterans, are they just visitors or people who remain in sufferance
of somebody else who, quote, `controls' society, or is this a
society that belongs to everybody?''

A HOMECOMING FOR TREASURES LOOTED IN WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Russia, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary)   By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ For 50 years the old master drawings lay tucked away
under a bed in a provincial Russian city, the guilty secret of an
anonymous Soviet Army officer who scooped them up from the basement
of a German castle at the end of World War II as the army made its
way home from Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   And the 18th-century mosaic of semiprecious stones is one of
four that graced the walls of the toffee-colored Amber Room in a
palace outside St. Petersburg until 1941, when the entire room was
dismantled and carted away by the occupying German Army.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, as fate would have it and politics has finally
permitted, the 101 drawings from the Bremen Art Museum and the
mosaic from the palace at Tsarskoye Selo _ bits of the wreckage of
a devastating war _ will surface together for the first time at an
exchange ceremony to be attended by President Vladimir Putin of
Russia and Culture Minister Michael Naumann of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time Russia has let go any of its
so-called trophy art, a vast and uncounted trove of paintings,
sculptures, archaeological finds and other cultural objects seized
from Germany by Soviet troops as compensation for the extensive
losses caused by the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In a small way, it will ease some of the pain caused by the
disappearance of the fabled Amber Room, a gift to Peter the Great
from Frederick William I of Prussia. The room is being recreated
with a $3.5 million grant from Ruhrgas, Germany's giant gas
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our side, the return of even one element of the Amber
Room is a fine symbol, since the Amber Room has always represented
the most painful, the most poignant of our losses,'' said Russia's
deputy minister of culture, Pavel Khoroshilov. ``This is an act
that deserves attention from both sides, in Russia and Germany.''
Most experts caution that the exchange does not signal a softening
in Russia's resistance to returning its wartime booty. Russia's
claim to the majority of the art taken from Germany is still
intact, and even codified in a proposed law that would turn trophy
art into Russian national property. That proposal, which has been
kicked around among Parliament, the Kremlin and the Russian
constitutional court for three years, is expected to receive final
approval this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But like any law, this one has its exceptions, and it was the
exemption of objects taken from Germany by freelance pillagers,
like the remorseful ``owner'' of the Bremen drawings, that has
allowed the exchange to be scheduled for Saturday at the palace at
Tsarskoye Selo, which was renamed Pushkin. Other exemptions include
objects taken from religious or charitable institutions, art
treasures belonging to third countries not allied with Nazi Germany
and valuables taken from Holocaust victims or members of the
anti-Nazi resistance. Experts say that in time and with patience,
objects in these categories could eventually be released by the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is just starting,'' said Konstantin Akinsha, an
art scholar and specialist on Soviet trophy art who now works at
the United States Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets. ``If
this exchange happens, it means the ice is broken and something
more will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   From the German side, the release of the drawings and Putin's
visit are signs that after many years of painful debate, Russia is
willing to take a closer look at the contents and provenance of
this art and decide on the disposition case by case.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last six, seven years, Germany and Russia have not
been able to find a solution, even to find a common language,''
said Prof. Wolfgang Eichwede, director of Bremen University's
Eastern European Research Institute and a top German expert on
Russian trophy' art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have the beginning of a rethinking,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``I think both sides are looking for a way
out. It is too early to say that this is a new approach, but it is
already an attempt _ a step by Germany toward Russia and a step by
Russia toward Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichwede has long seen the issue as a cultural clash. ``During
the 1990s Germany and Russia developed very different and
contradictory approaches to this issue,'' he said. ``Germany kept
reiterating its position, which was that according to international
law, Russia was obliged to give back cultural valuables. Russia
said yes, the law exists, but the question of cultural loss is not
only a matter of law but also a matter of history, and Germany was
the one responsible for the war. Each side has spent a lot of time
underlining its own position and not much time trying to find the
historical responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a generation and the collapse of a political system
before the cache of 101 drawings and the Amber Room mosaic even
emerged from their secret hiding places.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s two young Soviet art scholars, Akinsha and
his colleague Grigory Kozlov, then hot on the trail of hidden
treasures from Germany, happened upon the retired army officer, who
to this day has retained his anonymity. The officer, trained as an
architect, was part of the engineering brigade that occupied
Karnzow Castle outside Berlin, where the Bremen art collection had
been sent for safekeeping in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   His trained eye recognized the value of the artwork that was
being kicked around the castle basement by Russian soldiers. He
took it home but never considered it to be the property of anyone
but its German owners. ``He wanted the stuff to go back,'' said
Akinsha, who together with Kozlov wrote a book documenting the
estimated $65 billion worth of cultural objects still kept in
secret Russian depositories. ``For all those 50 years he felt he
was sitting on stolen property.''
</P>
<P>
   At the officer's request, Akinsha and Kozlov quietly delivered
the drawings _ which include a rare watercolor by Durer, etchings
by Manet, Delacroix and Goya and lithographs by Toulouse-Lautrec _
to the German Embassy in Moscow, where they were kept in a safe in
the ambassador's office.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the long-awaited exchange was found in Bremen, the
northern German city that has long mourned the loss of its famed
Kunsthalle collection. It was in Bremen that the Amber Room mosaic
turned up out of the blue at a public auction in 1997, put up for
sale by the son of a German soldier who had apparently kept it as a
personal souvenir. The fate of the rest of the fabled Amber Room is
still unknown; it was eventually traced to Konigsberg, a German
city later taken by the Soviets and renamed Kaliningrad, where it
was last seen in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Bremen local officials, who had long been lobbying for the
return of art they knew to be in Russia, immediately put two and
two together and proposed an exchange of the mosaic for the
drawings in the ambassador's safe in Moscow. But the idea of an
exchange was hijacked by the German federal government in Bonn,
which has jealously guarded its prerogative to negotiate with the
Russians over trophy art.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the mystery donor was the second Soviet officer to come
forward with loot taken from Karnzow Castle. The other, Viktor
Baldin, who was also a member of an engineering brigade who had
trained as an architect, had confiscated 362 paintings when he too
saw how they were being treated by Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Baldin, who later became a museum director, also tried to return
his collection to Germany and made a series of appeals to a
succession of Russian leaders from Leonid Brezhnev to Boris
Yeltsin. In 1991 it looked briefly as if Yeltsin, then the Russian
President, was going to take the collection with him on a visit to
Germany until he was stopped cold by the Ministry of Culture. The
Baldin collection, which was exhibited in 1992, is now still at the
Hermitage museum.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
dismantling of the old hypersecretive Soviet system that the
Russians even admitted what they had hidden in their vaults: a
boggling array of riches that included the treasures of Troy
discovered by Heinrich Schliemann, a rich collection of paintings
by Dutch, Italian and French masters, a Gutenberg Bible and vast
libraries of archival material.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have yet to make a complete inventory of the
treasures and archival material in their possession. Only in the
last month did they declassify partial lists of the contents of
secret depositories at the State Hermitage Museum in St.
Petersburg, the Pushkin Museum in Moscow and other Russian state
museums.
</P>
<P>
   Khoroshilov said that the Russians were expecting claims for
objects that fall outside the category of Russian national property
as defined in the pending law. ``There is not a week that goes by
when we are not talking to delegations from the Netherlands,
Poland, Hungary,'' he said. ``Nobody is more interested than the
Russian side in clearing up some of these cases. But everybody is
waiting for the law, because they don't want to get tangled up in a
bureaucratic mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Khoroshilov said that Russia was also keenly interested in
sorting out its own national property _ not only valuables taken
from Nazi Germany but also cultural objects and archives taken from
the Soviet Union by the Nazis and eventually returned.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent conference in Moscow, an American researcher
presented the Russians with a documented list of the contents of 18
shipments containing almost 600,000 items that were returned to the
Soviet Union by the Americans in the 1950s from Nazi storerooms
located in the American Sector of occupied Germany.
</P>
<P>
   According to Patricia Kennedy Grimsted, a Harvard University
associate, the list of returned valuables, confirmed by documents
in the United States National Archives, came as a surprise to the
Russians, who have often said they do not know what items were
returned to them after the war. ``What they did get back is spread
all over the Soviet Union,'' Grimsted said. ``When things did come
back, they were handled so chaotically that they never could say
where they were.''

SHAREHOLDERS PASS CONTROL MEASURES AT RAYTHEON ANNUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shareholders have delivered a rebuke to Raytheon
Co. management at the company's annual meeting here, passing
nonbinding resolutions to soften antitakeover provisions and elect
all directors annually.
</P>
<P>
   The measures, opposed by the Lexington defense contractor's
board, underscored the frustration of many Raytheon stock owners
after a year of diminished profits and sinking share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's leaders say slowing overseas orders and difficulty
absorbing acquisitions have contributed to the company's problems.
But Wednesday, its chief executive, Daniel Burnham, said the
company is on track to recover. ``Raytheon has issues, we know what
they are, and we're dealing with them,'' he said. ``We believe that
Raytheon can be great again.''
</P>
<P>
   But resolution sponsors said Burnham and other top executives
must be held more accountable following thousands of layoffs and
other cost-cutting steps the company has taken in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is: We're holding you to a standard that you're
not meeting,'' said Bart Naylor, a Washington consultant for labor
and environmental groups who spoke in favor of the shareholder
resolutions. ``A board that's truly accountable wouldn't tolerate
failure for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Other backers included many of the large institutional investors
that together control 75 percent of Raytheon's shares. Public
pension funds, including the California Public Employees Retirement
System, also have voiced support for the measures.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have passed similar resolutions at dozens of other
companies in recent years, according to the nonprofit Investor
Responsibility Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's Burnham said the resolutions don't represent a major
setback. He said the board would consider implementing them. Some
of the company's antitakeover policies are required under the terms
of the mergers with other defense contractors that have doubled its
size in recent years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholder proposals were submitted by John Chevedden, a
former employee of Hughes Electronics Corp. in California prior to
its acquisition by Raytheon in 1997. Last year, he made an
unsuccessful bid to have directors elected annually.
</P>
<P>
   But the drop in Raytheon's share price by about a third since
last summer _ and the large salaries the company paid to Burnham
and others in 1999 _ brought out plenty of critics at the meeting,
held in an ornate hall at the US Chamber of Commerce, near the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker was Reed Hinchliffe, a senior staff engineer at
Raytheon's command and control systems division. He criticized
Burnham for accepting a $900,000 bonus for his work last year even
as bonuses for about 75,000 less senior employees were eliminated
because the company didn't meet certain goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't share our pain, sir,'' said Hinchliffe, who told
Burnham he has worked at Raytheon for 20 years. Citing a positive
review from Pentagon officials last year, he said that ``I did my
job, and the people I work with did their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, who like 5,000 other senior managers had his bonus
reduced by about 40 percent in 1999, told Hinchliffe, ``I
understand your point of view and I respect your view.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt the decline in the company's fortunes personally
as well, as the value of shares he holds have decreased by about
$15 million. He doesn't intend to return his bonus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing stock owners, Burnham said, ``Clearly 1999 was a
sobering year for us all.'' He repeated his previous statements
that Raytheon's outlook will improve through various
quality-improvement programs and increased defense spending. Steps
by the Pentagon to offer longer-term contracts also might help the
company earn higher returns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham said the company doesn't know yet how much it will make
on its work on a proposed national missile defense program. A
recent report by the Congressional Budget Office put the cost of
such a program at around $60 billion, far higher than previous
estimates. Some think that could be good news for Raytheon, which
would produce a missile-destroying space rocket if the
controversial program is approved.
</P>
<P>
   Of the measures passed, one calls for Raytheon to eliminate the
so-called ``poison pill'' plan it maintains to make it more
difficult for a hostile bidder to take over the company. Among
ballots cast, the proposal was supported by 62 percent of class A
shares and 61 percent of class B shares. Raytheon managers said the
suggested change could make it difficult to fend off a hostile bid
that didn't treat all of its shares equally.
</P>
<P>
   The second resolution calls for the election of board members
each year, rather than on the present staggered schedule that
opponents say entrenches the company's management. It was supported
by 58 percent of class A shares and 56 percent of class B shares.
</P>
<P>
   Another resolution, to freeze executive pay following sweeping
layoffs, was defeated, receiving the support of 9 percent of class
A shares and 10 percent of class B shares. The measure was proposed
by the Boston-based Responsible Wealth campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of shares voted wasn't available, a company
spokesman said. Raytheon's largest investors, including Templeton
Global Advisors Ltd. and Barrow Hanley Mewhinney &AMP; Straus Inc.,
didn't return calls seeking comment on the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's widely traded Class B stock dipped 81.25 cents a
share to $22.4375 on the New York Stock Exchange.

   NEW YORK _ ``They were expecting some kind of experimental house
like the one I built in Kobe,'' said the architect Shigeru Ban,
referring to the cardboard ``log'' houses he designed, along with a
paper church, for victims of the 1995 earthquake in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But Ban proposed something unexpected: a soaring lattice arch
made of cardboard tubes, which covers about a third of the
sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing 6 tons and spanning 87 feet, it has a lightness of
being, a kinetic energy. And even though it is solidly bolted in
place, it looks like a giant box kite about to snap its string and
take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make a strong contrast between the curve and the
verticals of the surrounding buildings,'' said Ban, 42, who was
commissioned to do the piece for ``Making Choices, 24 Exhibitions
of Modern Art From 1920 to 1960,'' a show that opened on Tuesday
and runs through Aug. 1. Ban, who is famous for making sturdy,
temporary structures for the world's refugees and victims of
disasters, loves assembling, disassembling and then reassembling
recyclable materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also wanted to make nice shadows,'' he added, as the arch
cast curves and diamond shadows on sunlit stone and water. He
wanted to cover the entire garden, but the budget was limited. So
the arch stops short of the three weeping beeches, which are still
open to the sky. But it covers the rustling white birches, changing
one's perception of their space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting an arch over the trees'' _ Ban searched for the words
in English _ ``makes the space underneath active and alive.''
</P>
<P>
   No steel or wood reinforces the cardboard tubes, which are
self-supporting and bracketed to the garden wall on one side and
the museum building on the other. Stainless steel cables keep the
bow to the arch. And there's a dynamic yin and yang between warm
brown paper and hard metal.
</P>
<P>
   The tubes, which are from 4 to 5 inches in diameter, were
manufactured in Germany and shipped to New York in 40-foot lengths.
The arch was then assembled in Queens over a scaffolding that
served as a mold, cut into curving sections for delivery and lifted
by crane over the trees and wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it the turtle delivery,'' said Dean Maltz, the
project's associate architect, conjuring an image of giant
carapaces being guided down into the garden and set in place by
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The lattice or diagonal grid of the arch fits elegantly into the
truss chords or curving perpendicular tubes that rise from the
garden wall. They are made of spun paper fiber that is both
flexible and water-resistant. And three coats of marine varnish
don't hurt either.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of engineering recalls the geodesic domes of
Buckminster Fuller, who built three temporary structures in the
museum's garden in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first architect to build with paper,'' said Ban,
who studied with Fuller. ``He used corrugated cardboard for the
geodesic dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Ban went on to earn a degree in architecture at Cooper Union,
and is building paper houses, museums and greenhouses of cardboard
and Plexiglas all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people recognize that this is made of paper,''
Ban said, gazing at his arch. ``I want them to be surprised. I want
them to throw away the prejudice that stops creativity.'' In other
words, you, too, could live in a paper house.
</P>
<P>
   From the log houses Ban built for the people of Kobe _ with
cardboard tubes for walls and sand-filled beer crates for
foundations _ to his own circular paper house on Lake Yamanaka in
Japan, to the Japanese pavilion he is building with Frei Otto for
Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany, Ban is demonstrating the diversity
of a material that is the stuff used to roll toilet paper and paper
towels. And it can be recycled, which saves trees.
</P>
<P>
   So when it came time to commission an architect for ``Making
Choices,'' which focuses on experiments with materials, ``Shigeru's
use of paper as a primary structural material, and his interest in
recycling made him an obvious choice,'' said Matilde McQuaide, the
curator of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Ban is good at seeing disconnections _ and fixing them. When
refugees started returning to Rwanda in 1996, Ban designed tents
with cardboard tube frames, to stop the last trees from being
chopped down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations provided plastic sheets and aluminum pipes
for frames,'' he said. ``But people sold the aluminum for money and
then cut trees to make a frame.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kobe, he noticed that people displaced by the earthquake were
not using the temporary housing provided outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to be near their work,'' he said. ``So they were
living in the park, and the city wanted to kick them out. So we
built pretty paper log houses to convince the neighbors to let them
stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ban's arch will be dismantled in August, when the garden closes
for renovations until 2004. ``It's a kind of farewell to the garden
as we know it,'' McQuaide said.

<P>
   LONDON _ In late February, I sat with Iain Kay on the back porch
of his house on Chipesa farm in southern Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   It was hot, maybe 90 degrees. We drank a cold beer, and sat
gazing out at his lush African land. Chipesa is a rich 4,500-acre
spread of grazing land for beef cattle and farmland for tobacco,
corn and paprika about 45 miles from Harare, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Kay is 51 years old, a gentle lanky man with an Abe Lincoln
beard. As he scanned his land, his eyes held a mix of love and
loss.
</P>
<P>
   If he had an inkling of what was to come, he gave no clue.
</P>
<P>
   I was in Zimbabwe to write about the plight of children whose
parents had been killed by AIDS. His wife, Kerry Kay, is an AIDS
activist and the main reason for my visit to the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Locals see the Kays as important and generous people who have
seen to the care and education of farmworkers and their children.
</P>
<P>
   We had lunch in the large main room of his fine old farmhouse.
Over plates of food grown on the farm, Kay seemed tormented by the
state of his country. He told me he me he hates politics. He
considers it a dirty yet inescapable part of his life. He is a
leader in the opposition to President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Kay detests Mugabe, who made his name during the country's war
in the 1970s to end Rhodesia's white rule. Like many in Zimbabwe _
black and white _ Kay believes it is time for Mugabe to end his
20-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   Kay considers Mugabe a poor leader who has squandered the
country's vast resources with mismanagement and a pointless
military adventure in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   His father purchased Chipesa as virgin land before Kay was born
there a half-century ago. Paradoxically, Kay's father was Mugabe's
deputy minister of agriculture in the early 1990s. His family is
from Scotland. I told him mine probably is from England. But Kay is
no more a Scot than I am an Englishman.
</P>
<P>
   He is a Zimbabwean and believes this is no less his country than
it is Robert Mugabe's.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mugabe and his followers treat him as a foreign
invader. About 70,000 whites live in this country of about 11
million. They inherited much of the old colonial trappings, such as
the large farms and businesses. About 4,500 white farmers own about
a third of Zimbabwe's productive land.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe paints whites as enemies of the state who refuse to
abandon their old ways and conspire with Britain to maintain
control at the expense of blacks. Whites have become Mugabe's
scapegoats for the legion of troubles that besiege Zimbabwe, where
more than half the people are unemployed and a quarter are infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe is pushing laws to require white farmers to surrender
their farms to the government without compensation so the land can
be redistributed to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run newspapers in Harare carry chilling accounts of
the evil done by the whites. If you were to substitute the word
``whites'' with ``Jews,'' you would get a disturbing reminder of
another country where a foreign minority was demonized by the
national government.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Kay agrees with the general principal of land
redistribution; he just believes the government must recognize that
the farmers' rights are undiminished by their race.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, I received an e-mail from Kerry Kay (apparently
no longer on the farm):
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Bert, in haste. Pretty awful situation. We had to
evaporate as there is a tag on Iain's head. Fortunately our
community is keeping an eye on things at home. Can't believe the
violence and brutality being unleashed on the population at large _
we pray for an end to the madness soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Iain Kay ventured to a nearby school, which he
had built for the children of his 120 employees. He was trying to
get a clear cellphone signal.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, 25 men jumped him and began beating Kay with sticks,
fan belts and iron rods. They pummeled his back, legs and head,
tearing a gash in his face. They tied him up with barbed wire and
dragged him into the bush. Kay told friends that he had assumed
they would execute him.
</P>
<P>
   In the nick of time, Kay's 20-year-old son approached creating a
diversion. Kay escaped into a reservoir. His attackers fled.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, a young black policeman was killed when he went to
the farm to arrest Kay's attackers.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers are part of a Mugabe-supported invasion of nearly
1,000 white-owned farms by an estimated 3,000 men who describe
themselves as veterans of Zimbabwe's war for independence. They
moved onto Kay's farm in March, built shacks and became squatters.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers consider the invasion an attempt to provoke violence
to create sympathy for the embattled Mugabe. Moreover, such an
outbreak would provide Mugabe an excuse to declare a state of
emergency, thus delaying a national election that he very well
might lose.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe says the occupation of white-owned farms is a justified
act of protest. He blamed the whites for creating the anger that
moved the veterans to act in such a way. Despite a series of court
orders declaring the occupations as illegal, the president has
refused to send in the police to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   So, far, nine people have been killed _ seven of them black. All
were Mugabe opponents. Dozens more have been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   I must confess that as a guilty white Southerner I have had a
certain ambivalence to what is happening in Zimbabwe. My gut sides
with those who want to end the vestiges of colonialism, an evil
cousin of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   As honorable a man as Kay seems to be, he inherited his land
from an evil system. I've worried that I might be lionizing a man
who could just as well be seen as a modern version of the
benevolent slave owner, a character often cited in the argument
that the Old South wasn't really so bad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, I look at this man and see the love he has for this place
and his people, and I worry even more that Zimbabwe would be
diminished without him.
</P>
<P>
   And I know that destroying a man like Iain Kay will never make
up for the wrongs of colonialism.

it is Robert Mugabe's.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mugabe and his followers treat him as a foreign
invader. About 70,000 whites live in this country of about 11
million. They inherited much of the old colonial trappings, such as
the large farms and businesses. About 4,500 white farmers own about
a third of Zimbabwe's productive land.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe paints whites as enemies of the state who refuse to
abandon their old ways and conspire with Britain to maintain
control at the expense of blacks. Whites have become Mugabe's
scapegoats for the legion of troubles that besiege Zimbabwe, where
more than half the people are unemployed and a quarter are infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe is pushing laws to require white farmers to surrender
their farms to the government without compensation so the land can
be redistributed to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run newspapers in Harare carry chilling accounts of
the evil done by the whites. If you were to substitute the word
``whites'' with ``Jews,'' you would get a disturbing reminder of
another country where a foreign minority was demonized by the
national government.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Kay agrees with the general principal of land
redistribution; he just believes the government must recognize that
the farmers' rights are undiminished by their race.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, I received an e-mail from Kerry Kay (apparently
no longer on the farm):
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Bert, in haste. Pretty awful situation. We had to
evaporate as there is a tag on Iain's head. Fortunately our
community is keeping an eye on things at home. Can't believe the
violence and brutality being unleashed on the population at large _
we pray for an end to the madness soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Iain Kay ventured to a nearby school, which he
had built for the children of his 120 employees. He was trying to
get a clear cellphone signal.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, 25 men jumped him and began beating Kay with sticks,
fan belts and iron rods. They pummeled his back, legs and head,
tearing a gash in his face. They tied him up with barbed wire and
dragged him into the bush. Kay told friends that he had assumed
they would execute him.
</P>
<P>
   In the nick of time, Kay's 20-year-old son approached creating a
diversion. Kay escaped into a reservoir. His attackers fled.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, a young black policeman was killed when he went to
the farm to arrest Kay's attackers.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers are part of a Mugabe-supported invasion of nearly
1,000 white-owned farms by an estimated 3,000 men who describe
themselves as veterans of Zimbabwe's war for independence. They
moved onto Kay's farm in March, built shacks and became squatters.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers consider the invasion an attempt to provoke violence
to create sympathy for the embattled Mugabe. Moreover, such an
outbreak would provide Mugabe an excuse to declare a state of
emergency, thus delaying a national election that he very well
might lose.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe says the occupation of white-owned farms is a justified
act of protest. He blamed the whites for creating the anger that
moved the veterans to act in such a way. Despite a series of court
orders declaring the occupations as illegal, the president has
refused to send in the police to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   So, far, nine people have been killed _ seven of them black. All
were Mugabe opponents. Dozens more have been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   I must confess that as a guilty white Southerner I have had a
certain ambivalence to what is happening in Zimbabwe. My gut sides
with those who want to end the vestiges of colonialism, an evil
cousin of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   As honorable a man as Kay seems to be, he inherited his land
from an evil system. I've worried that I might be lionizing a man
who could just as well be seen as a modern version of the
benevolent slave owner, a character often cited in the argument
that the Old South wasn't really so bad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, I look at this man and see the love he has for this place
and his people, and I worry even more that Zimbabwe would be
diminished without him.
</P>
<P>
   And I know that destroying a man like Iain Kay will never make
up for the wrongs of colonialism.

MERRICK WAS COLORFUL BROADWAY FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN DEZELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Merrick, the colorful and frequently contentious theater
impresario who's been called the ``Barnum of Broadway'' and ``The
Abominable Showman,'' died early Tuesday in London. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably Broadway's most successful producer, Mr. Merrick in the
late 1950s and 1960s is said to have grossed $20 million annually,
earning $2 million a year in salary.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for his musical hits such as ``Gypsy'' (1959), ``42nd
Street'' (1980), and ``Hello, Dolly!'' (1964), Mr. Merrick also
brought a number of groundbreaking plays to the Great White Way.
Among them were the American premieres of John Osborne's ``Look
Back in Anger'' (1957), Tom Stoppard's ``Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead'' (1967), and Peter Weiss's ``Marat Sade''
(1965). Mr. Merrick transferred the 1964 Dublin premiere of
``Philadelphia, Here I Come!,'' by a then unknown Brian Friel,
intact to Broadway, where it ran for 326 performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to keep his passport in his pocket at all times in
case he heard of a show opening in London. That way, he'd be there
first,'' producer Jon B. Platt, chairman of Broadway in Boston/SFX
Theatrical, said Wednesday. ``He was one of a kind _ a showman's
showman.''
</P>
<P>
   A believer in the the maxim that no publicity is bad publicity,
Mr. Merrick was almost as well known for media stunts as for
putting on plays. He once placed a monkey at the wheel of English
taxicab with a sign on the side of the vehicle proclaiming, ``I am
driving my master to see `The Matchmaker.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mr. Merrick's feuds with actors helped sell tickets. The
producer battled regularly with Jackie Gleason, who starred in the
musical ``Take Me Along.'' He also fought with Anna Maria
Alberghetti, star of ``Carnival,'' who reportedly hung his
photograph in the bathroom of her dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   His relations with playmakers and the press were no easier.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the opening preview performance of a troubled
production of ``42d Street,'' shortly before the curtain was to go
up, the audience was told the show had been canceled because of
technical problems. In fact, Mr. Merrick _ who had barred the press
from previews _ had spotted Cliff Jahr of The New York Times in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a snake loose in the theater,'' he said the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merrick is the Bermuda Triangle in a Brooks Brothers suit,''
Stan Freberg told the Globe in 1989, after working with the
producer on a stage version of his comedy album ``Stan Freberg
Presents the United States of America.'' After telling Freberg he
was brilliant _ the next George S. Kaufman _ and promising him
fame, fortune, and a Pulitzer, Mr. Merrick suggested bringing in
another writer to punch up the writer's script, according to
Freberg. He later told him to take Abraham Lincoln out of a Civil
War sequence ``because he doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Merrick suffered a stroke in the early 1980s that affected
his speech and for the rest of his life he used a wheelchair. His
personal life was as volatile as his career. He was married six
times, most recently to Natalie Lloyd, who had been his live-in
companion since 1989. He leaves two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Merrick's death came three days after the passing of
Alexander Cohen, another flamboyant producer with an impressive
list of Broadway shows. Cohen died Saturday at age 79.

BUSH CAMPAIGN SHOW STOPS IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the weeks since George W. Bush won the bitter
Republican primary race against Senator John McCain, he has been
revamping his campaign, mellowing its tone, and moving to the
middle, gathering many positive reviews and slowly climbing in the
polls against his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday, when the Bush road show came here to the political
equivalent of Broadway, the choreography at several stops along
Pennsylvania Avenue was complete, with every move made by the Texas
governor designed to address what some see as shortcomings in his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   No foreign policy experience? Bush hoped to erase that
perception by meeting for an hour with Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov, chastising him in private for his country's war in
Chechnya, Bush aides said. Bush also said he wants to build a
missile defense system opposed by Moscow. While Gore has far more
foreign policy experience _ and, unlike Bush, has been to Russia
numerous times _ Bush hoped to send a message that he could deal
firmly with foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   No working relationship with Democrats in Washington? Bush met
Wednesday with Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a Democrat, and
Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, a Republican, to discuss the
governor's views on Social Security reform. Bush spokeswoman Karen
Hughes later reiterated that the governor wants to allow taxpayers
to divert part of their Social Security payments to a fund that can
be invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter to the Bush campaign that Kerrey, who once
backed Democratic candidate Bill Bradley, has endorsed Gore and
will have retired from the Senate when the next president takes
office. Bush was ``impressed by (Kerrey's) thoughtful approach,''
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on whether Bush intends to outline a detailed Social
Security plan, Hughes said: ``He will endorse the concept'' of
reform ``without the specific numbers.'' Pressed further, Hughes
said Bush likes the general concept of what has become known as the
Kerrey ``2 percent plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Under that plan, the 12.4 percent Social Security tax would be
lowered to 10.4 percent, with the remaining two percentage points
worth of payments going to retirement accounts that could be
invested in the stock market. The plan's backers say this could
boost the Social Security savings of a person born this year by $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diverting money away from the Social Security trust fund is
irresponsible,'' Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said. ``Even the most
modest proposal on Capitol Hill, which is 2 percent, would bankrupt
the trust fund by 2023 when the senior population is expected to
double over the next two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrey said it was irresponsible for Gore to refuse to back
his plan, saying it would save Social Security, not bankrupt it.
Kerrey, defending his meeting with Bush, said he wasn't trying to
help the Republican candidate but was happy to educate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush said, `I like the general outline of what you are doing,'
'' Kerrey said. ``He said he didn't understand that given all that
it does for lower-income people, why don't Democrats embrace it?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's meeting with Kerrey fit into a day designed to show Bush
as presidential and bipartisan. After months of saying he wanted
voters to ``kick the tires'' of his campaign, he came to Washington
for the first time since securing the Republican nomination and
kicked the tires of the town _ and liked what he felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an incredibly optimistic person. I feel positive about
your future _ and mine,'' he told the Republican Women Leaders
Forum at the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, which for weeks has chided Gore's
inaccessibility to the media, mostly kept its candidate at a
distance Wednesday despite the greatly increased press corps that
followed him around the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for example, met for nearly an hour with several hundred
people at the Reagan center in a scripted show designed to
highlight Bush's early reading initiatives. The program featured
Bush and his guests seated on couches in an ``Oprah''-style format
and was frequently interrupted by Bush television commercials
broadcast on a large screen.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Bush was interviewed by a nervous elementary
school student about the success of the governor's reading programs
in Texas. Later, two junior high students who participate in an
independently sponsored program called ``Best Friends'' told Bush
they have agreed to abstain from sex until at least their
graduation from high school. Bush applauded in approval.
</P>
<P>
   A day after angrily declaring that Gore ``is willing to stretch
the truth and exaggerate in order to get ahead,'' Bush sought to
present himself as a model of positive campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will set a different tone. I will restore civility and
respect to our national politics,'' Bush said in remarks prepared
for a GOP fund-raiser Wednesday night. The black-tie gala by the
Republican National Committee is expected to raise a one-night
record of $18 million. But moments later in the text, Bush seemed
to go negative: ``For Al Gore's campaign, every day is
scorched-earth day.''

PURSUING 800 MURDER CASES, AND POCAHONTAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has 800 unsolved murder cases crammed into scrapbooks that
line the walls of his offices, his laboratory, even his bathroom,
like so much incriminating wallpaper: No wonder the man Gov. John
G. Rowland of Connecticut calls the most famous detective since
Sherlock Holmes _ the man whose devil-in-the-details testimony
helped get O.J. Simpson off the hook _ feels pressed to retire from
his day jobs and get on to his second career.
</P>
<P>
   His desk clock rests on a bouquet of dynamite sticks, but dead
bodies and how they get that way are what make Dr. Henry C. Lee,
the celebrated commissioner of the Connecticut State Police, tick.
Not that this Chinese refugee _ at 4, he fled the Communist
revolution with his mother and 12 siblings for Taiwan just before
his father was presumed drowned in the exodus _ has a thing for
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Lee, the former police captain (second in his class at
Taiwan's police academy, scholarship student at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice, 1975 biochemistry doctorate from New York
University) solves deaths the way his wealthy father's never was.
Did Ho-Ming Lee's boat sink by accident? Was it bombed by
Communists? He's stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe God's will: If my father don't die, maybe I become a
juvenile delinquent because I grow up too rich,'' says the fatalist
in him. Lee grew up so poor in Taiwan that he owned only one pair
of shoes each year and walked to and from school barefoot to
preserve them. He often went to bed hungry because his mother had
foraged no supper.
</P>
<P>
   But she made sure her children didn't miss an education:
``Thirteen of us, and none criminals,'' notes Lee, whose mother,
now 104, continues to nag him about his work ethic. (He says
education is a gift he gave his two children, a financial analyst
and a dentist: at his lab on weekends, they did homework while he
solved cases. He remembers it as ``quality time.'')
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a 61-year-old former martial artist (he worked his way
through college teaching kung fu, used to plant body parts in his
backyard and dig them up later to document decomposition rates. The
findings were handy during recent trips to Bosnia, where he helped
identify victims in mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   He makes grisly missions like that for two reasons: out of
respect to victims and closure-seeking families, and out of
dedication to forensic science, the calling that inspires his
17-hour workdays and an office joke. He says colleagues envision
him snapping from stress and chasing them with the samurai swords
that hang behind his desk. Lee discounts that prospect, but finds
it funny. Let's face it, there's not a ton of fun in his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody enjoys seeing dead bodies; I'm not that crazy,'' says
Lee, who gets indignant when people assume his workday unfurls like
a ``Quincy'' rerun. ``In our real life, is no Quincy,'' he says in
fractured English, one of six languages in which he manages to make
his point in lectures worldwide. ``You don't walk onto crime scene,
figure out, wrap it up in hour. You don't have tunnel vision.
That's the beauty of forensics. Common sense. No emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee makes snap conclusions in murder mysteries just once a year,
during his annual visit to the movies with his wife, Margaret. ``In
five minutes, I have it figured out. She'll say, `You're wrong!'
but I'm always right. She can't stand it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for real-life cases, he sadly revealed a host of
investigative indiscretions linked to the Los Angeles police in the
Simpson trial but neglected to answer Simpson's thank-you note, one
of 17,000 letters he received after testifying; his $100,000 expert
witness fee went, as usual, to charity. (Lee believes he testifies
for forensic facts, not for prosecution and defense lawyers.) He
scrutinized the JonBenet Ramsey crime scene, speculated that some
elements appeared staged and insists that it's ``a solvable case,''
implying that the principal investigators are too busy writing
books about it to resolve it.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed the death of the deputy White House counsel Vincent
Foster as suicide (25,000 letters on that one), and in his most
eccentric back-burner assignment, he's looking for Pocahontas,
buried in Britain 383 years ago, on behalf of the singer Wayne
Newton, who traces his American Indian roots to her tribe and wants
her interred in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of his notable cases was body-less.
</P>
<P>
   Back when ``Fargo'' was just a macabre future twinkle in the
Coen brothers' camera lens, Lee got down on all fours in a
Connecticut blizzard to scrounge for the remains of a flight
attendant suspected of being murdered and fed into a wood chipper
by her husband, an airline pilot. He worked around the clock to
crack the case, pausing only to check in at home in Branford,
Conn., for his wife to defrost his hands and feet and fortify him
with rice and tea. (He sometimes forgets to do practical things
like eat and sleep.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Lee accumulated just under an ounce of human remains,
proved they belonged to the flight attendant, and 15 years ago
prosecutors secured Connecticut's first murder conviction without
benefit of a corpse.
</P>
<P>
   It's just one of the chapters that Lee, who has his life story
down to a science and doles out autographed cups as souvenirs,
relays as he revisits his reasons for leaving his posts as
commissioner and head of the state police forensics laboratory. (He
believes he's accomplished his mission of putting the state police
in step with 21st-century technology.)
</P>
<P>
   As for future chapters, there are 800 possibilities, plus the
retrieval of an Indian princess: ``In all my life, I won't finish
800 cases,'' he frets. But he's game to try.

OPPOSITION LEADER THREATENS FORCE TO HALT ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ As President Robert Mugabe's party boycotted
church-led peace talks, Zimbabwe's opposition leader said Wednesday
his party may be forced to use force in order to defend its members
from attacks by government supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Movement for Democratic Change, a fledgling political
organization that threatens to break Mugabe's 20-year grip on
power, has until now urged its followers not to give the president
cause to impose emergency rule.
</P>
<P>
   But with violence rising against its members and the police
making only minimal efforts to stem the lawlessness, opposition
leader Morgan Tsvangirai hinted that his party would no longer turn
the other cheek. Five opposition members have been killed in the
past three days by pro-government mobs.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition ``will no longer sit back and watch our
supporters being killed,'' Tsvangirai told reporters in Zimbabwe's
capital. ``We cannot stand by and watch while our people are being
murdered. We shall devise a strategy to protect ourselves. We shall
take this violence to their doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite urgent regional and Western diplomatic efforts, Zimbabwe
is sliding deeper into a state of anarchy. In the past two months,
government supporters and veterans of the liberation war against
colonial Rhodesia have seized nearly 600 white-owned commercial
farms and invaded hundreds more. Two farmers have been killed and
scores of farm workers and their families have been badly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans claim they are taking back the land they fought for
two decades ago, but as popular support for the opposition grows,
the violence has turned increasingly political and moved off the
farms. The veterans, who launched the attacks in late February
after voters rejected Mugabe's proposed new constitution, have
vowed to go back to war if the ruling party loses upcoming
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Far from condemning the farm invasions, Mugabe has encouraged
them. He allocated $500,000 back in February to help fund the
veterans, urged his supporters to ignore two High Court orders to
halt the illegal invasions, and resisted pressure from Britain and
his neighboring counterparts to evict the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   As he dispatched three cabinet members to London for high-level
talks on land reform, due to start Thursday, Mugabe firmly
denounced Britain's attempt to link aid for land reform to a return
of law and order. His party also resisted internal pressure,
boycotting church-led peace talks Wednesday with the opposition in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mugabe has maintained power by simulating violence all the
time,'' said Washington Sansole, a former High Court judge. British
and regional leaders ``are asking him to give up the one thing
that's kept him in power. He can't let go.''
</P>
<P>
   The deteriorating political climate dealt another blow to
Zimbabwe's already beleaguered economy as all-important tobacco
sales opened slowly Wednesday. Economists said only about 30
percent of the country's normal annual yield of tobacco reached the
auction houses in time for the opening gavel.
</P>
<P>
   Large quantities of tobacco have been burned by angry mobs
invading the farms, and many farmers have been blocked entry to
their barns to grade their leaf. The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association
has urged farmers to delay delivery of their bales until next month
in the hope that the violence will ease. Zimbabwe's top foreign
exchange earner, tobacco accounts for about 25 percent of the
country's annual economic output.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports Wednesday about the situation on
the farms. The Commercial Farmers Union said the violence was
slowing somewhat, but individual farmers said as many as 12 new
farms have been seized since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the attacks is critical. Speaking ahead of the meeting in
London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Wednesday that
Britain would increase aid for land reform in Zimbabwe by $57
million over the next two years only if Mugabe called off the
invasions and organized the elections. ``The illegal occupations
must be stopped before any land reform starts,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has also demanded that a priority had to be placed on
resettling poor rural families and that farmers be compensated for
land they gave up. Earlier this month, Zimbabwe amended its
constitution to seize land without payment to the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, opposition leader Tsvangirai said two more men were
killed in Kariba, about 220 miles northwest of Harare, by
government supporters on Tuesday. One was dragged from his office
and beaten to death in the streets. Three men died on Monday _ one
from gunshot wounds and another from a blow to his head from an ax.
The third was beaten to death after Mugabe followers saw that he
was wearing an opposition T-shirt.

HELMS TO CLINTON: NO ARMS BILL `ON MY WATCH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An emboldened Senator Jesse Helms declared
Wednesday that President Clinton would not be able to pass any
arms-control measure in the last months of his term, saying, ``Not
on my watch, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   Arms control analysts said the North Carolina Republican's
outburst carries considerable weight because of the absence of
strong Clinton administration leadership on non-proliferation
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has created their own Jesse Helms
monster,'' said Seyom Brown, a visiting fellow at the Brookings
Institution in Washington and a professor of international
relations at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' statement on the Senate floor came at a time when the
United States is talking with Russia about renegotiating the
landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to allow for a US
national missile defense system. His remarks came just a day after
President Clinton met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov at
the White House to talk about the future of disarmament agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But Helms, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said if the administration tried to amend the ABM
treaty, he would not hold hearings or let the measure out of his
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be clear to avoid any misunderstanding down the line,''
he said. ``Any modified ABM treaty negotiated by this
administration will be DOA _ dead on arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   He further said, ``This administration's time for grand treaties
is clearly at an end. We will not consider any new, last-minute
arms control measures that this administration negotiates in its
final closing months in office.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin dismissed Helms'
remarks, saying it wouldn't stop the administration from
negotiating with Russia to amend the ABM treaty if the United
States goes ahead with the missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helms is not the entire Senate,'' Rubin said. ``Senator Helms
is an important senator (but) in the past, treaties have been
approved that he voted against and that he opposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said, however, that Helms' statements represented a
failure of the Clinton administration strategy of trying to bring
him over to their side.
</P>
<P>
   First, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright tried to
cultivate Helms, praising him in public, even visiting him in North
Carolina. Then, UN Ambassador Richard Holbrooke tried to curry
favor with Helms by bringing him before the UN Security Council in
the hopes that both sides could learn from the other and defuse the
issue of US arrears to the United Nations. That plan worked, in the
short term, with the passage of partial US payment.
</P>
<P>
   Later, again under Holbrooke's encouragement, the UN Security
Council traveled to Washington with Helms as their host, a move
that ``enhances the notion that Helms is somehow as important as
the president in setting a foreign policy agenda,'' Brandeis' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have Madeleine Albright and Richard Holbrooke genuflecting
in the direction of Helms for tactical political maneuvers. It
inflated the man's sense of his own power. What we have here is
Holbrookeian arrogance feeding Helmsian arrogance,'' said Brown,
who is working this year on a study of force and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Arms control, stalled in recent years after moving swiftly at
the end of the Cold War, looms as one of the top issues for this
year and coming years.
</P>
<P>
   It has become extraordinarily tumultuous in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Russia has taken the high moral ground in three major
steps favoring non-proliferation _ passing a nuclear test ban
treaty, ratifying the Start II nuclear arms reduction pact with the
United States and then proposing deep cuts in Start III talks _ the
US testing of a missile defense system has greatly angered other
world leaders. Those leaders fear that such a system would give the
United States a significant strategic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But there are major doubts about whether even a system that is
greatly scaled down from President Reagan's Star Wars dream could
ever work.
</P>
<P>
   In late June or early July, the Pentagon plans a third and final
test of a missile defense system before Clinton decides to either
back funding for the entire program or delay the decision for his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Steinbruner, professor of public policy at the
University of Maryland, said the administration has allowed its
non-proliferation policy to drift while waiting on a decision for
missile defense, estimated to cost $60 billion this week by the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   That report, authored by Geoffrey Forden, raises several
questions about the viability of the current schedule for the
program, suggesting that the 10-year timeframe may be too short and
some analysts believe it could benefit from more than 21 flight
tests _ each costing $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Steinbruner said, administration officials had
made only ``nominal efforts'' on behalf of the nuclear test ban
treaty, which was defeated earlier this year. And he criticized the
lack of administration push for the Start II pact, which means it
won't likely go through the Senate this year either _ whether Helms
spoke up or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton needs to marshal the majority view in this country
that supports the arms control treaties,'' Steinbruner said. ``But
the minority realizes there's basically no team on the field and
they can have a field day. Who do you blame? The crazies? Or the
the people who are supposed to defend good sense but aren't?''

 &HT;    Housing official hears Atlantans' tales of predatory lending
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two elderly African-American widows from Atlanta were
the star witnesses at a Wednesday forum on predatory lending
practices sponsored by two Clinton Cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Ewing, 70, received a foreclosure notice this week from
her latest mortgage lender. She explained that four different
high-cost lenders had flipped her debt, tacking assorted new fees
on each new transaction and driving her monthly mortgage payment
from $300 to $1,026.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to make monthly payments,'' Ewing told a panel
headed by Andrew Cuomo, U.S. secretary of housing and develompent.
``Because the mortgage is so high, I am having trouble paying my
utility bills and buying food.''
</P>
<P>
   Emma Lou Sanders, 74, owed only $1,700 on her mortgage when an
aggressive salesman convinced her to take a new mortgage to pay for
home improvements. Sanders is now saddled with more than $23,600 in
new mortgage debt, though the promised improvements were never
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel awful,'' said Sanders, who has trouble making her
payments from her monthly income of $650. ``Nobody wants to be in
this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said predatory mortgage lending has become ``a national
crisis ... with a troubling racial factor.''
</P>
<P>
   He and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers recently formed
a task force to study the problem. The group will hold forums in
four other cities before issuing a report to Congress in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real estate market is so hot, there is so much equity in
homes, we have created an opportunity for some to victimize those
within the market,'' Cuomo said. ``We want predatory lending
practices stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo praised ethical lending practices within the so-called
``subprime'' loan industry for making money available to millions
shut out of the regular credit market because of their blemished
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a national trend, subprime mortgage refinancings in
Atlanta have skyrocketed _ particularly in minority neighborhoods _
rising from 1,768 in 1994 to 11,408 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, complaints to the Atlanta Legal Aid Society
about subprime loans have shot up, too, as have foreclosure
notices.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Beasley, head of Georgia's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, said a
class-action suit in the early 1990s helped defeat one abusive
lender in Atlanta: a subsidiary of Fleet Financial Group. ``But
this is a tiger, a devious tiger,'' Beasley said. ``We thought we
ran off Fleet, but they've circled back on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulating the subprime market is a tricky political issue
because banks such as Citigroup, Bank of America and First Union
all own subprime lending affiliates. The banks maintain a powerful
political lobby, which Cuomo was careful not to offend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that prides itself in its integrity,''
Cuomo said. ``No good company would knowingly do business with any
of these bad actors.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bill Brennan of the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, a
national expert on predatory lending, said virtually all subprime
lenders routinely charge exorbitant interest rates and fees,
collect high pre-payment penalties and ``pack'' pre-paid credit
insurance into loans secured by the borrower's home. All those
practices are abusive and should be outlawed, Brennan and other
consumer advocates argue.
</P>
<P>
   The industry could live with rules that ban loan flipping, new
limits on credit insurance and clear disclosure on loan fees, said
Jeffrey Zeltzer, executive director of the National Home Equity
Mortgage Association. ``I am concerned about the reputational
damage'' caused by the recent focus on the industry, Zeltzer said.

`FLINTSTONES' PREQUEL FALLS SHORT OF ROCK-SOLID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as a preschooler, I never quite got into ``The
Flintstones.'' The idea of audience laughter accompanying a
cartoon, which couldn't possibly have been real, always bugged me
(my first critical decision!). Still, one tries to approach
boomer-friendly TV spinoffs such as ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock
Vegas'' with an open mind, and although the new movie isn't
completely, as the song says, a ``gay old time,'' it's better than
anyone had a right to expect.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that it's great, just that it's innocuous.
It's a surprisingly kid-friendly prequel to ``The Flintstones''
saga, showing how the modern Stone Age family got together. It
plays like an episode or two of the TV show, stretched out to fill
an hour and a half or so.
</P>
<P>
   Fred and Barney (Mark Addy and Stephen Baldwin) are young quarry
workers. Betty (Ally McBeal's Jane Krakowski) is a carhop at the
local bronto-burger stand. Wilma (''3rd Rock From the Sun's''
Kristen Johnston) is an unhappy heiress who sets the story into
motion when she runs away from her empty life and her materialistic
mother (Joan Collins). Betty mistakes Wilma for a, um, caveless
woman (hey, it's the movie's joke, OK?), takes her in as a roommate
and gets her a job at the burger stand. When Fred asks Betty for a
date, Barney begs to be set up and is paired with Wilma. After some
awkwardness, the couples discover where the true chemistry lies,
and head toward romantic bliss.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of movie left to go, however, and we're not even
in Rock Vegas yet. We get there when Wilma's jilted boyfriend, the
smug and snooty Chip Rockefeller (''Dharma &AMP; Greg's'' Thomas
Gibson, clearly enjoying hamming it up), invites the foursome to
his Vegas casino. It is, of course, part of a scheme to ruin the
couples' romantic dreams and steal Wilma back. Since we already
know how things will turn out, this isn't exactly suspenseful.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as a sort of Greek chorus is the Great Gazoo, a
supercilious little space alien who has been banished to Earth to
study mating rituals. Gazoo doesn't really have any business in the
movie except to give stage actor Alan Cumming a chance to hone his
shtick _ which he does much better in his other role, a send-up of
Mick Jagger. Fred kicks the Great Gazoo offscreen a lot; it's easy
to wish that the little twerp would just stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Watching familiar performers enact live-action cartoon
characters is sort of like walking into the biggest-budget
high-school play ever mounted. Perhaps that's why Addy, best-known
to American audiences as the most desperate of the dancers in ``The
Full Monty,'' comes off best; his round face gives Fred a
vulnerability that the blustery cartoon version seldom had. Baldwin
and Krakowski do a pretty good job of nailing their characters'
voices, and especially their goofy laughs. Johnston tries less hard
as Wilma, but at least she looks great in designer cavewear.
Collins' Liz Taylor-lite act and Harvey Korman's addle-brained
portrayal of Wilma's shell-shocked father are mildly amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Characterization and dialogue aren't a big deal here, but then
they weren't a big part of the TV series, either; the cartoon's
best bits were its imaginative use of prehistoric (and pre-human,
but never mind that) animals as household appliances and heavy
machinery. The movie re-creates this passably well, and earns some
points for sliding in some double-entendres that will amuse adults
without stinging young ears. These days, a kid movie that includes
only one gas-passing joke is practically a model of restraint, and
``Viva Rock Vegas'' has a clever moment every 10 minutes or so to
carry it along. The best thing about it, however, is that there's
no laugh track. Bet the producers were tempted to add one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' is rated PG for a couple
of mild swear words, some innuendo, many merchandising
possibilities and way too many rock puns. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Consumers may have often suspected computer companies
of trying to pick their pockets. Now the companies are trying to
fill them.
</P>
<P>
   Small enough to slip into a shirt pocket or purse, handheld
computers are appearing with capabilities that go far beyond their
original task of organizing personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Once viewed as Silicon Valley fashion accessories, geek toys and
portable sidekicks for desktop computers, these miniature computers
are reaching for a broader consumer audience as they add power and
an expanded repertory of tricks.
</P>
<P>
   They still have the basic features like a calendar and an
address book, an expense report, a calculator, a memo pad and a
to-do list _ features that have endeared the Palm Pilot and its
successors to several million users. But by adding software or
hardware attachments, the newer handheld computers can be
transformed into digital cameras, voice recorders, electronic
books, global positioning systems, digital music players, pagers,
bar code readers, electronic maps, language translators and game
machines.
</P>
<P>
   When outfitted with clever peripherals like folding, full-size
keyboards and snap-on modems, these pocket rockets can even do
limited duty as lightweight substitutes for laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Linked to a wireless communications network, the new handhelds
can send and receive e-mail messages, browse the Web and tap into
services being developed for mobile shopping and investing.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, the pocket computer category has become one of
the hottest areas in the technology industry. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Palm Computing said this week that its new models would all be
able to connect to the Internet without wires by the end of the
year. It also said that at least one model would be controlled by
voice commands. Like other handheld computers, Palm's current
models rely on handwriting recognition or taps on a tiny,
screen-based keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft, which has been trying with limited success to break
Palm's tight grip on the handheld market, unveiled a much improved
operating system for pocket computers last week. Hewlett-Packard
uses Microsoft's new Pocket PC software in its impressive new
Jornada 545.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Handspring Visor, created by the people who developed the
Palm Pilot, became available in retail stores this month. Before
that, it was offered only online.
</P>
<P>
   _ Research in Motion, maker of a popular wireless paging and
e-mail device called the RIM Blackberry, said this month that it
planned to add organizer functions to its products, thereby going
mano a mano with both Palm and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In short, lots of good things are coming in these small
packages. But as the field grows, the choices are getting more
complicated, and the fancier the application, the fancier the
price. Meanwhile, pocket computers are facing increasing
competition from smart, Internet-enabled cell phones and pagers
that include many of their basic features.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a survey of some of the more intriguing new
handheld computers, peripherals and applications. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Palm Inc. sold more than 2 million Palm III, Palm V and Palm VII
handheld computers last year, making it by far the most successful
company in the category. Palm attributes its success to a ``less is
more'' philosophy, focusing on simplicity and ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is taking the ``more is more'' approach. It envisions
a series of handheld computers that can do almost anything that a
Windows-based desktop computer can do.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds great in theory, but the strategy has not worked.
Adding bells and whistles like color screens and multimedia
features increased complexity, weight and cost, and reduced battery
life. Consumers also balked at the clumsy Windows CE operating
system. Things got so bad last year that Microsoft was abandoned by
several manufacturers, including Philips, IBM, Uniden and Everex.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft recently released the Pocket PC operating system,
which is a significant improvement over Windows CE, although many
similarities remain.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket PC is unlikely to be the Palm killer that some analysts
have envisioned, in part because thousands of software applications
are already available for the Palm OS but only a relative handful
for Pocket PC.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Microsoft deserves a hand for what it has accomplished.
Pocket PC comes with pocket-size versions of Microsoft mainstays
like Outlook, Internet Explorer, Money, Word and Excel, which makes
it a compelling choice for people who have standardized using those
desktop applications.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not all work and no play. Pocket PC also includes
Windows Media Player for playing color videos and stereo music
files, including MP3 files. And it includes Microsoft Reader with
Clear Type, a delightful program that enables a Pocket PC device to
display text more legibly on a handheld screen. Clear Type makes it
practical to download books from the Internet and read them easily,
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Given its current travails, it is interesting that Microsoft
includes Machiavelli's ``Prince'' among the small library of
e-books that it distributes with its Reader software.
</P>
<P>
   The new operating system has expanded support for all sorts of
plug-in and peripheral devices, making Pocket PC-based devices the
most versatile on the market.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first devices to showcase the new Pocket PC software
is Hewlett-Packard's new Jornada 545, a sleek and powerful
challenger to Palm's best-selling Palm V. Do not confuse this model
with the previous generations of Jornadas, which had the styling
and appeal of a brick.
</P>
<P>
   The Jornada feels more solid and rugged than most handheld
devices. But at 9 ounces, it has twice the heft of the Palm V. You
will be fully aware that it is in your pocket. The weight includes
rechargeable lithium ion batteries that last about eight hours
between charges.
</P>
<P>
   The passive color display screen is not the best in the
category, but it is better than most, including Palm's only
color-screen model, the Palm IIIc.
</P>
<P>
   The five-button layout on the Jornada's face is surprisingly
elegant considering the device's many features. Two more buttons on
the left edge are notable. One controls a voice recorder (the
microphone and speakers are built in), and the other is a scrolling
wheel for leafing through the virtual pages of an electronic book.
There is also an infrared port for beaming information, a la Palm,
and a headphone jack.
</P>
<P>
   I had a few other gripes with the Jornada 545. For some reason,
probably to reduce bulk, H-P gave the Jornada a Type 1 (Compact
Flash) expansion slot instead of the slightly larger but more
versatile Type II slot. The main drawback is for people who want to
put a few hundred megabytes of MP3 music files on a tiny IBM Type
II MicroDrive.
</P>
<P>
   The other quibble is with the stylus, a wimpy, insubstantial,
flattened pointer that nests awkwardly inside the flip-up cover of
the Jornada. The lid is removable, and when the Jornada goes
topless there is no convenient place to stash the stylus.
</P>
<P>
   Like other handheld computers that use a Windows operating
system, the Jornada 545 is expensive _ about $499. But if you
consider that it combines the capabilities of a handheld PC, a
Rio-type MP3 player and an electronic book, and that the much less
capable Palm IIIc costs $449, the Jornada's price does not sting as
much.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   People who have never used a digital camera might not understand
why the Design by IDEO eyemodule for the Handspring Visor is such a
good idea. But once you get used to the idea of taking pictures
without having to mess with film development, somehow nearly
everything you see demands to be preserved in pixels.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny, $149 eyemodule camera snaps into the Springboard
expansion slot of the Visor and adds hardly any weight or bulk.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means a replacement for a good digital camera.
Instead, it is intended for taking small but decent color or
black-and-white snapshots that can be viewed promptly on the
handheld's screen. Exposure and focus are automatic, and each shot
is labeled with the time and date. Depending on how much memory the
Visor has, the eyemodule can store up to 25 color pictures or 125
black-and-white shots.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the Visor, the pictures can be organized, annotated,
transferred over a cable to a PC for printing or e-mailing as JPEG
files, or beamed wirelessly to another nearby Visor or Palm device
(both of which use the Palm operating system). Real estate agents
and insurance adjusters might find such cameras useful, and it is
just a matter of time, I'm sure, before Visor-toting grandmothers
beam pictures of the grandkids to one another at their weekly poker
games.
</P>
<P>
   You would not want this camera if you are serious about
photography, but it is fine for casual, low-resolution snapshots of
the kind used on Web pages or sent by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   When the Visor was introduced last year, Handspring promised
that there would soon be a variety of plug-in modules for the
Visor's clever expansion slot. But the offerings have been sparse,
and the eyemodule is one of the first such modules to appear. A
list of available modules and accessories is available at
www.handspring.com.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak will soon offer a much better digital camera attachment
for the Palm family. Called the PalmPix, it takes VGA-quality (640
by 480 pixels) photos and includes a 2X zoom lens. Photos can be
saved in either JPEG or BMP file formats.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPix costs $179 and is expected to be in stores within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Entering information into a handheld device is often a
challenge, requiring the user either to learn a new written
alphabet for the computer's handwriting-recognition software
(called Graffiti on Palm systems and Transcriber on Pocket PCs) or
to have the patience to tap out messages using a tiny, virtual
keyboard on the display screen. Some people master those skills
quickly, but others find the process odious, especially for taking
notes or composing e-mail messages longer than a few sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Even rapid tap-typists will appreciate the cleverness of Think
Outside's Stowaway Portable Keyboard ($99) for Palm and Handspring
Visor computers. A version that works with Microsoft's Pocket PC is
promised for summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Stowaway _ in such demand that many stores have it on back
order _ is a full-size keyboard that unfolds accordion-style from a
package not much larger than the handheld PC itself. There is a
built-in docking station for the computer. The keyboard weighs less
than a half pound and draws all the power it needs from the little
computer. Best of all, it has the same size and feel of my favorite
laptop keyboard. When you are done typing, the keyboard folds up
easily and tucks back into a pocket.
</P>
<P>
   I tested a version with the Handspring Visor and resolved never
again to travel without a Stowaway.  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The main attraction of these pocket computers is their ability
to travel with you, but for many of us the main drawback to
traveling is that we get lost at some point. (And those of us with
Y chromosomes are known to be genetically disadvantaged in asking
for directions.) Rand McNally, known for its maps, comes to the
rescue with a global positioning system, or G.P.S., attachment and
maps for several models of Palm computers.
</P>
<P>
   A G.P.S. receiver communicates with a network of 24 satellites
that continuously broadcast precise time and location data toward
earth. The G.P.S. device for the Palm, which is about the size of a
flattened beer can, tracks these broadcasts and uses them to
calculate its own longitude, latitude and altitude with an accuracy
of 100 yards or less.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the raw coordinates is not much help, so the real power
of the Rand McNally system is in plotting the information on
customized Streetfinder street maps that can be downloaded from a
PC and displayed on the Palm's screen. Then, if the device has a
clear view of the sky, it plots the user's approximate position on
the map. You may still be lost, but you will be lost more
accurately than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Normal people may find that simply downloading the maps to the
Palm is sufficient. But for those who have special needs, like
hiking in a remote area, driving in unfamiliar rural areas, or
simply having the latest and greatest gadget to show off to
friends, the Rand McNally GPS system for Palm III computers is
quite handy. It is available for $179 from the Rand McNally online
store at www.randmcnally.com. A version for the Palm V costs $199.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the Streetfinder GPS does not work with the Palm IIIc,
which is the only Palm that can show maps in color, or the Palm
VII, which is the only Palm that can wirelessly send e-mail
messages explaining that you are lost and will be late.

   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ The state and federal
governments that are partners in the antitrust suit against
Microsoft have agreed to file a joint proposal on remedies in the
case, an agreement that was in doubt as early as Wednesday morning,
officials said. The joint proposal would keep the Justice
Department's plan to break up Microsoft into two companies intact,
but state officials say they have worked to strengthen some of the
interim remedies that would modify Microsoft's conduct. By Joel

ONE GIANT LEAP FOR TECHNOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
  (One small leap for film) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Timecode is the little bit of technology appended to
good-quality video or film that allows an editor to synchronize
sound and picture, so that a mouth moves when a voice speaks,
hooves hit the ground when their clip-clop is heard, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Timecode also makes possible the movie of the same name,
directed and based on a story more composed and conducted than
written and directed by Mike Figgis, perhaps best known for
``Leaving Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   More than most of Figgis' sometimes difficult work though, this
one should intrigue if not always delight viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It is billed as a film that shatters the linear narrative form
used in cinema for the past century, largely by taking advantage of
the possibilities of digital video cameras that could be used for
extremely lengthy taping and quite intimate shots. Thankfully,
though the technology makes for a remarkably different looking
film, there is a story, a pretty solid one, underpinning the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned, though, that the technical tricks may cause some
viewers to reach for the aspirin in trying to make sense of what's
happening on screen.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the viewer doesn't see one full-screen, linear
view of the film's events. Rather, we see four views, all playing
simultaneously in split-screen mode.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of minutes, the viewer figures out that this is
the way things will be for the next hour and a half. Soon after
that, the viewer figures out that the events on the four screens
are related.
</P>
<P>
   The film is basically set in and around an office building on
West Hollywood's Sunset Strip, as the four cameras follow the
intertwining stories of two couples, one played by Saffron Burrows
and Stellan Skarsgard, the other by Salma Hayek and Jeanne
Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   Skarsgard plays a dissipated though talented movie producer
having an affair with Hayek's gold-digging bisexual
actress-wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   Tripplehorn's character suspects as much and bugs Hayek's purse
to listen as Hayek meets Skarsgard at his work. Burrows' character
is deeply unsatisfied with her marriage and comes to visit
Skarsgard at his work as well, to tell him she is leaving him.
</P>
<P>
   The fine cast _ which includes Holly Hunter, Julian Sands and
Kyle MacLachlan, among others _ all improvised their lines,
sometimes quite funnily, following a story structure created by
Figgis.
</P>
<P>
   Their performances are all the more remarkable because they were
shot without breaks or second takes, in fifteen 93-minute,
four-camera shoots done over a nine-day period. When the shooting
was done, Figgis settled on one four-camera shoot, the fifteenth,
as the one to be used for the film.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis didn't edit the video at all, merely putting the four
cameras' results (he was one of four videographers) on screen
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   To draw the viewer's eye from one screen to another, and thus
tell the story, Figgis relied on sound, raising the audio level
from one screen, or two, or all four, or none.
</P>
<P>
   The sound mix thus defines the film. A different mix would have
created a different film, much as an underground club DJ can
radically reshape a familiar song by the way he mixes in samples,
drum beats and found sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures still have weight, of course, because this is film.
Indeed, part of ``Timecode's'' strength is the way you can watch an
actor's reactions on one screen to events unfolding on another.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis has constructed a darned clever technology gimmick.
What's remarkable is that despite the gimmick, the film works
pretty well as entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   It's not perfect. A series of fake quakes, for instance, detract
from the story (though they show off how well synchronized the
shooting was). And the confrontation between Tripplehorn's jealous
character and Skarsgard's philandering one and its immediate
aftermath doesn't feel as organic and real as much of the rest of
the film.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Timecode'' is a fascinating step forward in the
filmmaking process, and one we can only hope will stimulate the
imagination of other creative people, and the audiences who enjoy
their work. But just in case, bring that bottle of aspirin.

TV INVENTS WHAT JAPAN LACKS: IMPOLITENESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The show began with a clamor befitting a three-ring
circus as the host, one of Japan's most famous comedians, entered
the set shrouded in smoke and dressed as a stick of dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after he announced the day's theme _ the nuisance
caused by Japan's motorcycle gangs _ a brief fistfight broke out
between the television show's panel of 100 foreigners and the dozen
or so bike-riding teen-age rebels, pale shadows of Brando's ``wild
one,'' but volatile nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   When order was finally restored, an Iranian panelist bluntly
challenged the Japanese toughs. ``You think you are so strong and
manly because you live in a weak society,'' he said. ``If you are
so brave, you should come to my country and try your tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   With its numbing mixture of idiocy and bully-boy cruelty served
up in a high-pitched din, this show, which was first broadcast in
1998, has become one of the country's most popular by opening a
window on a parallel universe scarcely imagined by most viewers, a
world peopled with foreigners who speak fluent Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The format for the show, ``Strange Things About the Japanese,''
might best be described as the United Nations meets Jerry Springer.
And on Wednesdays, when the Tokyo Broadcasting System brings a
boisterous mass of 100 opinionated foreigners _ more than most
Japanese will ever meet _ into the nation's living rooms, what
ensues is a vigorous raking over the coals of this deeply insular
society and its sometimes peculiar ways.
</P>
<P>
   The themes have included topics like delinquency and promiscuity
among the young, racism and the long-troubled relations with Korea.
Indeed, Japan is often presented in an unflattering light, as the
show slyly uses foreigners to criticize aspects of society that
much of the news media treats with kid gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But for Japanese viewers, the biggest vicarious thrill may
simply be confrontational debate. In a protocol-constricted
society, where venturing one's opinion too forcefully or even out
of turn is frowned on, the show's arguments, in which foreigners
regularly take on the most enervating features of life here, is
like a bracing breath of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, there haven't been any hard-core debate shows
on TV,'' said Justin Patterson, 25, an American who is a regular
panelist. ``You have plenty of silly shows with people goofing off.
But Japanese have never had shows with people going at it over
ideas or serious issues. I don't mean this to sound bad, but
Japanese often don't have the guts to just tell it like it is, with
a bang.''
</P>
<P>
   The program eagerly shatters other cultural molds, as well.
Rather than ending in the consensus that this society prizes so
highly, ``Strange Things'' ends each week with no particular
conclusion. And although Beat Takeshi, one of Japan's best-known
humorists and filmmakers, is the host, the moderator's role is
almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   For many participants, foreigners from every continent, one of
the most important features is the free-flow cosmopolitanism. Not
only does the program serve as a kind of a televised National
Geographic, introducing the residents of one of the most ethnically
homogeneous countries to people from every horizon, but it also
demonstrates to the chagrin of xenophobic rightists that people of
different cultures can successfully cooperate and mix.
</P>
<P>
   The loquacious panelists shatter another cherished myth along
the way _ that only Japanese people can master this country's
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this show, for most Japanese, foreigner simply meant
American,'' said Eli Bergmann, 23, a French panelist whose mother
is Japanese. ``Now, they are gradually coming to understand that
there are other countries out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Another participant, Moogwi Kim, 22, a Korean university
student, also emphasized the program's role in helping ease a
closed-off Japan into the globalized world.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more foreign people are coming to Japan, and for the
first time in their lives, Japanese people are realizing the
importance of dealing with them,'' he said. ``Both sides have
lacked a means to communicate with each other until now. The show
has become a sort of bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the earnest talk of multiculturalism and painless
geography lessons, though, inevitably the show favors entertainment
over erudition. For one thing, the producers sometimes find it
simpler to divide up the participants by race or color, lumping
Australians and Israelis with Europeans, and Bangladeshis with
Africans.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the emphasis in many debates seems to be on working
the foreigners into a hot lather and cutting back and forth between
commentators so quickly that there is little opportunity for
follow-up, or indeed serious thought. ``It can fairly resemble a
zoo,'' Bergmann conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may open windows on other worlds for its viewers,
for some the zoolike aspect of the program, with its raucous,
inconclusive debates, might almost seem to advertise Japan's
conservative values. For all the giddy freedom of foreigners, the
disorder subtly recommends the tranquillity of a uniform society
governed firmly by rules understood by all.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, the show works as Japanese entertainment,
because it unthreateningly highlights this country's unusual
situation as an island of high prosperity inhabited by a
provincial, nearly homogenous and inwardly turned people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is the only country in the world to have such a
program,'' said Rufin Zomahoun, 35, a graduate student from Benin
who is the biggest star of the show. ``As a closed society, this
country is a special case. They know that foreigners find them
strange, and they itch to hear what we think.''

 &HT;    Braxton returns with confidence and style
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Heat'' Toni Braxton is generating on her third album isn't
really because of the barely-there outfit she wears on the cover _
or the summery title track.
</P>
<P>
   It comes from the confidence that resonates throughout this
return.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly enjoying the luxury of being an artist who is
appreciated whether barefoot and blue-jeaned (her 1992 single ``How
Many Ways'') or all-gowned-up with an orchestra (the 1996 ballad
``Un-Break My Heart''), the throaty singer revels in her range of
musical styles here.
</P>
<P>
   Which shifts the focus to perhaps the only problem with the
album: lyrically, much of this is forgettable mood-setting, rather
than her usual, well-done storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Braxton teams up with big ballad provider Diane Warren
(``Un-Break'') on ``Spanish Guitar'' and explodes on an almost
over-orchestrated ``Killing Me Softly'' for a now-Latino-savvy
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Breathless come-on ``Maybe,'' ``Speaking In Tongues'' and sweaty
instrumental ``The Art of Love'' erase any memory that she was a
shy preacher's girl.
</P>
<P>
   But the certain hit single is the slow, slinky offering ``Just
Be A Man About It.'' Created by Atlanta talents John'ta Austin,
Teddy Bishop and Bryan Michael-Cox, the plainspoken and
well-written ballad is as sassy as her first solo hit, 1992's
``Love Shoulda Brought You Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Hear it and you can almost see Oprah and her audience waving one
hand in affirmation and exchanging ``Mmm-hmm girls! Tell 'em!''

   ``Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live''
</P>
<P>
   Pink Floyd. Columbia. 30 tracks
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Pink Floyd's colossus ``The Wall'' set the standard for '70s
progressive rock concept albums. Which is to say parts of it were a
crashing bore. Now, 20 years after redefining art-rock pretense,
Floyd has issued a live two-disc set culled from several 1980-81
``Wall'' shows. And this time, Roger Waters and Co. get it right.
``The Wall Live'' is wonderfully free of the art-school touches
that cluttered the original. Gone are the melodramatic segues and
crazed teachers shouting over David Gilmour's shimmering guitar
licks, which are looser and more engaging live. All that's left is
the menacing, raucous rock show singer-composer Roger Waters
intended _ as much a play on Floyd's love-hate relationship with
fans as a commentary on the angst of modern life. In places, ``The
Wall'' still goes over the top _ exhibit A: the campy ``Vera'' and
``Bring the Boys Back Home'' shtick. But for the most part, this
set captures Floyd stripped bare, showcasing the nexus of Gilmour's
clean, soulful breaks, Waters' madhouse-howl vocals and Richard
Wright's trippy keyboard washes.

   The first album of newly released Neil Young tunes since
``Broken Arrow'' in '96, ``S&AMP;G'' is alternately pretty and dark,
melodic and random-sounding, obvious and inscrutably personal. Of
Young's dozens of records, ``S&AMP;G'' sounds most like '78's ``Comes a
Time.'' The title track, a short, bright tune about the uselessness
of material possessions (``I used to have a treasure chest/Got so
heavy that I had to rest'') even dates to the same era, only now
being released. Among the more lyrically idiosyncratic tracks,
``Red Sun'' merges familiar Youngian Western-rustic imagery (``When
the red sun sets/on the railroad town/And the bars begin to
laugh/with a happy sound'') with what seems to be a suggestion of
Jesus' return (``The well will be flowin'/and the words will come
fast/When the one who is comin'/Arrives here at last''). As a rule,
Young's best stuff is electric, and this mostly unplugged set isn't
an exception. His best recent song, the moving ``Slowpoke,'' was
transferred from ``S&AMP;G'' to last year's CSN&AMP;Y album. Yet new Neil
is always worth a listen, and there's enough going on that this
promises to grow on you with each hearing.

   There's nothing like a serial killer to bring a father and son
together, particularly if there's an expansive generation gap
between the two. And in the aggressively stupid ``Frequency,''
we're not talking about any ordinary generation gap. Here, the
father and son are separated by the grave. But thanks to the aurora
borealis and a trusty ham radio, the two men find they can relive
the past, change the future, track down a murderer and still have
time to argue about the batting order of the '69 Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Director Gregory Hoblit (``Primal Fear,'' ``Fallen'') and
first-time screenwriter Toby Emmerich have taken a genre that's
been done to death in movies and ``The Twilight Zone'' and mixed in
both grisly gore and sappy sentimentality to create an
undisciplined clunker of a movie. ``Frequency'' wants to make you
cry and jump out of your seat and the same time. But the film's
rapidly shifting plot and tone only underscores the shaky and silly
nature of its premise. It simply doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Caviezel plays John Sullivan, a hangdog New York cop who
lost his firefighter father, Frank (Dennis Quaid), in a warehouse
blaze 30 years ago. One night, during an electrical storm, John
discovers that he can communicate with his father. Frank is still
living in 1969, anxiously awaiting the first game of the '69 World
Series featuring his amazin' Mets and blissfully unaware that he's
soon going to perish in that warehouse fire.
</P>
<P>
   John, of course, knows his old man is going to die, and once he
has convinced his father that it's really him (some World Series
info from the future helps), he can steer him clear of danger. But
that opens up another can (make that a case) of worms. If Frank
lives, others will die, including, most improbably, those whom
Frank loves. But John, with the future on his side, might be able
to prevent that, provided that ham radio stays in good working
order.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those willing to suspend disbelief, ``Frequency'' is a
trying stretch of one's patience as well as a remarkably reckless
exercise in filmmaking. The movie's reality shifts are somewhat
interesting at first, but become increasingly illogical, often
ignoring earlier plot points. Any element that doesn't fit into the
movie's dubious world is immediately discarded. That's apparently
how John can be presented as a drunk in one scene and a dutiful son
in the next.
</P>
<P>
   Hoblit tries to keep the film moving so fast that audiences
won't notice the gaping holes in the story, but to no avail. The
movie also makes a shameless foray into ``Field of Dreams''
territory with its baseball references and ghost-dad storyline.
There's a kernel of a good movie here about the love between a
father and son. Leave it to Hollywood to include the Son of Sam in
the family reunion. &QL; 
_____ &QL;

 &HT;    How to saute and make a pan sauce
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Simple techniques in words and pictures and words
</P>
<P>
   The whole world of food has opened up to us in the past few
years. Now, if only we had the time to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have access to so many ingredients, but we have a lot less
time to cook,'' said Pam Anderson, author of ``How to Cook Without
a Book'' (Broadway Books, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was in Atlanta this month to teach a class and preach
the gospel about the importance of mastering a few basic cooking
techniques in order to enjoy home-cooked meals on weeknights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cherry-picked the simple techniques that will work on
weeknights, when people most need help,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   We've cherry-picked even further to give you a feel for her book
and her message. Below, we focus on searing, sauteing and pan
sauces. We also offer Anderson's answer for how to quickly prepare
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Her book is a primer on simple techniques, with easy recipes
that can be memorized, along with rhymes to help you learn the
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal companion to Anderson's book is James Peterson's ``The
Essentials of Cooking'' (Artisan, $40). Peterson said he made the
book, with hundreds of color photos demonstrating techniques, for
``the MTV generation'' that works better with visuals. It's a
handsome book worthy of space on most kitchen shelves as a
reference. Below, you'll see his photos for sauteing pork chops to
go along with Anderson's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Good Gadgets
</P>
<P>
   Some kitchen gadgets and tools are useless; others are real
timesavers. During a class at Cook's Warehouse this month, Pam
Anderson revealed three she wouldn't live without.
</P>
<P>
   The salad spinner _ great not only for spinning the salad
greens, but she also uses it to drain the water from shredded
potatoes before making potato cakes. It works wonders. Anderson got
nearly a half gallon of water out of two spins on the potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Egg slicer _ Anderson keeps boiled eggs in her refrigerator at
all times. She plops one or two in the egg slicer and tosses with
salad greens for an instant, substantial salad.
</P>
<P>
   Tongs _ the cheaper the better, Anderson said. She uses them to
turn meat, lift lids, toss salads.
</P>
<P>
   Searing
</P>
<P>
   ``The only trick to searing is a pan that's good and hot,
</P>
<P>
   The only other thing you need is a fan that vents a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How to Cook Without a Book''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choose the right size skillet, making sure the pieces of meat
will have neither too much nor too little space between them. Make
sure the skillet is heavy-bottomed. Cast iron works well unless
you're making a wine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Set the skillet over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes while
preparing dinner and seasoning the meat or fish. Drizzle both sides
of each piece of meat or fish with oil. Season both sides with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Crank up the heat under the dry pan and turn on the exhaust
fan 3 or 4 minutes before searing. Cook the pieces of meat or fish
over high heat until an even, rich brown crust forms, 2 to 4
minutes, depending on type and thickness of the cut. Turn and cook
until the remaining side develops a crust, 2 to 4 minutes longer.
Set a timer so you don't lose track.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  This method works best for steaks, burgers, pork tenderloin,
fish steaks (tuna, swordfish, halibut, sea bass, salmon) and
scallops. Seared meats pair well with pan sauces (see recipes, next
page). Anderson also suggests flavored butters and relishes.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Seared Scallops
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 5 minutes Cooking time: 4
minutes
</P>
<P>
   One or two of these make a lovely first course, especially when
served with Orange Pan Sauce With Pernod (see recipe, next page).
Anderson suggests buying only untreated or dry scallops. By law,
treated scallops should be labeled ``water added scallop product.''
Such treated scallops don't sear well.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds dry (see explanation above) sea scallops
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Lemon wedges or a pan sauce
</P>
<P>
   Set a heavy-bottomed 12-inch skillet over low heat for 5 to 10
minutes while preparing the meal and seasoning the scallops. (To
speed up the heating process, the skillet can be set over medium
heat for 3 to 4 minutes.) About 3 to 4 minutes before searing the
scallops, turn on the exhaust fan and increase the heat to high.
</P>
<P>
   To season the scallops, set them on a plate and drizzle with
oil; turn to coat. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. A
minute or so after the residual oils in the skillet send up wisps
of smoke, put the scallops in the pan. Cook over high heat until
they develop a thick, rich brown crust, about 2 minutes. Turn them
and continue to cook over high heat until the other sides develop a
thick, rich brown crust, about 2 minutes longer. Remove from the
pan and let stand a couple of minutes. Serve with lemon wedges or
make a pan sauce.

   Medallions
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 5 minutes Cooking time: 7-8
minutes
</P>
<P>
   Roasting whole tenderloins has always been the standby; but
cutting the tenderloins into medallions is a much quicker way to
prepare this tender meat. And it's quite tasty, too, especially
paired with the black pepper molasses pan sauce (see recipe, next
page).
</P>
<P>
   2 pork tenderloins (about 1 1/2 pounds total), patted dry and
cut crosswise into 1 1/2-inch medallions, each pressed with
fingertips to 3/4- to 1-inch thickness
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pan sauce
</P>
<P>
   Set a heavy-bottomed 12-inch skillet over low heat for 5 to 10
minutes. About 3 to 4 minutes before searing the medallions, turn
the exhaust fan on and increase heat to high. Set medallions on a
plate, drizzle with oil and turn to coat. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   A minute or so after the residual oils in the skillet send up
wisps of smoke, put medallions in the pan. Cook over high heat
until the meat develops a thick, rich brown crust, 3 1/2 to 4
minutes. Turn the medallions and continue to cook over high heat
until the remaining sides develop a thick, rich brown crust, 3-3
1/2 minutes longer. Check that it's cooked through (make a small
cut). Remove to a plate. Serve with pan sauce.

</P>
<P>
   ``How to Cook Without a Book''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choose the right size skillet so that the pieces of meat have
neither too much nor too little space between them. Before
preparing the meat, set the skillet over medium-low heat,
immediately adding a mix of oil and butter, so that they heat up
with the skillet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While the skillet is heating, prepare the meat, sprinkling
both sides of each piece with salt and pepper, then dredging each
side in flour. A couple of minutes before sauteing, increase the
heat to medium-high. When the oil is hot but not smoking and the
flecks of milk solids in the butter turn golden brown and smell
nutty, add the meat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cook the meat, turning only once, until golden brown on each
side. Make a pan sauce or serve with an uncooked sauce or relish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  This method works well with chicken and turkey cutlets,
boneless pork chops, fish fillets (flounder, catfish, snapper,
tilapia, grouper and other thin, white-fleshed fish) and duck
breasts.

<P>
   There probably isn't a greater standby in most households than
boneless, skinless chicken breasts. This method is quick, and when
the chicken is served with pan sauces, an everyday meal becomes
something special.
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon oil
</P>
<P>
   4 boneless chicken breast halves, trimmed of fat and pounded
with the dull side of a chef's knife until texture and width are
more or less even
</P>
<P>
   Salt and ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup all-purpose flour, measured into a pie plate or other
shallow pan
</P>
<P>
   Lemon wedges, or a pan sauce or uncooked relish
</P>
<P>
   Heat butter and oil in an 11- to 12-inch skillet over low heat.
While the pan is heating, sprinkle chicken breasts on both sides
with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of minutes before sauteing, increase the heat to
medium-high. When the butter stops foaming and starts to smell
nutty, arrange the chicken breasts, skinned side up, in the
skillet. Cook, turning only once, until chicken breasts are rich
golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove chicken from
skillet. Serve immediately with lemon wedges, an uncooked relish or
a pan sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Pork chop variation: Substitute 4 thick-cut boneless pork chops
for the chicken breasts and follow the above directions. Serve with
an uncooked relish or pan sauce.

</P>
<P>
   This is a master recipe that will offer a quick side dish. It's
ideal for asparagus, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots,
parsnips, cauliflower, celery, fennel, green beans and winter
squash. You'll need to snap, chop and peel the veggies accordingly,
thus the flexible prep time. And cooking times will also vary, but
the goal is to get vegetables to the ``just tender'' point.
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fat (extra-virgin olive oil, vegetable oil, butter
or bacon fat)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 pound prepared vegetable
</P>
<P>
   Optional aromatics:
</P>
<P>
   ( 1/2 small onion, sliced thin; or 2 medium garlic cloves,
minced; dried/fresh herbs; ground black pepper)
</P>
<P>
   Bring the water, fat, salt and vegetable, along with optional
aromatics, to a boil in a Dutch oven or large, deep skillet. Cover
and steam over medium-high heat until the vegetable is brightly
colored and just tender, 5 to 10 minutes, depending on vegetable
size.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the lid and continue to cook until the liquid evaporates,
1 to 2 minutes longer, adding more fresh herbs or other flavorings
as desired. Saute to intensify flavors, 1 to 2 minutes longer.
Adjust seasonings, including pepper to taste, and serve.

 &HT;    When time is a factor, remembering the basics of sauteing,
searing and deglazing will help you get it on the table
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 6:30 and the workday was a bear. Relaxing would be nice,
but stomachs can be heard growling all through the house. The rest
of the family is looking at the cook with urgent ``What's for
dinner'' expressions.
</P>
<P>
   This is no time to go digging for a recipe and rounding up a
dozen ingredients. The family needs dinner in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's time to rely on a few basic cooking techniques _
like sauteing, searing and deglazing to make a pan sauce. In a
half-hour, all will be eating well.
</P>
<P>
   ``After work, I'm tired, and sometimes a recipe is a stumbling
block. If you have to engage with a recipe, read it through, find
all the ingredients, you're likely to say `forget it' and order
out,'' said Pam Anderson, author of ``How to Cook Without a Book''
(Broadway Books, $25).
</P>
<P>
   If Anderson stumbles over recipes, then it's not hard to see how
the average home cook would. Anderson is the former executive
editor of Cook's Illustrated magazine, which specializes in testing
numerous recipes to find the perfect one for a dish. Her last
cookbook, in fact, was called ``The Perfect Recipe: Getting it
Right Every Time'' (Houghton Mifflin, $27).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd spend my days testing recipes and analyzing them, then at
5 o'clock I would go home and open the refrigerator and I didn't
know what to do,'' Anderson confesses. ``I felt like a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Anderson learned, was returning to basics and
focusing on the how-to more than the what. By mastering a few
simple techniques and rules and keeping the pantry stocked, dinner
can be on the table in a half-hour almost any night.
</P>
<P>
   James Peterson, author of ``The Essentials of Cooking''
(Artisan, $40) also urges cooks to focus on techniques rather than
exact recipes. His new book has thousands of step-by-step color
photos demonstrating the most basic techniques such as slicing a
carrot to trussing a chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we learn backwards,'' said Peterson, an
award-winning cookbook author. ``I was cooking I don't know how
long before I learned how to peel a turnip.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's book doesn't have photos, but it does offer short,
master recipes along with a few rhymes that can be memorized to
help home cooks learn to work without the safety net of recipes.
</P>
<P>
   She's also streamlined certain techniques to adapt them to
modern, time-crunched lifestyles. For pan sauces, she's cut the
amount of liquid and therefore the cooking time it takes to reduce
to a sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perfect way is fine for entertaining,'' said Anderson.
``But I've learned we need the `get it on the table' style of
cooking, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in one pan, a cook can first steam-saute some veggies; then
saute some chicken breasts or boneless pork chops or sear a steak
or scallops; and then from the pan juices create a quick, tasty
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you can concentrate on what's really important _ sitting
down with the people you love,'' said Anderson, ``and rediscovering
the magic you can have at the dinner table.''
</P>
<P>
   SAUTEING
</P>
<P>
   ``Heat butter and oil, swirling them around. Add meat, seasoned
and coated, and cook until beautifully browned.''
</P>
<P>
   SEARING
</P>
<P>
   ``The only trick to searing is a pan that's good and hot. The
only other thing you need is a fan that vents a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A PREPARED PANTRY
</P>
<P>
   If a cook keeps the pantry stocked with these few essential
items, dinner is always a quick half-hour away:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A dozen eggs
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Boneless chicken breasts
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pasta
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Canned tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Potatoes
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Onions
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hearts of romaine lettuce

 McCAIN TOURS HANOI, WITH BITTER MEMORIES  
 by MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam _ As he strode through the shadowy hallways and
incongruously sunny courtyards, gesturing here, pointing to a
detail there, Sen. John McCain might have been a father showing a
son his alma mater. Except the landmarks on this tour were dank
cells like the one where McCain spent two years in solitary
confinement, and leg irons, which he once wore as a punishment for
insulting the guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always interesting for me to be back here and show my son
the place where I lived for a long time,'' the Arizona Republican
said as he paused next to a faded photograph of himself as a
grim-faced, unmistakably defiant inmate. ``But I put Vietnam behind
me when I left.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he guided his wife and 13-year-old son through the
remnants of the grim jail known as the ``Hanoi Hilton,'' McCain,
long a proponent of better relations with Vietnam, betrayed
feelings still raw a quarter of a century later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still bear them ill will,'' he said of the prison guards,
``not because of what they did to me, but because of what they did
to some of my friends _ including killing some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his wife, Cindy, had visited the prison, known as Hoa
Lo, on one of his eight previous trips to Vietnam since his release
in 1973. But McCain, whose visit comes just before the the 25th
anniversary on Sunday of the end of the Vietnam War, said he wanted
to show his son Jack the place.
</P>
<P>
   A sprawling French colonial-era fortress, the jail housed 300
U.S. pilots at various periods during the war. The Vietnamese
authorities tore down much of it 1993 to make way for a luxury
hotel and office complex called Hanoi Towers. But they preserved
one corner as a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, McCain seemed aware that the site of his suffering
had become just another stop on the tourist trail for people
visiting Vietnam's now-popular capital. At several points during
the self-guided tour, he stopped to say hello or to have his
picture taken with American tourists _ most of whom said they
supported him during his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination this year.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered an acidic commentary on how the Vietnamese
portrayed life inside the prison. Alongside the pictures of McCain
and his fellow prisoners, a plaque declared: ``Though having
committed untold crimes on our people, the American pilots suffered
no revenge once they were captured and detained. Instead, they were
treated with adequate food, clothing and shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaking his head, McCain muttered, ``That's entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, another set of photos showed the Americans receiving
letters from their families, meeting with North Vietnamese
journalists and attending Mass. McCain pointed out that one of the
pilots in that picture had placed his hand on his chin, with only
his middle finger extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that sums up how he felt about being here,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has described his five-and-a-half-year imprisonment as a
nightmarish time, in which he was beaten and kept in solitary
confinement. Twice he tried to hang himself, only to be cut down
and assaulted by the guards.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was captured on Oct. 26, 1967, after his Navy plane was
shot down while on a bombing run over Hanoi. He crashed into a
lake, breaking both arms and a leg.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McCain paid a visit to the lake, known as Truc Bac,
where he described to reporters being dragged ashore and beaten by
an angry mob. On this visit, several curious locals stepped forward
to greet McCain _ some posing for photographs with his family.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, McCain said the American inmates communicated by
tapping on the walls of their cells. The prisoners nicknamed their
cell-block Thunderbird, and McCain described how it was lighted
with a single bulb. During the day, loudspeakers that hung from the
ceiling would drone with music by North Vietnamese propaganda
figures like the singer known as Hanoi Hannah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard her every day,'' McCain said. ``She's a marvelous
entertainer. I'm surprised she didn't get to Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese government has expressed anger at McCain's
description of his treatment as a prisoner of war, especially in
his recent memoir. Wednesday, despite his sarcasm and fleeting
bitterness, the senator seemed reluctant to add to his earlier
accounts of that period.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McCain has long advocated reconciling the two countries
and was instrumental in the establishment of diplomatic relations
with Hanoi five years ago. At his arrival here Tuesday, he said he
had come to ``commemorate the beginning and continuation of a new
relationship between the United States and Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with senior Vietnamese officials, the senator said
he discussed negotiations on a trade agreement between the two
countries. A deal was agreed to in principle last July, but has
bogged down since then as the Vietnamese have balked at several
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for this most celebrated of POWs, the war is the shadow
the lurks behind every meeting and every ritual. On Tuesday, soon
after he landed in Hanoi, McCain attended a ceremony on a
sweltering airport tarmac, in which the remains of six people,
believed to be U.S. soldiers missing since the war, were loaded on
a U.S. Air Force plane and flown to Hawaii for forensic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   For Jack McCain, Wednesday's visit seem to confirm the stories
his father had told him. As he left the prison, Jack said he had
expected the cells to be cramped and dark. Indeed, his knowledge of
the prison seemed so thorough that he expressed surprise at only
one small detail: the iron doors at the main entrance were wide
enough that his father was delivered through them in a truck.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Susan Terry of Roswell, Ga., asked for a
sweet-and-sour rice salad she vaguely recalled that had green
onions in it. Beyond that, she said, it might have included raisins

 &HT;    SHOPPING DESTINATION: Summerville, S.C.
 &HT;    Finding charm amid the Lowcountry pines
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMMERVILLE, S.C. _ Wealthy plantation owners and their families
began coming here as early as 1745 to settle among the pines,
seeking respite from swamp fevers and insects plaguing the
peninsula of ``Charles Town,'' now Charleston, 20 miles away on the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1900s, the town had become a popular winter resort
for Northerners who came for the mild climate, the fresh air (with
its reputed therapeutic qualities) and good hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, people are drawn to the lovely ``Flowertown in the
Pines'' for its small-town friendliness, 700 buildings on the
National Register of Historic Places, cozy bed-and-breakfast inns
in historic homes and a fabulous resort on the outskirts of town
and, no doubt, the excellent shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Brick storefronts downtown house a wonderful array of specialty
shops with antiques, collectibles, original art, handmade crafts,
toys, home decor, gifts, apparel and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Among the shops facing shady Hutchinson Square are Piazza, a
home decor shop with an artist studio and garden shop inside; High
Cotton, which offers first-quality overruns and closeouts with
labels including Banana Republic, American Eagle Outfitters, Lands'
End, L.L. Bean and Talbots; and Dorchester Jeweler and Gifts, which
carries affordable jewelry and pins inspired by Charleston
architectural design.
</P>
<P>
   Folks still stop in at the corner drugstore _ Guerin's Pharmacy
_ for old-fashioned sundaes and milkshakes at the soda fountain.
</P>
<P>
   Just off the square is Bunny Business, an adorable pink cottage
filled with pretty things for little girls. The 200-year-old house
was renovated and expanded by owner Cathy Tuten.
</P>
<P>
   The 1913 Cauthen Hardware building is now People, Places and
Quilts _ 5,000 square feet of new and antique quilts, antiques,
folk art and thousands of bolts of fabric that create a
kaleidoscope of color.
</P>
<P>
   The original hardware furnishings, even the 1919 cash register,
are still in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who work here love old things,'' says owner Diane
Wilson. ``It suits us to ring up purchases by hand and write up
tickets. No plastic here.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a fat brown stuffed bear lounges lazily on a
bench outside Pear Tree, hinting of the wondrous toys and games
inside.
</P>
<P>
   And down Cedar Street, there's Cow Hydes Ltd., with its
black-and-white bovine-inspired awning and leather creations
inside.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea: You stroll around town, chat with the friendly
shopkeepers, have a bite to eat, maybe stop in at one of downtown's
two day spas and then buy-buy. There's really not much else to do
in Summerville _ which is part of its charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived here 16 years, and we love it,'' says Lydia
Williams, a former Atlantan who opened her consignment shop,
Scarlett's Closet, eight years ago. ``All my family is in Atlanta.
This is close enough to home, and we are 45 minutes to Wild Dunes,
where we have a beach house. We have the best of both worlds. This
is God's country.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take I-20 east to I-26 in Columbia, S.C., then

 &HT;    Farewells, celebrities pack schedule for May sweeps
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hang a big red ``Exit'' sign over the May sweeps: It's all about
the goodbyes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox is leaving ``Spin City'' (May 24) to deal with
his Parkinson's disease. Julianna Margulies, whose character Carol
Hathaway tried to kill herself in the very first episode of ``ER,''
finally departs (May 18), alive, after five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   All those grown-up kids of ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' are outta
here in a two-hour finale May 17. Another Fox youth series, ``Party
of Five,'' has its last episode Wednesday. CBS' ``Cosby'' and ABC's
``Boy Meets World,'' neither of which made any impact, get
send-offs nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the networks will also try to distract you with
specials, which sometimes are big and sometimes just long. Mirrored
disco balls on ``The '70s'' will battle flying carpets on ``Arabian
Nights'' this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But if you had to predict one show that will crush them all, it
would be the all-celebrity editions of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' next week.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick rundown of some of what's ahead in May sweeps,
which start tonight:
</P>
<P>
   S E R I E S
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Friends'' (8 tonight on NBC) _ Bruce Willis starts a
three-week guest role as the disapproving dad of Ross' girlfriend;
that older man/younger ``Friends'' woman plot is dusted off when he
gets involved with Rachel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
</P>
<P>
   (8 p.m. Monday-Wednesday, 9 p.m. May 4 on ABC) _ The
much-heralded celebrity version, with Kathie Lee Gifford, Rosie
O'Donnell, David Duchovny, Drew Carey, Queen Latifah, Ray Romano
and others playing for charity. Alex Trebek had a conflicting
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``ER'' (10 tonight on NBC) _ Nurse Hathaway has been getting
ready to leave for months, just as that painfully sweet Croatian
Dr. Kovac has been working up the nerve to make his romantic move.
There's no indication that George Clooney will ride to Carol's
rescue, as has been widely rumored.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Popular'' (8 p.m. May 18 on the WB) _ The spoofy teen series
skewers the conventions of season-ending cliffhangers with two
weddings, a funeral and a natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Frasier'' (9 p.m. May 18 on NBC) _ No credible leaks yet on
the one-hour finale, where Daphne is supposed to get married, but
may end up with Niles.
</P>
<P>
   M O V I E S
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Arabian Nights'' (9 p.m. Sunday and Monday on ABC) _
Scheherazade (Mili Avital) tells the stories of Aladdin, Ali Baba
and other legendary characters in a feast fit for a sultan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The '70s'' (9 p.m. Sunday and Monday on NBC) _ Fictional
archetypes (Black Power guy, druggie girl) truck through 10 years
of travails. Great soundtrack: Marvin Gaye, Steely Dan, the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Gepetto'' (7 p.m. May 7 on ABC) _ Drew Carey and Julia
Louis-Dreyfus sing in a new musical of ``Pinocchio.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Jesus'' (9 p.m. May 14 and 17 on CBS)_ Jeremy Sisto has the
title role, with Debra Messing of ``Will &AMP; Grace'' as Mary
Magdalene and Gary Oldman as Pilate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Linda McCartney Story'' (9 p.m. May 21 on CBS) _
Elizabeth Mitchell (``Gia'') stars as Paul's late wife.
</P>
<P>
   S P E C I A L S
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Academy of Country Music Awards'' (8 p.m. Wednesday on CBS)
_ Dolly Parton hosts, all the usual suspects sing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Judds Reunion: The Power to Change'' (8 p.m. May 17 on
CBS) _ Not just Wynonna and Naomi, but Ashley too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Daytime Emmy Awards'' (9 p.m. May 19 on ABC) _ Susan Lucci
hosts.

 &HT;    Secretaries make their mark
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, every one of you callous, corporate-nose-to-the-grindstone
bosses who forgot that Wednesday was Secretaries' Day raise your
hand. Now, here's your chance to make it up to him/her. Send your
invaluable minion home with one of these rentals:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Nine To Five'': What's most intriguing about this broad 1980
farce blending office and sexual politics is the casting. Imagine
Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton (in her feature debut) all
drowning in the same typing pool thanks to their contemptible boss
(a very funny Dabney Coleman). The first half is much better than
the second, but the stars' easy ensemble triple-playing gives it
its spark. Interesting side note: as part of the research, director
Colin Higgins asked secretaries how they'd dispose of their bosses
if given the chance. The most popular choices were guns, poison and
hanging.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Clockwatchers'': A kind of Gen X ``Nine to Five.'' In this
wicked little 1997 take on workplace hell, some temps bond over
happy hour wings and shared complaints about working in an office
rife with petty politics and nonstop Muzak. Much like the
Fonda/Tomlin/Parton picture, the plot is not as sharp as the
nuanced observations of your typical dysfunctional corporate
``family.'' And again, the casting is a trip: Parker Posey (then
reigning queen of the independent scene), Lisa Kudrow, trying to
parlay her ``Friends'' fame into a movie career and Toni Collette,
recently Oscar-nominated for ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Take a Letter, Darling'': Rosalind Russell plays an
advertising executive who hires Fred MacMurray to be her secretary.
An enjoyably prescient and witty movie for its time (1942), it
shrewdly adds the inevitable romance. In her memoir, Russell
recalls that the role led to a slew of career-woman parts, so much
so, that she was asked to address a convention of real-life female
executives. She humorously pointed out that every picture usually
began with her barking orders at ten or twelve guys in a conference
room, but there was always one fellow with a hat pulled down over
his eyes who says ``verrry interesting'' before leaving the room.
The topper: by the end of the picture, she was always married to
him and gratefully retired to a house in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Swimming With Sharks'': In L.A., they don't always call them
secretaries. They're known by the more politically correct title,
``personal assistant.'' In this scathing 1994 low-budget blast at
Hollywood, Frank Whaley plays the ``personal assistant'' to Kevin
Spacey, a vice president in charge of production at a major movie
studio (Joel Silver, some have whispered, is the real-life model,
but for my money, Spacey's megalomaniacal boss-from-hell is the
rule out there, not the exception). The movie's frame _ an
exasperated Whaley has gone over the edge and taken Spacey hostage
in his own house _ is a little forced, but overall, the film
captures just how horrifying life among the latte-drinkers can be.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Working Girl'': Yep, it's the ultimate fantasy for everyone
who's ever fetched coffee for a self-centered boss or heard said
boss take credit for his or her idea. But boy, it works and works
and works. Made in 1988, Melanie Griffith gives her best
performance to date (she got an Oscar nomination) as the
teased-hair heroine who uses her smarts to reinvent herself as
executive material. Harrison Ford generously underplays as the
dream guy she wants. Best of all, however, is a ferociously funny
Sigourney Weaver (another Oscar nominee) who shows us that selfish
bosses come in all shapes, sizes and genders.

 &HT;    Bare-knuckled look at bad boys a knockout
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of last year's most controversial studio releases, the Brad
Pitt-Edward Norton flick will have as many people loathing it as
liking it. Either reaction is justifiable.
</P>
<P>
   The film, about a pack of guys beating each other to bloody
pulps, is violent, nihilistic, intoxicated by its own bad-boy
humor. And, yeah, it falls apart in its last half-hour with a twist
ending that doesn't totally stack up. But it's still one of those
rare films that creates an electrifying alternate universe
onscreen. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO PICK:
</P>
<P>
   `Fight Club'
</P>
<P>
   Rated R / Our critic's grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   OTHER NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Flawless'' (R) _ It might be a guilty pleasure _ if they'd
made it 30 years ago. You could slip it into the VCR and giggle at
its dated, consciousness-raising plot and its by-the-numbers tale
of a homophobic security guard (Robert De Niro) who learns to
respect the brassy/soulful drag queen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) next
door. Unfortunately, the flick from writer-director Joel Schumacher
is a new release full of weary cliches and flat comic bits. Grade:
D+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Dinner Game'' (PG-13) _ A feast of foolishness. A bunch
of snotty Paris yuppies holds a weekly dinner to see who can bring
the biggest idiot as his guest. Publisher Thierry Lhermitte thinks
he's got a sure thing when he meets Jacques Villeret who builds
scale-model monuments out of matchsticks. But fate intervenes when
Lhermitte throws out his back and is forced to spend the evening
with Villeret who, with all the best intentions, systematically
wrecks his life. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``On the Ropes'' (unrated) _ An admirable, Oscar-nominated
documentary about three young boxers fighting dead-end lives in New
York's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. Like ``Hoop Dreams,''
``Ropes'' records the hope and sometimes heartache athletic ability
offers; it's a powerful democratic equalizer. The movie also
reminds us that reality is often more dramatic than fiction. Grade:
B

   Q: I would like to find No Bugs M'Lady paper for my cabinets. I
have used it for years, but now I can't find it.
</P>
<P>
   _Joan Miller, Smyrna, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: All nasty little critters will soon steer clear of your
cabinets. This odorless insecticidal shelf and drawer covering,
which is FDA approved and comes in 20 patterns, kills roaches, ants
and silverfish. You can also put this product in storage areas and
around garbage cans, under sinks and in broom closets. Order No
Bugs M'Lady from Kittrich Corp. A case of 12 18-inch-by-10-foot
rolls is $15.35. 1-800-321-1741.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am in search of bluejeans by HIS. For years, I bought them
from Target but can't seem to find them anymore. These jeans are
long-lasting and fit well.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Bradford, Conyers, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your search is over for these easy-care blue denims. Thony's,
111 Peachtree St. S.W. (404-525-0711) carries HIS in waist sizes
30-42. A pair is $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find Albert Einstein's No More Smelly Shoes? My
wife complained about my smelly tennis shoes, but after using this
product, I heard no more complaints. But I've lost track of it.
Help me!
</P>
<P>
   _Jerry Blum, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Only a genius could discover ``No More Smelly Shoes.'' We
located it at the Bed, Bath &AMP; Beyond store at 800 Ernest Barrett
Parkway, Kennesaw (770-499-8863). A bottle is $7.99. Made in
Australia by Dynamo House, this product _ so named ``because it's
such a brilliant idea,'' says the manufacturer _ contains only
natural substances. ``It's nontoxic,'' says a Dynamo House
spokeswoman, ``and its odor-counteracting ability has been
scientifically proven.'' It's simple to use. After wearing, spray
one or two squirts into each shoe. Leave overnight or wear
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to locate a toothbrush for people who wear
braces. It's by Butler G.U.M.
</P>
<P>
   _Marilyn Davis, College Park, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your dentist will love you. Butler G.U.M.'s version is the
Proxabrush Handle ($2.19). It cleans and removes plaque on
hard-to-reach tooth surfaces and comes with two interdental brush
refills. And Oral-B makes the Interdental Kit ($2.69) which comes
with a handle and two brush refills. It ``effectively cleans around
bridges and braces,'' says the manufacturer. We found both brushes
at CVS, 4860 Stone Mountain Highway, Lilburn (770-972-3057).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a card holder so a one-armed person can take
part in a card game. It sits on the table and holds 13 cards.
</P>
<P>
   _Lillian Brown, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: This is your lucky day. We found a Wood Card Holder from
Games of Tradition ($11.95) at the Game Keeper in Phipps Plaza,
3500 Peachtree Road N.E. (404-266-9600). It sits on the table and
holds your playing cards so you don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE TO READERS:
</P>
<P>
   Several readers have not been able to find Domino Dots, the
sugar cubes. A spokeswoman for Domino Sugar Co. says the New York
plant that makes the cubes has been on strike since June. However,
she's hopeful the strike will be settled in a few weeks and the
plant can again produce the cubes. Watch for them to start
returning to grocery stores in the next few months.

HEATHERS
</HEADLINE>
  Many sides of Heather Graham 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mystery, thy name is Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   After some of the boldest, and some of the goofiest,
performances in recent cinema, the big-eyed blonde from Agoura
defies the one-note celebrity take without, apparently, even
trying. As soon as you try to fit her into a convenient conceptual
box, intriguing contradictions knock down perceived boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, she's a good kisser,'' jokes Casey Affleck, who plays
a supporting role in ``Committed,'' the new romantic comedy that
marks Graham's emergence as a leading lady. ``Basically, she's a
lot of fun. She's kind of like a sister to everyone, always bouncy
on the set and easy to get along with.''
</P>
<P>
   But Luke Wilson, another ``Committed'' actor, was impressed by
different, more mature aspects of the actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being really affected by `Drugstore Cowboy,' and
even though she didn't say a lot in the movie, I was very
interested in her character,'' Wilson says, referring to Graham's
style-setting, troubled-child role as a pharmacy-robbing drug
addict. ``And I really dug 'Boogie Nights' ... But sometimes you
can work with somebody that you've liked from afar, then the other
shoe drops in one way or another and you think, 'Oh, that's too
bad.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But Heather is just a really hard worker, and you can feel it
on the set. Heather is not about her angle or your angle; she's
just about doing a good job. I got the feeling that she was really
going for it in a good way.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Graham a giggly California girl or a solid, adventurous
professional? For that matter, is she determined to remain the
artsy taboo-breaker of ``Drugstore,'' ``Boogie'' and ``Twin Peaks''
or is she morphing into the blithely naughty, mass-market comedian
seen in last year's ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' and
``Bowfinger,'' and in the upcoming Farrelly Brothers sex farce
``Say It Isn't So''?
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the subject, is Graham, at age 30, still
rebelling against her strict Catholic upbringing (her parents
famously forbade her to appear in the namesake black comedy
``Heathers'' after reading the expletive-rich script) or choosing
her roles, however outrageous they may be, by more mature criteria?
</P>
<P>
   It's probably not an either/or proposition in any of these
cases. Like Joline, the devoted-beyond-reason young wife she plays
in ``Committed,'' Heather Graham is a complicated individual.
</P>
<P>
   Saner, but complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I understood where this character was coming from,
I thought the script was funny and dramatic at the same time, and I
could see certain things about myself in her,'' says Graham,
looking incongruously funky/glamorous (silky black top, jeans of a
near-radiant blue) and on her way to Wal-Mart (carrying around a
fuzzy, lime green overcoat). ``I've never been in her exact
situation, but I just felt really passionate about the whole
project.''
</P>
<P>
   In the independently produced film, which was written and
directed by Lisa Krueger (``Manny &AMP; Lo''), Joline is a New York
nightclub owner who takes promises very, very seriously. When her
photographer husband Carl (Wilson) abruptly relocates to El Paso
to, y'know, work some things out, Joline tracks him down.
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't act like your typical abandoned wife. Determined
to save her marriage, Joline watches Carl from afar, insinuates
herself into the lives of his associates (including his new
girlfriend) and, generally, gives the confused man his space.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, she can't take it any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she just embodied the idea of really believing in
something,'' Graham explains. ``So even if she is annoying, and at
a certain point should really get the idea of giving up, I think
the movie is really about figuring out who you are. She finds out
that, yes, she is a committed person and has to learn to accept her
disappointments and then move on. She can still be that same sort
of person and even go at it again more _ but, maybe, have more
wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrying a film for the first time was certainly a
wisdom-getting experience for Graham, even if she typically jokes
about the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to get nine hours of sleep a night,'' she says,
laughing. ``Since I was in practically every scene and we were
working six days a week, I got pretty tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters was the fact that Graham had just fallen in
love with Ed Burns, the writer-director (``The Brothers McMullen'')
and actor (``Saving Private Ryan'') when filming commenced. He
joined her in El Paso for most of ``Committed's'' shoot, which was
nice. Then again ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right at the beginning of our relationship, and I was
afraid to show him the script because I didn't know him that
well,'' she reveals. ``But it was very romantic, him being there
every day. Of course, the director was going, 'Great. We're doing
this movie about a girl whose husband leaves her and you guys are,
like, the couple hanging out together every second.'''
</P>
<P>
   No problem with commitment as far as Burns and Graham are
concerned. They've been together ever since, and she recently
played a role in his upcoming movie ``Sidewalks of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, the night I met him, we talked a lot, and then I
went home and couldn't fall asleep,'' she admits. ``I was all
excited; we were committed! It's a good relationship; we're honest
and discuss a lot of things. And he's fun to work with; he would
listen to me when he was writing the script and incorporate some of
my ideas into it, which was really exciting. And he's always
encouraging me to write myself and develop projects, which is
really inspirational.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are few subjects Graham is shy about discussing,
the couple's recent, widely reported interest in purchasing the
late John Kennedy Jr.'s New York loft is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I wouldn't really talk about it anyway, because
where we live is private,'' says Graham, who nonetheless indicated
that they won't be buying the place. ``It would be kind of creepy
for certain people out there to know where we're living _ and
besides, moving to this couple's apartment that died? That's not my
desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham is also reluctant to get very specific about her
five-year estrangement from her retired FBI agent father, her
mother and her sister Aimee, who is also an actress. Her feelings
about her family, though, have been extensively examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to think that I was leading my life to rebel
against them,'' she allows. ``That's what years of therapy have,
hopefully, untaught me to do. I think I have sort of reached the
point of just really trying to make myself happy. Because I feel a
lot happier, I know that I am doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just great to enjoy who you are and not really worry
about what other people are thinking, or how it affects them.
Sometimes, you really have to make sacrifices in order to be the
person that you are and to enjoy your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Wisconsin and raised in several parts of the country
before her family moved to Agoura Hills, Calif., when she was 9,
Graham describes herself as an introverted child whose unfocused
creative nature made her feel out of place in the conservative
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham discovered her own Yellow Brick Road _ both out of
her adolescent shell and in the direction of her budding muse _
when she played Dorothy in a school production of ``The Wizard of
Oz.'' She followed it to Hollywood, and while still in school she
appeared in a number of commercials, on the sitcom ``Growing
Pains'' and in several TV movies. Her first feature film was the
1988 teen comedy ``License to Drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Graham has exhibited an unmistakable taste for edgy
movies and characters caught up in dire lifestyles _ junkies,
rollerskating porn stars, promiscuous actresses. In ``From Hell,''
the film she'll be making this summer, she'll be an English
prostitute stalked by Jack the Ripper.
</P>
<P>
   But much like fellow San Fernando Valley film talents Kevin
Spacey and ``Boogie Nights'' director Paul Thomas Anderson, Graham
has a way of locating the attractive humanity _ and in her case,
often, the fun _ beneath the surface of alarming, even appalling
behavior. She attributes a big part of that signature ability to
her passionately complicated relationship with the place where she
grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of exciting, creative people are coming out of the Valley
now,'' she notes. ``And why couldn't they? Whatever else you want
to say about it, the Valley is great. It's like, there's as much
crazy, weird culture going on here as there is in New York. And I'm
not saying this just because I'm from there; it's got its own
amazing thing going on.'' &QL;

   NADTERECHNOYE, Russia _ When Russian bombs rained down on Grozny
last fall, the city's only orphanage moved to this small town in
northern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to have been a temporary stay. But seven months
later the orphanage is still here in a cramped former schoolhouse.
Nobody can say when it might move back.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the children, Tatyana Tkachenko, a sprightly
11-year-old, would dearly like to return. Life in Grozny was no
picnic, but at least the children had more than one room to share.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the orphanage is the story of what is happening in
Chechnya. Or more aptly, what is not happening. As the war has
dragged on, temporary dislocations seem to have become
semipermanent.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Chechnya has stopped in time.
</P>
<P>
   It has no elected leaders because the situation is too unstable
to arrange local elections. Maj. Gen. Vladimir Kovrov, the Russian
military commandant who administers the Nadterechny region, said
Tuesday that the voting for a new leader of the republic and heads
of local districts would probably not take place for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Chechnya made much headway in dealing with the crush of
refugees. The refugee camps in this district are still overflowing.
The refugees, who live four families to a tent, say their homes
either have been destroyed or are still in a battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   For many, life is a kind of Catch-22. If they leave the refugee
camps for a few days to check the conditions of their homes, they
may miss their food rations. Petimat Gelikahnova, a 48-year-old
refugee who was waiting for a shipment of food aid in nearby
Znamenskoye, is one of thousands who are trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Grozny and saw that everything was destroyed,'' she
said. ``So we came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the orphanage, whose 29 children had thought they
would have to make do with the spartan home here for just a few
months. Now they are settling in for a long stay.
</P>
<P>
   The orphanage _ officially called the Home for Orphans and
Children Left Without Parental Support, No. 1 _ was opened as the
1994-1996 war in Chechnya was ending. Not all of the children are
without parents. Some were left at the home by desperate mothers or
fathers who were too poor to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya enjoyed a de facto independence then, but it was also a
zone of anarchy and poverty. The orphanage was one of just eight,
and the only one that did not close for lack of money. Even so, it
did not have much government support. It received 5,000 rubles from
the Chechen authorities over four years (less than $1,000 at the
old 1996 exchange rates).
</P>
<P>
   The current war has made a difficult situation immeasurably
worse. The orphanage was near a rail line in a Grozny district
pounded by bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the staff decided it was time to flee. So the
orphanage was relocated in a small school building here, the one
Arbi Mamakayev, a famous Chechen poet, once attended.
</P>
<P>
   The local authorities pay the staff's salaries, and the
Volgograd militia, which polices this town, donates potatoes and
onions. But beyond that the orphanage has little.
</P>
<P>
   Meat, fruit and milk are in short supply. The furniture is spare
and the children need shoes and summer clothes. The building is
small. In the room where virtually all of the children sleep _ some
three to a bed _ a green curtain separates the girls from the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had more space we could accept more children,'' said the
bookkeeper of the orphanage, who did not give her name.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children have been shaken by the war.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Magomed, a 9-year-old who spent several months at the orphanage
while his mother was being treated for tuberculosis, had lived with
her in a basement for months to escape the fighting. During his
stay apart from her he was withdrawn and barely spoke.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   But by and large, the children appear to be well treated, well
adjusted and eager to go back to Grozny. Tanya was left at the
orphanage by her parents, who were out of work and too poor to look
after her. She has two dresses. While she is not one to complain,
she agreed it would be nice to have one more.
</P>
<P>
   Because her parents are still in Grozny, she wants to return.
But that will not be easy. The orphanage compound there was damaged
and awaits repair. The city still lacks electricity, and the
orphanage has no generator. The senior Russian representative in
Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, has ruled the ravaged city not yet
suitable for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we left they were bombing day and night,'' Tanya said.
``And it's OK here. But I'd like to go back.''

A BLACK GUMSHOE WHO BUILT A GENRE IS BACK ON THE JOB  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this year's Academy Awards, Isaac Hayes performed the theme
from ``Shaft'' engulfed in a special effect gone horribly wrong: a
billowing wave of stage smoke that looked ready to waft him away.
</P>
<P>
   The 1971 movie, a massive hit that saved its troubled
distributor, MGM, from bankruptcy and gave a whole new meaning to
the phrase film noir, exists under a similar cumulonimbus.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Parks's groundbreaking detective film never got the
respect it deserves; I recently overheard a major filmmaker giving
the picture short shrift and claiming he could have done a much
better job with the material, given Hayes' score _ which some
consider the true star of the motion picture. In fact, the score
builds a frame around the likable cool of Parks's picture; it
doesn't usurp it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a new version of ``Shaft'' _ starring Samuel L.
Jackson, directed by John Singleton and written by Richard Price _
due for release this summer, the original film will be scrutinized
once again. Will it get any more respect this time around? (At
least last time, the picture's flashy clothes were accorded a
degree of admiration.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' affirmed the growing success of the blaxploitation
genre, which had begun in 1970 with the release of ``Cotton Comes
to Harlem,'' a swift, comic retelling of Chester Himes' novel that
cagily tempered the author's Old Testament brutality. The
surprising box-office performance of ``Shaft,'' adapted by Ernest
Tidyman from his novel, sparked studio interest in black action
films and gave Parks _ a Renaissance man with fiction, music and,
of course, photography among his accomplishments _ a new career.
</P>
<P>
   His photography has a marvelous emphatic vitality, and that
vitality informs his filmmaking in ``Shaft,'' which was as much a
tribute to the detective movies of the 1930s and '40s as it was a
fountainhead for those of the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   A true pioneer, Parks had, in 1969, directed an adaptation of
his Bildungsroman, ``The Learning Tree'' _ the first
studio-financed film directed by an African-American. In ``Shaft,''
just two years after his directorial debut, he shows a feel for
creating indelible moments, like the opening sequence: the star,
Richard Roundtree, hits the streets and the urgent sizzle of the
high-hat from the theme alerts the movie world to a different kind
of party. (John Badham's introduction to ``Saturday Night Fever,''
where John Travolta's sexual bounce is a manifestation of New York
ego, seems directly influenced by the start of ``Shaft.'')
</P>
<P>
   Shaft's agile swing into a hotel window, snaking through so he
doesn't bang his head on the sill while clad in his black leather
street armor and brandishing a shotgun, is such a classic piece of
action that it's used as the film's poster.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Shaft'' doesn't hold up these days as an action film,
its detractors are probably too young to be aware of the elation
that charged movie houses of the '70s as cheering black audiences
saw a dark-skinned hero _ iconic and masculine in his
up-to-the-minute proto-fade haircut and collection of leathers _ in
total control of his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Roundtree's on-screen relish, which was itself a kind of
dynamism, connected to an audience hunger. And he held the screen
like an aristocrat. New to the movies, he had appeared onstage; but
his greatest success had been as an Afro Sheen model: he could be
seen grinning in hair cream ads in the backs of magazines whose
covers proclaimed his arrival as a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   In one stroke, he was lionized and doomed; he scored so soundly
as Shaft that he was finished. Between the lack of roles for black
actors outside the genre, and the impact he made as Shaft,
Roundtree was boxed in. The constraints of the era are enough to
allow forgiveness for his accepting the role in the short-lived
``Shaft'' television series of the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Roundtree's sunny self-possession helped him temporarily
displace Sidney Poitier, whose rigidity made him unappealing to
young black audiences, as the reigning black actor. What they
couldn't see at the time was that the upright precision that made
Poitier seem so humorless was a boiling anger that he held in
check, the elegant and inexplicable righteousness that had made him
a star and that Denzel Washington seized upon years later.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Roundtree has a glint of devilishness, visible in
the scene where Shaft pretends to be a gay bartender. His evolution
as an actor went largely, and unaccountably, unnoticed. He simply
got better, displaying aplomb even in the minor ``George of the
Jungle.'' And those who had hoped to see him become the black Sean
Connery _ he has the same outsize wellspring of charm and virility,
but with a leavening sense of self-deprecation _ were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   There was no room for his move upward and onward. Roundtree's
curse was that he appeared on the scene when there was room for
representations of only one type of black man: the avatar of
inner-city aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   The title character's name itself suggested the heavy,
elbow-to-the-rib swing of the theme song. If the makers of the new
``Shaft'' are smart, they will include the Hayes theme, if only to
give it the ground-shaking Dolby send-off the audio technology of
the time couldn't provide.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this piece of heavy jam kept audiences in their seats
waiting to see, or hear, whether anything nearly as good would
follow. And it did: plenty of muscular orchestral funk, a seeming
contradiction that Isaac Hayes had mastered long before he was
courted to score ``Shaft.'' With its strains of urban melancholy
and horns used for soft punctuation, Hayes's work was obviously
influenced by Ennio Morricone and Burt Bacharach. The percussion
and flutes were pushed to the front of the sound mix to add
poignant contrast to the bombast of the strings, and in Hayes's
case, of the throbbing, danceable bass lines and warm, moody
Hammond B3 organ interludes.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes's music was made for the movies, and his score for
``Shaft'' helped establish a whole new brand of soundtrack. After
its success, which included a best-song Oscar for Hayes, almost
every major R-and-B performer of the period was snagged to compose
music for blaxploitation movies. But only a handful of scores _
including Curtis Mayfield's ``Superfly'' and Marvin Gaye's
``Trouble Man'' _ emerged from the pack. (Willie Hutch's score for
``The Mack'' and Bobby Womack's theme song for ``Across 110th
Street'' are also notable. The off-white soul man Quentin Tarantino
used ``110th Street'' over the opening credits of ``Jackie
Brown.'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The success of blaxploitation movies, and their guilty-pleasure
importance to white audiences, is easy enough to explain. During
the Vietnam era, when Richard Nixon's 5 o'clock shadow blotted out
the sun, misery became an emblem of cool. For the most part, white
movie protagonists were hobbled by their shame. The heroes of
blaxploitation, however, were active, proudly potent heroes: John
Shaft and his brethren were able to effect change, to do good.
</P>
<P>
   They also had a capacity for pleasure, because they accomplished
what they set out to do _ which was, more often than not, to stick
it to the Man with grinding regularity. The fact that whites _
Honky, Mr. Charlie, depicted in these films as the whitey who often
snarled a racial slur at the heroes before dying a spectacular
death that elicited cheers _ were also responsible for producing
these movies was a paradox not lost on the crowds in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The fairy-tale carnality and wish-fulfillment plots of these
films embodied an optimism that most '70s movies lacked, a
folkloric bravado that the heroes _ if that's the word _ of
Scorsese and Altman and Coppola were denied. Yet blaxploitation
movies came armed with a political imperative.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, when the revolution would not be televised,
militants and community activists were invariably among the good
guys in black action-movie story lines. After all, ``Shaft'' was
released in 1971, only a few years after the premiere of the
light-stepping espionage program ``I Spy,'' in which Bill Cosby was
the first black man to carry a gun on series television.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shaft,'' the black gangster Bumpy Jonas hires the black
detective played by Roundtree to retrieve his kidnapped daughter
from the Mob. When Jonas tries to discredit the Black Panther-like
revolutionaries, Shaft rebukes the criminal. Shaft sides with the
militants, who assist him in the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   It's the one thing that the newer, affectionate but often clumsy
attempts to replicate the genre miss out on. Blaxploitation movies
were built upon a shared recognition of the need to shake up the
status quo _ the collateral rage of the civil rights movement was
brought to the big screen. These movies didn't limit themselves to
making style statements, or tracking ingenious petty crimes and big
ripoffs. At the climax of ``The Mack,'' one of the best-known and
most revered blaxploitation pictures, the protagonist is
enlightened about his misadventures in the pimp trade by his
militant brother.
</P>
<P>
   There's no point in inflating, or overly romanticizing,
``Shaft.'' Like others in its genre, it was a movie in which the
women weren't well realized, let alone well treated. In a
post-coital scene, after Shaft brusquely tries to dismiss his
one-night stand, the woman criticizes him for his callousness.
</P>
<P>
   This is a set-up for a joke, but the worldliness of the gesture
transcends the genre, as do a number of touches in ``Shaft.'' When
its dry-ice hero can't get a cab, it drew peals of knowing laughter
from black audiences _ and helped seal this movie with an
African-American director's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to watch, like Moses Gunn's crocodile tears as his
Bumpy Jonas talks about his missing little girl, and the assurance
with which Parks moves the picture around the city; it's a time
capsule of a Manhattan that used to be a much wilder theme park
than it is now. At its best, ``Shaft'' is robust and earthy _ the
root of a movement that was just starting to bloom.
</P>
<P>
   But this new, raw form of expression had critics, who feared
audiences wouldn't regard the movies as simple entertainments and
would be damaged by their violence. And what finally cut off its
development was a problem no one had anticipated. After the core
audience tired of seeing the same movie being remade over and over
_ even Roundtree couldn't muster much pride for ``Shaft in
Africa,'' the brotherman-in-the-motherland third go-round _ studios
assumed they'd exhausted the wallets of black audiences and
abruptly stopped making movies with blacks casts. As a result, a
new form was left to die.

ECONOMIST KRUGMAN LEAVING MIT FOR PRINCETON

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Paul Krugman, a respected international economist and
star in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's economics
department, will be leaving Cambridge for Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Krugman plans to depart MIT for a joint appointment
to Princeton's economics department and the Woodrow Wilson School
of Public and International Affairs. The news, which first appeared
in MIT's student newspaper, The Tech, was confirmed Wednesday by
faculty at both universities.
</P>
<P>
   The move is being made as much for personal as professional
reasons, according to people familiar with the decision. The pull
of Princeton, N.J., was great for Krugman because his parents live
nearby and because his wife, Robin Wells, an economist, was offered
an employment contract to teach at Princeton, colleagues said.
Wells, unlike her husband, did not have a tenured post at MIT; it
could not be determined Wednesday whether her Princeton contract
included tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Landing a matched set of university postings _ particularly
difficult-to-obtain postings at elite institutions _ is a major
problem for the modern academic couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get an ideal arrangement for two people is not easy, and
this (Princeton appointment) seems to be it. I believe that to be''
the reason for Krugman's departure, said MIT economics professor
and Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman, who has gained a popular audience this year through a
regular column in The New York Times, was on a sabbatical at
Princeton for part of the current academic year. Wednesday, he
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   As a professional move for Krugman, Princeton's international
school has a sterling reputation. But its economics department is a
notch below MIT's, which is widely recognized to rank among the top
two or three in the country. However, Princeton is building its
department _ and the addition of Krugman will certainly add to its
luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an economist extraordinaire,'' said Michael Rothschild,
dean of Princeton's Wilson School. ``He has made more original
contributions to basic economics than almost anyone in the
profession. At the same time, he writes sharply, freshly,
controversially, presciently about economic policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Krugman, 47, firmly established his star reputation within the
profession in 1991, when he received the John Bates Clark Medal
awarded to promising young economists. Although he first
specialized in international trade, his interests have become more
eclectic in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman has written 16 books, including ``The Age of Diminished
Expectations'' and ``The Accidental Theorist and Other Dispatches
from the Dismal Science.'' A Democrat, he was a member of the
Council of Economic Advisers for two years during the Reagan
administration.
</P>
<P>
   While his departure is clearly a loss for MIT, the Cambridge
university has had difficulty hanging on its wunderkind and former
PhD student. MIT lost Krugman _ the first time _ when he briefly
departed for Stanford University in California, returning to his
alma mater in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sad to lose him to Stanford and glad to get him
back,'' Samuelson said. ``I don't think this (Princeton move) was
an easy decision for him.''
</P>
<P>
   While well known by economics insiders, Krugman's gained
celebrity status when he began writing a twice-weekly column for
The New York Times on Jan. 2, competing for the top spot on the
op-ed page with Times political columnist Maureen Dowd. (The Boston
Globe is owned by the New York Times Co.)
</P>
<P>
   While Krugman had earlier written for publications as varied as
Foreign Affairs, Fortune, and Salon, the Times column allowed
Krugman _ whom one newspaper dubbed the ``bad boy of economics'' _
to unleash his sharp pen on a range of economic and business
topics, from President Clinton's budget surplus to Bill Gates'
Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The column has made his name so familiar that he may be in
danger of becoming a ``pop internationalist,'' a label he once
affixed to economist and MIT colleague Lester Thurow, journalists
James Fallows and Robert Kuttner, and former Labor Secretary Robert
Reich.
</P>
<P>
   A Princeton spokeswoman said the university's trustees had not
yet acted on the appointments and would not comment further.

PLEASING, BUT NO PASSION

Our rating: 2{ stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it never quite overcomes a severe case of the cutes,
``Committed'' boasts enough grace notes to earn a mild
recommendation. The film strikes a leasing, specific tone early _
a feeling of airy obsessiveness, if you can imagine _ and sustains
it quite consistently. That isn't the most impressive feat a movie
can accomplish, but it's no small achievement, either.
</P>
<P>
   A breezy comedy about borderline psychosis, the film's title
cuts both ways. Not only is Heather Graham's heroine, Joline,
admirably committed to her marriage vows, at a certain point she
ought to be committed for taking her idealism over the line into
abject stalking.
</P>
<P>
   For her first real movie starring role, Hollywood bad girl
Graham (``Boogie Nights,'' ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me,'' ``Bowfinger'') marshals a great deal of charm and well-judged
amounts of kookiness. She makes Joline adorable, admirable and just
the right percent of scary.
</P>
<P>
   But her efforts can't quite make writer-director Lisa Krueger's
difficult mixture of whimsy and pain react convincingly. It would
be one thing if Joline were the only lovable loony on the screen.
But everyone she encounters comes with a full package of quirks,
too. This democratically allows everyone a nice actor's moment or
three, but the cumulative effect is to wipe out the humanity. The
characters become comic constructs, even though Krueger and the
cast's intention was clearly to make them believable individuals.
</P>
<P>
   We learn early on, from both voice-over narration and Joline's
actions, that she fervently believes one's word is one's bond.
She'll let a bass player perform at her New York nightclub, for
example, even though the rest of his band has deserted the
pre-arranged gig, that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   So when her husband Carl (``Blue Streak's'' Luke Wilson), a
newspaper photographer frustrated by constant food-shooting
assignments and evidently a whole lot else, disappears for points
unknown, Joline still goes ahead with his surprise birthday party
(after all, she's invited all their friends).
</P>
<P>
   Then she goes looking for him. Relentlessly, if sweetly.
However, when she finally tracks the dog down to El Paso, Texas,
Joline maintains her distance. From her car, she watches the
desert-edge trailer he lives in for hours on end (the neighbor
whose yard she parks in, a Croatian maker of arty pinatas played by
Goran Visnjic, goes to increasingly elaborate lengths to seduce
her).
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, she finds herself bonding with Carl's new
girlfriend, Carmen (Venezuelan model Patricia Velasquez, who has
good deadpan comedy instincts); their shared self-esteem issues
instantly moves the Mexican emigre to Joline's side of the matter.
Carmen even tries to get her mystic medicine man Grampy (Alfonso
Arau, the director of ``Like Water for Chocolate'') to help
straighten her new pal's psyche out. Even Joline's sexy,
boundaries-impaired little brother, Jay (Casey Affleck), heads west
to lend moral support _ as if he had any morals to work from.
</P>
<P>
   There's something Krueger is trying to say here about people
behaving in ritualistic ruts. Joline has vague, New Agey notions
about fate and protective spells that grow more desperate as her
grip starts to slip. But everyone appears to suffer some kind of
circling pattern of self-frustrating behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting theme, but one which the movie is too busy
being cute to satisfactorily explore.

TRAPPED IN THE CITY: THE DARK SIDE OF SUMMER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   Kristin Hohenadel's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about European films being made in English.  
 By KRISTIN HOHENADEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the Prague summer of 1994, during a heat wave
unrivaled in 200 years, nude sunbathers posed in their front yards
and old ladies in transparent nighties cruised the streets. I was
stuck in a city that had not yet embraced deodorant or
air-conditioning, and whose hardware stores had run out of fans.
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday afternoon in the midst of this evil swelter, I got
stuck in the elevator. Visible through the open cage, I hoped a
neighbor would soon wander out in his underwear to check the mail
or take the dog for a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Time passed. The hallway was lonely as a church.
</P>
<P>
   When the super's wife _ dressed in a bra and a skirt _ opened
her door to bid some guests a boozy farewell, I shook lightly on
the bars.
</P>
<P>
   Please help me, I said in well-rehearsed Czech. Help me, please.
She widened her eyes, snorted deeply and slammed the door behind
her.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this moment that I understood the meaning of being
stranded _ punished by circumstance, bereft of language, mired in
bad weather, too broke to get out of town. Suddenly I was starring
in the remake of the 1964 ``Lady in a Cage,'' in which Olivia de
Havilland, trapped inside a home elevator on a hot summer day,
rings the emergency button for help from the alley only to be
tormented and robbed by strangers.
</P>
<P>
   So often in the movies, summer is a time of flight and escape,
romance and bliss; too brief in real time but long in the memory,
like all the things we love. But films such as ``Lady in a Cage''
reveal the dark side of summer, that season in which fights break
out on the subway and lovers sleep far apart in the bed and the
heat tempts normally passive mortals to madness.
</P>
<P>
   An endless summer of another sort, in which insomniacs drag
their mattresses to their rooftops and live with the blinds open
and dream murderous dreams. If we know the ingredients of a happy
summer _ free time, beautiful weather, the great outdoors _ then we
know that the unhappy summer is its antithesis. And if all happy
summers seem to resemble one another, each unhappy summer is
unhappy in its own cruel way.
</P>
<P>
   It takes just a few quick establishing shots _ a dog picking
through trash in a Brooklyn gutter, people slumped on their stoops,
watering their sidewalks and cluttering the city pools _ to set the
stifling mood for ``Dog Day Afternoon.'' It's a brutal August day
in 1972 when Al Pacino, as a reluctant bank robber, finally decides
to change his destiny with a heist. You can't help feeling sorry
for him when the cops cut the air-conditioning; after all, he's
kept on his jacket and tie for a noble portion of the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   And pity his hostages, prisoners not only of a random crime but
of a relentless heat, who weakly fan themselves and faint
occasionally and mop their perspiring brows, with only a couple
cans of Tab to quench their thirst.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been crazy all summer,'' Pacino's lover, Leon, tells the
police, who have brought him from the psychiatric ward. ``He's been
trying to kill me since June.''
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee has chronicled the volatile forces that can explode
the calm of a New York summer. The heat is a backdrop, catalyst and
star in his 1999 film ``Summer of Sam,'' based on the Son of Sam
slayings in 1977. The sense of menace is thick as a swamp as crime
rises with the temperature. The killer is taunted by a neighbor's
barking dog, the city is plagued with blackouts and looters, and
the hotter it gets, the more people are afraid to leave their
houses or sit in their parked cars or sleep with their windows
open.
</P>
<P>
   In the first moments of Lee's ``Do the Right Thing,'' shot in a
steamy palette of oranges and reds, Samuel L. Jackson, playing the
local D.J., announces the weather with an apocalyptic air. Rosie
Perez soaks her face in ice water, and the street kids bust up a
fire hydrant and chase the ice cream man. The newspaper headlines
cornily shout: ``BAKED APPLE''; ``HELTER SWELTER''; ``QUE CALOR!''
</P>
<P>
   People curse the heat the way you might stick pins in a voodoo
doll, to try to defuse the source of its vexing power. ``I'm gonna
kill somebody today,'' Danny Aiello says out loud, in a stark
prelude to the inevitable violence. But we have always seen it
coming; every excruciating airless moment has led us to it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every miserable summer ends in bloodshed, even in
New York City. Sometimes the pent-up urban summer is a study in
restlessness, of that inescapable feeling of being where one should
not be, powerless to get out. The cast on Jimmy Stewart's broken
leg in Hitchcock's ``Rear Window'' leaves the poor grounded
photojournalist with nothing to do with his appetite for adventure
but look out the window and spy on the neighborhood theater. And,
of course, give him time to finally realize his true love for Grace
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris summer in Eric Rohmer's ``The Green Ray'' is a
barometer of dashed expectations for the poor Delphine, who has
lost her boyfriend and has no vacation plans for the month in which
all good Parisians depart for the grandes vacances. This is not the
fiery landscape of a Spike Lee film: Parisians recline listlessly
on park benches and read in the sunshine and sunbathe by the Seine.
Still, Delphine flees the tranquil but stagnant city three times
before she finds what she is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For it seems that in the hopeless discomfort of summer in a
city, the only relief might be romance. The sweetest moments in
``Raging Bull,'' which portrays the years-long decline of Jake
LaMotta, are in its beginning, when he finds the cool blonde at the
city pool in the midst of a scorching summer. In ``West Side
Story,'' the forbidden, quick-burning love of Maria and Tony is the
respite from the turf wars of the Jets and the Sharks, acted out in
the stifling summer playground of the park, the river, Sweeney's
lot.
</P>
<P>
   The terrible ``Taking the Heat'' begins at Christmas but soon
leaps to the hottest day of the year: ``It's 100 degrees ... the
city's gonna be a zoo today, power outages, maybe riots ... jungle
hot and humid,'' cries the ubiquitous radio announcer. What follows
is gridlock, death and a predictable romance to send us off with a
happy end.
</P>
<P>
   But if love is the answer, the heat can also drive otherwise
happily married couples to distraction when one leaves the other
behind to roast in the kitchen. In ``A Walk on the Moon,'' Diane
Lane makes a summer bachelor of her devoted husband (Liev
Schreiber), who stays behind in the city eating cereal out of a
frying pan and repairing televisions. But she's the one who gives
in to the temptation for a summer fling.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Seven Year Itch,'' the wife goes away for the summer
and assumes she'll be having all the fun, while the poor husband
stays behind _ only to meet Marilyn Monroe on his first night
alone. It's her first New York summer, and she learns to survive it
by putting her ``undies in the ice box,'' finding a neighbor with
air-conditioning and standing over the subway vent while her white
dress is famously blown above her ears.
</P>
<P>
   The husband does his best to remember his vows, and to stay away
from cigarettes and booze, all of which lasts a few hours. In the
1965 ``Paris in the Month of August,'' Charles Aznavour starts out
a happily married summer bachelor and ends up having an affair with
a tourist when the wife and kids are away.
</P>
<P>
   My elevator incident ended happily. Still, I swore then and
there that I'd never spend another summer in the city. But the next
summer I was living in Paris, and my English boss made us mind the
office while she went to St.-Tropez. Those of us left behind shared
one fan and took turns dumping bottles of Evian over one another.
</P>
<P>
   When we were free to roam with the other foreigners around the
airless ghost town of August in Paris, we drank rose as if it were
water till all hours on the Place de la Contrescarpe, had
late-night picnics on the quais of the Seine, found the cinemas
with air-conditioning. Yes, there were worse fates than being
shipwrecked in Paris, and like any group of castaways, we found
comfort in one another's company. We even got used to the sweat; it
was the being left behind that hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The dull pang of knowing the rest of the world was in Provence
or Biarritz. Like the patissier across the way, the next summer I
packed my bags and closed the blinds. I left my Paris apartment for
the month of August and returned Sept. 1 with the first cool
breeze.

DIET PRODUCT MAKER TO PAY $10 MILLION IN REFUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``You can eat what you want and never, ever, ever
have to diet again.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? No, not really, the Federal Trade Commission said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the company making that boast and others aimed
at people who dream of being slimmer had agreed to cease and desist
and to pay $10 million to the people who bought its products, or to
the U.S. Treasury if refunds to buyers are not practical.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Enforma Natural Products of Encino, Calif., made
those assertions on the Internet and in televised commercials. On
Wednesday the company's chief executive, Andrew Grey, said Enforma
was admitting no wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand by our excellent products and are settling this case
to avoid prolonged, costly legal battles,'' Grey said. He said the
federal agency's demand that Enforma refund money to customers was
in line with the company's policy of giving refunds to people who
are not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements in question featured an obviously fit man
with Popeye-like forearms: Steve Garvey, the former major-league
baseball player. Garvey told viewers that Enforma's Exercise in a
Bottle contained a natural enzyme that worked by ``forcing every
cell in your body to work harder whether you're exercising or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Enforma product, Fat Trapper, ``literally traps fat
before it gets into your system,'' Garvey assured viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The two products come in capsule form and together cost about
$35 a month. While admitting no wrong, Enforma agreed not to make
misleading claims in the future and to back up assertions with
evidence.

THE MOVIE THAT CREATED THE `SUMMER MOVIE'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRENCE RAFFERTY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-Five years ago, Steven Spielberg's ``Jaws'' created the
Summer Movie as we know it: the action-heavy ``thrill ride'' sort
of picture, aimed at sensation-hungry younger audiences, which
moves into theaters around Memorial Day and remains there, partying
hard, until the school year starts up again in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaws'' opened on June 20, 1975, and its phenomenal popularity
_ it was the first movie to relieve American audiences of more than
$100 million of their hard-earned money _ helped turn Hollywood
into what is now largely a summer-business town, sort of like
Amity, the New England beach resort where the film's dire events
take place.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the picture today, you might interpret it as a kind of
allegory, in which the business community of Amity, refusing to
close the beaches after a couple of fatal shark attacks, eerily
embodies the ethics and aesthetics of the entertainment industry.
The distributors and exhibitors do not shut down the multiplex even
when they know that something lethal _ a ``Speed 2,'' a
``Godzilla,'' a ``Wild, Wild West'' _ lurks within.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say (as some do) that ``Jaws'' is responsible for
the ``blockbuster mentality'' that has held sway over the major
studios for the past couple of decades. When did Hollywood
(italics)not(end italics) try for blockbusters? You can pin this
rap on any enormously lucrative picture you happen not to like;
just from the decade preceding ``Jaws,'' suspects include ``The
Exorcist,'' ``The French Connection,'' ``Love Story'' and ``The
Sound of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Godfather'' has the alibi of obvious greatness; even if it
were the culprit, not a court in the world would convict it. The
worst you can say about ``Jaws,'' I think, is that its success
suggested, to the beady-eyed studio marketers, a link between the
kind of movie it so spectacularly was and the time of year when it
was released.
</P>
<P>
   When studio executives first saw ``Jaws,'' they must have
reacted like those old cartoon characters whose eyes would pop open
and turn into dollar signs. The movie proposed a solution to a
problem that had been plaguing the suits since the late '60s _ how
to tap into the big ``youth'' market, but reliably. The studios
didn't quite understand the appeal of pictures like ``The
Graduate,'' ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``Easy Rider'' and ``M-A-S-H''
and certainly couldn't replicate it. (For that matter, they
couldn't even figure out how to clone ``Love Story.'')
</P>
<P>
   But ``Jaws'' was, on the face of it, entertainment of a type the
studios knew how to produce. At that time, action pictures were
mostly being marketed to older audiences, but ``Jaws'' showed
Hollywood it could sell action to kids too, with a few adjustments
_ a faster pace, a hipper kind of humor, a stronger sense of horror
and no Charlton Heston. ( Heston had in fact wanted to play the
police chief in ``Jaws,'' but Spielberg wisely rejected him in
favor of Roy Scheider.) And why not release that type of movie in
the summertime, when _ for the middle-class young, at least _ the
livin' is easy?
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the action-youth-summer nexus is a stirring
myth for marketing departments, a Grail legend for MBAs. Ordinary
moviegoers, however _ and especially those over 25 _ tend to view
this achievement as rather a mixed blessing. What if, some pleasant
evening in July, you want to go to the movies, but just don't
(italics)feel(end italics) like a
blow-you-through-the-back-wall-of-the-theater experience? You're
out of luck, and that could make you a tad resentful toward
``Jaws'' and its spawn.
</P>
<P>
   But that feeling should be resisted, because ``Jaws,'' like
``The Godfather,'' is a great film. And it, too, deserves immunity
from prosecution for the crimes of present-day Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In order to grant ``Jaws'' the coveted ``Godfather'' exemption,
though, it may be necessary for film historians and the
higher-minded segment of the film audience to overcome a few
prejudices about genre. ``Jaws'' is, after all, fundamentally a
horror movie. There's a rugged, nautical-adventure component to the
second half of the picture, in which the three main characters _
Police Chief Brody, an icthyologist named Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss)
and the salty old shark-hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) _ roam the
coastal waters in search of the giant homicidal fish.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie has a lot more in common with ``Dracula'' than
with ``Moby-Dick.'' This great white shark is no Great White Whale,
gorging on metaphor; it's a monster, pure and simple, and its sole
purpose is to generate fear.
</P>
<P>
   That's the essence of the horror genre _ in fact, the only way
of defining it that connects supernatural thrillers about ghosts
and vampires with sci-fi monster movies (``The Thing,'' the
``Alien'' series), and also with slasher and serial-killer sagas
(``Halloween,'' ``The Silence of the Lambs'') that don't require
the viewer to believe in occult forces, life after death, the
Devil, or extraterrestrial organisms.
</P>
<P>
   The shark of ``Jaws,'' as conceived by Peter Benchley, the
author of the best-selling 1973 novel, is a natural predator
exaggerated just enough to turn it into an acceptable horror-story
nemesis: it's described as a ``rogue,'' with atypical feeding
patterns that almost suggest a purpose, a malevolent will; and it's
larger than normal, making it, of course, that much harder to kill.
Those are the characteristics requisite to a monster: a whiff of
evil and an aura of invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   And Spielberg, who had successfully attributed those very
qualities to, of all things, a big truck in the television movie
``Duel'' (1971), knew even more than Benchley did about the
mechanics of producing fear. One of the reasons the film is so much
better than the book is that Spielberg is more single-minded in his
dedication to scaring us silly; he eliminated the novel's
distracting subplots, and his editing rhythm is so unsettling that
the audience never gets the chance to relax, even during apparent
lulls and scenes of comic relief. We're always aware of something
awful under the placid surface.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   How much an individual viewer actually enjoys that unremitting
tension is, I suppose, a matter of temperament. What makes a horror
movie more disturbing than other kinds of suspense thrillers and
action movies _ police dramas, say, or the international intrigue
Tom Clancy serves up _ is that the anxiety it generates is
magnified by a sense of helplessness: you're up against a force
that can't be mastered by reason.
</P>
<P>
   Many adults, especially those of the well-educated,
professionally accomplished variety, don't like that feeling one
bit and may complain about having been manipulated by a genuinely
scary movie like ``Jaws.'' (If there's manipulating to be done,
(italics)they're(end italics) going to be the ones to do it.) Those
of us who don't feel quite so masterly are a good deal more
comfortable with the horror experience. Teen-agers get it in a big
way.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after ``Jaws'' opened, Spielberg himself sounded a
little sheepish about what he'd done, almost apologetic about the
film's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very mixed feelings about my work on that picture,'' he
said. ``I saw it again and realized it was the simplest movie I had
ever seen in my life. It was just the essential moving, working
parts of suspense and terror.'' He was unfair to himself. Of the
thousands of suspense-and-terror machines constructed for the
movies in the medium's first century, only a few have made their
``moving, working parts'' function so smoothly. (Even though the
movie's mechanical shark, famously, didn't work very well at all.)
</P>
<P>
   But Spielberg didn't want to be known as, in his words, ``a
shark-and-truck director,'' perhaps in part because, like all young
virtuosos _ he was 28 when ``Jaws'' opened _ he had a tendency to
get bored with his own facility, to undervalue the skills that
other artists would sell their souls for.
</P>
<P>
   And he probably suspected, too, that as a director of horror
movies he would never be taken entirely seriously as a filmmaker
and might even wind up looking faintly disreputable. (The career of
his friend Brian De Palma would, over the next 10 years, provide
confirmation of that suspicion.) Spielberg could have used some of
the magisterial confidence of Alfred Hitchcock, who was always
inordinately proud of ``Psycho'' _ the ``Jaws'' of 1960 _ precisely
(italics)because(end italics) it was the film in which he exercised
the most absolute control over viewers' responses.
</P>
<P>
   The master of suspense wasn't apologetic about creating fear,
because it's a potent emotion, and he was fortunate (or, if you
will, cynical) enough to believe that for a filmmaker no emotion
was better than any other.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock may not have been right about that. The sheer terror
of ``Psycho'' is less complex, and less rewarding for the audience,
than the metaphysical dread that informs ``Vertigo.'' And fear, it
should be said, is potentially more dangerous than many other
emotions: wielded by demagogues and propagandists, it can be hugely
destructive. But it doesn't have to be, and it doesn't have to be
moronically simple, either. ``Jaws'' is the proof.
</P>
<P>
   Although Spielberg's technical prowess is ideally suited to the
horror genre, his temperament really isn't. He brings a rather
sunny outlook to extremely dark material, a contrast that weirdly
enhances the paradox at the center of Benchley's story: the
juxtaposition of summertime fun and sudden, violent death. (In
``Jaws,'' a day at the beach isn't exactly a day at the beach.)
Spielberg doesn't merely juxtapose those elements but seems rather
to unite them; they meet, somehow, at the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   What struck me as I watched ``Jaws'' again recently (there's a
good letterboxed video but no DVD yet) is how much more humor and
beauty Spielberg brings to it than it really needs to be an
effective genre piece. The interplay of the three men in the boat
is often hilarious (think, for example, of the improvised-looking
scene in which they drunkenly compare scars), and even the most
shocking bits of carnage are so elegantly conceived that they have
a sort of perverse wit.
</P>
<P>
   For all the relentless, terrifying momentum ``Jaws'' builds up,
it's an unusually companionable horror picture: it doesn't oppress
viewers with claustrophobic atmosphere or try to wow them with
special effects. As far as I can tell, there isn't a single process
shot in the movie. The ocean and the clear sky are allowed to be
themselves, and so are the three sensibly apprehensive men who move
through this gorgeous setting in search of the beast. ``Jaws''
makes fear look (italics)natural(end italics) _ which of course, it
is. In this picture, we understand terror so well we can even laugh
at it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to denigrate ``Jaws'' by making it sound profound.
This is not the sort of picture that wants the audience to think
too hard. It's a visceral-experience movie, and its distinction, I
believe, is that it's truer to the experience of physical fear than
any other horror movie, before or since. I also wouldn't want to
claim that the film's influence hasn't been a little pernicious.
We'd all give a lot, I'm sure, to have been spared the overbearing
action-and-horror fests of the past 25 summers (including,
prominently, Spielberg's own ``Jaws'' knockoff ``Jurassic Park'').
</P>
<P>
   But it's time to let ``Jaws'' off the hook. Like the great
white, it is what it is, and does what it does with extraordinary
efficiency and power. And so what if most of its descendants have
been terrible? If every summer movie were as good as ``Jaws,'' none
of us would ever get to the beach.

LATIN MARKETS SINK IN NASDAQ'S STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ With the Nasdaq oscillating sharply this
month, Latin America's two principal markets, the Bovespa of Brazil
and the Bolsa of Mexico, have gone along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging markets have always been buffeted by instability in the
United States as anxious investors pull out of what are considered
high-risk positions elsewhere. Because Latin American markets have
been dominated by brick-and-mortar companies, they have usually
been linked to the Dow, not the technology-heavy Nasdaq. This new
relationship has confounded investors, particularly now that the
Brazilian and Mexican economies are booming.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the Nasdaq swing, the Bovespa index has
dropped to 15,446, after rising to a high of 19,046 in March. In
Mexico, the Bolsa index has fallen to 6,751, from a high of 8,417
also in March. Some of the current downward pressure can be
directly linked to the market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Nasdaq euphoria that fueled the markets in the fourth
quarter,'' said David Chon, Latin America equity strategist for
Bear, Stearns. ``After running up significantly, some of the froth
is now coming off of the telecom-media-technology sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the telecommunications sector, which makes up about 50
percent of the Bovespa, has led Brazil's downward trend. The shares
of CRT Cellular, for example, which is controlled by Telefonica de
Espana, fell from a high of 899 reais ($499.20) in March, to 609
reais at Wednesday's close. CRT is one of the cellular companies in
Brazil that plans to start wireless Internet services by June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telecom companies are all earning revenue from the
Internet,'' said Julio Zeigelmann, director of equity funds at
BankBoston Asset Management in Sao Paulo. ``It makes sense that
decreasing optimism in the Internet would affect us locally.'' In
Mexico, Telefonos de Mexico has also taken a hit, closing on
Wednesday at 27.9 pesos ($2.96), 23 percent below its 52-week high
of 36.2 pesos on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But since technology is still a nascent industry in Latin
America, most companies _ including telecommunications concerns,
which are still trying to meet demand for regular fixed-line
service _ are still squarely part of the traditional economy. That
makes for a tenuous connection between Latin American stocks and
the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``This correlation doesn't have much logic,'' said Octavio de
Barros, chief economist of BBV Argentaria in Sao Paulo. ``When the
market realizes that the Bovespa is not linked to the Nasdaq, we
could have a rally.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Latin America companies, and particularly in Brazil, are
undervalued now that stock prices have fallen, with many trading
below book value, according to many analysts. They believe that the
flight to quality that normally occurs during market turbulence
should reverse once the value of Latin American stocks becomes
widely known.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly reports released this week have also animated
investors. On Tuesday, for example, the Mexican cement company
Cemex announced that operating profit rose 22 percent in the first
quarter compared with the similar quarter of 1999, beating
analyst's expectations. The positive news follows impressive
results announced last week by the Brazilian steel company CVRD,
which increased profits 98 percent in the first quarter over the
comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings reports followed positive economic news coming out
of Latin America. Since the Russian debt crisis in 1998 sent
investors running from Latin America and forced Brazil to devalue
its currency, the region has had a quick recovery. Latin America is
expected to grow 3.7 percent this year, up from 0.2 percent last
year, according to estimates from ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has also shown some decline this year. The region
should finish the year with inflation at 6 percent to 8 percent,
compared with 8.8 percent last year. The International Monetary
Fund recently revised its inflation target for Latin America this
year to 7.7 percent from 8.4 percent on strong economic activity
coming out of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Congress has also passed important legislation, the
Fiscal Responsibility Law, which establishes austere spending and
indebtedness limits for the local, state and federal governments.
The Brazilian government has been battling large deficits for
years, and indebtedness was a primary cause of investor uncertainty
in the devaluation last year. The budget deficit now stands at 3.6
percent of the country's gross domestic product, but with the new
law and the economic recovery, the government expects the deficit
to fall to about 2 percent of GDP in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, investment activity, which has been strong this year
because of ties to the United States through the North American
Free Trade Agreement, is expected to slow before the presidential
election on July 2. &QL;

 &HT;    Delete key probably the best defense against junk e-mail
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are times _ lots of them, really _ when I'm over
my head talking about some facet of technology. Things change so
fast and get so complicated that I end up spending a lot of my time
being mystified. But when it comes to junk e-mail, I'm on solid
ground.
</P>
<P>
   I once was a junk-mail king. I spent seven years writing for
mail-order catalogs and putting mailings together. So next time you
open your real-world mailbox and find envelopes telling you that
the ``Smith Family Is Already a Winner'' or that the secret to
consolidating all your credit card bills is inside, curse me.
</P>
<P>
   Junk e-mail is just the modern equivalent of all those mailings
that I worked on so diligently. Both are a major irritant for a lot
of people, and both are almost impossible to stop. I know that junk
e-mail _ spam as it's called _ is becoming an increasingly annoying
problem because I get so many e-mails asking how to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of methods, and we'll sure touch on them
because sometimes it helps to at least try to stop an annoyance
rather than just feel helpless. But the bottom line is that, if you
have an e-mail account, you're going to get junk mail addressed to
you. And a high proportion of this mail will be offensive in some
way. They'll either insult your intelligence with stupid get-rich
offers, or they'll offend your sensibilities with X-rated offers
that are blatant, even in the e-mail itself.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's talk about what not to do. Most junk mail includes
instructions for being removed from future mailing lists. Don't
comply. While some legitimate mailers really will remove you, it's
impossible to know who is legitimate and who isn't. By replying,
you are actually making your e-mail address more valuable to the
e-mailer. It can then be sold as an address that has proven valid
and active. The exception to this rule is if you get an e-mail from
a brand-name company. Then you are probably safe in asking that
your name be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, don't give in to the temptation to write back and chew out
the mailer _ for the same reason you shouldn't ask to be removed
from the list. You'll just increase the chances of even more
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what can you do? Keep in mind my opinion that none of these
techniques will noticeably decrease the amount of junk mail you
get. That's a fact of life. But you can try to discourage specific
mailers. One good way to do that is to write and complain to the
folks at the Internet provider used by the mailer. There are Web
sites such as www.bankes.com/nslookup.htm that will let you look up
the administrators at a site. Just go to the site and follow the
directions to find the names, addresses and even telephone numbers
of the administrators. All that said, be warned that many junk mail
abusers use free and low-rent sites that frankly don't care whether
you're angry or not. But you can try.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet providers also offer software filters that help
remove junk mail. For instance, if you have an EarthLink account,
you can use what that service calls the Spaminator. Other providers
also have similar features, designed to filter out junk mail. So,
write an e-mail to your provider and ask them.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail programs themselves _ Microsoft's Outlook and Eudora's
professional version, or its new free version _ sometimes offer
ways for you to filter the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you can do what I do. Just read the headers and press
the delete key and forget it. The best way to eliminate junk e-mail
is to avoid responding, avoid buying. That's a slower filter but
one that _ if enough people do it _ is guaranteed to solve the
problem.

 &UR; ``THE WORLD'S SHORTEST STORIES OF LOVE AND DEATH'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Steve Moss and John M. Daniel (Running, $7.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We flatter ourselves to think we know something about writing
tight, but we are pikers compared with these people. Granted, there
was self-interest involved. They were embroiled in a contest
sponsored by the San Luis Obispo newspaper ``New Times,'' which
invited readers to submit stories using plot, setting and characte
in fewer than 55 words. First prize included a certificate and a
T-shirt. If ``New Times'' hasn't upped the ante since then, it
doesn't deserve readers like these. Most of the stories are long
(relatively speaking) on dialogue, humor and creative implication,
and short on everything else. It sounds easy, but try it. Here is
``The Britches of Madison County,'' in which author Bill Crown
one-ups Robert James Waller in 37 words: ``Francesca came out on
the porch and welcomed them home, her husband, their son, and
daughter. But her skirt was hung up in the waist of her drawers.
The old man got hip and he shot her.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ORCHID FEVER'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Eric Hansen (Pantheon, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Please do not shy away from this book because its subject is
orchids and you don't know anything about them. Hansen didn't know
anything about them either, until he was hired to guide two orchid
fanatics into the wilds of Borneo in search of the holy grail of
orchids, the Latin name of which we refuse to repea here. Hansen
hired some Borneo natives to provide sherpalike assistance on this
journey, and these simple, jungle-savvy men provide lots of laughs
as they react to the orchid zealots' reasons for sloshing up a
muddy Borneo river with a stockpile of equipment that includes a
camouflaged cardboard toilet. This trip was the author's
introduction to the world of orchids and orchid lovers, which was
far more complex, seductive, competitive and pricey than he ever
imagined. Read all about it in this captivating and often funny
book. (Hansen appeared briefly in a recent ``60 Minutes'' story
about the orchid world. As is almost always the case when media
overlap, the book is better.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``SHRINK YOUR HANDICAP'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Phil Lee and Jeff Warne (Hyperion, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can read this as a means to improve your golf game, or you
can read it for laughs. New &AMP; Notable has no golf game to speak of,
but in search of good suggestions for Father's Day, we read gamely
on, stifling our guffaws. Lee, a psychiatrist, and Warne, a golf
instructor, join forces to explain the mystery of why you play
better when no one is watching. The villain is the dreaded panic
attack syndrome. As Lee says, There are specific swing weaknesses
that are magnets for the chemicals of anxiety. Even the tiniest
amount of anxiety produces chemicals that will feast on certain
specific weaknesses in the swing. Their solutions include a
pre-shot routine that involves entering a light trance, developing
``Insight-Oriented Defenses'' to fight the nasty chemicals and
``uninstalling'' the ``Blame Game,'' or the urge to be angry over
bad shots. They take this very, very seriously, but we could not.
Disguised as psychobabble, even common sense sounds like hooey. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; ``LEFT FOR DEAD'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Beck Weathers (Villard, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The survival of Dallas pathologist Beck Weathers was just about
the only good news to come out of the storm on Mount Everest that
killed nine people in 1996. Left for dead by other climbers, he
suddenly, miraculously stood up and walked through the squall to
the nearest camp. Fellow climber Jon Krakauer (``Into Thin Air'')
comes off well in this version of the day's events. Anatoli
Boukreev, the guide who climbed without oxygen and so was unable to
help his clients descend before the storm hit, does not. Neither
does George W. Bush, who would not help Weathers' family get him
home from Nepal. Less interesting sections about Weathers' youth
and relationship with his wife and family are followed by sobering
descriptions of his recuperation (he lost both hands and his nose
to frostbite). Best of all, he tells of the daring Nepalese pilot
who flew alone, perilously higher than his helicopter was meant to
go, and brought Weathers off of Mount Everest alive.  &QL;

JUSTICES CONSIDER WHETHER HOMOSEXUALS CAN JOIN THE BOY SCOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The question before the Supreme Court on Wednesday
was whether the Boy Scouts have a constitutional right to exclude
gay members, but the justices did not seem particularly interested
in either Boy Scout policy or the future of gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, what clearly concerned the court were the implications
of ruling for one side or the other. If the Boy Scouts cannot
exclude homosexuals, can they still exclude girls, the justices
wanted to know. Would a Jewish social group be forced to accept
non-Jewish members, or a gay organization to include heterosexuals?
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the justices asked, if an organization deems a
particular kind of exclusivity to be central to its identity, must
courts take that assertion at face value? If not, by what standard
are they to judge it? If so, might that not be the equivalent of
giving a free pass from the anti-discrimination commands of civil
rights law?
</P>
<P>
   The questions came thick and fast for the lawyers representing
the Boy Scouts of America and James Dale, who was an Eagle Scout
assistant scoutmaster when his troop in Monmouth County, N.J.,
expelled him 10 years ago, after learning from a newspaper article
that he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts ``specifically forbid membership to
homosexuals,'' he was told. Dale, who as the article reported was
co-president of a student gay rights organization at Rutgers
University, sued under New Jersey's anti-discrimination law, which
includes protection for sexual orientation. Last year the New
Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts are a ``public
accommodation,'' to which the state law applies, and rejected the
argument that the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of
association shielded the Scouts' policy.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' questions on Wednesday reflected their effort to
decide where to slot this case into an array of First Amendment
precedents that offer ammunition to both sides. For example,
several justices asked in different ways whether Dale's termination
reflected the simple fact of his sexual orientation, as opposed to
scouting officials' conclusions that he was engaged in ``public
advocacy,'' as Justice Anthony M. Kennedy put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the message that would go to youth in the
program,'' replied George A. Davidson, the Boy Scouts' lawyer.
``Being openly homosexual communicates the concept that this is
OK,'' he said, adding that ``coming out'' as a gay person, ``in the
culture in which these statements are made, is a statement fraught
with moral meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether being gay inherently conveys a message is
important, given one of the court's precedents, a 1995 decision
that the organizers of Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade had a
First Amendment right to exclude a group of gay marchers. The court
ruled in that case, which the Boy Scouts have cited prominently,
that the organizers did not have to turn their parade over to an
unwanted message, in that instance to an expression of gay pride.
</P>
<P>
   But Dale's lawyer, Evan Wolfson of the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, maintained that what was at issue in Dale's case
was ``identity-based discrimination, the equation of a human being
with an assumed message,'' without reference to anything Dale had
said or done. ``A human being is not speech, other than `I am who I
am,''' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   His assertion that there is no message inherent in Dale's sexual
orientation was an effort to invoke, rather than the case of the
St. Patrick's Day parade, a trio of sex discrimination cases from
the 1980s. In those cases, the court rejected claims that all-male
organizations, including the Jaycees and the Rotary Club, had a
constitutional right to exclude women, with the court noting that
the women simply sought to join and were not trying to change the
essential nature of groups that were organized around
business-networking.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson from those cases, Wolfson said, is that scouting must
show that its own ``expressive purposes in bringing its members
together are significantly burdened'' by a requirement to admit gay
members. The Scouts have failed to meet that test, he said, because
the Boy Scouts are not organized around a principle of opposition
to gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is better qualified to determine the expressive purpose of
the Boy Scouts _ the Boy Scouts or the New Jersey courts?'' Kennedy
said to Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, representing the Scouts, conceded that the policy of
excluding gay members did not appear in the organization's official
manuals. But that makes no difference, he said, noting that ``the
Boy Scouts are so closely identified with traditional moral values
that the phrase `He's a real Boy Scout' has entered the language.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said the policy was based on the Boy Scouts' ``moral
code,'' as expressed in the phrase ``morally straight'' in the
Scout Oath and the word ``clean'' in the Scout Law.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens asked whether the Boy Scouts took the
position that a person who engages in homosexual activity ``cannot
fit that definition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct,'' Davidson replied.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said the Scouts were in an even stronger position
than the organizers of the St. Patrick's Day parade, who won their
case even though, he said, there was ``no readily apparent message
in the parade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have a moral code,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice David H. Souter, who wrote the court's unanimous
opinion in that 1995 case, Hurley vs. Irish American Gay Group of
Boston, disputed Davidson's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in simply drawing a parallel to Hurley,'' Souter
said, ``is that we're not at the point where anyone is proposing to
use the Boy Scouts'' for expressing their own message. Dale wanted
to rejoin scouting and was ``not proposing to carry a banner,'' the
justice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put a banner around his neck when he appeared in the
newspaper,'' Davidson replied. ``He can't take it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, arguing for Dale, said the Boy Scouts, ``one of the
least private public accommodations in the country,'' had not
justified an exclusion from a ``neutral civil rights law of general
applicability.''
</P>
<P>
   Some justices suggested that perhaps none of the court's
precedents was really a good fit for this case. Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor told Wolfson that ``I can well understand'' why public
accommodations law should apply to organizations that have a
commercial purpose, like the Jaycees or the Rotary Club in the
earlier cases. ``But should the weight we give it in the context of
a First Amendment claim be the same for private organizations?''
she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist asked whether members of a
Catholic organization could limit the group to Catholics on the
basis that ``we just feel much more comfortable with Catholics, and
we do Catholic work.'' He asked Wolfson whether, in light of the
Constitution's protection for freedom of association, ``they need a
more expressive message than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson replied that freedom of association did not exist as a
``free-floating right'' but rather was entitled to recognition only
to the extent that it served the ability of an organization's
members to express their message. As simply a free-floating right,
he said, it could be invoked ``as a defense against civil rights
laws that would swallow civil rights laws.''
</P>
<P>
   While most members of the court appeared uncertain of how to
decide this case, Boy Scouts vs. Dale, No. 99-669, Justice Antonin
Scalia left little doubt of his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``To require the Boy Scouts to have as a scoutmaster someone who
embodies a contradiction of their message _ how can that be?''
Scalia asked Wolfson. He said the Constitution ``prevents a state
from diluting or imperiling the message an organization wants to
convey, whether by speech or by dropping a bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision is expected by early summer.

IRAN CLERIC ATTACKS PRESS AS AN ENEMY AGAINST ISLAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ As scattered protests continued against the
abrupt closing of 13 newspapers, the country's most powerful Muslim
cleric weighed in with a vehement attack Wednesday on the
now-silenced liberal press as a deviant force bent on turning the
country against Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The cleric, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader who holds
ultimate political and religious authority, also praised President
Mohammad Khatami, the champion of the reform movement. He denounced
``counterrevolutionaries'' masquerading as reformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revolutionary tendencies should not keep silent in the
face of such realities,'' he said, in a translation provided by the
official Iranian news agency IRNA. But, he added, any crackdown on
reformers should not be considered an attack on Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude is not correct because the president is himself
defender of the system and the revolution,'' he said. ``Moreover, I
strongly support the president.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the ayatollah's attempt to distinguish between Khatami
and his journalistic and political supporters is not likely to
dispel anxiety here over the recent assault on the reformers, who
are poised to take control of Iran's next Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-line Council of Guardians, meanwhile, allayed some
fears by announcing Wednesday that long-delayed runoff elections
for 66 seats in the new 290-member parliament will take place on
May 5.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of voting on Feb. 18, about 70 percent of the
winners were associated with reform parties. Since then the council
has voided the results of 11 races that reformers won and warned
that it would change some of the results from Tehran, where
reformers had captured 29 out of 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning for the second round begins on Thursday, although
the reform movement will be handicapped because most of their
newspapers have been closed in the past four days by the Tehran
courts. Two prominent reform editors were sent to prison on vague
charges of insulting Islam, and a third, who was summoned to appear
in court on Monday, is expected to be jailed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Reform leaders have urged their supporters to avoid actions that
might invite retaliation by the security forces, which are under
the control of the supreme leader. But students in Tehran and a few
provincial cities boycotted classes Wednesday and held on-campus
demonstrations. So far the protests have been peaceful and the
police have not intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open question is how long the country's students and young
people will be patient with what's going on,'' said a Western
diplomat. ``They have proven to be an unpredictable force.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayatollah Khamenei, who owes his position to the clerical
establishment, has recently issued a series of ambiguous statements
about the political situation. Until now, most reform leaders have
said publicly that they believe Ayatollah Khamenei has not taken
sides in the increasingly bitter contest.
</P>
<P>
   At times he has called for national unity and calm. At times he
has called for suppression of any opposition to the conservative
line; last week he proclaimed that ``legal violence'' is justified
against those who challenge the system.
</P>
<P>
   The judiciary, dominated by conservative clerics, partly
justified its closure of reform newspapers by saying they had
displeased the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, courts have also issued arrest warrants for
the liberal academics and clerics who attended a conference on
Iranian democracy in Berlin earlier this month. The moves followed
the broadcast on state television of scenes from the conference,
which featured Iranian exiles criticizing the regime and a
bare-armed woman dancing at a seminar.
</P>
<P>
   The government television answers directly to Ayatollah
Khamenei. Several European diplomats in Tehran said they believed
that the film of the conference had been doctored to show some of
the moderate Iranian clerics and journalists watching calmly as the
woman gyrated. Most participants have said they were not in the
room at the time of the dance.
</P>
<P>
   The supreme leader's speech Wednesday was typically two-edged.
He urged the warring political camps to end their sniping,
condemned unnamed reformers, declared himself amenable to open
political debate in the press and made a gesture to Iran's legions
of unemployed by criticizing Khatami's economic policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Say this for ``Where the Heart Is'': With child abuse, battered
women, alcoholism, a tornado and dismemberment by railroad car,
matters are rarely dull here. Set in an Oklahoma town where life
never seems to be OK (where's Gordon MacRae when you need him?),
the movie has a lifetime of tragedy but nary a moment of
authenticity rolled up into its two-hour running time.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is based on Billie Letts' 1996 bestseller about
17-year-old Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman), a young woman who has
``never lived any place that didn't have wheels under it.'' Novalee
is very pregnant when we first meet her and about to embark on a
cross-country move with her good-looking, shifty boyfriend, Willie
Jack (Dylan Bruno). When the two stop at an Oklahoma Wal-Mart,
Willie Jack has second thoughts about fatherhood and drives off,
leaving Novalee to fend for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Fend, she does. Novalee finds that a Wal-Mart has everything a
young girl needs _ except a doctor when her water breaks. Thus
after living in the store's camping section and shopping its food
aisles for sustenance, Novalee is whisked off to the hospital where
she gives birth to the ``Wal-Mart'' baby and becomes a tabloid
heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Novalee's fame is short-lived, but it does bring her a surrogate
family in the form of an eccentric do-gooder (Stockard Channing)
and a single-mother nurse, Lexie, (Ashley Judd, as appealing as
ever). The film quickly evolves into a coming-of-age story as we
watch Novalee mature from anuneducated teen-ager to an accomplished
young woman, able to take care of others as well as herself.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is sweet-natured enough, but when its litany of
tragedies demands a tougher tone, the script (by Ron Howard
veterans Lowell Ganzand Babaloo Mandel) fails to deliver the
much-needed veracity. And Portman, one of the screen's most
polished young performers, isn't entirely believable playing an
uncertain young woman. This is an actresswhose dominant quality is
self-awareness, and Novalee is nothing if not oblivious in the
first third of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Portman, Judd and Channing all deliver sympathetic performances,
and James Frain is likable as Novalee's shy, librarian suitor. The
movie occasionally goes back to the Willie Jack character, an
aspiring country singer who hooks up with a no-nonsense Nashville
manager (Joan Cusack in an amusing comic turn). That Willie Jack
will get his come-uppance is a given, as are most of the events in
this amiable film. Predictability seems to go hand in hand with
misfortune here.

THROWING OUR ANXIETIES TO THE LIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The excavation of Rome continues. Not the physical Rome _
imperial city of marble monuments, stone quarry for later Romes
built atop the early ones. Rather, work has resumed on the symbolic
Rome, the Christian emblem of cruelty and intrigue, vanity and
lust, corruption and damnation.
</P>
<P>
   Real digs are supervised by archaeologists. The symbolic one has
long been directed by Hollywood and its corps of experts in the
uncovering of desires and fears.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, ``Gladiator,'' directed by Ridley Scott, resumes the
dig for sunken metaphors on a scale not seen since the late 1950s
and early 1960s, when audiences lined up for two-part spectaculars
like William Wyler's ``Ben-Hur,'' Joseph L. Mankiewicz's
``Cleopatra'' and Stanley Kubrick's ``Spartacus.'' In the spirit of
these legendary epics, ``Gladiator'' is an allegory of its own
time. The first Roman cinema spectacular to be made by Hollywood
since the end of the cold war, it is a meditation on the perplexity
of the world's sole surviving superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Quo vadis? Where does America go from here? After expansion,
implosion _ this is the diagnosis set forth by ``Gladiator'' in
period costume. After all the world has been conquered, Rome splits
apart under mounting pressure from the forces of Good and Evil _
republican heroes and tyrannical knaves. The populace, meanwhile,
is regaled by Hollywood spectaculars staged in the grand new
Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects grow ever more dazzling and surreal.
Christians are thrown to lions. The arena is flooded for naval
battles. Caesar puts on a Yankee cap. The crowd screams for more.
</P>
<P>
   Why revive this genre of movie now? DreamWorks, the movie's
producer, boasts of special effects made possible by computer
imaging techniques. Rome can be built in a day. Just run some
paintings by Cole, David and Alma-Tadema through the scanner, et
voila! Better yet, feed ``Ben-Hur'' and ``Spartacus'' through the
computer, in their entirety. Morph well, reheat, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Ours is an era of remakes and postmodern simulations. The
technology makes it easier to recycle familiar images. The
Colosseum, the White House, the intergalactic spaceship, the
skyline, the ghetto, the corporate headquarters: whether computer-
or carpenter-generated, these settings are features in a symbolic
landscape in which a fragmented society can participate in the myth
of a common culture.
</P>
<P>
   Some have found it difficult to identify with this myth as
rendered by the Roman spectaculars of the postwar years.
``Ben-Hur,'' for example, was not a reassuring experience for many
American Jews, who had to reckon with anti-Semitism in that era.
Shifting the anti-Semitism from American WASPs to ancient Romans
did not dull the pain of living in the world of ``Gentlemen's
Agreement,'' the restricted neighborhood, the whispered slur, the
secret quota. Nor was it reassuring that Ben-Hur was Jewish, given
that his redemption was contingent on his becoming a follower of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Wyler's ``Tale of the Christ,'' as ``Ben-Hur'' was subtitled, is
worth keeping in mind as we witness the construction of another
hero myth: the legend of ``The Greatest Generation,'' to borrow the
title of Tom Brokaw's recent best-selling book. There's no reason
to doubt the courage and sacrifice shown by the Americans who
struggled through the Depression and World War II. The story of
these gladiators holds a powerfully inspiring message for our
vastly more self-indulgent times.
</P>
<P>
   But to complete the record, another story must be told: the
story of what it was like to grow up as a child of the greatest
generation. What was it like to grow up in the early years of the
Cold War, beneath the shadow of the bomb? What was it like for the
children who went to the Roman spectacles of those years, before
television brought images of warfare into the nuclear family home?
</P>
<P>
   Dad has a high-paying job in the military-industrial complex. By
day, he works to develop the hardware for guided missiles. At
night, he comes to an authentic colonial home with flame-shaped
light bulbs. This setting helps soothe the trauma caused by
atrocities overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Mom is back in the kitchen, doing her best to follow a cheerful
script about marriage and family life. Her chipper moods are
periodically interrupted by hushed-up stays at rest homes. Dad
sighs a lot and loses his temper. Princess is already exhibiting
the first signs of bulimia. Young Butch, meanwhile, is growing up
queer and has taken to spending afternoons at blood-soaked Steve
Reeves movies in preparation for the day when he starts a career as
a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, it turns out, is following a script of normalcy. In
situations not covered by the script, nobody knows what to say. And
with early adolescence comes a need to break out of the script.
Hormones raging, Butch begins to sense that there's something not
normal about his angle on the world. It is at this point, age 12,
that Butch discovers Downtown. He makes the discovery when the
entire family dresses up one Saturday and goes to a reserved-seat
first-run showing of ``Ben-Hur.''
</P>
<P>
   But the movie turned out to be a sideshow compared with the city
itself. Streets, crowds, theater marquees, shop windows _ all
composed themselves into a place where any kind of script could be
written. ``Ben-Hur'' was a childhood event. The city beckoned
toward adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The release of ``Gladiator'' happens to coincide with another
Roman spectacular. For Holy Year, celebrated by Roman Catholics
every quarter century, the Eternal City has put on its finest
clothes. For the rest of 2000, Rome will be a destination for
faithful pilgrims and tourists alike. Even less than ordinarily a
place for daily living, the city is transformed into a symbol of
itself. It is a Christian epic, an architectural drama.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Roman monuments, like the Colosseum and the recently
reopened remains of Nero's Golden House, portray the pagan era at
its most wanton. The pilgrimage route, seven churches visited by
the pious, forms an avenue of redemption. Baroque Rome, the
creation of Sixtus V, is the Church Triumphant, the victory of
virtue over sin.
</P>
<P>
   If you must choose only one spectacle this year, go to Rome.
There, you'll have the opportunity to see the ingredient that the
cinematic versions tend to overlook. Rome is an Italian city,
populated by Italian people living rich, Italian lives. Romans,
like others, have been living with lust and guilt for thousands of
years, and they learned long ago the wisdom of turning hypocrisy
into art.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sistine Chapel, you behold a ceiling full of coiling
erotic figures. The pleasures and sins of the flesh are two parts
of one organic system. They coil round and round like the columns
in the baldacchino Bernini fashioned for St. Peter's (with bronze
stripped from the ancient Pantheon).
</P>
<P>
   If you go, please pay special attention to the confessionals.
Non-Catholics have an image, reinforced by movies and television,
of the confessional as a hidden place shrouded in deep shadow,
where people sneak in when no one is looking. In Italian churches,
confessionals are as conspicuous as video arcades. Made of dark
wood, with ornate pediments, they stand out against white walls.
Even their interiors offer no place to hide. There's lighting, and
the occupants may not even bother to pull the little
voting-booth-style curtain.
</P>
<P>
   If you read lips and speak Italian, there's a good chance you'll
know all. But the design alone tells you that these are major
fixtures of liturgical technology. Machines for converting vice
into virtue, they relieve the conscience of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The postwar Roman epics were sprawling adventures in hypocrisy:
moral tales that allowed audiences to indulge vicariously in
pull-out-the-stops orgies. Lavish sets and wardrobes, bloodshed,
dissolution, stars, money, nastiness, and flesh. Still, despite the
Roman settings and violent plots, the epics actually depict the
moral climate in the Age of Eisenhower, when the tyranny of
normalcy ruled the cultural landscape. You can imagine how
displaced Butch felt.
</P>
<P>
   The DreamWorks revival of this campy entertainment genre
reflects, in part, the New Normalcy of our time. The glorification
of the Greatest Generation is part of this phenomenon. So is the
oxymoronically named New Urbanism movement, with its compact
suburban subdivisions and houses fabricated from Cheez Whiz.
Unfortunately, we have yet to perfect a way of managing hypocrisy
with the Italian flair. In fact, we are now dismantling the system
that went far toward accommodating diversity and complexity in the
postwar years: the symbiotic relationship between squeaky-clean
suburbs and torrid Cities of the Plain.
</P>
<P>
   All grown up, Butch drifts downward into the arena of his mind,
through the broken pieces of his private archaeology. He dreams
back to a time before Playgirl centerfolds, Chippendale dancers,
Calvin Klein underwear ads and RuPaul, back, back before Richard
Nixon lost an election because his face was a national eyesore,
back to a time when the American moral fiber was held together by
the strict segregation of men and women into acting subjects and
passive objects.
</P>
<P>
   In this divided landscape of rigid role assignment, the postwar
he-man was a transgressive figure. The plot required him to be
admired for the virtues of his actions. Casting and costume design,
meanwhile, ensured that action took a distant second place to his
role as an object of desire. The discreetly placed towel, the
concealing shadow or the loincloth professionally distressed to be
peek-a-boo threadbare _ fittings, fittings _ were the only
concessions to virtue that actually created a stir.
</P>
<P>
   They exploded the modesty that they were supposed to represent.
Thus clad, the male action figure insinuated himself into the mind
as the embodiment of a conflict between violence and sex.
</P>
<P>
   By 1960, Butch is spending so much time downtown he might as
well buy a commuter ticket. His parents don't approve of this,
suspecting that sex is somehow involved. This is true only in a
voyeuristic sense. Butch is actually pursuing what Auden called the
Vision of Eros. By this, the poet referred not to physical pleasure
as such, but to a world in which intolerance does not inhibit the
natural desire to give love and receive it. Butch has this vision
in the hypnotic rhythm of the streets.
</P>
<P>
   But by age 8, without understanding what they are, Butch has
developed erotic feelings for sailing instructors, lifeguards and
other athletic types. He also knows that it's not safe to act out
these emotions. Even the wrong kind of look could land him in a
hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, however, the male physique presents itself to be
admired by anyone who buys a ticket, along with biblical trappings
or the aura of classical myth. Downtown represents freedom to be
aroused without even the need to acknowledge what's really going
on. These pictures are, after all, family entertainment, or, in the
case of Steve Reeves vehicles, kiddie matinees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is also a place where theater and movies present stories
nearly as twisted as Butch's mind. What was ``The Roman Spring of
Stone'' actually about? A passive gladiator who wins the fight
without moving a muscle. Gore Vidal has told the story about
persuading Stephen Boyd, in the role of Ben-Hur's boyhood friend,
to play a pivotal scene with Charlton Heston as if the two had once
been lovers. Heston is not to be let in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Spartacus,'' Tony Curtis and Laurence Olivier discuss
sexual preferences in culinary terms. Oysters or eels. Even
downtown, some loves don't want to speak their names.
</P>
<P>
   Butch ought to know that the regime of normalcy is itself a
historical abnormality. He's read two novels by Mary Renault. He
knows that Catullus, not Charlton Heston, is the representative
figure of ancient Rome. Even in the Roman spectaculars of the '20s
and '30s, images of men were more explicitly erotic.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, postwar normalcy is the abnormality Butch must
learn to live with. Somewhere in the background, a presidential
aide is arrested at a Washington YMCA. In ``Advise and Consent,'' a
senator commits suicide when a political adversary threatens to
expose a youthful fling. A radio host is saying, ``I wouldn't want
the plane I'm flying on to be piloted by someone who had those kind
of thoughts on his mind!''
</P>
<P>
   By now Butch is at war within himself. If there is any
possibility of escaping normalcy, it lies downtown. But the child
wouldn't have a roof over his head if Dad weren't busy designing
gyroscopes to guide weapons of mass destruction. The Urban and
Suburban conditions are a duality that won't let Butch go. His
drives take a turn toward Thanatos. He begins to have fantasies
about what Charlton Heston would look like without a head.
</P>
<P>
   Parents will want to know if ``Gladiator'' is too violent for
children. No and yes. The movie's special effects are so prominent,
and the action so highly aestheticized by art direction, that the
bloodshed registers mainly as operatic mise en scene. Some veil of
snow is always falling, some gossamer drapery is always rippling,
the wind is always rustling in octoplasmic sound. But there's a
horrible scene in which the Gladiator, played by Russell Crowe,
cuts an insignia from his flesh. And the hero does make a living
decapitating people. We are not spared the graphic details.
</P>
<P>
   The gore, however, is used to illustrate that the character is a
true-blue postwar suburbanite at heart. The dying Caesar, played by
Richard Harris, begs him to go to Rome to become the city's
protector, but the Gladiator dreads going to that cesspool. He has
thoughts only of his farm in the hills, where the wife and kid wait
to greet him at the gates. You've never seen such dreamy rows of
poplars. Welcome home, Joe. The lawn needs mowing. But when Caesar
expires, decadent Romans intervene, and blow the American dream to
smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   In actuality, the post-cold-war implosion has produced the
opposite effect: a revival of normalcy on a scale not seen since
Ike and Mamie's day. In contrast to Ike and Mamie's day, however,
the regime of normalcy now focuses its energies on the urban
centers as well as the American Dreamland outside them.
</P>
<P>
   This is evident not only in the actions of the city's Caesarian
protectors _ police crackdowns, curbs on First Amendment rights,
the notion that pasties are required for reasons of public health _
but also in the increasing saturation of urban life with suburban
values: chain stores, theme restaurants, festival marketplaces,
ersatz period architecture, and even cultural events that purport
to challenge norms.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ``Sensation'' show at the Brooklyn Museum of Art,
for instance, offered a Disneyfied idea of provocation _ a Shock
Mall. No wonder it received a PTA-style response.
</P>
<P>
   Quo vadis, indeed. ``The Matrix,'' last year's Oscar winner for
special effects, proposed one answer that lingers in the mind. In
this futurist gladiatorial spectacle, we all live in a
maximum-security prison. We are held there by the illusion that the
year is 1999 and all is normal. Implosion is permanently implanted
in our brains. The erotic is harnessed in the service of machines.
Neo, the movie's high-tech hero, wants to make the world safe for
that cosmic abnormality called life. Thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   Butch dozes off again. He dreams of the ideal city: no street
crime, no homeless people, no squeegie men. The trains run on time.
Great special effects. Triumphal arches and surveillance cameras
stretch as far as the eye can see. A decadent democracy has been
reformed. Libido has been suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs down.

COURT SUPPORT AMGEN'S PATENT CLAIM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amgen won an early round on Wednesday in a
high-stakes lawsuit in which it is trying to protect its leading
drug from competition.
</P>
<P>
   In a pretrial hearing, a federal judge in Boston ruled that
Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis had infringed on one Amgen
patent covering erythropoietin, or EPO, an anemia drug used for
patients undergoing kidney dialysis or chemotherapy for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts differed on how significant a victory this was for
Amgen because the trial will proceed, with Aventis and
Transkaryotic, known as TKT, having a chance to prove that Amgen's
patents are invalid. Still, shares of Amgen jumped $2.9375, to
$57.25, a gain of 5.4 percent, on more than twice the normal
trading volume. TKT fell $4.125, or 17 percent, to $28.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first but important step in the final determination
of Amgen's claims,'' Gordon M. Binder, Amgen's chairman and chief
executive, said in a statement. But TKT said in a statement that it
was too early to predict the outcome and that it remained
confident.
</P>
<P>
   TKT, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Mass., has developed
a way of producing EPO that it contends does not infringe the
patents held by Amgen. If it wins the case, it and Aventis, the
European company that is its partner, would be able to compete for
part of the estimated $4 billion in annual EPO sales, most of which
is now split between Amgen and its licensee, Johnson &AMP; Johnson. TKT
might also be able to use its technique to make its own versions of
other lucrative drugs now produced by Amgen and other biotechnology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen, the nation's largest biotechnology company, uses
conventional gene-splicing, in which it clones the human gene
governing EPO production and puts it in hamster cells, which are
then grown in culture to produce the drug. TKT's technique is to
turn on the EPO gene that is present in all human cells but is
usually dormant. It then grows human cells in a culture to produce
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Federal District Judge William G. Young of Boston said on
Wednesday that TKT and Aventis had infringed a patent claim
covering pharmaceutical composition containing human EPO grown in
mammalian cells in culture. But he denied motions for similar
rulings on two other patent claims, deferring them until the trial.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the ruling is not surprising. One of TKT's major
contentions is that Amgen's patent claims are overly broad and
should not extend to human cells. Judge Young's ruling was more on
the literal meaning of the patent claims. He can address whether
the claims are overly broad in the trial itself, which is scheduled
to start on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was Amgen's best shot,'' said Jonas V. Alsenas, an
analyst with ING Barings, who believes TKT will win.
</P>
<P>
   But Elise Wang, an analyst at PaineWebber, said the ruling
provided ``a significant advantage for Amgen now going into the
trial.'' Instead of having to prove TKT infringed, she said, Amgen
will now only have to defend the validity of its patents. The
burden of proof, she said, has now shifted solely to TKT and
Aventis. &QL;

THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR THE ANGLO-IRISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Deborah Warner's historical drama introduces us to the
end of the world of the Anglo-Irish, aristocrats who dominated
Ireland until the country's early 20th-century war for independence
from England. It takes place at the estate of Sir Richard Naylor
(Michael Gambon) and his wife, Lady Myra (Maggie Smith), who
continue to entertain guests and host lawn-tennis matches even as
violence escalates around them. They're not so much ignoring the
war as defying it, which is easy to do because there is little
evidence around them, aside from the British soldiers who stand
sentry near their country home.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people staying there are Sir Richard's 19-year-old
niece, Lois (Keeley Hawes), who is almost blissfully naive about
the war. She sees it as an opportunity to dance and flirt with the
soldiers, and understandably attracts the romantic attention of an
earnest British captain (David Tennant). Just as understandably,
she's drawn to the more dangerous and exciting rebel Peter Connolly
(Gary Lydon), who provides an opportunity for a sexual awakening _
and an opening to an almost inevitable family.
</P>
<P>
   Warner and screenwriter John Banville fashioned ``The Last
September'' from an Elizabeth Bowen novel, and the film retains the
literary qualities, unfolding and building upon itself much like a
book, but also taking its time. Despite the methodical approach,
the film is a bit top-heavy with characters, and demands attention
until Lois' story emerges as its focal point. Hawes, whose
apple-cheeked features make her ideal for the kind of ingenue we
don't see much anymore, makes us empathize with Lois, and Slawomir
Idziak's elegiac cinematography suits the film's melancholia. The
film's slowness is a minor drawback, but it offers rewards for
patient viewers. &QL;

COCHRAN PLANS SUIT ON BEHALF OF SLAIN POLICEMAN'S MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON AND TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ In a move that raises the stakes in the
racially &UR;  &LR; charged shooting death of police Sgt. Cornel Young,
Johnnie Cochran Jr., the O.J. Simpson lawyer, and his legal ``Dream
Team'' say they plan to file a wrongful death and civil rights
lawsuit seeking $20 million on behalf of the victim's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking the first step on a journey, hopefully a journey
for justice,'' said Cochran during a news conference at Allen
A.M.E. Church here. ``Healing will only begin when you have true
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said his high-profile team is working with the US
Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which is itself
launching an investigation into the Providence police department.
</P>
<P>
   The development brought cheers among the city's black leaders,
who said they are convinced that the Cochran group will raise the
stakes in the case, flushing out more details about the incident _
and, perhaps, forcing Providence into a more searching discussion
of race.
</P>
<P>
   But other city leaders, mindful of the media circus that
surrounded the Simpson case, said they fear that Cochran will play
a more divisive role, just as poeple are trying to put the case in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed in Ms. Young, in her choice of lawyers,''
said Michael Marcoccio, head of Providence Fraternal Order of
Police. ``She has the right to sue, but Cochran and his grand stand
act will only further divide the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Rev. Marlowe V.N. Washington, a member of the Rhode
Island Ministerial Alliance, defended Young's decision to pursue
the sought-after lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not O.J. Simpson's legal team, but this is Leisa
Young's legal team,'' said Washington. ``They have come to assist a
grieving mother who lost her one and only son.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week a Rhode Island grand jury cleared Patrolmen Carlos A.
Saraiva and Michael Solitro III of criminal wrongdoing in the
shooting death of Young. The Providence officers apparently mistook
Young, a black man in civilian clothing, for an armed suspect at a
late-night restaurant on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Young was off duty when he drew his gun to help the two
officers, who were confronting an armed suspect during a fight
outside The Fidas diner. The two officers said they didn't
recognize Young and when he didn't drop his weapon, they shot him.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Young's father, Major Cornel Young Sr., is the highest
ranking officer in the department. It is unclear if Young Sr.,
divorced from hiw wife and who could not be reached for comment,
supported the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Vincent A. Cianci said he had begun to meet with The Rev.
Eugene Rivers of Boston and local city and religious leaders to
discuss what could be done to improve relations between the police
and minority community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were starting to heal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Leisa Young said she had begun to lose faith after
government officials were unable to tell her what happened on the
night of son's death. She said she needed a powerful person to help
in her quest for justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't heal unless you know what is wrong,'' she said. ``I
can't let this go until I found out what happened to my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran and his associate, Peter J. Neufeld, joined Robert B.
Mann, a local laweyr, in filing a claim Wednesday with the city
council. The notice argued the ``actions of Providence police
caused the wrongful death of Cornel Young Jr., interfered in his
family relationship and deprived him and his family members of
their federal and state constitutional rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said the case, which has been the talk of Providence for
months, is not about money but about making ``the streets of
Providence safer for all citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Young contacted Cochran and Barry Scheck, who both defended O.J.
Simpson on murder charges, months ago, after she felt she couldn't
get answers from city and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just realized how unprepared I was to fight this battle
alone,'' said Young. ``I knew of their reputation and I thought
they didn't live here so they wouldn't have to worry about the
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Cianci said he would be willing to meet with
Cochran and his legal team as well as Young to try to bring about a
resolution, but Cochran said it may be too late for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran has taken on a number of racially charged cases,
including the case of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant assulted
by three white police officers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law School Professor Charles Ogletree said that Cochran
was probably drawn to the Young case because of the potential to
affect how the city's police force operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will turn that whole department on its head,'' said
Ogletree. ``You will see a different level of training... on how to
use firearms. It will be a wake-up call to Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Charles Walton (D-Providence) contends the arrival of
Cochran team is just another chapter in a sad, ongoing saga.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had one small section of closure with the grand jury
decision,'' said Watson. ``That didn't close everything.''

A PIPE FITTER`S WRENCH OF HER OWN
</HEADLINE>
 By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It used to take Nannette Cooper about an hour every
morning to curl her hair, put on foundation, eye shadow and
lipstick and pick out just the right business suit and three-inch
heels for her job as a hotel manager in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it takes her all of five minutes _ showering, throwing on
jeans and a T-shirt, tying her hair in a ponytail and lacing up her
steel-toed boots.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, 39, is now a construction worker who has her sights set
on becoming a premier pipe fitter and welder, maybe at a nuclear
plant.
</P>
<P>
   True, it is hard for the 5-foot-2, 125-pound blonde to hide her
female frame, even in baggy pants, from her co-workers, mostly men.
And she isn't crazy about their habits of spitting constantly and
answering nature's call under the open sky. (She uses the portable
toilet and has ``gotten so that I can go once a day and be OK with
it,'' she said.)
</P>
<P>
   But none of that really matters. ``I've been working toward this
for 20 years,'' said Cooper, who is in her third year of a
full-time apprenticeship. Her latest gig is at Ashland Chemical in
Bartow, Fla., where she is actually fitting pipe on her own. That
entails following blueprints and placing pipe pieces together like
a jigsaw puzzle and passing them along to a welder who attaches the
pieces together with a gizmo called a stinger.
</P>
<P>
   When she utters the word ``stinger,'' her eyes light up with the
memory of her father's use of the instrument in her hometown of
Ferron, Utah. As a child, she said, she spent hours hanging out
with him as he welded farming equipment and trailer parts for
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But in high school, her teachers discouraged her from pursuing a
welding career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked to take the welding or shop classes, they said it
wasn't for girls,'' she said. So, she took courses like shorthand
and typing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated it, but I figured you just have to follow the rules,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she is breaking the rules. That has become a lot easier in
the current tight labor market, of course, in which job hopping has
become common and many people are challenging established
assumptions in traditional industries and switching careers in
their late 30s, 40s and even 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Few are making such a drastic shift as Cooper. But women are
invading former male strongholds. Though they still account for
only 2.5 percent of construction workers, for example, their
numbers in that industry soared last year by nearly 30 percent, to
145,000 from 112,000 the previous year, according to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is movement among women to join the trades, no question
about it, but it's very, very slow,'' said Ray Hilgert, professor
of management and industrial relations at Washington University in
St. Louis. ``In the construction industry, there is still a lot of
hostility toward women. There's a lot of tokenism that goes on. You
see highway projects and the women are usually out there holding
directional stop and go signs.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does Hilgert see Cooper's future? ``If she can make it,''
he quipped, ``she can be the Jackie Robinson of the pipe-fitting
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The analogy might be extreme, but Cooper has come a long way. In
the small Mormon community where she grew up, women were supposed
to be ``family oriented'' and were encouraged, if they chose a
career at all, to become bank tellers or teachers. She did not
disappoint. She married at age 18 and within four years had two
children. Her husband, Rodney, was a construction worker
specializing in electrical work, and the family traveled from
construction site to construction site. The temporary jobs she took
_ as waitress, administrative assistant and gymnastics coach _ were
all indoors. In Tampa, she spent 10 years in hotel management,
first running Shoney's Inn and then a Quality Suites.
</P>
<P>
   But the 80-hour weeks left her no time for her family, and in
1997 she realized it was time to get out when she learned, only by
reading the local newspaper, that her son had been chosen his
soccer team's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly, she applied for the apprenticeship program at the
plumbers' and pipe fitters' local of the AFL-CIO in Tampa. At first
she thought she had botched the interview; she showed up in a suit
and heels, while the 30 other applicants, all men, were in jeans
and T-shirts. Then, the interviewer tried to discourage her. ``You
know this is heavy work,'' he told her. ``You're going to get
sweaty.'' She said she didn't care. A week later, she was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Her first job was lugging tools and water kegs. After her first
day, she remembers going home, taking off her boots and thinking:
``I love it.'' Since then, she has been working for a local
contractor, doing a variety of jobs. She also takes plumbing and
pipe-fitting classes every Tuesday and Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she relishes the extra time she can spend with her
children, now 19 and 17, and her husband, who encouraged her to
change careers. And though money is tight _ she makes roughly half
her hotel manager's salary _ she takes comfort in her expectation
of future pay in the range of $60,000 to $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cooper calls herself a feminist, but she warns women that
construction work is not for the faint of heart. Aside from the
heavy lifting, she is required to read blueprints and calculate how
to align pipes that will be connected to 55,000-gallon chemical
tanks and the like. Even a mistake by one-sixteenth inch can botch
the job, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the work environment, which includes not only
spitting and public urinating but lots of whistling at passing
women and the occasional dirty joke. ``It's a whole different
culture,'' Cooper said. ``You just have to get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, her fellow workers and foremen have gone out
of their way to teach her the ropes, and one of them usually walks
her to her car after work.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's dream is to reach the top of her profession and work at
a nuclear plant, where the art of pipe fitting plays a critical
role in containing radiation. Her ultimate goal is to work side by
side with her son Rodney Jr., 19, who is in his first year as a
pipe-fitting apprentice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing glamorous at all about the job,'' Cooper said.
But, she added: ``When you finish a job, you can forever drive by
and feel good you helped complete it.''

VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN TEXAS PRISONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) An inmate brawl at a West Texas prison on Tuesday that
left one prisoner dead and 31 injured was the sixth violent
incident at a state prison this year, underscoring an escalating
spiral of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice reveal
that incidents of violence in Texas prisons have increased more
than 10-fold within the past decade, from 1,434 in 1990 to 14,669
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That increase has outstripped the increase in inmate population
during that same period. The number of inmates has gone from 49,209
in 1990 to 148,734, in 1999, a three-fold increase.
</P>
<P>
   Both prison officials and guards, while differing on other
issues, agree that today's inmates are younger and more prone to
violence than prisoners of past years. Beyond that, however, they
differ over how badly the institutions are understaffed.
</P>
<P>
   The fight at the medium- to minimum-security unit near Lamesa
Tuesday came as prison officials were auditing their corrections
staffing and guards were demanding pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   The fight involved about 300 black and Hispanic prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The dead inmate was identified as Fernando Trejo, 24. Trejo was
serving a five-year sentence for burglary from Cameron County.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Larry Todd said the brawl was sparked by racial
tensions that erupted over an incident in the dining room at lunch,
when a black inmate began fondling himself in front of a female
corrections officer. Todd said a Hispanic prisoner attacked the
black prisoner with a water pitcher and the two were removed.
</P>
<P>
   Other prisoners began taking sides, however, and the
disagreement spilled over into the work area where the fight began.
Inmates broke into a storage shed and armed themselves with garden
tools. The disturbance was quelled after about five hours and the
unit was placed on lockdown.
</P>
<P>
   While the slayer has not been identified, ``We are making good
progress on finding the inmate who killed Trejo,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   One guard received minor injuries when a pepper gas grenade
exploded in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred as prison guards were demanding that the
state Legislature hold a special session and raise their wages. The
guards, who want an average salary of $34,000 per year, contend
that prisons are dangerously understaffed, in part, because of the
low pay. Guards currently earn their peak pay of $26,724 a year
after 21 months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Todd said the Lamesa unit, which has a capacity of 1,342 inmates
and currently houses 1,322, is budgeted for 422 guards and has 392
employed there at present.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not understaffed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates there are not considered security risks, though many
of them may have committed violent crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is the same as it's been for some time now,'' Todd
said. ``Throughout the whole system we have younger, tougher
inmates. They're serving longer sentences and have less to lose and
they're more prone to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Olsen, deputy director of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees, the union that represents
corrections officers, differed only on one point with Todd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it does have to do with younger, more violent
criminals,'' Olsen said. ``But some of it has to do with
understaffing as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the prisons remain short-staffed, we're looking at
some serious danger to corrections officers and to the prisoners
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen said there are between 25,000 and 30,000 guards monitoring
about 150,000 inmates on a 24-hour basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean all those guards are out on the floor,'' he
said. ``A number of them are in offices and, by the time you spread
the others out over three shifts it boils down to one guard to
almost 100 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't see a pay raise soon, there's going to be a mass
exodus from those jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight at Lamesa came on the heels of an incident at the
Connally Unit in Kenedy Sunday in which two prisoners stabbed
another prisoner. The motive for the assault was not known and the
injured prisoner was in stable condition at a San Antonio hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, a nurse at the infirmary of the Hughes Unit near
Gatesville was attacked, beaten and threatened with scissors by an
inmate.
</P>
<P>
   On April 13, an inmate held a guard hostage for seven hours at
the William P. Clements Unit in Amarillo before releasing him,
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar incident on Feb. 21 two inmates held a guard
hostage for 13 hours at the Terrell Unit in Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 15, a guard in Huntsville was stabbed with a pencil.

THE ULTIMATE TRADING PLACES PLOT: ME FOR MYSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest favor this movie does for us is resurrecting the
wonderfully solipsistic Joan Armatrading song from which the movie
borrows its title. Great tune, but unfortunately, a better song of
choice might have been ``Deja Vu,'' because the movie suffers from
a familiarity that's inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that will stop some people from connecting with this
Australian romantic comedy, in which single, thirtysomething
journalist Pamela Drury (Rachel Griffiths) ruminates over what
might have happened had she married the high-school sweetheart she
turned down. She gets a chance to find out when, through a bizarre
turn of events, she meets her alter-ego _ who did marry the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela One and Pamela Two swap places, much to the befuddled
delight of husband Robert (David Roberts), who is pleasantly
surprised to find that the mother of his three children has a
renewed vigor and sex drive. That wanes, however, when Pamela
discovers that being a mom involves messes such as young children
with poor bathroom habits and that dreamboat Robert isn't the man
she thought he would be.
</P>
<P>
   Director Pip Karmel, who filmed in Sydney but steered clear of
the self-conscious eccentricity of many recent Australian films, is
primarily interested in illustrating the futility of regret. She's
right to use Griffiths, who brings a sort of perplexed and bemused
gravity to the role of Pamela, to help make her point. But the
movie quickly melds with any number of recent romantic-comedy
meditations on fate; it's easy to see Meg Ryan or a lighthearted
Gwyneth Paltrow doing something similar. In fact, they have;
Griffiths' edge helps separate ``Me Myself I'' from their work, but
it's only the merest shred of individuality in a movie that is, at
least partly, about individualism.

 Susan Reiter's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
Jose Limon Dance Company.  
 By SUSAN REITER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Helgi Tomasson, the celebrated dancer from
Iceland, stood onstage at the New York State Theater for the last
time as a member of the New York City Ballet, accepting flowers and
a resounding ovation for his final performance.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, if he goes against his innately modest and
reticent nature, he should be back on that stage, this time taking
a bow as the choreographer of a world premiere for the company's
spring gala program.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasson's ``Prism,'' set to Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1,
will be the closing work on a program that includes the premieres
of two Peter Martins ballets, ``Slonimsky's Earbox,'' to John
Adams's score of the same name, and ``Todo Buenos Aires,'' to
Adams's orchestrations of two Astor Piazzolla compositions. Along
with Christopher Wheeldon's ``Mercurial Manoeuvres,'' which opens
the gala evening, these ballets are all part of City Ballet's
fourth Diamond Project, a showcase for new choreography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prism'' represents a homecoming, one that might have taken
place sooner had Tomasson's responsibilities as artistic director
of the San Francisco Ballet not been so all-consuming. In addition
to leading his troupe to a new level of achievement and
international recognition, he has choreographed 25 one-act ballets
and his own productions of 4 classics there since taking over in
June 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Martins has been asking me for many years to come and do
a ballet here, and finally this season it worked out that I was
able to do it,'' Tomasson said during a mid-March interview at New
York City Ballet's Lincoln Center rehearsal studios. ``For the
first time, I was not making a new ballet in San Francisco. I put
together a Discovery Program there with six premieres by young
aspiring choreographers, so that meant that I stepped aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomasson was in town to finish ``Prism,'' which he began
choreographing last November, and to audition potential new members
for his San Francisco troupe.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-hour rehearsal a few days earlier, Tomasson took
a long pause to sort out a series of large circling patterns in his
ballet's third movement as the full cast of 29, plus understudies,
waited to start dancing again. This final movement features
bounding, bravura passages for Sebastien Marcovici and brings
together dancers from the first movement, which focuses on a lead
trio backed up by three additional trios, and the second, which
includes a lead couple (Maria Kowroski and Charles Askegard) with
seven supporting couples.
</P>
<P>
   While the others took a break, Tomasson, in a black T-shirt and
jeans, guided Marcovici through a tricky series of leaps and
clarified some details. When they reassembled and ran through the
full finale, its elegant details and sophisticated, pristine
patterns emerged, the dancers riding the energy of the robust
Beethoven score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking for years that this music would make a
wonderful ballet,'' Tomasson said. ``It's early Beethoven; I found
it very danceable when I listened to it _ and in some ways a little
intimidating. But when the opportunity came to work with City
Ballet, I thought of that music, and felt it was right for this
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent so many years here, and coming back, in a whole new
way, to the company where I spent the better part of my career _ I
wanted to do a pure dance in a classical sense, using the classical
technique. I had a very clear concept of what I wanted to do, based
on how I heard the structure of the music. This is a big-sounding
work; I really wanted a lot of people onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Tomasson embarks on a new ballet as an experienced
choreographer, but he readily recalls creating ``Menuetto,'' his
first work for City Ballet, in 1984. He had already begun his
choreographic career with two well-received ballets for the annual
workshop of the School of American Ballet, which is affiliated with
City Ballet, but now he was in the big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting, but it was not easy, because I was still part
of the company, just starting out as a choreographer,'' he said.
``Maybe it was just my perception, but there were times I felt
awkward. I was almost too much a part of them as a family of
dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing ``Menuetto,'' Anna Kisselgoff wrote in The New York
Times that Tomasson ``has met his own test with flying colors _
using the most formal of methods to create the most natural of
ballets.'' The choreography bug had bitten him for good, and from
his first season in San Francisco, he made regular contributions to
the repertory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was very necessary, and also it's something I wanted
to do,'' Tomasson said. ``I felt it would really give the dancers
an idea of what I was looking for, how I want them to dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomasson, 57, who remains trim though his hair has gone from
black to white and thinned somewhat, has now been running San
Francisco Ballet for the same number of years he danced with City
Ballet. ``It was not a terribly smooth transition,'' he says, in
his understated way, of his arrival there; his restrained approach
and attention to the refinements of classical technique represented
a big change from the flashy showmanship of the previous director,
Michael Smuin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was trial by fire,'' Tomasson says. Making the company his
own and maintaining its high standards, he says, has been ``very
challenging, rewarding, frustrating _ it's been hard work, a
24-hour job.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Rose Building, where Tomasson was rehearsing
``Prism,'' had not yet been built when he was with City Ballet and
thus harbors no nostalgic associations, he did experience a few
pangs on entering the New York State Theater. ``It's amazing; it
doesn't seem like 15 years,'' he said. ``When I go into the
theater, it feels almost like it was yesterday.''

GET FIT AND HAVE A BALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use on or after May 1, 2000) 
By PHIL DAVIS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judi Clark found her workouts were lacking. Then she found ``The
Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   She was skeptical when her personal trainer first rolled the
giant blue rubber ball into the high-tech gym at the Spectrum Club
in Valencia. It looked like a circus prop. What, she wondered,
could this goofy, air-filled thing do for her body?
</P>
<P>
   The question should have been, What (BEGIN ITAL)can't(END ITAL)
it do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sweating on the third stretch,'' Clark said. ``It's
unbelievable. I worked out with different trainers for nine months
without real results. With the ball, I got results quickly. I'm
standing up straighter. My muscles feel stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Working out on the fitness ball _ also known as the stability
ball, flexi-ball, therapy ball, Swiss ball, Resist-a-ball or physio
ball _ is the latest exercise trend popping up at fitness clubs.
While new to the clubs, the method has been used by years by San
Fernando Valley certified personal trainers and physical
therapists. It was invented in Switzerland in the 1950s as a method
for restoring patients' motor skills after serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The ball capitalizes on the body's own weight by creating
instabilities that force typically unused ``stabilizer'' muscles in
the back, abdomen and buttocks to work. Ordinary exercise machines
give support that allows those muscles to relax. Perched on the
ball, the body improves its posture by straightening the spine.
</P>
<P>
   After mastering the initial balancing tricks _ lifting one foot,
then switching to the other without falling over _ trainer Larry
Painter has clients like Clark work through stretches, push ups or
even barbell workouts that put the whole body through the paces.
For example, a bench press on the ball turns the body into the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Painter likes the ball because it builds strength physically and
mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It increases our awareness of where our bodies are in space,''
said Painter, who first used it a year ago when he was recovering
from a back injury. ``One of the most exciting things about doing
ball work is that people really feel good about their ability to
move and be in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Chain health clubs currently introducing class instruction for
the ball include Bally's Total Fitness and Bodies in Motion. Bodies
in Motion launched a pilot program in Century City in March, while
Bally's plans to roll out classes at its Northridge and Chatsworth
locations as soon as storage equipment arrives, said area aerobic
director Cricket Haskell.
</P>
<P>
   Bally's trainer Carl Harberger _ who has used the ball with
clients in Chatsworth for two years _ speculates all the recent
attention is part of an overall whole-body fitness movement that
also includes such programs as Pilates and yoga.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike extreme workouts such as spinning, he says, the ball
appeals to people of all fitness levels, including senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new cutting-edge sort of thing,'' agrees Phil Jun, a
manager for Bodies in Motion.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the response in Century City, Jun says Bodies in
Motion might introduce similar classes at San Fernando Valley
franchises, such as one in Encino. Club members have already
convinced him to add two evening classes at Century City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that people are trying once, then
telling all their friends,'' said Jun. ``People like it because you
don't immediately get tired. But believe me, you feel it later.''
</P>
<P>
   Jun sees more weightlifters using stability balls to overcome
workout plateaus, points where marked improvement ceases. After
exercising underworked back and abdomenal muscles, they often begin
lifting heavier weights or increasing repetitions.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's funny, because usually there's one or two of
these balls in the corner of every gym just collecting dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Sporting-good merchants also have noticed increased sales of the
ball. But Ronen Pollak, owner of Fitness Depot in Woodland Hills,
says most demand for the $25-$55 item has come from personal
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Del Barrett, owner of Action Personal Training in Encino, said
all 22 trainers there use them for various purposes.
</P>
<P>
   And, Barrett said, many clients are referred from physical
therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Having worked ``Swiss balls'' into rehabilitative programs for
18 years, Dr. Ruth Gomez, clinical director of Progressive Physical
Therapy in Tarzana, is not surprised the ball is catching on in
exercise circles, given its range of possibilities and results.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez has administered ``Swiss ball'' therapy for conditions
ranging from weak bladders _ the exercises strengthen pelvic
muscles _ to muscle injuries. She even uses them in brain injury
cases, such as strokes, to help restore a patient's physical
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that you attempt to right yourself,'' Gomez
explained of the latter exercise. ``When you start to go off
balance, the response to align yourself against gravity is an
automatic response.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``When you feel yourself begin to fall, the body
wants to catch itself. It's a survival instinct almost.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jolly, who works out at Spectrum Club in Valencia,
turned to the ball to help alleviate a back problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very effective,'' Jolly said. ``It looks simple, but it's
not so easy. Besides, sometimes the simplest things are the most
effective. I'm getting results, and that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   As with any new exercise, experts recommend consulting a trained
exercise or medical professional for instruction before using the
stability ball.

 &HT;    Flagpole removal ignites Confederate emblem fight in Georgia
town
 &HT;    By Ben Smith III and Maurice Tamman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ The 21st-century battle over the banner of
the Confederacy shifted Wednesday from South Carolina to Stone
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that its property rights had been violated, the Sons of
Confederate Veterans filed a federal lawsuit against the city for
removing a cemetery flagpole on which the group had intended to
hoist the battle flag Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, accusing the group of coming to town to pick a
fight on Confederate Memorial Day, said the flagpole was removed
because the group installed it without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   The verbal fracas marked the latest in a series of skirmishes
around the Southeast over the emblem. A measure to remove the flag
from atop the South Carolina Capitol is halfway through its
Legislature. That effort was prompted by a boycott of the state,
launched by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
</P>
<P>
   This month the Jackson City Council in Mississippi voted to
remove the state flag, which incorporates the Confederate Cross of
St. Andrew design. And activists on both sides of the issue say the
moribund campaign to change Georgia's own Confederate-style state
flag is almost certain to be resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``What monument can be sacred? If we can't erect a memorial
where our dead are buried, where can we have one?'' said Gene Wade
of Snellville, Ga., one of more than a dozen Confederate veterans
who staged an impromptu march in Stone Mountain on Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The group includes H.K. Edgerton, a black member of the Sons of
Confederate Veterans who traveled from Asheville, N.C., to
participate in the memorial service Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That flag belongs to those dead heroes,'' said Edgerton, who
is among a small group of descendants of black Confederate
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Edgerton, Wade and others said the decision by Stone Mountain
Mayor Chuck Burris to have the flagpole removed Tuesday, the day
before Confederate Memorial Day, is clear evidence that opponents
of the Georgia flag want to rid the state of Confederate symbols.
</P>
<P>
   When former Gov. Zell Miller launched his unsuccessful bid to
change the state flag, he and other supporters argued, among other
things, that the Confederate flag belonged to museums and memorials
such as Stone Mountain Park.
</P>
<P>
   For Stone Mountain, which has long straddled an uneasy divide
between its past as a mecca for the Ku Klux Klan and its present as
a growing enclave of middle- and upper-class African-Americans,
this is an unwanted fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have really fought this image because of this one sad man
who owned property here,'' said Ginger Lipscomb, who owns Stone's
Jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Lipscomb, who said she didn't mind the Confederate emblem flying
in the cemetery but agreed that a permit was necessary, was
referring to James Venable, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who once
lived in Stone Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the city of Stone Mountain made worldwide news when it
elected its first black mayor, Chuck Burris. Many viewed his
election as symbolic of a new era, and business leaders backed his
pragmatic approach. Rather than seeking to remove ``mammy dolls''
from gift shops or strip the state flag from City Hall, Burris said
he was more interested in promoting tourism.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, before leaving for Dallas to attend the National
Conference of Black Mayors, Burriss said, ``I've never made this an
issue. They've always gotten a permit approved every year for the
Confederate Memorial (service). The real issue is the illegal
erection of a flagpole.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a city ordinance, anyone seeking to erect a structure
other than a stone monument must receive permission from the city
cemetery's sexton. That official, Tug Tuggle, said he never
received such a request this year from the Sons of Confederate
Veterans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Sons had asked the city council for such permission
but were refused.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the group bought four cemetery plots and erected the
flagpole there 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   City council members said Wednesday that they invited the group
to a special meeting April 18 to work out a compromise, but the
group did not show up. Coleman said the group was not aware of such
an invitation.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal was to allow the group to keep the flagpole and to
fly the original Confederate national flag, the so-called ``Stars
and Bars,'' rather than the battle flag, which is far more
offensive to blacks, said City Council member Nan Odum Nash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not unsympathetic to (the SCV),'' said Nash, owner of a
local military antiques store that sells Confederate flags. ``I
wanted to work out a compromise but they didn't come to our
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said Wednesday that flying the ``Stars and Bars'' was
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Bradley, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union,
said he found the city's removal of the flagpole ``troubling ... I
think the people putting it up were clearly making a free speech
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley added that the city's position is probably
defensible because it has allowed small, temporary Confederate
flags in the city cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often have flags in cemeteries. That is very traditional
and bears on what can be regulated ... That helps them (the city
council) because they don't seemed to be concerned with content,''
said Bradley. It gives them a leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lipscomb and other area business owners seemed
annoyed by the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you will mention what a small crowd this is,'' Lipscomb
said. ``There is not some terrible turmoil going on in our town.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, hundreds of people, many dressed in period
costumes of hoop skirts and the somber gray uniform of the
Confederate soldiers, celebrated Confederate Memorial Day at the
cemetery. Many waved small Confederate flags as the sun settled
into the sky.

FIREARMS MAKERS SUE TO BLOCK PROPOSED STATE AND LOCAL GUN CODE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Pa., Mo., Mich., Mass., Ga., Ind., N.J.,
Conn., N.Y.)   by JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seven of the nation's largest gun manufacturers
filed suit Wednesday to block New York state, Connecticut and 16
local governments from adopting purchasing policies that favor gun
companies that agree to stringent rules governing the ways they
make, sell and distribute weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here today to end an illegal attempt by a number of
self-appointed and self-important government officials to violate
the basic rights of a legitimate and a responsible industry, and to
foist on citizens across this country a nationwide gun-control
scheme unapproved by Congress,'' said Robert Delfay, president of
the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group that helped
organize the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, the suit seeks to prohibit purchasing policies
intended to pressure gun companies into adopting a sweeping ``code
of conduct'' promoted by U.S. Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo and
the attorneys general of New York and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the code requires companies to install locks
on handguns, develop ``smart-gun'' technology allowing only
authorized users to fire a weapon and place hidden serial numbers
inside guns. It also requires dealers to accept a host of
restrictions, including selling weapons only to people who have
passed gun safety courses.
</P>
<P>
   To date, only one company, Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's oldest
and largest handgun maker, has accepted the code. In exchange, 29
cities agreed to drop lawsuits against Smith &AMP; Wesson seeking
monetary damages for gun violence. But since agreeing to the code
on March 17, Smith &AMP; Wesson has tried to back away from major
elements of it.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo's office had been in negotiations with other gun makers,
including some involved in Wednesday's suit, to encourage them to
agree to the code, also in exchange for having municipal lawsuits
against them dropped. But Wednesday's announcement seemed to signal
that those talks are all but dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no chance in the world we'll sign the deal,'' said
Paul Januzzo, vice president for Glock Inc., one of the plaintiffs
in Wednesday's suit. Glock, which just weeks ago seemed close to
accepting the agreement, is the largest seller of firearms to law
enforcement agencies in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to buy guns
selectively from companies that accept the code was first promoted
by New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, out of concern that
using Congress, state legislatures or the courts to win gun-control
measures was taking too long.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, officials in more than 70 cities have said
they would adopt the procurement policy. Cuomo is developing
similar regulations for public housing authorities, and Spitzer has
ordered his department to adopt the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The gun makers' suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta,
asserts that such selective purchasing policies are an illegal
attempt to regulate interstate commerce because they would restrict
the ways gun companies do business across the nation. Under the
commerce clause of the Constitution, only the federal government,
not cities or states, are allowed to regulate commerce across state
lines.
</P>
<P>
   The suit names as defendants Cuomo, Spitzer, Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and officials from 16 local
governments: San Francisco; Washington; Philadelphia; St. Louis;
Detroit; Boston; Atlanta; Miami-Dade County; Newark, N.J.; Gary,
Ind.; Bridgeport, Conn.; and Oakland, Berkeley, East Palo Alto,
Inglewood and San Mateo County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Glock, the gun companies that filed the suit
include some of the best-known names in the industry: Colt's
Manufacturing, Beretta U.S.A., Browning Arms Inc., Sig Arms Inc.,
Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., and Taurus International Manufacturing.
Together, they account for about 80 percent of all the handguns
sold to law enforcement agencies in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Delfay said he could not cite any evidence that those companies
had been hurt by the procurement policies, mainly because they have
just been instituted. Indeed, most of the cities named in the suit
have only pledged to adopt the policy, but have yet to draw up
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Cuomo called the suit a frivolous attempt by the
manufacturers ``to distract from their failure to take
responsibility for their share of the tragic problem of gun
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said in an interview that the courts had repeatedly
upheld the right of cities and states to band together to make
public policy. ``Governments have to be free, indeed they have an
obligation, to use their purchasing powers, as well as other
powers, to serve the public interest,'' he said.

SOUND WAVE IMAGES SHOW UNIVERSE IN ITS INFANCY, BUT RAISE MORE
QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.J., Ill., Mass., Italy, Canada)   By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists Wednesday released the clearest pictures yet taken of
the infant universe, before stars and galaxies had formed and when
space was filled with hot turbulent gases. The images confirm one
major prediction of the leading theory of the explosive birth of
the universe, but they failed to reveal another crucial feature
that scientists had hoped would buttress that theory.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment it is uncertain how radical a revision, if any,
will be required to account for the new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The images _ actually imprints of sound waves, or ripples, _
were produced using a balloon-borne telescope named Boomerang by a
multinational collaboration led by Dr. Andrew Lange of the
California Institute of Technology and Dr. Paolo de Bernardis of
the University of Rome. The images, which were released at a NASA
news briefing Wednesday, are being published Thursday in the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're essentially snapshots of the universe when it was
300,000 years old,'' said Dr. Wayne Hu, a cosmologist at the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., who wrote a
separate commentary on the results in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to understand how the universe came about in what they
believe was a giant explosion, called the Big Bang, some 13 billion
years ago, scientists focus on ripples, or variations, in the
temperature of the primordial gas. These can be used like a
measuring stick to gauge the large-scale geometry and overall
contents of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the ripples observed by the Boomerang experiment
indicates that the universe contains just the right amount of
matter and energy to make space ``flat,'' in astronomical terms _
meaning that the apparent size of distant objects is determined by
the ordinary law of perspective, rather than appearing shrunken or
magnified _ just as predicted by the reigning theory of how the Big
Bang got started, which is called inflation. A preliminary analysis
by Boomerang and other experiments first revealed that flatness
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation, our boldest and most promising theory of the
earliest moments of creation, passed its first, very important
test,'' said Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of cosmologists were surprised by what the new
images were expected to reveal, but did not: fainter ripples of
smaller size on the sky. Just as an organ pipe resonates with its
main note and higher harmonics, the early universe should have
contained the smaller ripples, according to inflationary theory.
Scientists had eagerly awaited the results of Boomerang as the
first experiment that could see the smaller ripples, but it did not
produce clear evidence of them.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed results have turned the images into a sort of cosmic
Rorschach test, with some scientists seeing confirmation of
existing theories, and others seeing the first dark hints that
those theories are _ if not entirely wrong _ at least in need of
serious revision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do, you're going to have to kill one of the holy
cows of cosmology, throw away one thing that people believe a lot
in,'' said Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Lange cautioned that the team was presenting only 5 percent to
10 percent of its data in the Nature paper and that the theoretical
implications were still subject to revision. But cosmologists said
that if the higher harmonics did not eventually emerge clearly from
the data, all bets would be off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, I think, would require a radical revision of cosmology
as we know it,'' said Dr. David Spergel, a cosmologist at Princeton
University.
</P>
<P>
   According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, the
gravity of all matter and energy in the universe can warp space and
bend light rays. Generally speaking, this means that initially
parallel light rays eventually cross or diverge. Only in a ``flat''
universe, containing a precisely defined amount of matter and
energy, do the rays remain parallel.
</P>
<P>
   That precise amount is predicted by inflation, a theory first
proposed in 1980 by Dr. Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Inflation predicts that during the Big Bang a tiny mote
of space became drastically stretched by fields of energy that are
predicted by advanced theories of particle physics. Minute
fluctuations in the amount of energy in different places would
eventually have generated sound waves, or ripples, in the
primordial gases.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation, or light, emitted from those gases in the early
universe arrive billions of years later at Earth still retaining
the imprint of the sound waves. These imprints can be compared to
theoretical calculations of the early universe. Their apparent
sizes on the sky give a measure of whether the radiation from them
traveled to Earth on straight or curved lines, giving a gauge of
cosmic geometry, as if an optician was trying to estimate the power
of a lens by measuring the size of newsprint seen through it.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Boomerang experiment saw the most pronounced ripples
at about 1 degree on the sky, as expected for a flat universe,
``this is looking like a big triumph for inflation,'' Tegmark said.
</P>
<P>
   But Boomerang was also designed to look for some of the more
subtle predictions of the theory. To study the cosmic radiation,
the experiment used 16 ultracold detectors that look like tiny
spider webs, said Brendan Crill, a collaborator at Caltech.
</P>
<P>
   The detectors were placed in an instrument package and carried
to 120,000 feet, high above the warm glow of most of Earth's
atmosphere, by a balloon during a 10-and-a-half-day flight in
Antarctica beginning in late December 1998. The radiation fell on
the detectors, which heated up and cooled down by fractions of a
degree as they were directed toward warmer and cooler parts of the
cosmic ripples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like holding the back of your hand into the
sun,'' Crill said. ``You can detect the light by feeling your hand
warm up.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 16 detectors made 54 million separate measurements
during the flight, said de Bernardis, a principal investigator of
the experiment at La Sapienza, the main campus of the University of
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's briefing presented a fraction of the data that has
so far been subjected to the arduous analysis necessary for drawing
precise conclusions, according to Dr. Richard Bond, a Boomerang
collaborator at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics
at the University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buzz on the street is going to be that there is no second
`Doppler peak,''' as the harmonics are known, Bond said. But with
more data to be analyzed, he said it was too soon to say whether
there was a discrepancy with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   If the peaks fail to appear, however, cosmologists said that
revisions to the theory ranging from mild to radical might be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   One solution, the scientists said, would be to adjust what seem
to be well-established ratios of ordinary matter; dark or unseen
matter; and a kind of static energy permeating space called the
cosmological constant, in the universe as a whole. Such adjustments
would mean that other astronomical observations are somehow wrong.
Or, said Dr. Paul Steinhardt of Princeton, the energy could be
something else entirely _ a bizarre, flowing substance called
quintessence.
</P>
<P>
   Still another possibility would be that inflation did not
produce structures in the early universe after all. Spergel said
that he still considered that possibility a long shot. But he said
that most cosmologists expected the Boomerang measurement ``would
fit bang-on the standard model. But it didn't. This will make
things interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner of the University of Chicago said that ``this could be
the thread that unravels the whole tapestry.'' He added, ``That's
not where I'm betting.''

GUYANA AIRLINE OWNER SCENTS NEW GROWTH IN OLD BACKWATER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Guyana _ Flying over this country's bountiful rain
forest in a noisy propeller plane seating nine people can unnerve
the most seasoned traveler. And what if the pilot shows up wearing
sneakers and a T-shirt?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in this company, mister,'' said Gerald Gouveia, the owner
of Roraima Airways, an upstart Guyanese airline. After Gouveia saw
the unsettling effect such attire could have on foreign visitors,
he decreed a dress code for his pilots: tie, slacks and black
leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we must sweat,'' said the 44-year-old executive, clad
in such clothing because he sometimes pilots his company's planes,
one hot day here in Guyana's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Gouveia is one of the more outspoken business executives in
Guyana, the only English-speaking nation in South America. Working
to discard more than two decades of isolation after independence
from Britain in 1966, Guyana's economy has slowly become more
capitalistic over the last decade, and people like Gouveia are
leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   He got his start in aviation in the armed forces, where he spent
15 years, eventually rising to chief pilot of the army air corps.
During that time he got some experience working under pressure
after the 1978 mass suicide of more than 900 followers of Jim
Jones, the doomsday cult leader who constructed a city, Jonestown,
in Guyana's interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smell of the place was disgusting, but there I was _
flying the world's media into the middle of nowhere,'' Gouveia said
in lilted Guyanese English that resembles the accent of Jamaica.
``What a rush!''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the military, Gouveia moved north, like many of
his countrymen, to Canada, where he worked as a flight instructor
in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more Guyanese still live outside the country than in
it, leaving the population at little more than 700,000. The largest
communities of Guyanese abroad are in Toronto and in New York,
where as many as 130,000 people are largely concentrated in
Richmond Hill, Ozone Park and Jamaica, Queens; and in Crown Heights
and Flatbush, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Although the financial stability to be found in North America
was attractive, he returned to Guyana in the early 1990s to work
for Golden Star, a Canadian mining company, organizing its
transportation for a large gold-mining operation in the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1992, elections brought in a government perceived as
more favorable than its predecessor to private investment. So after
some market-friendly changes, like the privatization of the
national telephone company and the awarding of a concession to a
Malaysian concern for a large-scale timber operation, he started
his own airline eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gouveia called it Roraima Airways after Mount Roraima, the
remote peak that serves as the backdrop of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's
adventure novel ``The Lost World.'' It is also where the borders of
Guyana, Brazil and Venezuela meet, a region of economic potential
if Guyana chooses to forge stronger ties with its South American
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   With that idea in mind, Gouveia initiated the first regularly
scheduled flights between Guyana and Brazil, linking Boa Vista, a
city in the upper reaches of the Brazilian Amazon, to Georgetown.
But lack of passenger demand on the route soon made Roraima Airways
drop it.
</P>
<P>
   Gouveia attributed this lack of demand to concern among some
Guyanese government officials over the possibility of their small
country becoming a mere appendage to its neighbor to the south,
with 170 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, progress has been made in strengthening
Guyanese ties with Brazil with the forming of a tourism and trade
commission headed by Gouveia. Although he is still critical of what
he calls foot-dragging, he said that ``Guyana is realizing that
much of its future is linked to better Brazilian relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Commonly called Gerry, or Captain Gerry, Gouveia is known for
his blunt criticism of Guyana's government. The country's politics
remain polarized by race issues, and though people from different
racial backgrounds mix freely on the streets of Georgetown, they
tend to vote along ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a vibrant democracy has emerged, enabling people to
express their views. Since 1992, the Indo-Guyanese majority,
descended from people from the Indian subcontinent, has governed
the country, after more than two decades of rule by Afro-Guyanese _
those descended from Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Gouveia is a member of still another minority, the Portuguese,
descended from laborers from Portugal who came to Guyana more than
a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gouveia's biggest feud with the authorities came a year ago,
after he acquired the country's first civilian helicopter. With the
new machine, he hoped to organize tourist expeditions into rain
forest lodges and to fly supplies to mining camps.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, the army began competing with him, using its own
helicopters to organize sorties into the interior. And because the
army did not pay taxes on fuel, it charged less, eventually
squeezing Roraima Airways out of the helicopter business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerry's a little bitter about the helicopter issue,'' said
Moses Nagamootoo, the minister of information. ``But we're a very
poor country. We encouraged our army to get into things like
farming, or to use their helicopters to make a little extra money.
What harm is there in having an army that is not in dire straits?''
</P>
<P>
   Facing such obstacles, Gouveia does not expect to become another
Richard Branson anytime soon. His fleet consists of three small
planes, none of them jets. And his company is still smaller than
the country's two other airlines, Guyana Airways and Trans-Guyana.
Still, that does not stop him from thinking big.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got it all in Guyana for a big air travel market _ the
preserved natural beauty, the natural resources, the exports,'' he
said, counting on his fingers the nation's production of rice,
sugar, timber and gold. ``It takes a crazy capitalist like me to
get off the sidelines and make sure we don't lose this chance.''

<P>
   LONDON _ To flee Myanmar seven years ago, Maung A. had to pay a
small fortune in bribes. He had to abandon his modest business and
his increasingly dangerous career as a local opposition politician.
And he had to leave behind his wife and 9-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   After settling in Britain, he applied for political asylum,
saying he had been harassed and threatened by a government that had
also jailed one of his colleagues and forced another into hiding.
But in 1997, after a four-year wait, his application was denied.
</P>
<P>
   In one of various reasons, the British Home Office said that
Maung's decision to apply for asylum two months after arriving
here, rather than immediately at the airport, was not the action of
a desperate man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said, recalling his fraught flight
from Myanmar, through Bangkok, Moscow and Brunei, and his
exhausted, bewildered arrival in London with no ability to speak
English and no knowledge of the asylum process. Maung, who has
appealed the decision, agreed to discuss his case only if his full
name was not used, saying he wanted to protect his relatives back
home and did not want to antagonize the Home Office here.
</P>
<P>
   He is right to be worried about the Home Office. The year 2000
is not a good time to be an asylum-seeker in Britain. Vulnerable to
the public perception that Britain has become too easy a target for
economic migrants intent on exploiting its generosity, the Labor
government has enacted a tough new law that makes it harder for
refugees to enter and remain in Britain. And it has made it
abundantly clear that it will not tolerate the presence of refugees
whose asylum claims do not meet the highest threshold of proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threshold for asylum is the kind of persecution people
suffered in the war in Kosovo,'' Jack Straw, the home secretary,
told reporters recently. That rules out huge swaths of people from
places with decidedly mixed human-rights records, like China and
Turkey, according to Home Office figures. It also rules out
Gypsies, or Roma, who are increasingly fleeing persecution from
skinheads and others in Eastern Europe: No applications from
Gypsies have been accepted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   No applications from Myanmar have been accepted in recent years,
either. And refugee groups say that Maung's treatment by the Home
Office reinforces the widespread perception that the government
seems institutionally inclined to keep some people out, rather than
letting them in _ even people like Maung, who has a college degree,
got a job as soon as he legally could and hardly fits the
stereotype of an idle asylum seeker living off government handouts.
</P>
<P>
   Home Office caseworkers ``are very suspicious of anyone who
makes an application for asylum,'' said Alasdair Mackenzie,
coordinator of Asylum Aid, the group that is providing legal help
to Maung. ``Basically, they don't believe anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Asylum applications have been increasing throughout Europe. In
Britain last year, 71,000 people applied for political asylum, a
huge increase even from the previous year's figure of 46,000. In
1988, only 4,000 people applied, but that was before the fall of
the Iron Curtain and the political and social upheavals of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's refugees come from the world's most unsettled
countries, including, most frequently, Somalia, Afghanistan, the
Czech Republic, Sri Lanka and the former Yugoslavia, and many have
survived horrific treatment at home and showed extraordinary
cunning and resilience in making their way here. They come by boat,
by plane, by car, or in the back of trucks, some with forged
papers, others with no papers at all.
</P>
<P>
   But their reception, never very enthusiastic, has been bordering
on the hostile in the last year. The government and the
Conservative opposition have each tried to cast itself as the
tougher party on asylum.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, this has resulted in the newly enacted law,
which has placed some refugees into detention centers, replaced the
system of cash benefits with subsistence-level vouchers, and begun
imposing stiff penalties on truck drivers and others caught
bringing illegal immigrants into the country. Meanwhile, the
Conservative leader, William Hague, recently proposed placing all
new asylum seekers into prison-style detention centers and
deporting them within about six weeks if their applications are
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 32,300 asylum seekers whose cases were decided in 1999,
36 percent were granted asylum and 11 percent were given what is
known as exceptional leave to remain. In some years, as few as 20
percent of applicants have been allowed to stay in the country.
Many of those decisions are likely to be overturned on appeal,
leading to suspicions among refugee groups that caseworkers are
perhaps too quick to turn people down.
</P>
<P>
   And that perception is growing as the government, faced with a
backlog of 100,000 cases, has made speedy resolution of asylum
cases a top priority. Last month, the Home Office made decisions on
10,000 cases, more than tripling its usual rate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government says the application process is as fair as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize our international obligations toward refugees and
we would say that we treat each case fairly and impartially with
regard to these obligations and with regard to the facts of each
case,'' said a spokesman for the Home Office, asking that his name
not be used, in accordance with general government practice in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Maung's tale does not involve torture, as the tales of many
refugees do, but it does involve the sort of threats and fear that
are commonplace in Myanmar. In 1988, a simmering anti-government
movement swelled into mass protests in which hundreds of
demonstrators were shot dead by security forces. The ruling
military dictatorship was overwhelmingly defeated in parliamentary
elections two years later, but the opposition never took its seats,
and the government arrested hundreds of people for such offenses as
campaigning, criticizing the regime and gathering in groups of more
than five.
</P>
<P>
   Maung, who managed his family's rice mill in a small town in
southern Myanmar, ran for parliament as an opposition candidate. He
did not win, but was constantly harassed during and after the
campaign, he said, and was shot at once. And he said that his house
and office were constantly watched by security forces. His campaign
manager, facing arrest, fled. Among a mass roundup of political
dissidents, his local party's political secretary was jailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was up to the government, and it was not very easy
to survive,'' Maung said, describing how the government arbitrarily
shut down his mill, routinely entered his house to question him,
and menaced him with guns. ``It was a very bad life.''
</P>
<P>
   Maung said that he knew he would be jailed if he continued his
political activities and that it would be better to work for
democracy from the outside _ by joining a dissident movement from
abroad. In 1992, he went into hiding, and struggled to raise the
more than $4,000 needed to bribe officials for a passport and other
papers. When he got to London, he became the vice president of the
Burmese Democratic Organization here.
</P>
<P>
   After he left Myanmar, security forces removed his wife from her
parents' house, blindfolded her, and drove her to a prison where
she was interrogated by seven men, he said. She was shown cells
where prisoners were kept in solitary confinement, ill and moaning
with pain. Newspaper photographs of her husband marching in front
of the Burmese Embassy in London were waved in her face. After
several years, she too escaped to London, with phony papers in
which she and her son used pseudonyms.
</P>
<P>
   But the British government said it did not believe that Maung
was ever seriously at risk. Among the reasons the Home Office gave
in its rejection letter in 1997 were that although Maung said he
had been repeatedly questioned by the authorities, he had never
been actually arrested. Also, it said, he had remained in Myanmar
for two months after receiving a visa, giving an impression that he
was not at risk.
</P>
<P>
   And Maung's ability to obtain a passport, which the Burmese
authorities as a rule do not give to their political opponents,
raises ``grave doubts on the credibility of your account,'' the
Home Office said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also chided Maung for failing to claim asylum the
moment he arrived in Britain. ``These were not the actions of
someone in fear of their life and seeking to bring themselves
within international protection at the earliest opportunity,'' the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Maung has ready explanations. Being shot at once was scary
enough for him, he says. He got a passport and visa only through
the corruption of government officials. And he did not claim asylum
when his plane landed because he didn't speak English, didn't know
anything about the asylum process, and had just endured a marathon
journey through several countries that would have sent him back to
Myanmar if a fast-talking English businessman he met on the journey
had not helped him.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Office says it will not discuss individual cases and
concedes that decisions about asylum are based largely on extensive
reports on the human rights situation in applicants' countries of
origin, rather than on an individual's own account. Myanmar, it
says, does not seem like the kind of place that would give someone
like Maung any trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Maung and his family are waiting for a ruling on his
appeal. They bought a tiny fish-and-chips shop in Hackney, London,
with money they saved from Maung's street-sweeping job and his
wife's job delivering newspapers. On the counter Maung keeps a
stack of pamphlets promoting democracy in Myanmar. He would not, he
feels sure, be able to display those back home.

BETTER PAY FOR A BETTER COLLEGE? NOT REALLY 

</HEADLINE>
 By ALAN B. KRUEGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Your son or daughter has just been accepted to both
the University of Pennsylvania and to Penn State. The deadline for
decision is May 1. Where should your child go?
</P>
<P>
   Many factors should be considered, of course, but lots of
parents and students are particularly interested in the potential
economic payoff from higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there was a consensus among economists that
students who attend more selective colleges _ ones with tougher
admissions standards _ land better paying jobs. Having smart,
motivated classmates and a prestigious degree were thought to
enhance learning and give students access to job networks.
</P>
<P>
   But is it true?
</P>
<P>
   A study that I conducted with Stacy Dale of the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation, ``Estimating the Payoff to Attending a More Selective
College'' (available at http://papers.nber.org/), has undermined
this consensus.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see how one could think that elite colleges
enhance the earnings of their graduates. The College and Beyond
Survey, a Mellon Foundation study of 14,239 full-time workers who
had been college freshmen in 1976, found that the average student
who entered a highly selective college like Yale University,
Swarthmore College or the University of Pennsylvania, earned
$92,000 in 1995. The average student from a moderately selective
college, like Penn State, Denison University or Tulane, earned
$70,000.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this comparison is that students who attend
more selective colleges are likely to have higher earnings
regardless of where they attend college for the very reasons they
were admitted to the more selective colleges in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to address the problem, earlier studies compared students
with similar standardized test scores and grade point averages who
attended more and less selective schools. But this approach takes
account of much less information than admissions committees see.
There is no guarantee that all the relevant differences among
students have been held constant.
</P>
<P>
   This problem is known as selection bias. More selective schools
accept students with greater earnings potential, and students with
greater earnings potential are more likely to apply to more
selective schools. Apples are compared to a mixture of apples and
oranges.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome the problem, Dale and I restricted the comparison to
subsets of students who were accepted by comparable colleges. Some
students chose more selective schools; some less selective ones.
</P>
<P>
   College selectivity is based on the average SAT score of the
freshman class. We used data from the College and Beyond survey of
earnings for 1995. Although the data came from only moderate to
highly selective colleges, 30 in all, results are similar if a
smaller, but nationally representative sample, the National
Longitudinal Survey of 1972 high school graduates, is used.
</P>
<P>
   Our research found that earnings were unrelated to the
selectivity of the college that students had attended among those
who had comparable options. For example, the average earnings for
the 519 students who were accepted by both moderately selective
(average SAT scores of 1,000 to 1,099) and highly selective schools
(average SAT's greater than 1,275), varied little no matter which
type of college they attended.
</P>
<P>
   One group of students, however, clearly benefited from attending
a highly selective college: those from lower income families _
defined as the bottom quarter of families who send children to
college. For them, attending a more selective school boosted
earnings significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Restricting the comparison to those with similar choices helps
solve the selection bias problem because these students were
equivalent in the eyes of the admissions committees.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, students who applied to equally selective
schools revealed that they had similar aspiration levels and
self-confidence. If the comparison is restricted to students who
applied to equally selective schools _ regardless of whether they
were admitted _ attending a more selective school is still
unrelated to earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the selectivity of a school does not influence the
typical student's economic success, our analysis finds that the
resources schools devote to instruction, which are related to
tuition costs, do influence it.
</P>
<P>
   No study is definitive. Here's one unresolved issue in ours: Why
did 40 percent of students turn down the most selective school that
admitted them? Although it is possible that those with greater
earnings potential chose a less selective school from their menu of
choices, this seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons that college selectivity might have
little impact on post-college careers. First, even elite colleges
have diverse student bodies, and it is possible for apathetic
students at elite schools to find other apathetic students with
whom to play Nintendo and guzzle beer. By contrast, a good student
can get a good education almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Second, about one third of college graduates earn a higher
degree, whose prestige is often more relevant to their professional
or business success than their undergraduate college.
</P>
<P>
   Third, a student who goes to Penn State instead of say, the
University of Pennsylvania, is likely to end up near the top of the
class. Employers and graduate schools may not adequately adjust for
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   My advice to students: Don't believe that the only school worth
attending is one that would not admit you. That you go to college
is more important than where you go. Find a school whose academic
strengths match your interests and which devotes resources to
instruction in those fields. Recognize that your own motivation,
ambition and talents will determine your success more than the
college name on your diploma.
</P>
<P>
   My advice to elite colleges: Recognize that it is the most
disadvantaged students who most benefit from your instruction. Set
financial aid and admission policies accordingly.

FUGITIVE DIES BY OWN HAND DURING RAID, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR AND RAPHAEL LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite televised pleas from ministers, a phone call to
a youth worker, and pressure from police on anyone who ever knew
him, Sean Taylor, Boston's most elusive fugitive, died of a
self-inflicted gunshot as police burst into the house where he was
hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Taylor fired about a dozen shots before turning the
gun on himself just after 5 p.m. The shooting followed 90 minutes
of tense negotiations that brought his mother, father, stepmother
and ministers to the scene outside an apartment building, pleading
for a safe surrender.
</P>
<P>
   After eluding police for close to eight months, Taylor was
brazenly living on the edge, cornered in a house two blocks from
the Boston police station where gang unit officers had been
plotting how to hunt Taylor down.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had been on the run since a Sept. 2 car chase and
shootout in neighboring Brookline that ended in the capture of
accused killer Jason Pierce, who police say fatally shot two former
high school friends and nearly killed his ex-girlfriend in suburban
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But while the endgame Taylor promised delivered gunfire, it was
not the deadly volley with police he had envisioned: As tactical
teams entered the building and climbed the stairs, Taylor turned
one of the two automatic pistols he held on himself. He was taken
to Boston Medical Center in critical condition, where he died
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a young man who thought he was in a rap video, but he
found out that life wasn't a game,,'' said the Rev. Eugene Rivers,
one of a dozen pastors who had pleaded in a televised conference in
September for him to turn himself in. ``Unfortunately Mr. Taylor
apparently did not recongize that in life, if you play, sooner or
later you have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Rivers and the Rev. Hermon Hamilton, who was at the scene
of Wednesday's standoff and offered to go inside and bring Taylor
out unharmed, said police had used uncommon restraint both in
negotiations and in entering the building where he was hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took himself out,'' said Hamilton, pastor of the Roxbury
Presbyterian Church, which is next to the scene of Wednesday's
drama. Hamilton said he believed all the gunfire came from Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought his mother, they brought his father; I told them
I would be willing to negotiate,'' he said. ``Mr. Taylor had no
interest in that whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said the stand-off was triggered by an informant who
alerted police that Taylor was inside the building. Within minutes,
the house was surrounded, and police evacuated other residents
before starting lengthy negotiations. A white van with special
tactical teams was parked outside the house for more than 15
minutes before officers in SWAT gear emerged and burst into the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's mother, who did not give her first name, said she
offerred to speak to her son before officers went into the house,
hoping she could persuade him to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made us leave,'' she said. ``We was there, they made us
leave, the SWAT team went up there. We heard shooting _ pop pop
pop! _ and he came out on a stretcher. It seems they weren't
interested in having me help.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the wild shootout outside the Mall at Chestnut Hill
last September, Taylor had been wanted by Boston Police since March
1999, when he allegedly shot a female victim in the ankle at the
Academy Homes Housing Development in the city's Roxbury section.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor added three more counts of assault with a deadly
weapon, as well as attempted murder, after he shot at police
officers in the September incident.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation was part of a routine police patrol, but it
set in motion a chain reaction, sparking one manhunt as it ended
another. Pierce, 21, a longtime friend of Taylor also from Roxbury,
was himself the target of a massive multi-agency manhunt following
the Aug. 26 shooting that police say was motivated by jealousy in a
tumultuous relationship with his former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the women, Patrice Lassiter and Monique Brown, died in
the shootings. Shunae Allen, who was Pierce's girlfriend, was
injured. The three women, all friends who graduated from English
High School in Boston last year, went to Atlanta to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested after he was shot in the leg during the shootout with
Brookline police, Pierce could face capital murder charges in
Georgia in the shootings.

KNIGHT ERRANT OR ERRING? SOTHEBY'S TALE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes fairy tales do not have happy endings, even for
knights in shining armor. That lesson should come as no surprise to
A. Alfred Taubman, the shopping mall magnate who has made a second
career out of rescuing companies in distress from the arms of
unwelcome suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, however, could have dreamed up a tale like that of
Sotheby's, the venerable auction house that Taubman saved in 1983.
As if by magic, Sotheby's recovered, then prospered, under
Taubman's reign as chairman. It hit another rough patch in the
early 1990s, along with the rest of his empire. Then, Sotheby's
rebounded once more _ until federal investigators intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman, 75, resigned in February as chairman and is now
stepping down as a director of Sotheby's, with his armor tarnished.
And the Sotheby's story threatens to overshadow a life that might
well qualify as a Horatio Alger story come true.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors are investigating whether, in 1995, and
perhaps as early as 1992, Sotheby's conspired with its chief rival,
Christie's, to split business and fix commissions. Christie's has
as much as acknowledged antitrust violations by entering a
government program that promises leniency to the first conspirator
in antitrust cases to confess. Scores of customers who contend that
they were grossly overcharged have sued both auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   And fingers are being pointed at Taubman. Prosecutors have been
told that he and the former chairman of Christie's dreamed up the
commission-fixing scheme and ordered their executives to carry it
out, according to people involved in the case. No one, however, has
been charged, and much about the investigation remains murky.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman, while declining to be interviewed, has adamantly denied
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   His son Robert was to replace him as a director at a shareholder
meeting that was set for Wednesday in London. But the meeting was
suddenly postponed on Tuesday because the company's largest outside
shareholder, Ronald Baron, objected to the continuing Taubman
influence. Baron's firm, Baron Capital Management, owns about 38
percent Sotheby's; the senior Taubman still owns about 22 percent
of Sotheby's and has so-called supervoting rights that give him
control of the board.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Taubman's knight errantry has
landed him in trouble. His rescue of the Washington
department-store chain Woodward &AMP; Lothrop cost him hundreds of
millions of dollars and ended in bankruptcy in 1994. Macy's, the
department store in which he had a major stake, also went bankrupt,
in 1992. And he went into New York City real estate in the late
1980s, just before the local economy swooned.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the early '90s recession hurt his department stores
and shopping malls and slammed Sotheby's, where auction sales, and
profits, plunged. In 1992 Taubman began trying to raise cash,
selling off some of his depressed Sotheby's stock, some art works
and, eventually, a major stake in his malls. All this occurred
during the period now under investigation by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the financial pressures he faced, Taubman's friends
and business associates say they cannot believe that he would have
done anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall a single instance in which anyone has said that
he cut a corner or did anything inappropriate,'' said one friend,
Richard A. Manoogian, chairman of Masco Corp. in Detroit. ``I just
can't believe that Sotheby's was that important in the overall
scheme of things that it would be the one area in which he would do
something improper.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of immigrants from Germany (the initial A. stands for
Adolph), Taubman studied architecture at the University of Michigan
but never graduated. In 1950, he borrowed $5,000 and began building
on a small scale, a bridal shop here, a shopping strip there.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two decades, the shopping centers grew bigger and
grander until they turned into the glossy regional malls. Peter
Linneman, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania, said that it was Taubman who ``took the shopping
center from a sort of schlocky product in the 1950s and 1960s into
very creative and exciting places of business and of suburban
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   He became famous in the business world for his good eye, his
attention to detail _ and his bluntness. Leslie H. Wexner, founder
of Limited Inc., likes to tell the story of the first time they met
when Taubman summoned him to Detroit in the early 1970s. They
climbed aboard a helicopter and visited one mall after another.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch, Taubman ordered Wexner to fix up his stores, which
he called ``a blight on my shopping centers.'' Wexner says now that
he was ``really mad,'' but eventually realized that Taubman was
right.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Taubman reached his 50s, though, that he
developed a reputation as an investment whiz after putting together
what turned out to be one of the real estate deals of the century:
the purchase of the Irvine Ranch, then being developed in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman was invited by some members of the Irvine family to come
in as a white knight and rescue the 77,000-acre property from Mobil
Corp., which had won a bidding war for it. He assembled a band of
his rich friends, who bought it for $337 million in 1977. When they
sold out six years later, Taubman and his friends had scored a
profit of more than $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   That was where the cash came from to buy Sotheby's, the English
auction house, which was founded in 1744. Having expanded too
rapidly in the late 1970s, it was forced after an art market slump
to fire half its staff and started losing money. A pair of U.S.
corporate raiders began to buy up shares, sending shudders though
the ranks of the titled gentlemen and Old Etonians who had always
run the place.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman, once again, looked like a white knight. He may have
been another rich U.S. businessman, complete with a perpetual tan,
constant cigar and a beautiful young second wife, but at least he
wasn't a breakup specialist. And he had artistic connections. A
collector himself, he had been a Sotheby's customer, a force at the
Detroit Institute of Arts and a patron of the Whitney Museum of
American Art.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to bid by Sotheby's directors, Taubman once again put
together a group of friends, including Wexner, to buy the auction
house and take it private.
</P>
<P>
   The business executives were surprised to find out exactly how
antique Sotheby's practices were, Wexner said. Records were kept on
file cards and legal pads, the London offices were a rabbit warren,
and nobody could explain exactly how the business operated. ``It
was incredibly goofy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman did not simply drag Sotheby's into the computer age. He
also used his retailing talent to change the very nature of the
business. Sotheby's clients were no longer art and antiques
dealers, they were the collectors _ the shoppers _ themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chance for people to get involved with the auction
social swim,'' recalled John H. Gutfreund, the former chairman of
Salomon Brothers. ``The old money dominated the sellers, and the
new money dominated the buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   To get buyers and sellers in the door, the company added more
cocktail parties, glossy catalogs and blockbuster auctions of
celebrity collections like those of Andy Warhol and Claus von
Bulow. Selling art, Taubman famously said, was not too different
from selling root beer. (And he knew; until 1994 he owned the A&AMP;W
restaurant chain.)
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased with the changes. Dealers, in
particular, complained about the commercialization of the art world
and about how the auction houses were now competing with them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And there were missteps, some involving a rapidly expanding
lending program. Sotheby's was embarrassed when it became known
that in 1987 it had put up about half of the record-setting $54
million an Australian financier paid for a Van Gogh painting. The
buyer promptly defaulted; Sotheby's eventually sold the painting
again. And it stopped lending to buyers without other collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Taubman's methods seemed to work, and his timing was
good. The art market rebounded, and sales began to soar. Profits
rocketed, too; Sotheby's, which had lost more than $6 million in
1984, earned almost $113 million in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Things were so good that Sotheby's sold shares to the public
again, in May, 1988. Taubman made millions of dollars on the sale
and still owned about half the company's increasingly valuable
stock.
</P>
<P>
   His takeover of Sotheby's turned Taubman into a mover and shaker
in New York's social scene, a paradoxical position for a gregarious
man who nevertheless had always claimed to cherish his privacy. His
wife, Judith, was on the cover of Town &AMP; Country magazine; his
perfectly appointed homes in New York; London; Palm Beach, Fla.;
Southhampton, N.Y.; and Bloomfield Hills, Mich., attracted lots of
attention. Meanwhile, he endowed government-studies programs at
Harvard and Brown, donated millions to the University of Michigan
and the Detroit Art Institute and was active in Jewish
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1990s began, real estate tanked. And mall sales slumped.
The art market went into a recession, too, as the rich suffered
from a global economy slump. Sotheby's shares lost two-thirds of
their value in 1990. Auction sales dropped, and so did profits,
falling to less than $4 million in 1992. It was that year,
prosecutors have been told, that Sotheby's and Christie's may have
began to collude; it is certainly the year that they raised the
commissions they charge buyers, by exactly the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman's friends repeatedly say that it would be out of
character for him to have done anything improper, no matter what
his financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   There appear to have been some. In 1992, Taubman was trying hard
to raise money. He sold a third of his stake in Sotheby's, even
though the share price was low, and he had borrowed against much of
his remaining stake.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to sell stock in his malls, a deal that was completed
the following year and brought in a lot less money than originally
hoped. The transaction was complicated because Taubman and his
family had earlier borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from
the giant corporate pension funds of AT&AMP;T and General Motors,
secured by a stake in the shopping centers. The GM pension plan
ended up owning so much of Taubman's company that in 1998 it
swapped its shares for 10 of his malls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these financial pressures, Taubman remained the
model of a modern mogul, with all the lavish living that entails.
Indeed, he served as an inspiration for a major character in a
modern sort of fairy tale, Dominick Dunne's novel ``People Like
Us.'' In the book, about the clash of old and new society in New
York, the Taubman-like character is a rich trader who ends up in
jail. (Some details were so apt that Taubman demanded changes by
Dunne.)
</P>
<P>
   But not entirely apt, Dunne says now. When he wrote the book, he
said, he had watched Taubman only from afar; they have since met
and he has grown to like Taubman. ``I have never heard of a stain
on his reputation,'' Dunne said. ``Sure he's a tough guy; if you're
going to be a billionaire, you've got to be a tough guy.''

WORLD BANK ANNOUNCES LITERACY PROGRAM  

</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As world education ministers gathered in Senegal on
Wednesday to discuss how they have fallen far short of their
targets in poor nations, the World Bank was making plans to
announce a broad new commitment to schooling and literacy programs.
</P>
<P>
   James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank president, will announce in
a speech on Thursday at the World Education Forum in Dakar,
Senegal, that the bank is prepared to lend ``multiples'' more than
the $2 billion it now devotes to education programs each year, bank
officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The resources will focus on poor nations that produce a
comprehensive blueprint for enrolling more children in school, for
eliminating illiteracy and for ensuring that girls have equal
access to education.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative will be the bank's second sweeping commitment in
two weeks to fighting poverty at the grass-roots level. Last week
finance ministers endorsed a World Bank plan to spend much more to
fight AIDS in developing countries. The bank has pledged to shift
resources it once devoted to large-scale projects like dams and
highways to programs that directly help poor people. In total, it
makes about $30 billion in loans each year.
</P>
<P>
   The commitments have come at a time of unusual public pressure
on the bank and the International Monetary Fund, its sister lending
agency, to do more to alleviate poverty and protect the
environment. Protesters declaring that these lenders often do more
harm than good tried to shut down the spring meetings of the
institutions in Washington this month.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and fund officials say they are wary of a backlash against
globalization that could undermine their political support in the
richer countries that provide their money.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank is already the single largest source of
international aid for education, having doubled its annual lending
to $1.9 billion last year from $900 million in 1990. Bank officials
said they were prepared to devote many times that amount to a group
of nations, perhaps as many as 20, that produce ``business plans''
demonstrating how they will use foreign aid for certain goals.
These are to train teachers, buy textbooks, build schools and
subsidize families, so that children who would otherwise be relied
on to work can attend classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about how we move from rhetoric to concrete action,''
said Eduardo A. Doryan, the World Bank's vice president for human
development. ``The constraints on this program will not be money.''
Rather, he said, the constraints will be ``the political will in
developing countries to produce a viable and sustainable plan to
transform education.''
</P>
<P>
   The commitment came as ministers convened in Senegal for talks
organized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   When they met in Thailand in 1990, ministers vowed to put every
child in school by this year. But they have made only modest
progress. Some 125 million children, mostly girls, still receive no
formal education. Poor countries have made few gains in wiping out
adult illiteracy, with an estimated 880 million adults still unable
to read. And foreign aid for education in Africa has actually
dropped since the early 1990's, private groups that follow
education trends estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Education officials are now moving some of those goals ahead to
2015.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said it would work with four U.N. agencies and several
international citizens groups in pursuing the programs. Oxfam and
Education International are among the private groups.  &QL;

`YARD GAL': ADMIRABLE PRODUCTION MAY BE TOO GOOD, TOO EARLY

<P>
   Their laughter precedes them onto the stage: big, bright hoops
of noise with sharp and jagged edges. If you heard this sound on an
urban sidewalk, part of you would feel like smiling; another part
would urge you to cross to the other side of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Undiluted hormonal energy, the kind produced by feral teen-age
girls, tends to have that effect, that alarming double kick of
vitality and destructiveness. And that's precisely what you feel
blasting so unnervingly from the tiny stage of the MCC Theater in
the opening seconds of ``Yard Gal,'' Rebecca Prichard's high-octane
portrait of girl gangs in the East End of London.
</P>
<P>
   An import from the Royal Court Theater, this intense, lopsided
production, which opened Wednesday night, sets its pace by the
pharmaceutically exaggerated rhythms of its characters, who number
two but who give the impression of being about 10 times that many.
Sharon Duncan-Brewster and Amelia Lowdell, the play's two-woman
legion of a cast, are somewhere in their 20s, but they capture
exactly the animal glow and tirelessness, the toxic insolence and
doubts, peculiar to girls in late adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   That instantly makes them about as scary a team as can be found
these days on a Manhattan stage. Now imagine these same traits,
mood swings and all, heightened by a nonstop diet of cocaine, rum
and speed, among other treats, and you'll have some idea of just
how precipitous the peaks and valleys are in these remarkable
roller-coaster performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yard Gal,'' which received acclaim for both its stars and its
author (who was then 26) when it opened in London two years ago, is
written in a sharp, cadenced argot of slang and obscenities that
may at first sound like a foreign language to American ears. But
the story it tells won't be unfamiliar to anyone who has watched
television magazine chronicles of violent inner-city youths or
movies like Larry Clark's ``Kids'' from 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In charting a brief but densely packed chapter in the lives of
Marie (Lowdell) and Boo (Duncan-Brewster), best friends who move
among squats and jail cells and rave parties, Prichard seldom
diverges from a path that has often been traced before. ``Yard
Gal'' was commissioned by Clean Break Theater Company, an
organization devoted to giving a voice to female prisoners and
ex-offenders. You can feel the research that has gone into it and
the attendant danger that its characters will register as animated
case histories.
</P>
<P>
   That the play avoids this, at least in its first half, has to do
with the pure theatricality of its presentation, which has been
overseen with wit and resourcefulness by the director Gemma
Bodinetz. ``Yard Gal'' (a glossary included with the program says
the nearest American equivalent for the term is ``Hoochie Mama'')
begins with deliberate artistic self-consciousness, with the two
girls egging each other on to tell their story from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan-Brewster and Lowdell sidestep the potential preciousness
of this device by using it to establish a leery, ambivalent
relationship with the audience. They are both confrontational and
ingratiating, brazen and scared, with their flexed muscles and
ready-to-pounce postures undercut by the skittishness and, at
moments, emptiness of their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The trajectory of ``Yard Gal'' predictably takes the form of
stripping away the brazenness to find the emptiness and fear
beneath. The show starts off on a sharp, shrill high _ in which the
girls luxuriate in the free street life of thieving, drugging and
prostitution _ before descending into one hellish low of a
hangover.
</P>
<P>
   The events that lead to this point, many of them violent, are
re-enacted with great ingenuity by Duncan-Brewster and Lowdell, who
mark scene changes by rearranging four illuminated plastic cubes,
which also hold assorted props and costumes. (The original design
is by Es Devlin, adapted here by David Korins; the inspired
urban-blur lighting is by Frances Aronson.)
</P>
<P>
   Boo and Marie also give life to the four other members of their
gang, as well as assorted lovers, johns and rivals. These
impersonations, rather than being fully fleshed performances in
themselves, have just the right edge of cartoonishness, drawn in
varying degrees of affection and exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   Prichard has an undeniable gift for finding a
spontaneous-seeming poetry in an urban patois fed by diverse ethnic
rivers. She doesn't make the mistake of wedging unnatural metaphors
or insights into her dialogue. And Duncan-Brewster and Lowdell
deliver the words with a biting, proprietary zest. They own their
language, they seem to be saying, and it's a banner of their
independence.
</P>
<P>
   This rabid ardor gives an exhilarating charge to the first
half-hour of ``Yard Gal,'' which runs an intermissionless 90
minutes. Once the girls start to unravel, the show loosens its
grip. Though Prichard refrains from passing judgment, there is no
avoiding the solemn, cautionary tone that pervades the latter part
of the evening. The characters somehow seem less individual when
they're down than when they're up, like grim statistics brought out
for an anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yard Gal,'' in fact, should probably end sometime before it
does. The futures of these young women are so clearly etched from
the beginning in the faces of the actresses portraying them that
following their journeys to the brink of adulthood in such detail
feels unnecessary. This admirable production, a welcome
introduction to a team of fresh talents, has almost done its job
too well, too early.

TOM CRUISE, TEAM PLAYER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   Molly Haskell's most recent book is ``Holding My Own in No Man's
Land: Men and Women, Films and Feminists.''  
 By MOLLY HASKELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The anticipated through-the-roof success of the sequel to
``Mission Impossible,'' ``M: I-2,'' should soothe any hurt feelings
in the Tom Cruise camp over the actor's Oscar loss for
``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally the academy swoons over beautiful stars who go into
ugly mode to show they can act, but Cruise's strutting,
pelvis-jutting television sex guru, out to seduce and destroy the
female half of the species, was perhaps too far off the empathy
curve when compared with Michael Caine's kindly doctor, patron of
wayward women, in ``The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The incongruity of the dimpled megastar in vinyl vest and
ponytail running a boot camp for misogynists might have delighted
the critics, but Caine was the sentimental favorite. That is
something Cruise has never been and is not likely ever to be, as he
tackles one steep career cliff after another, alternating between
conventional action movies and decidedly riskier enterprises with
such talented eccentrics as Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese and
Paul Thomas Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the irony is that while playing cocky upstarts too full of
themselves to join the team, in his best work as an actor Cruise
has done just that: allowed co-stars and supporting players to
shine while his own subtler contributions have gone relatively
unheralded.
</P>
<P>
   Oscars have accrued, but not to him: Paul Newman won best actor
for ``The Color of Money'' (1986), ditto Dustin Hoffman in ``Rain
Man'' (1988). For ``Jerry Maguire'' (1996), he was nominated as
best actor, but it was Cuba Gooding Jr. who took home the prize,
winning for best supporting actor. As the flashy sports agent
suddenly seized with moral fervor, Cruise's Jerry played straight
man not only to Renee Zellweger, a fresh-faced enchantress emerging
into stardom, and the bad-attitude brother played by Gooding, but
also to a scene-stealing dad-seeking kid (Jonathan Lipnicki) with
sprouting hair and rimless spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   He partnered Rebecca De Mornay to delicious effect in ``Risky
Business'' (1983) and made a superb supporting cast in ``Top Gun''
(1986) look even better. And that's not to mention other major
awards for which he bears some credit, like best director Oscars to
Barry Levinson for ``Rain Man'' and Oliver Stone for ``Born on the
Fourth of July'' (1989), the other film that won him a best-actor
nomination but not an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   After 1986, flush with the stratospheric success of the
star-making ``Top Gun,'' he might have spent a decade performing
solo turns in bigger and noisier action pictures _ ``Days of
Thunder,'' ``Nights of Lightning.'' Instead, while doing the
occasional blockbuster, he chose to pit himself against seasoned
veterans in artier and more modestly financed projects.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that he was eager to leap into the arena with
heavyweights like Newman and Hoffman but that he was willing to
play the jerk, to assume the odious qualities so that the
none-too-stellar characters played by his partners might appear
ingratiating and wise. In ``Rain Man'' he plays bad cop to Dustin
Hoffman's cuddly autistic savant. In their odd-couple odyssey _
slick car salesman and the institutionalized brother he kidnaps,
hoping to wrest his inheritance from him _ it is Cruise's Charlie
Babbitt who seems more likely to go over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Insolent, greedy, rude and impatient, Charlie rants like an
out-of-control child; in the process he makes Hoffman's mentally
disabled mutterer seem more human than such a character, imprisoned
in his armor of compulsive tics, has any right to be.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance is essentially a series of
mechanical gestures, relieved by a sentimental and improbable
``awakening'' to the pleasures of the flesh, while Cruise has to
carry the emotional trajectory of the film.
</P>
<P>
   In his anguished, push-pull relationship with the brother,
Cruise in a sense ``acts out'' the trauma of the family, the anger,
the resentment, the inability to love; and, as he probes, he
provides the film's sense of illumination, making us feel as if we
are grasping the essential mystery of Raymond and their childhood
together.
</P>
<P>
   In the heartbreaking parting, when Raymond, his limited capacity
confirmed, takes the train back to the institution, it is Charlie
who bears the weight of the loss. Having finally made emotional
contact, with his own feelings as much as with Raymond's, he turns
and walks away, shoulders slumped, shrunken in his clothes, as if
he had suddenly lost 20 pounds. Yet the loose-jointedness of his
previously coiled body suggests a sadness offset by growth, the
angry kid having become a man who accepts loss as an inevitable
consequence of feeling.
</P>
<P>
   It's a magnificent, generous performance in a movie that was
voted best picture and won Oscars for almost everyone except
Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Paul Newman's victory as the over-the-hill pool shark
Eddie Felson in Scorsese's ``Color of Money'' is as much a tribute
to Cruise's refusal to stop and ask for love in the role of
Newman's hustler protege as it is to Newman's own undeniable
charisma. In the darkened dens of cheesy two-bit pool halls leading
up to the climactic playoffs in a cathedral-like Atlantic City
casino, Cruise's Vince is a whirling dervish, determined to show
his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Twirling his cue stick, dancing around the tables, alternating
between a smug, who-needs-you self-sufficiency and heartfelt
apology (``I was showing off, I'm sorry''), he resists Newman's
strategic blandishments to play possum as the two go toe-to-toe in
an Oedipal battle that only one can win.
</P>
<P>
   As with most stars, Cruise's talent is not without limits. He's
best in roles that cut close to the core of his own temperament and
personality: ones that may even draw on unconscious
autobiographical reverberations, such as _ one might speculate _
the actor's anger at the real-life father who divorced Cruise's
mother when he was a boy and from whom he was estranged for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   Stars become stars on the basis of a mysterious and seamless
meshing of personality and role, and for the adventurous among them
it's a delicate operation to chart a course between type and
stereotype, to play with and enrich the established and successful
persona, to vary its permutations, without going too far afield and
crash-landing in the alien and implausible.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise has done both, embracing stereotype in the superboy
heroes of ``Mission Impossible,'' ``A Few Good Men'' (1992), ``The
Firm'' (1993) and ``Top Gun,'' but in ``Eyes Wide Shut'' (1998)
straying too far from the extroverted charm of that very image.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   You have to admire the actor for taking virtually three years
out of his career at his bankable prime to offer himself up to the
erratic genius of Stanley Kubrick. If the movie proved to be a
disaster of overreaching, it was not Cruise's but Kubrick's fault,
inasmuch as the director wanted to have it both ways: a moody art
film with a Hollywood marquee star to boost the budget and bring in
the crowds. The sexual insecurity and introspective bent of the
protagonist in the Arthur Schnitzler novel Kubrick chose to adapt
is something Cruise simply can't project. The reflective spirit of
an intellectual, self-doubting man, anxious about middle age, is
not in his repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Even in ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' as good as he was as the
wounded Vietnam veteran turned activist, he couldn't quite convey
the spiritual evolution in Ron Kovic's self-portrait, and Stone's
sledgehammer direction doesn't brake for an interior life.
</P>
<P>
   There are very few male stars who would admit the possibility of
sexual inadequacy the way Cruise does in ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' as the
protagonist cuckolded by the desire of his wife (played by his
real-life spouse, Nicole Kidman) for other men. Star cinema, being
inherently macho, means never having to say you're sorry, never
having to apologize (``It'll be better next time''), never having
to own up to a shortage of masculine mojo.
</P>
<P>
   As if to compensate the Cruise character for his rejection at
home, he's a veritable magnet of desire in the world at large,
lasciviously eyed and hit on by both men and women. Women come out
of the woodwork to press his flesh or even, in the strenuously
unerotic orgy sequence, to sacrifice their lives for him.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise is not an interior actor in the brooding Method
tradition. He is an interesting blend of modern and traditional
star characteristics, a mixture of impulse and calculation, of
physical beauty and the resentment it breeds, in both the possessor
and the beholder. The high-testosterone movies are designed for the
action fans (kids) and the butts-and-biceps crowd (more male than
female), but even in the quieter pictures Cruise's directors have
generally understood his physical allure and provided appropriate
glimpses of flesh and curves, removing an undershirt for an upper
body eyeful, supplying form-fitting clothes for that shapely
derriere.
</P>
<P>
   Still youthful at 37, he's more the boy wonder than the
authority figure, a perennial ingenue who can't do the
furrowed-brow thing like Harrison Ford, or capture that actor's
rueful sense of regret; he has the cockiness but not the melancholy
of Bruce Willis, the intrepidity of Mel Gibson but not the irony.
</P>
<P>
   Also unlike the aforementioned, he's generally too fast-track
slick to draw women into the slow erotic dance of great movie
duets. He's not one of those screen stars like Ford, who attracts
by seeming not to know how attractive he is. In a recent A&AMP;E
biography of Ford, friends and commentators constantly reminded us
that he was a carpenter (read: ``real man'') before he was an
actor, and kept insisting, absurdly, that he wasn't
``good-looking'' in the movie star sense _ a defense he has clearly
cultivated to steer clear of the curse of male beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Even expert stage actors like Robert Redford and Paul Newman
have been taken less seriously on the screen because their
extraordinary faces brought suggestions of narcissism, and of
having it too easy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Cruise's love interests have acted as mom or older
sister to his boyish heroes. Kelly McGillis in ``Top Gun'' struck
one critic as more ``big sister than lover,'' and Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio in ``The Color of Money'' becomes his brains and
manager as well as his lover. His inability to grow up, to ``work
through'' that sibling and Oedipal rivalry, seems to have placed
him in a kind of protracted adolescence, yet with the right woman
and in the right situation he can radiate sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet and unworldly character played by Renee Zellweger in
``Jerry Maguire,'' and her winningly vulnerable son, bring out the
protective side of him; he becomes a surrogate father himself,
``falling in love'' with the boy, which in turn enables him to take
the first fearful steps toward intimacy with the mother.
</P>
<P>
   The coolness of Nicole Kidman in the films they've made
together, the harsh take-no-prisoners stance of Kelly Preston (his
fiancee in ``Jerry Maguire''), bring out the insecure and
competitive side of him, while softer, sweeter women allow him
breathing room, a space to both expand as a person and recede as a
star.
</P>
<P>
   When Zellweger's headed-for-disaster single mom confesses to her
loving and wiser older sister (Bonnie Hunt) that she's ``met a
guy,'' Hunt reacts warily. As ringleader of a support group/coven
of bitter divorcees, she knows whereof she speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope he's not good looking,'' she says, and we smile.
We smile because we've seen the guy and how handsome he is, and we
smile because we know what she means. A gorgeous guy can't also be
a decent, trustworthy, marriageable male, at least not in any
real-life story we've ever lived. But just as the writer-director
Cameron Crowe pulls off this deft hybrid of satire and romance,
Cruise manages to make us believe in what might on paper seem
blatantly inconsistent: a slick, go-for-broke agent who suddenly
has an attack of conscience but who, after all, can't quite give up
the game.
</P>
<P>
   And a handsome hunk with dimples to die for who can also commit
to a forlorn little woman who believes in him, thus somehow both
confirming and defying the stereotype of the impossible dreamboat.

A FLAWED BUT COMPELLING `KAHUNA'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2{ stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on a play and made by a theatrical director, ``The Big
Kahuna'' is, unsurprisingly, stagey. Limited to essentially one set
_ and a nondescript hotel suite at that _ and carpeted with
wall-to-wall, very written-sounding dialogue, the movie is, on the
most obvious level, a textbook example of how not to turn a play
into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those and other evident flaws (playwright/adapter Roger
Rueff is forever doomed to be unfavorably compared to ``Glengarry
Glen Ross'' era David Mamet), the story grows remarkably involving.
The issues it brings up _ loyalty, faith, just what the heck people
choose to weave their lives around _ are deep dish. Even if
``Kahuna'' never gets more than halfway into the bowl, it's still
pretty intelligent and compelling stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Three salesmen from an industrial lubricant company meet in a
hospitality suite at a Wichita, Kansas hotel. There's a convention
going on and their goal is to snag the business of the title
desirable client who, unfortunately, none of them know by sight.
</P>
<P>
   The principals represent the three stages of that peculiarly
American brand of job-related slow death. Danny DeVito's Phil is
starting to feel his age and questioning the meaning of it all in
the wake of a devastating divorce. His longtime cohort, Kevin
Spacey's Larry, is a fast and vulgar operator at the peak of his
persuasive prowess _ or maybe just past it, a fear he ruthlessly
wishes not to confront.
</P>
<P>
   The third participant is Bob (Peter Facinelli), a religious
young man on his first big assignment. Larry, naturally, delights
in tweaking Bob's piety, which the older pro considers naive. But
when, in the aftermath of the drunken party the salesmen host, it's
Bob who hooks the target CEO with talk of Jesus, much wee-hour
reassessment of personal priorities must be made.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey co-produced ``Kahuna'' and got a longtime theater buddy,
John Swanbeck, to direct it. It's easy to see why the actor was
attracted to the piece: Larry is the quintessential, overbearing
egomaniac that Spacey has specialized in from ``Glengarry'' to
``L.A. Confidential,'' ``Swimming With Sharks,'' ``Hurlyburly,''
``Consenting Adults'' and untold others. This project offers him
the opportunity to do what he does well without too much onscreen
competition. But as well as he understands characters like Larry,
illuminating new facets of that well-examined type proves a
difficult order to fill here.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito and Facinelli are fine in their roles, but the nature of
this beast dictates that they remain subordinate to Spacey's
personality pyrotechnics. Swanbeck moves everyone about the limited
film frame adequately, but he still has much to learn about the
difficult task of cinematically composing images in restricted
space.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting idea on ``Kahuna's'' agenda is
whether the true American religion is salesmanship _ and, if so,
how do we prevent our deepest beliefs from becoming mere pitches we
throw at those we want something from? It's good that ``The Big
Kahuna'' at least brings it up, but it's disappointing that it
doesn't examine this issue nearly as seriously as it deserves to
be.
</P>
<P>
   But that would probably have offended some potential customers.
And, Lord knows, we can't do that.

SOUTHERN CHARM AND DESPAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Servie clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Financially challenged small-town Southern folk have been the
butt of Hollywood jokes for so long that it's hard to muster
righteous indignation anymore. Trailer parks and discount stores
have a stereotypical cast of characters all their own, cemented
into our pop-culture consciousness through everything from
late-night talk show barbs aimed at our own president's roots in
Arkansas to the ubiquitous ``Jerry Springer Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dollops of truth in these unflattering stereotypes are
turned to the characters' advantage for once in Matt Williams' new
comedy/drama ``Where the Heart Is.''
</P>
<P>
   These are simple people with complex problems trying to come to
grips with them as best they can. They aren't necessarily proud of
their shortcomings, but they're not ashamed of them either. At the
heart of ``Heart'' is Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman), a waifish
mother-to-be abandoned at a small-town Wal-Mart by the baby's
brutish lout of a father, a handsome wannabe musician named Willy
Jack (Dylan Bruno). Broke and homeless, she wanders the aisles,
aimlessly ``shopping,'' only to wind up locked in the store while
she's in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   So she makes the mega-mart her new home, sitting in the park and
exploring the town by day, reading baby books and camping out in
the store by night _ all the while dutifully recording what she
owes her unknowing hosts. Her inevitable delivery attracts unwanted
celebrity as the mother of ``the Wal-Mart baby,'' drawing the
attention of her no-good mother (Sally Field, in a brief
appearance) who then proves her worthlessness once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   For Novalee, life is an endless series of hard lessons.
Fortunately, she surrounds herself with a surrogate family to help
along the way. She's given a place to live by Sister Husband,
(Stockard Channing) who then takes on the mother role. She's a
frisky, spiritual soul prone to apologizing for daily sexual
transgressions in her dinnertime prayers. Hospital nurse Lexie Coop
(Ashley Judd) acts as big sis, although she's not much of a role
model. With four kids and another on the way, the only thing she's
better at than breeding is picking lousy men.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a potential love interest in the local librarian,
Forney (James Frain), a timid brainiac who enters Novalee's life
after helping deliver her baby, given a mouthful of a name in
``Americus.''
</P>
<P>
   In a film crammed with drama _ there seems to be a life-altering
crisis, be it tornado or kidnapping, every few minutes _ ``Where
the Heart Is'' manages to skirt the pitfalls of soap opera
mushiness largely on the strength of its strong ensemble of female
players.
</P>
<P>
   Portman (Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace; Anywhere but
Here), it appears, can do no wrong these days. Though her
uneducated, hopelessly naive Novalee sometimes comes across as a
glamour queen whose shine has been dulled just a bit by greasy hair
and makeup shadows under her eyes, Portman exudes so much charm
it's hard not to root for her. Judd, who's on a similar box-office
winning streak these days, is equally charming, despite her
character's unwillingness to learn from her own mistakes. It's a
quibble many critics will have with the performance, but it's her
gullible optimism that makes the role so believable; real people do
make the same mistakes again and again, especially when it comes to
love.
</P>
<P>
   Channing's feisty mother hen is the strongest performance here;
it's still surprising she shows up only in supporting roles, having
proved herself capable of carrying a picture as well as any of
Hollywood's female elite.
</P>
<P>
   That Williams was able to find humor and heart while never
poking fun probably comes from his experience as executive producer
and creator of TV's ``Roseanne,'' a show that introduced
working-class values and problems into American homes far better
than Williams' ratings bonanza ``Home Improvement'' ever did. And
having family dramedy screenwriting pros Lowell Ganz and Babaloo
Mandel ``(City Slickers, Parenthood, EdTV)'' adapting Billie Letts'
bestselling novel didn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   The film's inevitable ``chick flick'' label is well-deserved.
This is a movie about women (Frain's bashful suitor not
withstanding), but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable for male
audiences. Its bigger hurdle is class-related. Anyone who's never
had to hold their car's hatchback open with a broom will have a
hard time relating to what it's like to walk in Novalee's flowered
house slippers. At least ``Heart'' will give them a delightful
taste.

 &HT;    Golf lesson: Perseverance pays off
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She's relentless. She's opinionated. She fights for
every stroke. She's the type of player who attaches herself to an
opponent like a thistle to a sock.
</P>
<P>
   She's, well, Rosie.
</P>
<P>
   That's Atlanta's Rosie Jones, the ultimate grinder _ and quite a
successful one. Jones is 12th on the LPGA career money list, with
more than $4.3 million earned and 10 victories during an 18-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   Her swing is too flat. She isn't long enough. But she's an
excellent putter who can pull a string of birdies right from the
depressing depths of a double-bogey. And you be the one to tell
Rosie Jones on the back nine that she's out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the ultimate grinder, and she's someone who gets the
most out of her game,'' Karrie Webb said Wednesday. Webb, the
LPGA's dominant player, was practicing for the Chick-fil-A
tournament that begins in Stockbridge on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She might not be the longest hitter or the best ball-striker,
but she just finds a way to get the job done, and I have a lot of
respect for that,'' Webb said. ``I don't think she gives herself
enough credit. I don't think she realizes how much respect she has
from a lot of players. She probably has one of the biggest hearts
there is.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial rewards certainly have eased some of the pain for
the 40-year-old Jones. The dream has been worth every extra hour it
takes to limber up joints stiffened by arthritis. Growing up as one
of eight kids in Albuquerque, N.M., Jones dreamed about being rich
and famous, perhaps an actress. Or maybe even a big-time jewel
thief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I don't want to be famous,'' she said, laughing. ``I just
want the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Jones' home be more suitably appointed with the trophy
from a major championship on the mantel? Of course. But would
winning this week's Chick-fil-A Charity Championship, her hometown
event now officially hosted by Nancy Lopez, be nearly as
satisfying? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really felt that with my success out here, my
longevity and my consistency, that not having a major really
tarnishes that,'' Jones said this week at Eagle's Landing Country
Club. ``If I was to stop right now, I wouldn't regret anything or
not having a major. ... I look at my score at the end of the day
and I look at the money that I've made at the end of the year, and
I just have to think I'm doing something right.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the toughest time of the year for Jones, with cool
temperatures making it difficult to loosen her aching back. But her
game seems to warm with the weather. She tied for 11th in the
Standard Register Ping last month and tied for eighth in the
Nabisco Championship. She tied for sixth a year ago in the
Chick-fil-A and joined runner-up Lorie Kane in scoring in the 60s
all three days.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones is not watching the Golf Channel this week _ she was
filmed recently for an upcoming ``Profiles of a Pro'' segment _ it
will be the Weather Channel. Surely, a week of the old-time, rotten
``Chick-Delay'' weather might sink Jones as a likely contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weather is a big deterrent for me,'' she said. ``If it's
chilly, I'm fighting some arthritis in my back, and I really don't
have the flexibility. But when the weather turns and it's in the
70s and 80s, I have as good of a chance as anybody. If you had to
break down my money, I make the most in June, July and August.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chick-fil-A has become a better fit for Jones each year.
Good, fast greens and thick rough are what she loves. She's not
going to separate herself from enough players on a bomber's course
with no penalty for inaccuracy. It's tough enough for an older
player used to being outdriven on the teebox. Jones has to make up
the difference with course management and playing within her own
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had to do that,'' Jones said. ``A grinder? I'm a
lifelong one. I'm used to it. That's what makes me so tough now. It
doesn't bother me to grind a bad round into a good round. I've done
that more times than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Webb, Jones is playing her first event since the Nabisco.
She was in Albuquerque recently, helping her mother through cancer
surgery. Jones' golf has been mostly social, at either of her two
home clubs, Ansley Golf Club or Settindown Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I just had spring break, and I'm just picking up
the books again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it, Jones doesn't need to study. She thinks that she is
a better player at 40 than 10 years ago because so many mental
mistakes are being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let my ego run my game,'' Jones said. ``Certain shots
dictate what you want to do and want you can do. I know what I want
to do is hit an 8-iron 160 yards over that bunker. Now, what I can
do, well, that's another story.''

JUSTICES HEAR ARGUMENTS ON ISSUE OF BOY SCOUTS, GAYS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lawyer for the Boy Scouts told a skeptical
Supreme Court on Wednesday that the group has a constitutional
right to fire gay troop leaders because homosexuality violates the
message of morality it seeks to impart to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   But the court appeared equally dubious of the attorney for a
fired leader, who said the Scouts are akin to a public company and
must abide by a New Jersey law that bans job discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, during the hourlong court session, grilled the
lawyers on whether the Boy Scouts could simply fire anyone who
fails to live up to its strict moral code or, conversely, must hire
female scoutmasters to comply with the state law, which also bans
sex discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case is whether the Irving, Texas-based Boy
Scouts of America has a First Amendment right to choose for itself
the people it hires to advance its message of morality or if the
group is simply a business that must comply with state laws, like
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render its decision in Boy Scouts
of America vs. Dale by early July. The Girl Scouts organization is
not a party to this case.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney George Davidson, pressing the Boy Scouts' case before
the court, said the group bars avowed homosexuals from leading
youngsters because their presence would undermine its
constitutionally protected goal of teaching ``traditional moral
values.'' Calling homosexual conduct ``immoral,'' the New York
lawyer said the organization is a respected teacher of morality as
evidenced by the well-known compliment, ``He's a real Boy Scout.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said the group does not inquire into a troop leader's
sexuality but believes it can take action if the issue becomes
publicly known, as it did in the case of the fired New Jersey troop
leader, James Dale.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg likened the Scouts' position to the
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy of the U.S. military, which also
drums known homosexuals from its ranks. Ginsburg and other justices
wondered aloud what other people the Scouts could bar from being
troop leaders in its effort to teach values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living together before marriage is not uncommon these days''
but violates traditional moral values, she said in asking whether a
man in such a living arrangement could be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter asked Davidson if the Scouts, in light
of the group's concern with conduct, could fire a gay troop leader
who neither publicized his sexual orientation nor engaged in
homosexual activities. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked if a
heterosexual troop leader could be fired for telling his young
charges that homosexuality is not immoral.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson responded that the Scouts organization, as part of its
constitutional right to associate and teach its moral beliefs,
could terminate any troop leader who did not conduct himself in a
``morally straight'' manner or expressed views at odds with the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Evan Wolfson, representing the fired leader, countered that
the Boy Scouts of America is a business that must comply with the
state law.
</P>
<P>
   Souter and O'Connor, however, said compliance with the state law
could lead to the unusual result of the Boy Scouts being forced to
accept women into their ranks because the statute bans not only
discrimination against homosexuals but bias based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Wolfson said the New Jersey law specifically
excludes from its prohibition on gender bias those organizations,
such as the Boy Scouts, that have a sex-specific membership.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Stephen G. Breyer, picking up on his colleagues'
line of questioning, asked if religious organizations would be
required to hire people of different faiths to comply with a state
law that bans bias based on religion.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson responded that religious groups can discriminate based
on faith if religion is their reason for being and their sectarian
message would be impaired if they had to hire outside their faith.
But with the Boy Scouts, sexual orientation is not the group's
unifying theme, added Wolfson, an attorney with the gay-rights
group Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia disagreed, saying that the Scouts' moral
message is a uniting force and might be constitutionally protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that homosexuality is immoral,'' Scalia said.
Having gay troop leaders would be ``a contradiction of its moral
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson reiterated that the Boy Scouts, like any other business,
must comply with state labor laws. To allow a company to use the
First Amendment to evade its legal obligations ``would swallow
civil rights laws,'' as the business could then fire employees
simply because their race undermines a message the firm says it is
trying to make, he added.
</P>
<P>
   James Dale, who earned the top rank of Eagle Scout during 12
years of scouting, was fired from his post of assistant scoutmaster
in 1990 after telling a local newspaper he is gay. At the time, he
was a Rutgers University student and served as co-president of the
school's Lesbian/Gay Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Dale sued the Boy Scouts, alleging illegal discrimination. The
trial court, however, threw out his case, ruling that the
organization had a First Amendment right to express its views about
homosexuality by dismissing him.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Supreme Court resurrected Dale's lawsuit, saying
the New Jersey law barring the Scouts from firing gays did not
interfere with the group's right to speak out against
homosexuality. The Scouts then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, in Washington to hear arguments in his case, said he has
``always loved'' the Scouts and hopes the court will rule in his
favor so he can return to scouting.
</P>

 &HT;    Violence ratchets up worldwide
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The boorish, occasionally deadly behavior of fans in
and around soccer stadiums is no big surprise. But there was an
especially grim rash of incidents over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Three persons were crushed to death in Monrovia, Liberia, on
Sunday. A crowd more than twice the size of the national stadium's
33,000-seat capacity rushed in for a World Cup qualifier with Chad.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction Wednesday, the Kenyan federation disbanded the
entire team and fired coach Christian Chukwu, the English newspaper
The Telegraph reported.
</P>
<P>
   Across the African continent in Nairobi, Kenya, fans threw
bottles and other debris on the pitch, and Kenya's qualifier with
Malawi was abandoned in injury time with the score 0-0 and the
visitors about to advance on aggregate 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Two fans died in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Sunday before a
match between Vasco da Gama and Flamengo when fans of the bitter
rivals clashed outside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ten players on an Argentinian second-division team were
assaulted by fans, and their opponents had to rush them to safety
in the middle of a match.
</P>
<P>
   A star in the Colombian league briefly was held hostage by
guerrillas opposing the government.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, three Turks have turned themselves in to police after
being charged with the fatal stabbing of Leeds fans Christopher
Loftus and Kevin Speight before a recent UEFA Cup match in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are passionate (for soccer), but for others it's
more than that, it's even more than a religion,'' Atlanta
Silverbacks striker Ignace Moleka said. Moleka hails from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire, and was a student
in Belgium during a terrible spate of fan violence in Europe in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is that people are dying,'' Moleka said. ``For
those of us who grew up outside of the U.S., it doesn't amaze us,
because the passion sometimes goes to an extent where it's out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadder still is the reaction of authorities to the tragedies.
Wednesday, the Liberian authorities denied that deaths occurred at
the match. President Charles Taylor of Liberia had threatened his
cabinet ministers with their jobs if they didn't attend. Some civil
servants might have understood that order to apply to them,
possibly contributing to the overcrowding. People scaled fences and
pushed past overwhelmed security personnel to watch the match,
which ended in a 0-0 tie.
</P>
<P>
   But there are hopeful signs. The Argentine players association
threatens to strike unless they get stronger security at matches.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, a Spanish court imposed a 17-year prison sentence
on Ricardo Guerra, a member of a group of neo-fascist supporters
connected to Primera Liga club Atletico Madrid, for fatally
stabbing Real Sociedad fan Aitor Zabaleta before the clubs played
in December 1998. Guerra also was ordered to pay $175,000
restitution to Zabaleta's family.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE, GERMANY RALLY
</P>
<P>
   David Trezeguet had two goals, including the winner in the final
minute of regulation, as defending World Cup champion France
defeated Slovenia 3-2 Wednesday in one of several friendly contests
featuring 12 Euro 2000 qualifiers. Slovenia led 2-0 until
Trezeguet, a substitute, scored in the 63rd minute, and Laurent
Blanc equalized with 11 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, the 1996 European champion, needed an 85th-minute goal
from Ulf Kirsten to even up Switzerland 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Yegor Titov and Valeri Karpin scored in the second
half as Russia defeated the United States 2-0 in the first senior
international match between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   UNITED GETS RUUD AWAKENING
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the failed medical exam of new signee Ruud van
Nistelrooy, Manchester United has called in the striker's doctors
at his current club, new Dutch champion PSV Eindhoven, to conduct
further tests on an injured knee that has kept him out of action
for a month. The club had to postpone a Tuesday news conference to
announce the addition of Van Nistelrooy, 23, signed last week for a
English transfer record $28.5 million. United, which won its sixth
Premier League title in eight seasons on Saturday in a 3-1 win over
Southampton, expects the transfer to be made official in a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   BOYCOTTING BARCA FAVORED
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona's lame gesture in trying to cop out of the Copa del
Rey ostensibly means the Spanish champions will be ready for
Tuesday's European Cup semifinal first leg with Primera Liga rival
Valencia. Barca, which walked off the pitch before Monday's Copa
del Rey semifinal with Atletico Madrid and later forfeited it,
protested that the Spanish federation should have rescheduled the
match. The club has a number of star players away on international
duty or out with injuries, but it didn't express its concerns in
advance. On Wednesday, Real Madrid meets Bayern Munich (2:30 p.m.,
ESPN2) in the other half of the Champions League draw.

   This spring, the Getty Center in Brentwood is having its art and
eating it, too. Or at least giving it a long, hungry look.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Edible Monument: The Art of Food for Festivals,'' an
exhibition on view at the Getty Research Institute through May 21,
is giving curious visitors a taste of an esoteric and necessarily
ephemeral art form: decorations and monumental sculptures made of
food.
</P>
<P>
   Outlandish and enticing in equal measure, these culinary marvels
were mostly used for aristocratic banquets and street festivals in
Europe between the 16th and 19th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   From relatively simple sugar-paste miniature buildings to
multistory baroque edifices composed of fruits, pastries, cheeses
and roasted pigs, these monuments testified to their patrons' good
taste, wealth and social standing, with awe-inspiring displays of
conspicuous consumption that would be right at home at an
Oscar-night party on the Sunset Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just in the 20th century that we love beautiful food
and love to eat,'' says Getty chief librarian Susan Allen. ``If you
think about things like Mardi Gras, even Super Bowl Sunday or
Chinese New Year's, you get the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from the Research Institute's formidable collections of
rare cookbooks, serving manuals and deluxe festival books, ``Edible
Monument'' contains 70 mind-boggling, mouth-watering depictions of
concoctions that were gobbled up or carted away centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other drawings illustrate the unbelievably hierarchical
guest-seating orders at spectacular dinner parties, where the
placement of each napkin and dish was as carefully regimented as a
military campaign. (Eat your heart out, Martha Stewart.)
</P>
<P>
   Also on display is ``Palace of Circe, Dessert Table After
Menon,'' a full-scale replica of an 18th-century sugar sculpture of
a classical Greek temple, complete with balustrades and sugar sand
parterres.
</P>
<P>
   On loan from Fairfax House in York, England, the work is an
edible cautionary tale, depicting Homer's account in ``The
Odyssey'' of how Ulysses' men were turned into pigs by the
sorceress Circe. It was re-created in 1997 by British
botanist/culinary historian Ivan Day, and flown over from England
in its very own seat on a Virgin Atlantic jet. It was then
reassembled by Getty staffers using egg whites to hold it together.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the works shown in the exhibition were originally
seen only by epicurean elites, the large-scale immovable feasts
served a more public purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In cities like Bologna, Italy, nobles and royalty used massive
free-for-all food grabs to convey the goodness and prosperity of
the governing city-state and to reinforce their own rule _ a
version of the Ancient Romans' mob-quelling formula of ``bread and
circuses.''
</P>
<P>
   At a given signal from the ruler, the plebes would rush up to
these towering structures and rip off hunks of bread and cheese,
dip their jugs in specially built wine fountains, even snatch up
live animals that were left to roam free on these football
field-sized enclosures.
</P>
<P>
   For frenzied group gluttony, it was a spectacle hard to surpass
even at a Taco Bell drive-in window on a Saturday night _ an early
multimedia event that served a complicated social and political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   If you seek more food for thought, Peter Brown of Fairfax House
will give a related lecture, ``Eat, Drink and Be Merry'' at 4 p.m.
May 18 in the Research Institute's Lecture Hall.

VIETNAM COULD USE U.S. MILITARY AID BUT ISN'T ASKING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last Veterans Day, Maj. Joseph M. Gaines of the
U.S. Air Force circled the airfield at Hue, in central Vietnam, and
then landed his military cargo plane filled with emergency supplies
of plastic sheeting, blankets and water bottles.
</P>
<P>
   On one level it was a standard relief mission, intended to help
flood victims, and it was over in less than 12 hours. But it was
also a milestone: Gaines and his team were the first uniformed
members of the U.S. armed forces to undertake a mission in Vietnam
since the last few U.S. troops pulled out in 1975. (In recent
years, non-uniformed U.S. teams have been permitted to search the
Vietnamese countryside for American remains.)
</P>
<P>
   The visit represented the quandary that confronts Vietnam 25
years later: that the victor of the war now needs the loser to
build the security and prosperity that have so long eluded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is the No. 1 country we want to help us in security
issues, in military issues and in economic issues,'' said Le Van
Bang, Vietnam's ambassador to the United States. ``But the war is
always in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the passage of time, Vietnam has remained reluctant to
allow any U.S. troops back into the country. Hanoi recently refused
another U.S. offer to help remove land mines and unexploded
ordnance, saying it feared that too many U.S. soldiers would be
seen around the country and be heckled. But it is just as possible
that Hanoi was afraid that U.S. soldiers would be given a hero's
welcome, like the one that greeted Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we touched down I stepped out, and people came up to me
to give me flowers, stuff to drink,'' the major said. ``They were
really happy to see us.''
</P>
<P>
   He was just 14 when Saigon fell to communist forces on April 30,
1975, ending a war that killed 3 million Vietnamese and 58,000
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines' mission opened the way to the first visit to Hanoi by a
U.S. defense secretary when William Cohen went to Vietnam last
month.
</P>
<P>
   An impoverished nation with a shrunken army, Vietnam needs the
access Washington could give it to the modern training and
equipment that would put it on an equal footing with its more
prosperous neighbors in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   With the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Vietnam lost its
oldest military ally and patron, leaving it weak and alone as it
faces a possible confrontation with China over competing
territorial claims in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But although the United States lifted a trade embargo against
Vietnam in 1994 and the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1995, Vietnam has yet to approve a trade agreement and
has hesitated at establishing fuller military-to-military
relations, which might include regular port calls, weapon sales,
training at top U.S. military war colleges and joint exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have full normal military relations, but we aren't
ready yet,'' said Le.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Washington would like to see Vietnam safely
ensconced in an informal security community with the other members
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a goal often
articulated by Adm. Dennis Blair, the commander of U.S. forces in
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Vietnamese resistance to dealings with the U.S.
military, China has warned against any military partnership between
Washington and Hanoi that might suggest a threat on its southern
border.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials insist that they would never jeopardize
relations with China to get closer to Vietnam, which today has
little strategic importance for the United States. But that
assessment could change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good relations with Vietnam will be important if China ever
got aggressive, but those are things we don't want to talk about,''
said Michael O'Hanlon, a military analyst at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even if barriers remain, the one that Gaines' mission breached
last fall represents a significant accomplishment, one that took 20
years to achieve, as well as $500 million and the disparate efforts
of U.S. veterans.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of America's military defeat, it became a point
of honor and a political requirement in Washington that neither
diplomatic nor military relations could be opened with Hanoi until
questions about Americans missing in Vietnam were resolved. But it
was that search that ultimately proved to be the key to opening the
door between the U.S. and the Vietnamese militaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter explored the
possibility of opening diplomatic relations, but he gave up when
Vietnam asked for the equivalent of war reparations. During the
1980s there was no question of negotiations, because President
Ronald Reagan was convinced that Hanoi still held U.S. prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But there were other, unofficial contacts. Bobby Muller, an
early leader of Vietnam Veterans of America, whose anti-land-mine
group was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997, went to Hanoi in
the 1980s to press for an accounting of the American missing. He
got a cold response until he met face to face with the men he had
fought against.

   ``No one could raise the theme of reconciliation without the
veterans who paid the price of the war,'' said Muller, a
paraplegic. ``The veterans wanted relations, and we knew it was
incumbent upon us to extend a hand of friendship and move on.''

A HOMECOMING FOR TIGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Williams World Challenge takes up residence at the posh
Sherwood Country Club later this year and it's being billed as a
postseason showdown between the planet's top 10 golfers and two
special invitees.
</P>
<P>
   It's much more, though.
</P>
<P>
   It's a father and son reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-hole, stroke-play tournament benefits the Tiger Woods
Foundation and presents its namesake with a grand stage on which he
can test his game against the best there is in front of his first
coach, his father Earl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very special,'' Earl Woods said of the tournament's move
from Phoenix to the Conejo Valley. ``It is like a homecoming for
Tiger since he played in Southern California Junior Golf
Association events and at many of the leading country clubs in the
Los Angeles area.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Woods began working on this project three years ago as a
way to raise funds for his son's foundation, which strives to help
young people reach their potential, whatever that might be.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, Tiger Woods is a fitting role model.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone associated with golf knew he had potential.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone associated with golf now knows he's lived up to that
potential.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the best of the best are willing to come to
Southern California to play in a tournament hosted by a player who
is still cutting his professional teeth tells you about Woods'
standing among his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Greg McLaughlin, the tournament director, said official
invitations would go out Sept. 11, the day after completion of the
Canadian Open, but Sergio Garcia, defending champion Tom Lehman and
Davis Love III already have indicated they will play.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the money is huge.
</P>
<P>
   It is the silly season's biggest pot, $3.5 million, with the
winner earning $1 million. That's almost twice the prize money of
the Shark Shootout, which had a larger field.
</P>
<P>
   The last place finisher will earn $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is about more than money, though.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Woods will tell you it is all about golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The design of the golf course is superb and a worthy challenge
for the top-10 golfers of the world,'' he said. ``Essentially what
we are planning for is to see who can claim the title on the field
of battle as the number one golfer in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, for this weekend, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And the Williams World Challenge will give the gallery and
television viewers a side of Sherwood that never surfaced during
the Shark Shootout, when par was obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   That was a team event. The players took their best shot and this
time it is Sherwood's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the course will play tougher that it did for the Shark
Shootout,'' said Earl Woods. ``They had a very receptive view for
low scores and we won't have that. We want the best golfer to
emerge and for this to be a worthy test for these world-class
players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello world.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember that brash Nike television commercial that introduced a
young Woods to the masses when he turned professional after winning
three straight U.S. Amateur titles?
</P>
<P>
   That ticked off some people.
</P>
<P>
   Some other things did, too. But Woods overcame them all. He
listened to the greats that preceded him, players like Arnold
Palmer and Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Amd the father has seen the son change.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost is that he is very comfortable with who he
is,'' said Earl Woods. ``He has made the requisite personality
changes he had to make to adjust to the PGA Tour and he has grown
and matured, both physically and mentally. It is reassuring to see
him reflecting all of the things we used to fight over as a little
kid. He's doing them routinely now.''
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, these skirmishes were about golf.
</P>
<P>
   Not walking to the green before a short wedge shot to analyze
the contours or sticking with the same routine on putts.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods does both nowadays out of habit.
</P>
<P>
   We know where he got it.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Williams World Challenge begins in November, it will
be about more than charity, money and bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   It will be about a proud father watching his son demonstrate
that he has learned his lessons well. &QL;

 WASHINGTON: move on.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1988, Reagan sent Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and himself a Vietnam veteran, to
persuade Vietnam to help in the search for America's missing.
</P>
<P>
   Vessey's first breakthrough was at a meeting with Gen. Vo Nguyen
Giap, the legendary hero of Vietnam's wars against France and the
United States. In a private meeting in 1988, the former enemies
fell into an animated, two-hour conversation that ``covered the
waterfront,'' according to Vessey.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about how the war had been fought, the high cost in
human lives and what could be done to bring the countries together
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that conversation I sensed an almost immediate
improvement in relations with the government,'' Vessey recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Since that meeting the Pentagon has sent 100-member teams every
other month to Vietnam _ though not in military uniform _ to scour
the countryside for the remains of Americans. So far, 554 remains
of military personnel have been identified, and the missions have
concluded that there are no living American prisoners held by
Hanoi. About 1,400 cases are left to be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., led a Senate committee to
report on the missing in action. A veteran who became a national
anti-war figure, he teamed up with Sen. John McCain, the
conservative Republican from Arizona and a former prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driven by the sense that we really needed to end the
war,'' Kerry said. ``We Americans were acting and behaving as if
the war was still going on and Vietnamese were holding Americans as
prisoners.'' The committee determined that there were no live
prisoners, and four years later the two senators flanked President
Clinton when he announced the establishment of diplomatic relations
with Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, from the Vietnamese perspective, the Pentagon has
opened up its considerable trove of maps, documents and other
archival material to help Hanoi find the more than 200,000
communist soldiers it still lists as missing.
</P>
<P>
   For the Vietnamese military, the problem is not only to find its
missing. Since the end of the Cold War, the country's economic
plight has forced it to reduce its armed forces by more than half,
from 1.2 million to 480,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past few years the Vietnamese armed forces have gone
through a harsh change,'' said Capt. T. McCreary of the Pacific
command. ``They have moved to self-defense completely, to a small
armed force that's not bad and can still defend the country and
territorial waters.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for the missing in action has developed into regular
exchanges of U.S. and Vietnamese officers and military officials
and invitations to Vietnamese officers to attend seminars and
conferences in the United States _ though not training or access to
modern equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It also created a spirit that finally made Major Gaines' relief
mission possible. And that, in turn, led last month to Defense
Secretary Cohen's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen promised the Vietnamese government help in dealing with
issues left over from the war, including joint research into the
effects of Agent Orange, the defoliant that U.S. forces sprayed
from the air across the south during the war.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped persuade the Vietnamese to reopen negotiations on
a trade agreement with Washington to open up Vietnamese markets,
said Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States believes that the security of both of our
nations can be enhanced by working together,'' Cohen told the
Vietnamese.

NEGOTIATORS AGREE ON PROPOSAL TO BREAK MICROSOFT INTO 2 COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: See also MICROSOFT-SPLIT) By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The state and federal governments that are partners
in the antitrust suit against Microsoft agreed Wednesday to file a
joint proposal on remedies in the case and back a plan to break
Microsoft into two companies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The joint proposal had been in doubt earlier in the day but
Wednesday evening it included elements that state officials had
proposed to strengthen interim restrictions on Microsoft's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   A federal official said the states had made useful suggestions
``that have been incorporated in the draft.'' Some details were
still being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   A state official said that a majority of the 19 state attorneys
general involved had signed onto the plan, but that a few holdouts
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Some were saying they may file minority opinions _ something the
trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, has said he does not want.
But with a Friday deadline for the proposal to be filed with
Jackson, some of them may still be convinced to join the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Among those holding out, one official said, is Betty Montgomery,
the attorney general of Ohio, who has said publicly that she
opposes breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may well be a minority opinion offered,'' one senior
official said. ``But what it will be and how it will be expressed,
we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a state official said, remarks by Microsoft's
leaders helped harden opinions among some attorneys general and
rally support around the breakup plan. On Tuesday, William H.
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, went even further than other company
executives have in defending Microsoft's conduct, which Jackson
called ``predatory'' and illegal in his ruling early this month.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the public television program ``Nightly
Business Report,'' on Tuesday, Gates said: ``It's important to
understand that Microsoft is very clear that it has done absolutely
nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The state official said ``the text of Bill Gates' remarks has
been carefully read today, and he makes it hard for people to be
trusting.'' But Microsoft asserts that it will win the case on
appeal and has every right to state its convictions in public.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said
in an interview with The Washington Post that the company had done
nothing wrong and saw no reason to alter its business practices.
Some attorneys general, working that day on enforcement mechanisms,
``saw this as a real slap in the face,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The joint state-federal plan calls for breaking Microsoft
roughly in half. One-half would be the operating-system company,
the other would hold everything else, including Microsoft's
applications software, such as the word processor Word and the
spreadsheet program Excel, and the Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   But since it is likely that a breakup plan, if approved by the
judge, would be stayed during legal appeals, the proposal includes
a range of interim restrictions on Microsoft's conduct. Among them
are a plan to publish a uniform price list for Windows and to give
other companies free access to the software interface codes for
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for these so-called conduct remedies to remain in
place for three years if the breakup is implemented or 10 years if
it is not. The states want to modify that element by extending the
duration in either case, but no decision had been made this
evening. Many of those conduct remedies were debated during the
court-mediated settlement talks that broke apart early this month.
Then, one clear concern of the states was that a strong enforcement
mechanism must be put in place, to be overseen perhaps by a
court-appointed special master.
</P>
<P>
   The states say they are trying to strengthen the enforcement
provisions of the conduct remedies, noting that if a breakup plan
is overturned on appeal, the conduct remedies will be the only
remaining restraints on Microsoft's behavior. The exact mechanisms
of the enforcement proposal are still being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft calls all of these remedy proposals extreme and
unwarranted. If they are in fact offered, the company will ask the
judge to hold lengthy and detailed hearings, with witnesses and the
opportunity to obtain government documents on the issue, before he
makes his decision.

FIGHTIN' WORDS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a
fight?'' asks Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) in ``Fight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   David Fincher's provocative film works on the premise that in
world where we have been anesthetized by consumerism (``The things
you own end up owning you''), you need the .... beat out of you in
order to feel anything. And while his protagonists spend a good
part of the movie brutally pounding each other with bare fists, the
audience is likely to feel it's taken a few shots as well.
</P>
<P>
   The story open with a nameless narrator (Edward Norton) tied to
chair with Tyler holding a gun in his mouth. The narrator then goes
on to recount how he ended up in this predicament, including
setting up the Fight Club. The members of which are men who feel
emasculated by today's society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a generation of men raised by women. I'm beginning to
wonder if another woman is what we really need,'' Tyler intones.
(Think journalist Susan Faludi's recent book about men ``Stiffed''
_ these guys have no interest in getting in touch with their
feminine side, only expressing their rage, not only with their
fists but in terrorist acts, including a some gross ones involving
food and bodily functions.)
</P>
<P>
   The first rule of Fight Club, according to Tyler, is that you
don't talk about Fight Club.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule of ``Fight Club'' is don't watch it with a date.
OK, maybe if you have as weird a relationship as Marla (Helena
Bonham Carter) and the narrator. (``Marla was like that cut on the
roof of your mouth that would go away if you'd stop tonguing it,
but you can't.'')
</P>
<P>
   The two meet because they are fellow support-group tourists,
meaning they crash meetings of people who have come together
because they are dying of something awful. It's only there that the
narrator, who lives by his Ikea catalog, can express any emotions,
crying into the chest of Bob (Meat Loaf), a former bodybuilder who
has developed breasts (we'll skip the more graphic description)
because of his testicular cancer. (Marla shows up there, too,
gender aside).
</P>
<P>
   Like the tiny scenes of pornographic material that Tyler splices
into children's movies, ``Fight Club'' ends up subliminally
imprinted on your brain. The film is a montage of consumer goods
(Krispy Kremes, Gucci, Ikea, etc.), violence, grotesque images,
including a raid on a dumpster that contains fat removed by
liposuction, which is then used to make expensive soap that is sold
in ritzy department stores (``We were selling rich women their own
fat asses back to them'').
</P>
<P>
   Now, does this make a good film? Yes, but with qualifications.
Fincher (``Seven'') is an immensely talented director but the film
could have been as effective with less. It's a bit strange that a
meditation about excess seems excessive, but that point can be
argued. Nevertheless, along with ``American Beauty,'' ``Being Jon
Malkovich'' and ``Magnolia,'' ``Fight Club'' was one of the more
interesting (even while being irritating) films of last year.
</P>
<P>
   You should be careful who you see it with, however; you could
end up in a fight. &QL; 
(BEGIN ITAL)``Fight Club'' is priced for rental on VHS ($106.99).
The DVD is $34.98 and includes commentary by Fincher, Pitt and
Carter, five deleted scenes and a making-of documentary.(END ITAL)

BREATHING NEW FIRE INTO `BEOWULF'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   ``Beowulf'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Translated by Seamus Heaney &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Epic poetry &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $25 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite being the bane of English Lit students seemingly since
the invention of the printing press, ``Beowulf'' is a fantastic,
crackling good yarn.
</P>
<P>
   It always was, of course, but it has taken the Nobel
Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney's astoundingly warm, briskly
paced, blazingly readable reworking/demothballing to bring this
out. He has done what all the stuffy academics with their dozens of
translations couldn't: remind the world that ``Beowulf'' is, first
and foremost, a tale, a good-vs.-ultimate-evil saga that was told
around campfires and hearths centuries before it was ever committed
to paper.
</P>
<P>
   More than a millennium separates us from the unknown writer who
penned this epic poem about a hero, his journeys to the land of the
Danes, and his battles with the monster Grendel, Grendel's mother
and, finally, 50 years later, a dragon. And over the centuries, the
images _ a valiant young hero; an epic journey; flashing swords; a
battle against an inhuman, overwhelmingly powerful, fire-breathing
foe; great castles; armies; minstrels spinning their tales _ have
been codified into our basic imagery of ancient times. ``Beowulf''
is the starting point, the literary Rosetta Stone, the place before
all the other places, the repository and starting line for so many
subsequent, sweeping sagas of dragons and men in chain mail and
heroic deeds done long, long ago.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's actually fun to read.
</P>
<P>
   Heaney's genius lies in how he moves the story along right from
the beginning:
</P>
<P>
   ``''So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by/and the kings who ruled
them had courage and greatness. We have heard of those princes'
heroic campaigns.''''
</P>
<P>
   Compare this to the popular 1973 translation by Michael
Alexander:
</P>
<P>
   ``''Attend!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard of the thriving of the throne of Denmark,/how
the folk-kings flourished in former days/how those royal athelings
earned that glory.''''
</P>
<P>
   Heaney certainly cuts to the chase. He gathers us around him,
tells us in language both simple and profound of Beowulf's epic
life and heartbreaking death, and moves the narrative along with
the grace and energy of a born storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   He writes action scenes with a clarity and sense of drama that
great film directors would envy. His reinterpretation of the epic
battle between an aged Beowulf and the gold-hoarding dragon _ in
which Beowulf is assisted by the brave soldier Wiglaf _ has the
fire and immediacy of an action movie, the dying-light poignancy of
Shakespeare:
</P>
<P>
   ``''Once again the king
</P>
<P>
   gathered his strength and drew a stabbing knife
</P>
<P>
   he carried on his belt, sharpened for battle.
</P>
<P>
   He stuck it deep into the dragon's flank.
</P>
<P>
   Beowulf dealt it a deadly wound.
</P>
<P>
   They had killed the enemy, courage quelled his life;
</P>
<P>
   that pair of kinsmen, partners in nobility,
</P>
<P>
   had destroyed the foe. So every man should act,
</P>
<P>
   be at hand when needed; but now, for the king,
</P>
<P>
   this would be the last of his many labours
</P>
<P>
   and triumphs in the world.''''
</P>
<P>
   Notice how much ground Heaney covers in such a small space:
Combat, triumph, the tragedy of Beowulf dying after his finest
fight. But more than that, Heaney's ``Beowulf'' reads like a story,
an entertainment for a winter's night. All of academia and lectures
and long-winded papers aside, that's the starting point, just as
``Beowulf'' is the starting point for so much literature that has
come after. We are separated by more than 1,000 years from the
original poet, whoever he was, who got this all down on paper, but
thanks to Seamus Heaney, his tale feels fresh today. &QL;

ELIAN'S FATHER SEEKS TO INTERVENE IN ASYLUM CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Juan Miguel Gonzalez on Wednesday asked a federal
appeals court to let him intervene in the asylum case involving his
son, Elian, and to oust the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez,
from the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   If the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, granted
both requests, the case could become moot and the father and son
could return to Cuba. Attorneys retained by Lazaro Gonzalez said on
Monday that the boy was seized last weekend as part of a plot to
end the case.
</P>
<P>
   The father's brief, submitted by his lawyer, Gregory B. Craig,
condemned Lazaro Gonzalez as ``an uninvited meddler in Elian's
life'' who maintained ``a circus atmosphere'' in which the boy was
``paraded every day in front of mobs gathered in the streets of
Miami.'' The brief was filed in response to a motion filed earlier
this week in which lawyers for the great-uncle asked that a
independent guardian be appointed for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Craig also argued against a court order sought by those lawyers
that demanded that the boy be kept away from Cuban diplomatic
property where he might be out of the jurisdiction of the appeals
court. ``To Juan Miguel,'' Craig wrote, ``the possibility of taking
Elian to an embassy or hiding behind diplomatic immunity is
non-existent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also filed a brief on Wednesday quoting a
government-appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Paulina M. Kernberg of
Cornell University's Weill Medical College, as saying after a two
and a half hour visit that ``Elian and his father appear to enjoy a
rich, varied relationship.'' Kernberg wrote that ``a visit by the
Miami relatives would not be advisable in their current angry
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Other visitors are being allowed. One of Elian's cousins flew
here from Cuba on Wednesday night to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Visas were issued in Havana for four friends of the boy, and for
a parent to accompany each child. They are expected to arrive on
Thursday and remain in the United States for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elian spent his second day on Wednesday with his father,
stepmother and baby half-brother at a secluded estate, the
Carmichael farm at the 1,100-acre Wye River Institute, on
Maryland's eastern shore. The family is living rent-free in a house
owned by Nina Houghton, a philanthropist who is the widow of an
heir to the Corning Glass fortune. The Cuban diplomatic mission is
providing their food.
</P>
<P>
   In another forum, the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled a
hearing for next Wednesday on the raid in which armed immigration
agents took Elian out of his great-uncle's home in Miami on
Saturday. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., said on Wednesday that more hearings
may be scheduled later in the week, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that Senate Republicans do not want to conduct
drawn-out hearings on a raid that most Americans supported, Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah, the committee chairman, said he would not call
the Miami relatives to testify. He said he may call their lawyers
and said he would invite Juan Miguel Gonzalez to appear. If not,
Craig, his lawyer, would be called.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, the Miami relatives continued to push
for a reunion with the boy. They brought with them several
Cuban-American doctors and psychologists who said Elian should be
permitted to see Marisleysis Gonzalez, the 21-year-old cousin who
helped care for Elian during the past five months, to help him cope
with whatever stress he may be experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lydia Usategui, a child psychiatrist who was in the house at
the time of the raid, said during a news conference on Capitol Hill
with the Miami relatives that ``he needs to see this family as
quickly as possible'' because the last time he saw them was when
they were being restrained at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   But the affidavit of Kernberg, the government's child
psychiatrist, said that the boy was clearly happy with his father
and that his removal from Lazaro Gonzalez's home ``although clearly
startling and frightening, was in all likelihood not a traumatic
experience producing lasting effects.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Elian had told his stepmother ``that he has a secret
love, `Mary.''' Kernberg continued, ``In my observations of Elian,
there were indications that `Mary' (his cousin Marisleysis
Gonzalez) may be an idealized love, rather than a maternal figure.
His feelings for Marisleysis are similar to the romantic feelings
of a school boy for his teacher or a wished-for girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Kernberg said that a visit by angry relatives ``would likely be
disruptive for the child, who demands a quiet period of emotional
healing from the last few weeks of stress.'' She suggested that the
relatives ``may benefit from counseling'' and that instead of
visits now, they should send letters, photographs and cassette
tapes with messages.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's court filings by Craig and the Justice Department
came in response to a motion filed on Tuesday by the lawyers
retained by Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They asked the appellate court to make the Justice Department
allow them, the Miami relatives and a Miami psychologist to see the
boy, and asked the court to appoint a guardian to look after the
boy's rights. Both Craig and the Justice Department scoffed at
those requests as unnecessary, since the boy was now in the custody
of his surviving parent.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez's request to intervene, and his request to
remove his uncle from the asylum case, went far beyond simply
answering the demands of the Miami lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In their filings this week, the lawyers for the Miami family
alleged there was a plot to shut down the case entirely, thwarting
their effort to gain asylum for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost assuredly, the INS, Juan Gonzalez and Cuban government
functionaries are working on a devastated, displaced and isolated
child to secure a repudiation of his asylum claim and thus mootness
of the appeal,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Miami attorneys, Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, said on
Wednesday that the legal moves by Juan Gonzalez and the government
had been foreshadowed by a Justice Department negotiator. ``The
last thing I asked him was if you get the boy and give him to the
father, doesn't it moot our appeal?'' Garcia-Pedrosa said. ``And he
said, `Yes, it does.'''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have accused the administration of
colluding with Craig to organize the raid last Saturday and bring
the asylum case to an end. The administration has insisted its only
motive in seizing Elian last Saturday was protecting his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Craig would not say on Wednesday what he would do if the motion
to intervene and to remove Lazaro Gonzalez are both granted. The
court could deny them both, or allow both Juan Miguel Gonzalez and
Lazaro Gonzalez to participate in the case through written briefs
and motions and in oral arguments scheduled for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's brief said his client should be allowed to intervene
``to speak for himself and to assert his rights as a father'' and
``to speak on behalf of Elian, who has no other suitable
representative in these proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that ``lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez _ and they are
Lazaro's lawyers, noyt Elian's _ seek to use machination and legal
sleight of hand to turn this court into the arbiter of an
intra-family dispute in which the primary antagonist is too distant
a relative to be considered even `extended family' under Florida
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig wrote that while it may once have been proper for Lazaro
Gonzalez to speak for Elian in the period immediately after his
rescue, it was no longer acceptable given the arrival of the boy's
father in the United States. He said the fact that Lazaro Gonzalez
was so ``brazenly defiant'' that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service ``was compelled to execute a rescue by force of arms''
showed that the uncle was not dedicated to Elian's interests.

LAUNCH OF SPACE SHUTTLE POSTPONED A THIRD TIME 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Stormy weather at emergency runways in
Spain and Morocco on Wednesday thwarted a third try to launch the
shuttle Atlantis on a space station repair mission.
</P>
<P>
   NASA was unsure when it would schedule its next attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest the space agency could reserve use of the Air Force
radar-tracking equipment required for every commercial, military or
NASA launching from the East Coast is May 18. However, NASA is
holding May 3 and 4 for the launching of an unmanned rocket here
with a new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   A swap between the shuttle and the weather satellite is
possible, said Dave King, NASA's shuttle launch director. He said
it would be later this week before a decision is reached.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle itself will require at least three days for
reservicing of its electrical power generation system.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis commander Jim Halsell and crew mates Scott ``Doc''
Horowitz, Jeff Williams, Mary Ellen Weber, Susan Helms, Jim Voss
and Yuri Usachev, a Russian cosmonaut, planned to fly to Houston
early Thursday and resume their training at the Johnson Space
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts will likely remain in the medical quarantine they
entered before Easter until a new launch date has been selected,
said NASA spokesman James Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of this week's three launch delays was $1.85 million in
unused fuel and labor.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Atlantis and its crew were nine minutes from
liftoff when launch and mission control teams gave up on finding an
overseas runway with weather acceptable for an emergency shuttle
landing.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle rules require clear weather at one of three runways in
Moron or Zaragoza in Spain or Ben Guerir in Morocco. Such a distant
runway would serve as a refuge of last resort in case the Atlantis
crew experienced a rocket-engine problem late in the 8{-minute
climb to orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Rain ruled out both sites in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In Morocco high crosswinds at the runway and a cloud deck at
5,000 feet ruled out Ben Guerir. Hopeful that conditions in Morocco
would improve, flight control teams waited until the last moment
before calling a postponement.
</P>
<P>
   High winds at the shuttle's emergency runway at Kennedy also
caused postponements on Monday and Tuesday. The Kennedy runway must
be available to the shuttle crew in case the astronauts experience
an engine problem early in their ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's postponement was only the fifth time in 98 shuttle
missions since 1981 that bad weather at an emergency overseas
runway has caused or contributed to a delay.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is eager to begin the 10-day mission, which is to
jump-start the stalled construction of the yet-to-be-inhabited
station.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis crew is to prepare the first two modules of the
station, joined in orbit in late 1998, for the arrival of the
Russian crew module in July and the first resident crew in late
October.

BUSH STRESSES BIPARTIANSHIP IN VISIT TO WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For once, George W. Bush was not acting like the
Washington outsider.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his rare visits to the nation's capital, and his first
since clinching the Republican presidential nomination, the Texas
governor Wednesday huddled privately with a Republican and a
Democratic senator on Social Security. He burnished his foreign
policy credentials by meeting with the Russian foreign minister,
Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   And he proved once again that he is a master fund-raiser,
bringing in $21.3 million for his party at a black tie dinner that
was a who's who of lobbyists and businesses with interests before
the government. Those represented included AT&AMP;T, the National Rifle
Association, Philip Morris Cos., the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association and the Chevron Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he was toasted by the Washington establishment, Bush
tried to create some distance from it, criticizing ``eight years of
excessive partisanship and fingerpointing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore administration has been the most relentlessly
partisan administration in our nation's history,'' Bush told the
crowd of about 1,500 Republican officials and lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes some in our own party have responded in kind,''
he said. ``Americans have seen a cycle of bitterness: an arms race
of anger. And both parties bear some of the blame. The legacy:
cynicism, a generic disgust. A feeling by too many Americans that
it doesn't matter who wins the election, you see they're all the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, cited the fund-raising event in
criticizing his Republican rival. Speaking to reporters in
Connecticut, Gore suggested that Bush's positions on issues had
been influenced by his donors, including the Philip Morris Cos. and
Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle
Association, who was a dinner co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fighting for common sense restrictions on the availability
of guns, but Governor Bush is receiving all this financial help
from the NRA and he is opposed to these common sense
restrictions,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush every trip to the nation's capital in this campaign
represents a delicate balancing act. Though Bush was an informal
adviser to his father when he was president, he is positioning
himself as an outsider from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He has cultivated relations with Republicans on Capitol Hill yet
at the same time stands as what he terms a new kind of Republican _
implicitly criticizing the Republican Congress that was led by Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Bush came to Washington for a fund-raiser, he
included a somewhat triumphal tour through the Capitol, where he
was surrounded by Republican lawmakers. This time, he stayed blocks
away from the Capitol and any similar images, instead meeting with
lawmakers from his room at the J.W. Marriott hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, his communications director, said he had meetings
and receptions planned from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. ``It was easier
for him to be able to have the kind of meetings he wanted to have
here without going over to the Hill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his wife, Laura, Bush did make one midday appearance
at a Republican women's forum that seemed the pinnacle of
Oprah-style politics, with the Bushes, two Republican lawmakers and
a series of guests _ young students and teachers _ all sitting on
chairs and couches arranged like a TV talk show set.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, a large poster of girls and women acted as a
backdrop emblazoned with the words ``For Our Daughters.''
Introducing her husband, Laura Bush said, ``Since this is about our
daughters, I think I'll talk about our own daughters and the way
he's been as a dad.'' She said, ``He actually got up in the middle
of the night and fed the babies with me and changed the diapers.''
</P>
<P>
   When he came on stage to cheers and applause, Bush thanked his
wife, saying, ``you read it just like I wrote it.'' He quickly
added that he was happy to be with ``three really brilliant
women,'' referring to his wife and the two moderators, Rep.
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such education events have left Bush running well among women
who in past elections have favored Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the day Bush held closed-door meetings at his hotel,
and senior members of his campaign team planned to stay in
Washington for the rest of the week to meet with senior
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the meeting with Ivanov, Bush held a one-hour
session on Social Security with Sens. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and Bob
Kerrey, D-Neb..
</P>
<P>
   The two have sponsored a wide-ranging measure to overhaul the
Social Security system that includes as one element individual
accounts that would be opened at citizens' birth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointed to that meeting later at the Republican fund-raiser
to show that he was willing to work with Democrats. Kerrey, who is
the chairman of Gore's campaign in Nebraska, but differs with the
vice president on Social Security said he was not bothered by the
mention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it produces some bipartisan middle ground on this issue
I'll think this meeting has been worthwhile,'' Kerrey said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been showcasing Democrats all this week. But for all
his protests about partisanship, he and the other Republican
speakers were unsparing of Gore at the party's gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican National Committee chairman, said,
``Welcome to the RNC's Al Gore retirement party.'' And Bush lashed
into his opponent calling him ``an integral part of an
administration that has waged the same old Washington blame game.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Last week was Earth Day. Unfortunately for Al Gore's
campaign every day is scorched earth day. And it's time to clean up
the toxic environment in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed, ``Make no mistake about this. When I am attacked in
this campaign I will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   As the keynote speaker, Bush helped his party raise an expected
$21.3 million Wednesday night, a one-night record, including the
unregulated unlimited donations that his primary opponent, Sen.
John McCain had campaigned against.

RUSSIA WANTS TO RESOLVE DISPUTE OVER MISSILES, SAY U.S. OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a second round of intensive meetings with the
Russian foreign minister about the missile defense system that the
United States wants to develop over Russian objections, senior
Clinton administration officials said Wednesday they had detected a
readiness by Moscow to explore all avenues of a possible resolution
to the looming standoff.
</P>
<P>
   But they acknowledged that Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and the
chief Russian arms-control negotiator, Georgy Memedev, had revealed
no significant shift in their opposition to the missile defense
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In effort to show the United States was standing firm on its
position, the State Department said there was a three-prong
approach described as the ``three D's.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be no ``deferral'' of the missile defense issue,
there would be no ``destruction'' of the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty and there would be no ``decoupling'' of the treaty that
regulates how both countries reduce their nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before Ivanov spoke, the chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., appeared to
be urging that negotiations with the Russians be suspended during
the final days of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   He said his committee would be willing to consider amendments to
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty but only after President Clinton
leaves office. Helms derided the president for wanting a ``final
photo-op'' with Russians before leaving the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of Ivanov, who was on the second day of a three-day
visit, appeared to be to gauge the political situation in the
United States before Clinton meets with Russia's president-elect
Vladimir Putin in Moscow in early June. Ivanov also met Wednesday
with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican Party's
presumptive presidential nominee, and had a 90-minute encounter
with 20 Republican and Democratic senators on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they believed the Russians were
judging whether they have to make a decision now and deal with
Clinton or whether they can gamble and wait for the next
administration. Because Clinton would like an arms control treaty,
the administration is trying to convince the Russians that they are
better off to take a deal that they know rather than one they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   As one administration official said, ``The big sell is: `Take a
sure bet now, don't take a risk in the future.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the differences between the Clinton
administration and Moscow is the development of a limited missile
defense that the administration says is necessary to defend the
United States against ``rogue'' states like North Korea and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   National missile defense systems are prohibited in the 1972 ABM
treaty that is based on the principle that the only way to
encourage reductions in strategic arms is restrict ways to counter
them. But the administration argues it is seeking only a modest
change to the treaty, which would essentially remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, conservative Republicans believe that the ABM
treaty is an antiquated relic of the Cold War and should be
scrapped so as to allow a more robust missile defense than the
administration is proposing.
</P>
<P>
   As they counter the administration on national missile defense,
the Russians are urging Washington to agree to deep cuts in long
range nuclear arms as part of a Start III accord.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the meetings Wednesday between Ivanov and the administration,
the Russians offered two counter proposals, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The first, dealing with curbing the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, involved expanding the current Missile Technology Control
Regime, an international accord that limits the range of missiles a
country can deploy.
</P>
<P>
   The second proposal involved working with the United States to
cooperate on theater missile defense systems that are allowed under
the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the State Department said the administration was
``interested in and intrigued by'' the fact that the proposals
showed that Russia understood new threats posed by nations like
North Korea and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration also publicly went out of its way to
state that there was, according to James Rubin, the State
Department spokesman, ``no chance of deferral'' of national missile
defense and amending the treaty
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the Russians would like to avoid this issue,'' Rubin
said at the State Department on Wednesday. But Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who met with Ivanov on Tuesday and Wednesday,
was ``making clear that deferral is not an option,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said in a speech to the National Press Club that the
administration would be making a ``fatal mistake'' if it went ahead
with the missile defense system. He urged the White House not to
``hurry'' on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Using a quotation from an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story, ``The
Swimmers,'' he said that America had been described as ``the
willingness of heart.'' ``There is every ground to apply his words
to Russia,'' he countered.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's new government requested Wednesday's meeting Bush, who
has made clear he would oppose any Clinton deal with the Russians
that limited the ability of a new president to make his own
agreement with them.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said it was unlikely that an agreement
involving a complicated package of support _ from the Russians,
from NATO allies, and from Congress _ would be ready by the Moscow
summit. ``That's not on,'' said one senior official.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin outlined this deal at the State Department on Wednesday,
saying: ``Our view of what's' best for the United States of
America, and that is to have a treaty that allows us to reduce our
strategic forces with the Russians, get deeper cuts than we have
now, reduce the nuclear danger that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Rubin said, the United States wanted to
``allow a limited national missile defense that would allow us to
defend against a small number of North Korean or Iranian missile
warheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the theater missile defense proposal of the Russians,
countries that were under immediate threat _ for example, South
Korea from North Korea _ would have a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   But such a system would protect not give universal coverage to
the United States, a factor that made it impossible for the
administration to accept, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov fielded questions from senators Wednesday afternoon. Much
of the focus was on the war in Chechnya and the brutal way that
Moscow was fighting. In response, Ivanov asked for help in fighting
terrorism, congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Ivanov, accompanied by Albright, was taken to
the secure conference room, known as the ``tank.'' He met with the
deputy secretary of defense, Walter B. Slocombe, and other
officials.
</P>
<P>
   As an opening gambit for the visit, Albright took Ivanov to
dinner Tuesday night at Les Pinasse, a French restaurant at the St.
Regis Hotel. In doing so, she abandoned earlier plans to take him
to The Palm, which is frequented by Washington lobbyists.

<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ On the sixth day of Passover, while the
kitchen staff rushed to prepare a lunch buffet featuring ``matzo
pizza,'' Ruth Goldschmidt slipped into a sparkling blue pool with
22 other women for a water aerobics class.
</P>
<P>
   The women had few concerns but keeping count as they flexed
their arms to the piped-in refrains of the song ``We Want the
Funk.'' The children and grandchildren were in the care of baby
sitters, or off ice skating or being entertained by a
ventriloquist; the husbands were playing golf or tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Until three years ago, Goldschmidt would have been home in
Brooklyn, N.Y., making yet another Passover meal from the
restricted set of kosher ingredients permitted for Passover use.
Now she and her husband, Fred, and their children and grandchildren
have joined a growing number of observant Jews who leave their
homes to make the Passover exodus to resort hotels for the holiday,
which ends at sundown on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   These resorts are a far cry and a long way from the Catskills,
where a previous generation gathered to celebrate Passover at
hotels that remained kosher year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish families are now going off to an increasing number of
luxury destinations in Arizona, Las Vegas, Palm Springs, Calif.,
the Caribbean, Switzerland and Italy that cater to the Passover
crowd. Most of these resorts are not kosher year-round, but are
buffed into Passover condition under the watchful eyes of rabbis
and trained kosher chefs. Travel agents who specialize in a Jewish
clientele estimate that Passover travel has increased 40 to 50
percent in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing like having Passover in your own home. But
the family grows, thank God, and you get older and you just don't
have the strength to make Passover anymore,'' said Goldschmidt, as
a waiter trotted back and forth from the kitchen bearing rib
steaks, grilled tuna and vegetable souffles to a table long enough
to seat all 16 members of the extended Goldschmidt clan.
</P>
<P>
   Three ballrooms in this city's Wyndham Resort and Spa, formerly
the Bonaventure, were filled with tables, some for two, some for as
many as 36, seating more than 1,400 people in all. Babies ate in
laps and high chairs, great-grandfathers watched in wheelchairs,
and boys tired of sitting raced up and down the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the scene, cell phone in hand, Sam Lasko, who runs the
family business that organizes Passover holidays in this hotel,
said, ``Instead of having to prepare and prepare, the mother comes
down and sits like a queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasko Family Kosher Tours started in this hotel 12 years ago,
with 320 guests. This year he has more than 5,000 guests in four
hotels. The cost? About $6,000 per couple at the Wyndham _ and more
at some of Lasko's other locations.
</P>
<P>
   To the uninitiated, Passover appears to be a one-night ritual _
a Seder dinner during which Jews retell the story of the exodus
from slavery in Egypt. But to more observant Jews, Passover is an
eight-day marathon. The first two days and the last two days are
considered full holidays, when no work is done and the use of
electricity or cars is banned, like on the Sabbath. The whole
holiday is preceded by weeks of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Like many women, Goldschmidt used to start cleaning her house of
chometz _ or leavened bread _ as soon as Purim, another significant
Jewish holiday, ended, about a month before, said her daughter,
Linda Nordlichter. ``She would vacuum and wash the closets, the
drawers, the drapes, polish all the silver until it shined,''
Nordlichter said. ``When we finally had the Seder, my mother used
to fall asleep. That's how tired she was.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel Passover is becoming a regular tradition for more and
more families as Orthodox Jewish women work outside the home and
have little time to bake honey cakes or grate horseradish as their
mothers once did. Some see this new tradition as a step of
liberation for women. But at some of the tables here, it sets off a
debate about whether a ready-made Passover dilutes tradition,
cheats the children, or neglects the whole notion of commemorating
the holiday with a personal sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were reluctant because we're a family that really values
the traditions and were afraid they would be lost here,'' said Leah
Polin, from Skokie, Ill., as she held her granddaughter on her lap.
``There's something to seeing and smelling and feeling the hours of
Passover preparation, something that people remember for a
lifetime. We feel it's important for the kids to experience that.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, the night before Passover, children brush bread crumbs
from the windowsills with feathers by candlelight. In a hotel, the
traditions are far less quaint. The process starts a month before,
said Rabbi Mordechai Smolarcik and Rabbi Kenneth Brander, who
together supervised the kosher transformation at this hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen appliances are cleaned with steam guns and pressure
hoses. The ovens and braziers are blasted with blow torches. Behind
the hotel, a tank is filled with 300 gallons of water and heated
with propane. The kitchen trays, utensils and plate covers are
placed in a cage, lifted with a fork lift and dunked into the hot
water, to ensure that any remnants of non-kosher food are removed.
</P>
<P>
   Two freezer trucks full of food supplies are parked behind the
hotel. Keith Stuart, the executive chef, said that he used 1,500
pounds of gefilte fish, 3,150 boxes of matzo, 75,000 eggs and 140
cases of potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   But the menus that Stuart and his minions produce range far from
standard Passover fare. At Tuesday's lunch buffet, guests heaped
portobello mushrooms, brook trout, three-cheese souffle and matzo
pizza on their plates. There was even a macaroni-and-cheese dish.
Pasta is usually considered chometz, but this brand was made with
matzo flour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it come a long way in terms of what can be produced
with flour and water,'' said Rabbi Smolarcik. ``For many years,
there was no kosher for Passover ketchup.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Passover macaroni comes another new phenomenon:
Orthodox matriarchs who have never been host to a Passover in their
own homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to bronze me some day as the woman who never
made Pesach,'' said Judy Fishman, a grandmother of 14, using the
Hebrew word for Passover. She has been taking her family to hotels
for Passover for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just play with my grandchildren, and not be in the
kitchen working,'' Fishman said. ``Passover is supposed to
celebrate the exodus from slavery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they never released the women,'' said her mother, Molly
Bolnick, who is 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the final exodus, it's just fine with me,'' Fishman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want,'' Bolnick said, turning to Alan Katler, a friend
whose family shares a table with the Fishmans, ``you do the
Passover. Next year in Alan's house.''
</P>
<P>
   Katler asked: ``How about Arizona? I say, next year in
Arizona.''

OPENING OF TROUT SEASON IN EASTERN SIERRA WILL BE BIG ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL A. ANASTASI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES _ No more waiting. Finally, it is next year.
</P>
<P>
   It is the year you dreamed of when the wind was so cold it
sliced through your heaviest jacket. It is the year you dreamed of
as you sat miserably in the rain and wondered why you drove five
hours and left work early. It is the year you dreamed of when
checking your bait became the highlight of every hour.
</P>
<P>
   This is the year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's Eastern Sierra trout opener is widely expected to be
the best in a decade or two. Only the sorriest, dorkiest or most
unlucky anglers will fail to catch their five-fish limits _ you
know, the same kind of guy who's the only one in the office not to
get in on that winning $20 million Lotto ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opener,'' said Gary Hooper of Rick's Sporting Goods, an
angling landmark here off the main drag in Mammoth Village, ``is
going to be killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick's will be open all night Friday (and offering a $1 spooling
special) and early Saturday for good reason: Last year, an
estimated 50,000 anglers from the San Fernando Valley and
surrounding area fished the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Most make the 300-mile drive after work on Friday (a fact that
has not slipped past the CHP), sleep for an hour or two and wake
before dawn for a shot at catching a fish that costs a buck-fifty
at your local supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, misses the point. The trout opener is a
tradition for many L.A. families. For some, it's their only
significant outdoors experience of the year.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, the waters of June Lake were
mirror-like, reflecting the snow-capped mountains that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   And even those who receive speeding tickets should be smiling on
Saturday as a rare combination of weather conditions has created an
ideal trout-fishing weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There is mild, spring weather in the Eastern Sierra _ daytime
temperatures have routinely reached into the 80s in Bishop _ yet a
tremendous amount of water is available for the region's lakes and
streams.
</P>
<P>
   The winter started late and ended early but was unusually
intense. As a result, the snowpack is 120 to 175 percent of normal.
There is plenty of water, little ice and, as a bonus, early
wildflower blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Most important to anglers, the Department of Fish and Game has
had far more time to plant waterways with trout, and they took
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you,'' said John Frederickson of June
Lake,``it's going to be a very easy opener.''
</P>
<P>
   The DFG has planted 1.1 million catchable trout in Mono County
waters and nearly 500,000 in Inyo County. In Crowley Lake alone,
the DFG has planted 450,000 trout, including 50,000 browns.
</P>
<P>
   And those figures don't include fish planted by various area
chambers of commerce to spice things up. They plant mostly bigger,
trophy-sized fish, including many of the famed Alpers trout.
</P>
<P>
   Because the region's lakes have been ice-free for so long, the
fish have been feeding longer. The DFG is expecting fish to be 20
percent bigger than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Significantly bigger,'' is how DFG biologist Curtis Milliron
put it.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast calls for clear skies with strong winds today and
Friday. As usual, there will be a brief fireworks show over Crowley
Lake to mark the season's official opening, one hour before
sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers need to be especially careful if they run into ice at
the higher elevations. Many of the lakes that are normally frozen
over at this time of the year are not. Do not be deceived by a
lake's thin ice sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing licenses cost $28.10 this year, an increase of $1.05. A
second-rod stamp, valid in lakes, costs $9.20.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grass is green,'' said Mickey Frederickson, John's wife,
``and the fish are jumping.'' &QL;

AT&AMP;T WIRELESS INITIAL OFFERING GETS LUKEWARM RESPONSE 

</HEADLINE>
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Individual investors who have been frustrated in
recent years as they have tried to buy into hot initial offerings
of high-technology stocks may be in for a pleasant surprise on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While AT&AMP;T's sale of shares meant to track the company's
far-flung wireless communications unit will be the nation's richest
initial offering, the sheer size of the deal, 360 million shares,
appears to have conspired with the recent market turmoil to ensure
that the offering will be warm at best.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, AT&AMP;T agreed to sell the shares for $29.50 each,
near the middle of the offering's expected range. That means AT&AMP;T
raised about $10.6 billion. But few analysts expect an explosive
first-day jump.
</P>
<P>
   For individual investors, that may mean that they will be able
to buy the new shares, to trade under the ticket symbol AWE, at
prices close to those paid by mutual funds and pension funds. But
as Groucho Marx might have put it, they may want to be wary of any
initial offering that would let them buy in.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons the big institutions are not snapping up the
shares, despite the fact that AT&AMP;T's wireless unit is growing by
more than 40 percent a year and has annual revenue of more than $8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutions obviously can be wrong, but they tend to be
wrong when they get into a herd mentality on the upside,'' said
Michael Mahoney, director for telecommunications investing at
Dresdner RCM Global Investors. ``This deal is not getting the
institutions particularly excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney manages about $400 million in communications investments
and said he declined to buy into the offering. He added:
``Individuals usually want to get into IPOs because they read about
these eye-popping first-day trades. That's probably not going to be
the case with this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarcity is often a big reason that technology offerings blast
off. Sycamore Networks, for instance, really has developed
innovative optical networking technologies. But it certainly did
not hurt that company's initial offering last fall that the public
had access to only 7.5 million shares, less than 10 percent of the
78 million shares then outstanding. That deal raised $284 million.
</P>
<P>
   Proportionally, AT&AMP;T's offering is not overwhelming; only about
15.6 percent of the wireless shares are to be sold in Thursday's
offering. But the overall size of the deal _ almost double the
previous record of $5.5 billion raised by United Parcel Service in
November _ has sharply reduced the scarcity factor.
</P>
<P>
   But there seem to be at least three other factors that have been
important in putting a small damper on AT&AMP;T's offering:
perhaps-unfounded concerns about the wireless unit's management,
the proliferation of other investment opportunities that has
emerged from the market downturn and the fact that AT&AMP;T intends to
distribute almost two billion additional shares as soon as this
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   When AT&AMP;T announced in December that it would offer the shares
to track the wireless unit, John D. Zeglis, the company's
president, was tapped to run the newly independent operation. That
was a slap to Daniel Hesse, who had been chief executive of the
wireless division since 1997, and he departed for a start-up,
Terabeam Networks, in March.
</P>
<P>
   Zeglis has just about made a career at AT&AMP;T in exceeding
expectations. A lawyer who worked on AT&AMP;T's divestiture of the
regional Bell phone companies in the early 1980's, Zeglis has
encountered skeptics each time his operational responsibilities
have increased. And each time, he has given the lie to the
predictions of failure, succeeding at every level.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently the skeptics have not yet been completely
defused.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal seems to be moderately undervalued, but we have some
concerns about the management turnover and the appointment of
Zeglis and the loss of Hesse,'' said Steven Lehman, manager of the
Federated Utility Fund, which has about $650 million invested in
telecommunications companies. Lehman said he declined to buy any of
the new wireless shares.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has been growing quite rapidly,'' Lehman added,
``but the long-standing head of the division was passed over for
what appears to be political reasons. It appears that they just
found a place for Zeglis in one of their most critically important
divisions. In this case the timing is unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said of Zeglis: ``I never feel that I understand a
vision of what he wants to do the with the business. Even though I
think he's a very talented man, I'm concerned that the role of CEO
is not just to set the vision but to explain the vision internally
and externally. He has some difficulty doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For their part, some investors appeared to have difficulty
deciding to invest in the new AT&AMP;T stock rather than in some of the
many other communications companies whose shares have been beaten
down recently.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, shares of Nextel, a national wireless provider,
have lost more than a third of their value while shares of
Voicestream Wireless, another big carrier, have been slashed almost
in half. Global Crossing, which is building undersea communications
networks, has seen its shares lose more than half their value
recently.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, those losses made the AT&AMP;T deal appear more expensive
(especially because AT&AMP;T refused to reduce the projected price
range for its offering as the market shuddered).
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the emerging communications companies have fallen
dramatically in a short time,'' Lehman said. ``I'd be inclined at
this point to look for some of those opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the various concerns, perhaps the most subtle is
uncertainty over how AT&AMP;T intends to distribute its remaining stake
in the wireless unit.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the offering's underwriters exercised their
over-allotment options, which would allow them to sell an
additional 54 million shares, AT&AMP;T would still retain 82.5 percent
of the wireless shares.
</P>
<P>
   In the six weeks or so immediately after AT&AMP;T's announcement of
the offering, many on Wall Street were privately led to believe
that AT&AMP;T intended to distribute its entire remaining wireless
stake to existing holders of AT&AMP;T's common shares, said analysts,
investors and people close to the offeringk.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, AT&AMP;T's management has all but decided not
to fully distribute the remaining shares, the people said. Instead,
AT&AMP;T will probably first give holders of its common stock the
option to exchange those shares for wireless shares outright.
</P>
<P>
   Such an exchange offer would obviously allow investors to decide
which shares to own, but could also have a significant positive
effect on AT&AMP;T's cash flow and per-share earnings. Because AT&AMP;T's
common shares earn a dividend while the wireless shares do not,
each share that is exchanged would allow AT&AMP;T to reduce its overall
dividend payments, which totaled $2.7 billion last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition, as the common shares that are exchanged are
subsequently retired, the company's per-share earnings would
increase (though analysts would be sure to discount the value of at
least some of that rise).
</P>
<P>
   At least two people close to the offering pointed out that John
C. Malone, who sits on AT&AMP;T's board, has had considerable success
with such exchange offers at Liberty Media, his television
programming operation.
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to the offering, the current thinking
in AT&AMP;T's executive suite is to conduct an exchange offer first,
perhaps within six months, and then distribute the remaining
unclaimed wireless shares.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has said it will consider selling additional wireless
shares to the public, but that appears highly unlikely, at least
this year. &QL;

GRACE WILL NOT SIGN AGREEMENT TO CLEAN ASBESTOS-CONTAMINATED
SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ Last December, W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. promised to ``do
everything in our power to help the people of Libby.'' Now, the
company has notified the Environmental Protection Agency that it
will not sign an agreement with the EPA to clean two
asbestos-contaminated sites here.
</P>
<P>
   Grace made the promise after the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
reported that hundreds of people had died or contracted fatal
diseases from the asbestos-tainted ore at a vermiculite mine owned
by Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the first P-I articles, an EPA emergency response
team and public health specialists began taking air and soil
samples around Libby.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the EPA said its preliminary testing found high
levels of asbestos in two areas. One was near the center of town,
where Grace packaged the expanded vermiculite, called Zonolite, and
the second was near the mine, where the raw ore was loaded on rail
cars. More testing is being done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The levels are high enough where we want the contaminated
material removed as quickly as possible,'' said Paul Peronard,
EPA's on-scene coordinator, when he announced the test results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave Grace the option of cleaning up the asbestos or having
us do it and bill them.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Alan Stringer, Grace's representative in Libby,
said his company would do ``whatever is required'' by the EPA to
remove the hazard.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, EPA announced that Grace told the agency it was
``not interested in signing a consensual cleanup agreement'' to
decontaminate the two sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA's goal remains to complete the cleanup at both sites this
summer and take any other necessary actions to protect public
health and the environment in and around Libby,'' Peronard said.
</P>
<P>
   William Corcoran, Grace's vice president of corporate affairs,
confirmed the company declined to sign the cleanup agreement
``because of the rights we would have to give up if we signed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran offered no information on what ``rights'' Grace would
lose but said the company is still prepared to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's displeasure with EPA's proposed cleanup agreement
apparently centers on the methods the agency used to collect and
analyze samples of contamination.
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy letter from Grace's lawyer, Kenneth Lund, to EPA on
April 18 argued about the appropriateness of EPA's techniques and
expressed surprise at the agency's actions.
</P>
<P>
   EPA's reply to Grace a day later said the company had been told
about the testing methods and the cleanup plans on Feb. 3, March 6
and April 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed removal actions at the site are based upon
current methodologies which clearly indicate a threshold for
removal,'' wrote Matthew Cohn, an enforcement lawyer from EPA's
Denver office.
</P>
<P>
   Grace is challenging EPA's testing protocol on numerous fronts.
Company officials met with high-ranking EPA officials at the
agency's Washington headquarters to question how testing was being
done, not only in Libby, but at hundreds of sites throughout the
country where tons of the contaminated vermiculite was processed
into insulation, lawn products and packaging material.
</P>
<P>
   In EPA's regional office in Seattle, letters and telephone calls
have been exchanged between the company and agency personnel over
the methods used to test vermiculite in various products,
particularly Zonolite chemical packaging material, which the EPA's
tests found to be heavily contaminated with asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Grace said it hasn't produced Zonolite Chemical Packaging
Vermiculite since 1994. But as recently as last month, the EPA and
the P-I found the material was still being sold in several hardware
and garden stores in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is not the only government agency concerned about the
adequacy of testing techniques and the long-established safety
standards for asbestos. In Denver this week, investigators,
scientists and health experts from a variety of federal agencies
met to discuss a variety of asbestos-related issues, including
whether existing exposure ``threshhold levels'' were sufficient to
ensure the safety of workers and consumers. Among the agencies at
the meeting were the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, the Mine
Safety and Health Administration, the Centers for Disease Control,
and the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Libby, health officials and members of victims
groups have raised strong doubts over Grace's offer to provide
medical care for people exposed to asbestos from the vermiculite in
Libby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have some real concerns about Grace's plans,'' says
Kerry Beasley, board chair of St. John's Lutheran Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace's medical criteria appear to be so restrictive that many
people who need the care may not qualify for it,'' Beasley said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital is also worried that there is no money or program
backing the plan, beyond Grace's promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Grace closes their doors, goes belly up or decides to stop
paying, there is nothing these people can do. There is no
protection for anyone,'' Beasley says.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital and the Asbestos Community Advisory Group is
discussing the formation of a Community Medical Trust, says Rick
Palagi, the hospital's chief exeuctive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trust would take money from the government, private
organizations and Grace, if it wanted to help, and make it
available to pay medical and other necessary expenses for people
with asbestos-related disease,'' said Jeanie Gentry, a hospital
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way Grace will not be in a position to decide who gets
help,'' she added.

JANE ROBERTS WOOD'S `TRAIN' KEEPS PICKING UP STEAM

   Jane Roberts Wood can't please everyone.

<P>
   ``There are times when I meet readers and they tell me, `Write
faster, honey,' '' she says, laughing. ``Well, I'm trying.'']
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old Texas native, who took up writing after her
first husband died in 1974, never expected to become the
bestselling _ and beloved _ author that she is today. In fact, she
decided to attempt a first novel 15 years ago pretty much on a
whim.
</P>

   ``I had a few short stories that had been published, and I got
such a kick out of that,'' the Dallas-based writer said. ``I'd
remarried, and it was a good time in my life. I just started with
an idea about a young woman going out to be a teacher in West Texas
in 1911.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea became ``The Train to Estelline,'' published in 1987,
which surprised readers and the publishing industry alike.
Everybody, it seemed, fell instantly in love with Wood's creation,
schoolteacher Lucy Richards, who at 17 is old enough to travel to
the tiny West Texas town of Estelline but still young enough to
have plenty of life lessons to learn. ``Estelline'' stayed on
various bestseller lists for eight months. It is now considered a
Texas literary classic, on equal footing with John Graves'
``Goodbye to a River'' and Larry McMurtry's ``Lonesome Dove.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood continued Lucy's story through two sequels, ``A Place
Called Sweet Shrub'' and ``Dance a Little Longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her books were much-discussed and analyzed, Wood
remained a mystery. Even now, in the last stages of completing a
new novel and just as the University of North Texas reissues the
so-called ``Lucy Richards trilogy'' in paperback, the author isn't
comfortable talking about herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strange sensation,'' she says, looking
embarrassed. ``I'd much rather talk about other interesting people
I've met.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed, Wood offers the following:
</P>
<P>
   She and her twin sister, Betty, were born and raised in the
small West Texas town of Memphis. Their father ran a school in a
nearby town, where he insisted that the ``West Texas farm boys'' in
his school learn Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Like many girls of that era, Wood says, she ``went to college
(at Texas Tech in Lubbock) to get married.'' Winston Roberts was a
dashing Navy pilot who wore his flight jacket and white silk scarf
around campus. They married and moved to Fort Worth. Roberts stayed
home to raise their two daughters, but in 1957 she enrolled at
Texas Christian University to pursue a master's degree in
literature.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Roberts family settled in Arlington. Wood
continued her education with a fellowship at Yale, and she taught
at Dallas' Mountain View Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then my husband died,'' Wood says. ``Afterwards, I kept a
journal and wrote poetry as catharsis. I would never let anyone see
that work now; it was too self-pitying. But it taught me the
importance of each individual word. Then I took a writing course at
UT-Arlington. As part of the class I wrote a short story, and I
guess that sort of started things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Olive,'' a short story about a widower bringing a young woman
back to his hometown, earned Wood an A _ and more. Her twin sister,
Betty, had met Jean Stapleton (''All in the Family'') and sent the
famous actress a copy. Stapleton immediately optioned ``Olive,''
with the intent of playing one of the characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean is one of the very nicest, and one of the most
businesslike, women I have ever met,'' Wood says. ``She told me
right away, `Jane, for every `yes' I've gotten in my professional
life, I've gotten 1,000 `nos.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Estelline,'' however, Wood hasn't gotten many nos. But
instead of concentrating on putting out more and more books, she
has tempered her writing success with a happy second marriage to
engineer Judson Wood, who brought two children to the union. The
blended family lives in Dallas, and Wood has followed the Lucy
trilogy with several short stories, which have appeared in various
magazines. Wood says Stapleton has optioned them all.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wood is almost finished with novel No. 4, still untitled,
which concerns a World War II veteran returning to West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to use as the title a line from some World War II song
or another,'' Wood says. ``The music of that era was so good, and I
was the greatest at dancing the jitterbug. I wanted to create a
sense of that time, and how, in those days, people did not put
their business in the street. Private lives meant private.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing we know about Wood's private life is that it will
always include writing _ if only to keep the reporters at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll keep writing always,'' she says. ``That is so much
more fun than talking about myself.'' .MDBR/.MDNM/ (Visit the

EX-BLACK PANTHER WINS LONG LEGAL BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The City of Los Angeles and the federal government
have agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Elmer Pratt, bringing an
end to the three-decade legal odyssey of the former Black Panther
whose murder conviction was overturned in 1997 after he had spent
27 years in prison, his lawyers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't prove that justice works,'' said Stuart D. Hanlon,
who as a young law student in 1974 took on the case of Pratt, known
as Geronimo, and has been with it ever since. ``To me, if it takes
27 years and this kind of legal struggle to get someone out, it
doesn't prove anything about justice. But on the other hand, it's a
resolution that makes sense and lets everybody move on with their
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers would not confirm the financial details of the
settlement, but people close to the case said the total was $4.5
million, with $1.75 million to come from the federal government and
$2.75 million from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   They said the city attorney here, James K. Hahn, had agreed to
that figure on Monday, and it was subject to the approval of the
City Council. The false imprisonment and civil rights lawsuit was
filed by Pratt's lawyers, including the Southern California chapter
of the American Civil Liberties Union and Johnnie L. Cochran Jr.,
who was the original trial lawyer and later gained fame defending
O.J. Simpson, shortly after a state court overturned Pratt's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   They had threatened a trial that would focus not only on the
prosecution of Pratt, but also on what they called a broader
pattern of harassment of Black Panthers in the 1960s and 1970s and
subsequent cover-ups that they said would implicate officials still
serving in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just a story of the past,'' said Mark Rosenbaum,
legal director of the ACLU. ``It was a story of three decades of
cover-up, and we made it clear that we were going to litigate that
and that it would implicate current officials. Nobody wanted that
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt's case has been one of the most prominent lingering
remnants of a turbulent time. He was arrested in 1970 and convicted
in 1972 of the murder of Caroline Olsen, a 27-year-old
schoolteacher, on a tennis court in Santa Monica in 1968. Pratt was
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison and spent nearly a third of
his sentence in solitary confinement. But he steadfastly maintained
his innocence, insisting that he was in Oakland for Black Panther
meetings when Olsen was killed, and that the police and agents of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation hid and possibly destroyed
wiretap evidence that would prove that.
</P>
<P>
   After years of stymied appeals, Pratt was released from prison
in June 1997 when an Orange County Superior Court judge reversed
his murder conviction, finding that prosecutors, during the 1972
trial, deliberately withheld the fact that a key prosecution
witness, Julius Butler, was a felon and an FBI informant.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors initially contended that disclosure of Butler's
status as an informant would not have changed the outcome of the
trial and sought to have Pratt returned to prison. But last year
the Los Angeles County district attorney, Gil Garcetti, citing the
long duration of the case, agreed to drop it.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, who now uses the name Geronimo ji Jaga, returned to his
hometown, Morgan City, La., where he works with a community group
to convert the abandoned, once-segregated school he attended into a
youth center. His lawyers said some of the settlement money, which
is expected to be paid in increments over several years, would go
to that effort. Some would also go toward lawyers fees and expenses
for the long legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   Hanlon said Pratt would have preferred to take the civil suit to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 52 now,'' Hanlon said. ``I think we felt it was better
for him to have the money and get his life in order and move
forward. He's not a rich man, but now he's going to have money
every month.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt did not answer a telephone message left for him in Morgan
City. But he told The Los Angeles Times, which first reported the
settlement Wednesday, that while he had wanted to use the suit as a
platform to expose what he called the FBI's ``evil scheme'' of
opposition to the Panthers and other radical groups, ``The wisdom
of my lawyers prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Miller, a Justice Department spokesman in Washington,
said the department would have no comment on the case.

STARR STILL SAVORING BREAKTHROUGH NASCAR WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Giddy over his first NASCAR Winston West
Series victory Saturday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, David Starr
never made it home to Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Starr headed directly for Southern California, where he
hopes to make it two in a row this weekend. Starr is at the Santa
Ana, Calif., shop of Embee Technologies, which has signed as his
primary sponsor for Saturday's Pontiac Wide Track Grand Prix 200 at
the California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's victory on the 1.5-mile trioval in Vegas came in only
his fifth Winston West start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living out a dream,'' said Starr, driver of the No. 35
Team Texas Chevrolet Monte Carlo owned by his uncle, Mike Starr.
``If I never go further _ if it stops today or tomorrow _ I've
lived out one heck of a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I had won in everything up until I got into the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series. My uncle, he built the Winston West team
and we've been running two or three races a year. We've been close,
but circumstances always knocked us out. So this is a great victory
for us. It was neat, because as the race went on, we made the car
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr went from 25th-quickest in practice to a seventh-place
starting spot after a couple of late-practice chassis adjustments
suggested by his uncle/crew chief. But when the race started, a car
that had been tight and difficult to turn into the corners suddenly
developed a loose condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end of the race, with like 15 laps to go, they had
a caution,'' said Starr, an instructor at his uncle's Team Texas
Driving School at Texas Motor Speedway. ``We were fifth or sixth
and I dove into the pits. When Mike found out there was only nine
cars on the lead lap, we threw on some left-side tires and
tightened up the car some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last six laps, the car was on rails. I was able to dive
deep into the corner and take it on the bottom and hold it
underneath them in the center of the corner. It was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also said his pit crew _ all employees of his uncle's
driving school in Fort Worth _ exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time we had done a pit stop together,'' Starr
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was made more memorable by those who were there to
celebrate with him in Victory Lane: Ophelia and Jimmy Starr,
David's mother and father; grandmother Mary Ellen Starr; younger
brother Johnny; and aunt Margie Stinson.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also received the congratulations of a NASCAR Winston Cup
regular after the formal ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny Schrader came up to me and said, `David, this is big. A
lot of people have been talking about you,''' said Starr, 32. ``I
must have talked to him for 20 minutes. He even gave me his mobile
phone number and said to call him if I had any questions. Before
the race started I had asked Schrader a couple of things and he
answered me. But when I won the race, I had a 20-minute
conversation with him. So I'll say it helped my stock.''

CUP `SILLY SEASON' FORECAST FOR TMS IS BLEAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Months before the traditional start of Silly
Season, the shape of the 2001 NASCAR Winston Cup schedule has begun
making headlines.
</P>
<P>
   And no, a second Cup date at Texas Motor Speedway is not
included in the latest speculative 36-race schedule. As reported by
``The Charlotte Observer'' and on the ``That's Racin' '' Web site
earlier this week, NASCAR plans to add Cup events in Kansas City,
Kan., and Chicago while maintaining the schedule's status quo
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That would increase the schedule to 36 points-paying events, and
38 weekends of racing when the Bud Shootout for pole-winners and
The Winston all-star event are included.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the additions of Kansas City and Chicago _ both
1.5-mile triovals each seating approximately 75,000 _ have been
anticipated since the season opener in February. But the notion
that NASCAR now is planning to plug the new racetracks into two of
five idle weekends currently on the calendar is an unexpected twist
for the management of Speedway Motorsports Inc.
</P>
<P>
   SMI chairman Bruton Smith and Eddie Gossage, TMS' executive vice
president and general manager, have been lobbying NASCAR for a
second Cup date since the track opened in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told directly by NASCAR that they have no weekends
on which to add dates,'' said Gossage, responding to the
``Observer'' report. ``I've got to assume from what I've been told
point-blank ... that's not possible. When we've talked about NASCAR
giving Texas its first date _ because we bought this one \Rfrom
North Wilkesboro Speedway\S _ they said there's not any more
weekends left in the year. Too many weekends on the road, and all
that stuff. I would assume that would mean not just for Texas, but
for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Befitting its image as a family-oriented sport, NASCAR does not
run on either Easter Sunday or Mother's Day. Using this year's
schedule as a guide, that also left the sanctioning body with open
dates on July 16, July 30 and Oct. 29 to allow the troops a chance
to wash their socks. Pencil Kansas City and Chicago into two of
those slots, and only one ``future'' race date remains vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Most series observers had tabbed the Darlington (S.C.) Raceway
and the North Carolina Speedway in Rockingham, N.C., as likely
candidates to lose their spring races in 2001 to accommodate Kansas
City and Chicago. Those swaps largely would have been intramural,
as International Speedway Corp. owns Darlington, Rockingham and the
Kansas City tracks and is a partner in the Chicago facility.
</P>
<P>
   ISC, of course, is run by the family of NASCAR founder Bill
France Sr. His son, Bill France Jr., is NASCAR's president and
retains the final say-so on the schedule being massaged by Mike
Helton, NASCAR's senior vice president and chief operating officer,
and Brian France, Bill Jr.'s son and a NASCAR senior vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage, who is friends with all of the above, respectfully
declined to get into a debate about the long-standing NASCAR/ISC
conflict-of-interest issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they've not been shy about saying they're going to Kansas
City and Chicago, and even \Rmetro\S New York _ which are all
ISC-owned facilities,'' Gossage said. ``I haven't heard anything
else definitively.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I expect them to do? I'm sure they're telling us the
truth \Rabout two races at TMS\S. I mean they tell you, you listen
and you believe. And they consistently have told me there is no
date to give to Texas or anybody. I guess we'll see. But I think
the fans have made a stronger case for TMS than we could ever
make.''
</P>
<P>
   The DirecTV 500 drew a NASCAR season-high crowd of 223,000 to
Fort Worth on April 2, a total that figures to be topped only by
the Brickyard 400 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Aug. 5.
Also mindful of the 6 million-plus fans who watched the live
network TV telecast, Gossage said he hardly is prepared to accept
that NASCAR again has circular-filed TMS' second date request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that Brian France and Mike Helton are men
of their words and they'll keep their promises of giving us their
first Winston Cup race,'' Gossage said. ``I'm hoping and assuming
it will come next year. If not next year, the year after. But I
honesty don't know.''  &QL; 
Martin tops vote
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Winston Cup points leader Mark Martin has edged Formula
One pacesetter Michael Schumacher in first-round balloting for
Driver of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Both Martin and Schumacher received seven first-place votes from
a national panel of 16 motorsports journalists, including this
reporter, who voted Ferrari ace Schumacher No. 1. Martin, who also
has won four of nine Busch Grand National races this season, fared
better in second-place balloting to emerge with a 101-90 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Points are awarded on a 9-6-4-3-2-1 basis for the top six
drivers of each quarter. A final secret ballot will be taken at the
end of the racing season to determine the successor to reigning
Driver of the Year Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   Native Texan and Cup regular Bobby Labonte was a distant third
with 36 points, followed by CART's Paul Tracy, 31; NHRA Pro Stock
leader Jeg Coughlin, 30, and Pennzoil World of Outlaws star Danny
Lasoski, 28. \Nsubheds:Gossage hits the road Harley-Davidson
loyalist Eddie Gossage will break out his 2000 ``Dresser'' and
leather riding gear this weekend to participate in the sixth annual
Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage, the executive vice president and general manager of
Texas Motor Speedway, has ridden in five of the cross-country
treks, which raise money for children's hospitals. Gossage sat out
the 1996 event, to oversee construction of TMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to extend relationships with some of the
competitors and some of NASCAR's officials and meet and attract new
sponsors,'' Gossage said. ``I go back to where did Adam Petty make
his Winston Cup debut \RTMS last month\S and the reasons given. One
was the friendship between the Petty family and me. Kyle is like a
brother and Adam like a nephew. There's a professional benefit, but
it's also pretty personal.''
</P>
<P>
   The ride begins with a parade lap Sunday morning around the
California Speedway, site of the Winston Cup NAPA Auto Parts 500.
The 12-state journey will end in North Carolina on May 7.  &QL; 
Speed Club booked solid
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1994, the National Hot Rod Association's Speed-Pro
200 mph Pro Stock Club finally is complete. Ron Krisher, of Warren
Ohio, became the 16th and final member with a career-best clocking
of 200.17 mph in the Eagle One Pontiac Firebird at Houston Raceway
Park in Baytown last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Five-time NHRA Pro Stock champion Warren Johnson (200.13 mph)
was the first to crack the magic 200 barrier in April 1997.
Arlington's Bruce Allen became the club's 12th member with a pass
at 200.17 mph in the Reher-Morrison Firebird on Sept. 18, 1999, in
Mohnton, Pa.  &QL; 
SCCA Sunburn run set
</P>
<P>
   Texas Region SCCA will contest the 10th annual Abilene Sunburn
Grand Prix on Saturday and Sunday on a 1.7-mile temporary road
course at the Abilene Municipal Airport. Races will be run in seven
groups, with practice and qualifying scheduled for 8:30 a.m. each
day. For more information, check the group's Web site

COWBOYS' OFFENSE A WORK IN PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Since Jack Reilly was hired as the Cowboys
offensive coordinator, speculation has abounded as to what the
Cowboys will do on offense next season.
</P>
<P>
   Considering it's the same offense that the Cowboys used during
Super Bowl title years in 1992, 1993 and 1995, one thought has them
looking like the Cowboys of old, dominating with the lead draw,
deep outs and slant passes.
</P>
<P>
   But because it's also the same offense the St. Louis Rams used
last season on the way to winning the Super Bowl, the Cowboys might
look like the Rams, whose running game was made up of swing passes
to their running back and threw a lot of deep passes.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that not even Reilly knows what the Cowboys will
do.
</P>
<P>
   He said a team's offense will depend on what the players can do
best.
</P>
<P>
   Except for veteran stars _ quarterback Troy Aikman and running
back Emmitt Smith _ Reilly is familiarizing himself with the
players.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' minicamp, which begins tomorrow and runs through
Sunday at Valley Ranch, is the first step in that process.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who was the Cowboys quarterbacks coach in 1997, spent
the past two years in New England. He has never worked with Raghib
Ismail, who joined the team as a free agent in 1999 and led the
Cowboys in receiving last year. Receiver Joey Galloway and tight
end Jackie Harris, both expected to have an impact in 2000, were
acquired in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys offense ``was the way it was in 1990s because of who
they had,'' Reilly said. ``With Emmitt and Troy still around it
will look similar but we don't want to be pigeonholed. We picked up
a few guys in free agency, so we have to see how it all works
together. We really won't know until we do all the minicamps and
training camp and then play some games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have been doing individual drills twice a week for
the past month. But the minicamp will be the first chance that
Aikman, Ismail, Galloway and the offensive line will work against a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said that's what makes this minicamp so exciting, as
``you get to do stuff and see what works.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys already know what works, considering the presence of
Smith and dominant offensive linemen like tackles Flozell Adams and
Erik Williams, guard Larry Allen and center Mark Stepnoski.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison sake, Ernie Zampese, the Cowboys' offensive
coordinator from 1994-1997 who now serves a team consultant,
believes the offense in 2000 will look more like the Redskins of
today and what the Cowboys did in the past than the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins coach Norv Turner was the Cowboys' offensive
coordinator in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all the same offense, but they look different when
you see them because of personnel,'' Zampese said. ``The Redskins,
like the Cowboys, have a big, strong downhill runner in Stephen
Davis. The Rams made sure they threw the ball more to \Rrunning
back\S Marshall Faulk. We have a power running game here. I would
certainly think we would look more like Washington than St.
Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Running the ball with Smith, however, is where the similarities
will likely end. The addition of Harris has the Cowboys planning to
use more two tight-end sets than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the presence of the league's fastest wide receiver
tandem in Galloway and Ismail and the desire to be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly reiterates that it would be wrong to pigeonhole the
Cowboys offense as one way or another. His overall goal is to do it
all well, throw deep and have an effective running game.
</P>
<P>
   To Reilly, it's a blank screen. But the picture should start
coming together tomorrow.

<P>
   SHAFT-FILM (Undated) _ Gordon Park's groundbreaking detective
film ``Shaft'' in 1971 never got the respect it deserves; I
recently overheard a major filmmaker giving the picture short
shrift and claiming he could have done a much better job with the
material, given Isaac Hayes's score _ which some consider the true
star of the motion picture. In fact, the score builds a frame
around the likable cool of Parks's picture; it doesn't usurp it.
Now, with a new version of ``Shaft'' _ starring Samuel L. Jackson,
directed by John Singleton and written by Richard Price _ due for
release this summer, the original film will be scrutinized once
again. By Elvis Mitchell. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DARKSIDE-SUMMER-FILMS (Paris) _ So often in the movies, summer
is a time of flight and escape, romance and bliss; too brief in
real time but long in the memory, like all the things we love. But
films such as ``Lady in a Cage'' reveal the dark side of summer,
that season in which fights break out on the subway and lovers
sleep far apart in the bed and the heat tempts normally passive
mortals to madness. By Kristin Hohenadel. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAWS-FILM (Undated) _ Twenty-five years ago, Steven Spielberg's
``Jaws'' created the Summer Movie as we know it: the action-heavy,
``thrill ride'' sort of picture, aimed at sensation-hungry younger
audiences, which moves into theaters around Memorial Day and
remains there, partying hard, until the school year starts up again
in September. ``Jaws'' opened on June 20, 1975, and its phenomenal
popularity _ it was the first movie to relieve American audiences
of more than $100 million of their hard-earned money _ helped turn
Hollywood into what is now largely a summer-business town, sort of
like Amity, the New England beach resort where the film's dire
events take place. By Terrence Rafferty. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROCKY-BULLWINKLE-FILM (Undated) _ The ``Fractured Fairy Tale''
was one of the many wicked satires from ``Rocky and His Friends,''
the smartest, dumbest, simplest and most complex cartoon ever made
for television (and, yes, that includes ``The Simpsons''). On June
30, Universal Pictures will resuscitate the flying squirrel and his
pals on the big screen in ``The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle,'' what studio flacks are calling a
``live-action/animated comedy.'' By Franz Lidz. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GLADIATOR-FILM (Undated) _ On Friday, ``Gladiator,'' directed by
Ridley Scott, resumes the dig for sunken metaphors on a scale not
seen since the late 1950s and early 1960s, when audiences lined up
for two-part spectaculars like William Wyler's ``Ben-Hur,'' Joseph
L. Mankiewicz's ``Cleopatra'' and Stanley Kubrick's ``Spartacus.''
In the spirit of these legendary epics, ``Gladiator'' is an
allegory of its own time. The first Roman cinema spectacular to be
made by Hollywood since the end of the Cold War, it is a meditation
on the perplexity of the world's sole surviving superpower. Quo
vadis? Where does America go from here? After expansion, implosion
_ this is the diagnosis set forth by ``Gladiator'' in period
costume. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEACH-FILMS (Undated) _ Although the beach movie genre is
generally considered to have begun with ``Gidget'' (1959) _
starring Sandra Dee as an affable, late-blooming teenager reluctant
to go on her first surf-and-sun ``manhunt'' _ it wasn't until the
successful release of American International Pictures' ``Beach
Party'' (1963) that film studios began to fully exploit the
economic rewards of niche marketing. And with two-thirds of all
filmgoers being between the ages of 16 and 24 by the late 1950s,
the intended target was clear. By David Bahr. (Moved) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CRUISE-FILMS (Undated) _ The anticipated through-the-roof
success of the sequel to ``Mission Impossible,'' ``M: I-2,'' should
soothe any hurt feelings in the Tom Cruise camp over the actor's
Oscar loss for ``Magnolia.'' Generally the academy swoons over
beautiful stars who go into ugly mode to show they can act, but
Cruise's strutting, pelvis-jutting television sex guru, out to
seduce and destroy the female half of the species, was perhaps too
far off the empathy curve when compared with Michael Caine's kindly
doctor, patron of wayward women, in ``The Cider House Rules.''
While playing cocky upstarts too full of themselves to join the
team, in his best work as an actor Cruise has allowed co-stars and
supporting players to shine while his own subtler contributions
have gone relatively unheralded. Oscars have accrued, but not to
him. By Molly Haskell. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KISSES-FILMS (Undated) _ Let's face it, most movie kisses are
dull and predictable, about as titillating as a dental hygiene
appointment. But that makes the good ones even more memorable. I
apologize to everyone whose favorite kiss is absent here. By Lisa
Zeidner. (Moved). &QL;

   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA-BROWN-DANCE (New York) _ Sometimes the choreographer
Trisha Brown, 63, likes to dance an answer to a question. Looking
elegant in a long, simple black dress on a late March weekend, she
rises to her feet to show how close her dancers come to one another
in ``Five Part Weather Invention,'' the first section of a new
three-part collaboration with the jazz composer Dave Douglas, the
visual artist Terry Winters and the lighting designer Jennifer
Tipton. Both this piece and ``Rapture to Leon James,'' the second
part, will have their New York premieres when her 12-member troupe
celebrates its 30th anniversary with a two-week engagement at the
Joyce Theater, beginning on Tuesday. In June, the complete trilogy
will be presented at the American Dance Festival in North Carolina,
which commissioned ``Rapture'' and the last untitled section. By
Valerie Gladstone. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOMASSON-DANCE (Undated) _ Fifteen years ago, Helgi Tomasson,
the celebrated dancer from Iceland, stood onstage at the New York
State Theater for the last time as a member of the New York City
Ballet, accepting flowers and a resounding ovation for his final
performance. On Wednesday, if he goes against his innately modest
and reticent nature, he should be back on that stage, this time
taking a bow as the choreographer of a world premiere for the
company's spring gala program. Tomasson's ``Prism,'' set to
Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1, will be the closing work on a
program that includes the premieres of two Peter Martins ballets,
``Slonimsky's Earbox,'' to John Adams's score of the same name, and
``Todo Buenos Aires,'' to Adams's orchestrations of two Astor
Piazzolla compositions. Along with Christopher Wheeldon's
``Mercurial Manoeuvres,'' which opens the gala evening, these
ballets are all part of City Ballet's fourth Diamond Project, a
showcase for new choreography. By Susan Reiter. (Moved). WITH

</P>
<P>
   BLUE-MAN-GROUP (Las Vegas) _ Blue Man Group is the three-man
performance troupe, the bald, blue-headed guys who, though
unspeaking (and occasionally unspeakable), have been wreaking havoc
on contemporary art in the intervals between playing their own
music on garbage pails and plumbing pipes at the Astor Place
Theater in Manhattan since 1991. The original Blue Men, Matt
Goldman, Phil Stanton and Chris Wink, were street performers who
established their own Club Nowhere on a sidewalk outside the
Copacabana in the late 1980s. By now, Blue Man has effected a
corporate merger with himself. Thirty other Blue Men have joined
the troupe, plus two in training. ``Blue Man: Tubes,'' the New York
show, is still going strong. In 1995 it opened in Boston; it's
still going strong there, too. In 1997 it was Chicago, where, yes,
it's still going strong. And last month, Messrs. Goldman, Stanton
and Wink opened in ``Blue Man Group: Live at Luxor'' in Las Vegas,
with a five-year contract. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIRTY-BLONDE-THEATER (New York) _ A Menage of muscle men and
drag queens flanked Mae West throughout her long career, both
onstage and off. They were her honor guard of sin, her ``boys,'' as
she liked to call them. In the play ``Dirty Blonde,'' a kind of
theatrical free-association on West, Kevin Chamberlin and Bob
Stillman bring a number of these ``boys'' to life. Written by
Claudia Shear, who conceived it with the director James Lapine,
``Dirty Blonde'' reopens Monday at the Helen Hayes Theater on
Broadway after a widely praised run at New York Theater Workshop.

IGNORNING DUNCAN HELPED SPURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As harsh as it may sound, the San Antonio Spurs
had to approach Game 2 of their first-round playoff series against
the Phoenix Suns as if Tim Duncan didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked, as the Spurs forgot about Duncan and scored
an 85-70 victory over the Suns that evened the best-of-five series
at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 is at 2 p.m. Saturday in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan has missed the past six games with a slight ligament tear
in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson more than made up for Duncan's absence on Tuesday
as he had 25 points, 15 rebounds and blocked three shots.
Afterward, Robinson said that the constant talk about whether
Duncan will or won't play haunted the Spurs during their 72-70
series-opening loss to the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of a little bit of a distraction for us,
because nobody really knows his status,'' Robinson said. ``We know
he's got a problem with his knee, and it gets swollen when he uses
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us want him on the floor if he's going to tear up his
knee. We don't really know what the doctors are saying, and for us,
at this point we can't worry about it. We just have to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said all his team can do is hope
Duncan improves, because winning back-to-back NBA titles without
him will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's medically able to go, he's going to want to go,''
Popovich said. ``He's dying right now, he wants to be out there so
bad. But it's just not smart. There's nothing he can do on that
knee right now.''  &QL; 
Walker shines again
</P>
<P>
   Samaki Walker proved again that he can shine in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Walker grabbed nine rebounds and blocked a career-high eight
shots Tuesday night when the Spurs squared their best-of-five
first-round Western Conference playoff series against the Suns at
1-1. Walker had 13 points, 16 rebounds and blocked three shots in
Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is starting in place of the injured Tim Duncan, and the
former Mavericks first-round draft pick is making the most of his
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a series we can possibly win without Tim,''
Walker said. ``Not taking anything away from Phoenix, but in that
first game we felt like we gave that game away.''  &QL; 
Road warriors
</P>
<P>
   After winning six of their last seven regular-season games to
receive homecourt advantage, the Spurs are saying the best thing
for them is to get out of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   After squandering homecourt advantage by losing Game 1, 72-70,
to the Suns last Saturday at the Alamodome, the Spurs must win at
least one of the next two games at America West Arena in order to
bring the series back to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Spurs guard Mario Elie said they can ``definitely'' win one game
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of distractions at home, including your boys
calling you for tickets,'' Elie said. ``But when you're on the road
you check into the hotel under an alias, and all you get to
concentrate on is your teammates and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of fans who call you and try to hassle you,
especially in Utah. They call and leave nasty messages like, `Karl
Malone is going to eat you up.' But when you're under an alias, you
don't have to worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs split their two regular-season games played in
Phoenix. They opened the season with three consecutive victories,
then lost at Phoenix, 77-74. They also snapped a two-game losing
streak with a 102-83 victory at America West Arena on Jan. 7. / nn

</P>
<P>
   SERIAL-MUSIC (Undated) _ Arnold Schoenberg waved the 12
commandments of serial music at a generation of composers
bewildered by the tower of Babel they had been forced to live in.
They were looking for an answer, and many were quick to follow. Few
realized the enormous breadth of skill and knowledge needed to make
serialism a truly musical experience. But here was someone with a
new idea. By Bernard Holland. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   DAWN-UPSHAW-MUSIC (New York) _ Hard as it may be to believe,
Dawn Upshaw turns 40 in July. By that age, most leading sopranos of
Upshaw's ilk have long since settled into a cushy routine. Yet no
sooner has Upshaw come up for air after the premiere of John
Harbison's ``Great Gatsby'' and a run of Debussy's ``Pelleas et
Melisande'' at the Metropolitan Opera than she takes up ``Images of
Dawn,'' an ambitious series of three programs produced by the Great
Performers series at Lincoln Center. It starts this Sunday
afternoon at Alice Tully Hall with ``The Composer's Oracle,'' a
recital of early 20th-century French songs written for the

   ART-NOUVEAU (London) _ A century after its heyday, the ornate
decorative style known as Art Nouveau remains so immediately
recognizable that debate over its merits often comes down to this:
do you love it or hate it? The Victoria and Albert Museum, however,
believes the time is ripe to revisit an earlier question: what
(italics)is(end italics) Art Nouveau? And to prove that the answer
is not obvious, it has put together ``Art Nouveau 1890-1914,'' the
largest exhibition on the subject since the last fin-de-siecle. The
premise of the show, which will travel to the National Gallery of
Art in Washington this fall after closing here on July 30, is that
Art Nouveau was not a flash-in-the-pan movement driven by press and
publicity. Rather it was a complex style, inspired by the idea of
total art, or Gesamtkunstwerk, as a political instrument, that had
roots in the mid-19th century and exercised influence well into the
20th century. By Alan Riding. (Moved).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MODERN-ART-MUSEUM (New York) _ The main event at the Museum of
Modern Art these days is the Museum of Modern Art itself. Such has
been the case since last fall, when a project called MOMA 2000
kicked off with the first of what will be three successive
top-to-bottom reinstallations of the museum's permanent collection
galleries. The whole affair, spurred by the imminent expansion of
the museum's premises, has been billed a grand experiment, a
test-drive toward the future. By Holland Cotter. (Moved). WITH

</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-EMBROIDERY-ART (Washington) _ The glorious gardens of the
Ottoman Empire live on in the embroideries that Turkish women
produced over a 400-year period. They made these pictures in thread
to cover floors, walls, windows and furniture in their homes as
well as to edge sheets, towels, tablecloths and fabrics for gift
wrapping. More than a few of these exceptional works are now on
view in ``Flowers of Silk and Gold: Four Centuries of Ottoman
Embroidery,'' an exhibition at the Textile Museum here through July
30. By Rita Reif. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOTOFEST (Houston) _ While new media advance faster than the
century, photography, a 19th-century product of the Industrial
Revolution, continues to blanket the earth. Threatened repeatedly
by newer discoveries like moving pictures, television, video and
the Internet, it refuses to disappear. In March, Fotofest, the
biennial photography festival in Houston, presented strong evidence
that the still camera, and specifically a festival devoted to it,
continue to play important roles on both local and international
levels. By Vicki Goldberg. &QL;

   TV-ANTIQUES-ROADSHOW (Undated) _ There are a lot of guilty
pleasures on television these days _ ``Blind Date,'' ``The Man
Show,'' whatever HBO calls that program that appears occasionally
featuring nude programming from foreign countries. The oddest
member of this company is no doubt ``Antiques Roadshow,'' PBS's
wholesome tour of America's bric-a-brac. One of the things that's
neat about the ``Roadshow'' _ and that perhaps explains why the
show is a guilty pleasure for some (and, conversely, a must-see for
others) _ is that it celebrates a kind of person who ordinarily
does not get that much attention. For want of a better word, we're
talking about collectors. By Jamie Malanowski. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-WEST-WING (Undated) _ The most fun part of this season's
surprise hit drama ``The West Wing'' are the speeches, which fall
into one of the hoariest traditions of theater: the entrance. When,
in the pilot, President Josiah Bartlett, played by Martin Sheen,
trundles into a shot, bemusedly declaiming, ``Thou shalt have no
other God before me,'' Sheen's relish in acting a scene he knows
will play to the back of the house is just as affecting as the
speech itself. The show's creator and co-writer, Aaron Sorkin,
loves this stuff; he served up plenty of it in his stage drama ``A
Few Good Men.'' By Elvis Mitchell. (Moved). &QL;

BUSH DEBATES FOREIGN POLICY WITH RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas met with the Russian
foreign minister Wednesday, airing differences over a missile
defense system and Chechnya but still expressing hope that the two
nuclear powers ``can work together to keep peace in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, who has faced sustained questions about his
inexperience in foreign affairs, the hourlong session with the
Russian, Igor Ivanov, was his second venture into the field this
week. On Monday he dedicated a bridge over the Rio Grande and
shared a stage with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said the Russian minister had long sought the
meeting with Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,
who was in Washington for a Republican fund-raising gala. Bush was
joined by his chief foreign-policy adviser, Condoleeza Rice, and by
Paul Wolfowitz, who was an undersecretary of defense in the
administration of Bush's father. Ivanov also brought along aides.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and his aides said the talk ranged from a
discussion of President-elect Vladimir Putin's goals for his
country, to U.S. investment in Russia, to one of the most serious
disagreements between the two nations: U.S. interest in developing
an anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, like many other Republicans, has said that if the Russians
are unwilling to suitably amend a 1972 treaty on anti-ballistic
missiles, he would back out of the treaty to free the United States
to pursue its own course. Other Republican leaders _ including Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee _ are firmly opposed to changes that might be negotiated
by President Clinton before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters after the session: ``I explained to him my
position as to why we need to develop a system to protect ourselves
and our allies against a rogue missile launch, against any missile
launch. It's part of redefining a post-Cold War era.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said: ``I made it very clear that I was going to think
in the best interests of the United States. First and foremost, and
the best interest of our country is to figure out how to keep the
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men also disagreed over the Russian military campaign in
Chechnya. Aides to Bush said that Ivanov vigorously defended his
nation's conduct while Bush told him, ``It is troubling for me as a
potential president to see use of force on innocent civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said afterward that Bush discussed how American executives
would make decisions on whether to invest in Russia. He told Ivanov
that with the struggle in Chechnya continuing it would be very hard
to do business in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting had its light moments too _ when Bush and Ivanov
started conversing in Spanish, for instance, confounding the
Russian translator. Putin, 47, and Bush, 53, are of the same
generation, a fact that seemed to intrigue Bush. ``I think that was
very encouraging,'' he said. ``It's time to redefine relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov later said the meeting with Bush presented ``an
opportunity to deliver our position.''
</P>
<P>
   When his presidential campaign began, Bush made several missteps
on foreign policy, mispronouncing the names of various
nationalities and failing a quiz on lesser known world leaders that
was sprung on him by a reporter.

PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENERGIZES MEXICAN OPPOSITION CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In the first televised debate of an unusually
competitive presidential election, Mexico's leading opposition
candidate made great strides in his effort to pull even with the
governing party's front-runner, polling experts and political
commentators said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They said that during the debate on Tuesday night, Vicente Fox,
of the opposition center-right National Action Party, struck a
chord with millions when he called on them to rewrite Mexico's
authoritarian history with a vote for democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the front-runner, Francisco Labastida, who is
President Ernesto Zedillo's candidate, staged a series of
whoop-and-holler street celebrations in cities around Mexico to
declare victory in the encounter, which was televised nationwide by
the country's two major networks. But a string of newspapers,
opinion pollsters and other commentators said on Wednesday that Fox
had won the debate by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Fox, an often rough-spoken former Coca-Cola
executive, reached out with conciliatory language to four rival
opposition candidates who also participated in the debate,
promising to form a pluralistic government that would seek a
peaceful democratic transition without jeopardizing the country's
recent economic gains.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, a three-time Cabinet minister from Zedillo's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, sought to
seize the initiative early in the encounter by presenting himself
as the candidate most likely to bring prosperity to working-class
Mexicans after years of economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the character to make big changes so we can leave
behind this period of belt-tightening,'' Labastida said. ``I
represent the real change.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox scoffed at those claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Labastida is talking to us about change, and he's been
inside the PRI for 37 years,'' Fox said. ``He was secretary of
interior, secretary of agriculture, he was a state governor, and we
didn't see change. It was all just more of the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has held a comfortable lead in public opinion polls
over Fox since the campaign got under way in earnest in January,
with some surveys showing him with a double-digit advantage. But
several recent polls have shown that lead diminishing dramatically.
A poll published on Monday by the newspaper Reforma, for instance,
showed Labastida backed by 45 percent of respondents, with Fox
backed by 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The other four candidates have only minimal support, the surveys
indicate, yet all six had equal time before the cameras on Tuesday
night. Labastida, as the representative of a party that has ruled
since 1929, was heavily criticized by the four rivals.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper counted 20 instances of opposition candidates
aiming criticisms at Labastida, who defended himself mainly by
criticizing Fox's recent rhetorical zigzags and his record as
governor of Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labastida looked as if he were surrounded,'' Juan Sanchez
Navarro, the influential patriarch of a wealthy brewing family,
told a television interviewer after the debate. ``His frontal
attacks against Fox suggested to me that he's started to fear that
he may lose the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida had his defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won! We won!'' Leonardo Rodriguez Alcaine, the leader of
the largest labor federation controlled by the PRI, told reporters
as he left the towering office building from which the debate was
broadcast. ``Labastida did very well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the televised confrontation, hundreds of union members,
neighborhood leaders and other PRI sympathizers were bused to a
downtown plaza to cheer for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minutes after the debate, the PRI recycled its eternal
triumphalism,'' the newspaper La Jornada said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox's performance invigorated his supporters, its
importance in the broader campaign remains unclear. Ernesto Zedillo
was given an embarrassing trouncing in a 1994 debate with two
opposition candidates and went on to win a convincing victory on
election day.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the debate on Tuesday allowed Fox to
communicate with millions of voters without the mediation of
Mexico's mainstream news shows, whose coverage of his campaign has
been overwhelmingly unfavorable, according to a survey by the
Federal Electoral Institute, the autonomous agency that organizes
Mexican elections.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign coverage by the two largest Mexican networks this year
has been significantly more favorable to Labastida than to Fox, the
institute's survey said. Fox received four times as much negative
coverage as Labastida, the survey said. The networks are licensed
and closely regulated by the government.

RETIREE WITH HIGH DRUG BILLS LENDS A HAND TO GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. _ Shirley Kindle, a 65-year-old retired
clerical worker, played a bit part in Al Gore's presidential
campaign Wednesday, but it was enough to win her over to the vice
president's side.
</P>
<P>
   She needs a dozen different prescription drugs each month. All
told, they cost more than $500 a month, which is more than her
Social Security check. To keep up her regimen, she has borrowed
money from her family, although, like many elderly people on fixed
incomes, she sometimes skips certain drugs altogether because she
cannot afford them.
</P>
<P>
   She likes Vice President Gore's proposal that Medicare cover the
cost of prescription drugs. And so Wednesday, after a magazine, to
which she had written a letter about the high cost of prescription
drugs, arranged with the campaign for a ``photo op,'' she posed
with Gore at Pelton's Drug Store here to illustrate her problem.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, she shops around at different pharmacies in her
hometown of Ansonia, and she had already bought her drugs for the
month. But in order to accommodate the vice president's campaign,
she and her son drove 40 miles from her home in Ansonia to East
Hartford, and she re-enacted her purchases at Pelton's, a quaint
family pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the drug store filled a dozen orange prescription bottles
with pills, rang them up at the cash register and declared to the
assembled cameras that her total came to $506.34, more than her
monthly Social Security check of $496.
</P>
<P>
   The event was part of a coordinated effort by Democrats across
the country to demonstrate their concern that drug prices are
soaring out of control and that they are more attentive than the
Republicans to the real-life needs of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said only that Kindle was helping him to illustrate a
larger problem and that ``as a courtesy'' she had ``aggregated''
her purchase at Pelton's.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Kindle said that she did not mind being a prop in
the campaign, even after several calls from Gore aides who were
fretting that she might be overcome with ``stage fright.''
</P>
<P>
   She is registered as an independent. But as she and her son sat
in a hallway outside the vice president's holding room at a center
for the elderly, she said she decided then and there that she would
vote for him. ``The Democrats usually handle the issues that I
believe better pertain to the average citizen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Joe, 31, who had taken time off from his job as an
apprentice optician to accompany his mother, said that he is a
registered Republican but that Gore had won him over too. ``It's
amazing how he's taken an interest,'' he said. ``This is something
that's important to me because it's important to my family. He
definitely has my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore used the event to promote his proposal for offering the
elderly a prescription drug benefit through Medicare, costing $200
billion over 10 years. He also took a jab at the drug industry,
calling it ``out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to the point where the margins are way out of
line with what most other industries and most other lines of
business believe is normal and adequate,'' he said, ``and they're
using the market power to dictate prices that are way above what
the competition would set them at.''
</P>
<P>
   This month's Fortune magazine reports that the pharmaceutical
industry has yielded the highest profits of the nation's top 40
industries. But it also notes that the industry's stock prices are
off considerably, and that this has been the source of considerable
concern at the drug companies _ that any Medicare plan to offer a
prescription drug benefit would ultimately constrain drug prices
and cut into profits. The drug industry worries that whatever it
might gain in new consumers who buy drugs because they are covered
under a government plan, it would lose in profits because the
government would pay less than the prices the companies charge now.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House Wednesday, President Clinton issued a study
saying that prices of the drugs most widely used by older Americans
had increased more than consumer prices in general. The study, by
Families USA, a consumer group, said that prices of the 50
top-selling drugs used by the elderly rose at nearly twice the
overall rate of inflation from January 1999 to January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniors living on fixed incomes simply can't cope with these
kinds of price increases forever,'' Clinton said. ``That's why we
should take action to help them, and do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a proposal outlined recently by House Republicans
did not go far enough. Clinton said it would ``do nothing'' for
those with annual incomes below $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kindle and her husband, Joseph, 70, a retired painter with a
union pension, earn less than half of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created Medicare in the first place because we knew it was
wrong for our parents' basic health to be decided by their
wealth,'' Gore said. His plan would allow those age 55 to 65 who
have no health insurance to buy into Medicare, providing free
coverage for low-income recipients and some benefits for those who
would pay $44 per month.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE TURNER WAY IS KNOWN AS THE HARD WAY FOR GRANT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a boxer, Michael Grant has a bad habit. He drops
his hands, leaving his chin hanging out there like a punching bag,
begging to be hit. But whenever the 6-foot-7-inch, 250-pound
heavyweight is sparring and drops his hands, his trainer, Don
Turner, yells, ``Start the whole round over.''
</P>
<P>
   In assembling a 31-0 record with 22 knockouts, Michael Grant has
learned to keep his hands up. Learned the hard way, the Don Turner
way. The start-the-whole-round-over way.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the fighter who will try to detach Lennox Lewis from
two-thirds of the heavyweight title Saturday night at Madison
Square Garden had to learn just about everything about boxing since
he started studying under Turner in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was a strong kid, but he didn't have any rhythm about
boxing,'' Turner recalled. ``But it took only two days to give him
balance and get him throwing combinations. He adapted right away,
and I called my wife, Minnie, and told her, `We got something
special here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that, Turner realized how special.
</P>
<P>
   When Grant's early manager, Bill Cayton, wanted Grant to desert
Turner for Kevin Rooney, who once trained Mike Tyson, Grant
refused. Almost any other young heavyweight would have jumped at
the chance to develop under Tyson's former trainer, but Grant stood
up to Cayton and stood up for Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Turner has often said, ``is when Michael showed me how
much character he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner liked that. In all his years as a welterweight and a
middleweight who never got close to a title bout and as a trainer
who mostly toiled with lesser-known fighters in New York and
Philadelphia before he was hired by Evander Holyfield, he had seen
too many boxers who lacked character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys sneer and talk trash,'' Turner said. ``Some of them
have talent, but no character. Michael's got good morals.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jim Thomas, the lawyer for both Grant and Evander
Holyfield, Turner is a ``father figure'' for the challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don matched up perfectly with both Evander and Michael,''
Thomas said. ``Evander doesn't need to be motivated, he just needs
to be reminded of things. Don would tell him, `You're turning the
wrong way,' that's all Evander wanted to hear. He doesn't need to
be bawled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's different. He needs that motivation. He didn't know
anything about boxing until six years ago, and Don will tell him
how it really is. When Don told Evander, `You can take Tyson
apart,' Evander really believed it because he knew Don wasn't
trying to con him.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner also told the world that Holyfield would win, although
not many of his listeners believed the trainer who will be 61 on
May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield did take Tyson apart in their first fight in 1996,
stopping him in the 11th round. In their 1997 rematch, Tyson was
disqualified when he bit Holyfield's right ear. Turner had finally
established himself on the top tier of trainers while he was also
developing Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael lived with me and my wife in our house in Norristown,
Pa., in those years,'' Turner said. ``Now he's got his own home
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of Turner's confidence before Holyfield's two bouts with
Lewis, they ended in a debatable draw and a unanimous 12-round
decision for the 34-year-old Englishman. Turner was also in Henry
Akinwande's corner in 1997, when Lewis won by a fifth-round
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Turner's been up against me three times,'' Lewis said,
``and he still has no success.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner laughed that off as irrelevant, remembering that the late
Ray Arcel was in the corner of various challengers during Joe
Louis' reign. During the instructions at midring, Louis once looked
over at Arcel and said, ``You here again?''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Arcel was in the other corner when Ezzard Charles
defeated Louis.
</P>
<P>
   And now Turner has Grant, who emerged as the No. 1 contender
after he stopped Andrew Golota in the 10th round last Nov. 20 after
having been knocked down twice in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never knocked down before,'' Grant said, ``so for me to
come back like that, it stacks some chips in my corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner hasn't had to psyche Grant, not with Lewis already
talking vaguely about Tyson as an eventual opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking past Michael and he don't like that,'' Turner
said. ``He knows Lennox Lewis is a good fighter and a good puncher,
but Michael thinks he can win.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as he doesn't drop his hands.
</P>

JANE ROBERTS WOOD'S `TRAIN' KEEPS PICKING UP STEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jane Roberts Wood can't please everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when I meet readers and they tell me, `Write
faster, honey,' '' she says, laughing. ``Well, I'm trying.'']
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old Texas native, who took up writing after her
first husband died in 1974, never expected to become the
bestselling _ and beloved _ author that she is today. In fact, she
decided to attempt a first novel 15 years ago pretty much on a
whim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a few short stories that had been published, and I got
such a kick out of that,'' the Dallas-based writer said. ``I'd
remarried, and it was a good time in my life. I just started with
an idea about a young woman going out to be a teacher in West Texas
in 1911.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea became ``The Train to Estelline,'' published in 1987,
which surprised readers and the publishing industry alike.
Everybody, it seemed, fell instantly in love with Wood's creation,
schoolteacher Lucy Richards, who at 17 is old enough to travel to
the tiny West Texas town of Estelline but still young enough to
have plenty of life lessons to learn. ``Estelline'' stayed on
various bestseller lists for eight months. It is now considered a
Texas literary classic, on equal footing with John Graves'
``Goodbye to a River'' and Larry McMurtry's ``Lonesome Dove.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood continued Lucy's story through two sequels, ``A Place
Called Sweet Shrub'' and ``Dance a Little Longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her books were much-discussed and analyzed, Wood
remained a mystery. Even now, in the last stages of completing a
new novel and just as the University of North Texas reissues the
so-called ``Lucy Richards trilogy'' in paperback, the author isn't
comfortable talking about herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strange sensation,'' she says, looking
embarrassed. ``I'd much rather talk about other interesting people
I've met.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed, Wood offers the following:
</P>
<P>
   She and her twin sister, Betty, were born and raised in the
small West Texas town of Memphis. Their father ran a school in a
nearby town, where he insisted that the ``West Texas farm boys'' in
his school learn Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Like many girls of that era, Wood says, she ``went to college
(at Texas Tech in Lubbock) to get married.'' Winston Roberts was a
dashing Navy pilot who wore his flight jacket and white silk scarf
around campus. They married and moved to Fort Worth. Roberts stayed
home to raise their two daughters, but in 1957 she enrolled at
Texas Christian University to pursue a master's degree in
literature.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Roberts family settled in Arlington. Wood
continued her education with a fellowship at Yale, and she taught
at Dallas' Mountain View Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then my husband died,'' Wood says. ``Afterwards, I kept a
journal and wrote poetry as catharsis. I would never let anyone see
that work now; it was too self-pitying. But it taught me the
importance of each individual word. Then I took a writing course at
UT-Arlington. As part of the class I wrote a short story, and I
guess that sort of started things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Olive,'' a short story about a widower bringing a young woman
back to his hometown, earned Wood an A _ and more. Her twin sister,
Betty, had met Jean Stapleton (''All in the Family'') and sent the
famous actress a copy. Stapleton immediately optioned ``Olive,''
with the intent of playing one of the characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean is one of the very nicest, and one of the most
businesslike, women I have ever met,'' Wood says. ``She told me
right away, `Jane, for every `yes' I've gotten in my professional
life, I've gotten 1,000 `nos.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Estelline,'' however, Wood hasn't gotten many nos. But
instead of concentrating on putting out more and more books, she
has tempered her writing success with a happy second marriage to
engineer Judson Wood, who brought two children to the union. The
blended family lives in Dallas, and Wood has followed the Lucy
trilogy with several short stories, which have appeared in various
magazines. Wood says Stapleton has optioned them all.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wood is almost finished with novel No. 4, still untitled,
which concerns a World War II veteran returning to West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to use as the title a line from some World War II song
or another,'' Wood says. ``The music of that era was so good, and I
was the greatest at dancing the jitterbug. I wanted to create a
sense of that time, and how, in those days, people did not put
their business in the street. Private lives meant private.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing we know about Wood's private life is that it will
always include writing _ if only to keep the reporters at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll keep writing always,'' she says. ``That is so much
more fun than talking about myself.'' &QL;

ANALYSIS: MICROSOFT BREAKUP IS A LEGAL STRETCH BUT A LIVE OPTION 
 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government faces a formidable legal challenge in trying to
persuade a federal judge to split up the Microsoft Corp., but not
an insurmountable one by any means, according to antitrust experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be somewhat of a stretch,'' said William Kovacic, a
professor at George Washington University Law School, ``but I think
the breakup that has been suggested is consistent with the broad
and flexible historical legal standard in antitrust.''
</P>
<P>
   That malleable legal framework in which federal courts have
handled remedies in federal antitrust cases dates from a Supreme
Court ruling in 1959, International Boxing Club of New York Inc.
vs. United States. In that ruling, the Supreme Court declared that
federal district courts have ``large discretion to model their
judgments to fit the exigencies of a particular case.''
</P>
<P>
   The district courts, the justices added, can and occasionally
should adopt forward-looking sanctions _ beyond measures that deal
specifically with the products and practices in the trial evidence.
``Sometimes,'' the court declared, ``relief to be effective must go
beyond the narrow limits of the proven violation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the courts over the years have been reluctant to break up
companies unless their monopoly position was obtained illegally or
through mergers. Neither of those apply in the Microsoft case. In
his ruling earlier this month, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found
that Microsoft was a predatory monopolist whose illegal conduct
stifled competition. Yet he specifically noted that the company had
not obtained its monopoly in the market for personal computer
operating systems illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's unfair conduct, he said, was taken to defend its
monopoly position from the challenge of Internet software. That is
quite different, for example, from Standard Oil, which was broken
up in 1911 after the courts found that it had illegally obtained
its monopoly position. Stripped of any niceties, Standard Oil's
acquisition overtures often amounted to: Merge with us or we'll put
you out of business. (Another major corporate breakup _ of AT&AMP;T in
1984 _ resulted from an out-of-court settlement rather than a
court-ordered remedy to antitrust complaints.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, courts have generally split up companies in federal
antitrust cases when the monopolist was created through mergers,
from Standard Oil and American Tobacco in the early part of the
century to Hollywood studios in the 1940s and '50s, who were forced
to divest themselves of the theater chains they had purchased.
Again, the merger precedent is not one that applies to Microsoft,
which has mostly grown on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts have very little experience with splitting up a
monopoly that is not the result of mergers,'' said Andrew I. Gavil,
a professor at Howard University law school. ``It is far easier to
envision where the line should be drawn for the breakup when the
defendant was created through a series of mergers than a company
like Microsoft. I think that would tend to make Judge Jackson more
hesitant to break up Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   The software maker argues that any proposal to break up the
company would be an extreme and radical step. In an e-mail message
to employees on Tuesday, Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's president and
chief executive, said that ``absolutely nothing in the current case
justifies breaking us up.'' Microsoft plans to appeal Judge
Jackson's ruling and is confident that it will win the case on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In criminal cases, the courts apply the common sense notion that
the punishment should fit the crime. And in federal antitrust
cases, the courts, a legal expert noted, try to ensure that the
remedies are ``a good fit'' with what the monopolist did.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the role of the remedy in a case like this is not to
punish Microsoft but to restore competition,'' said Herbert
Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school and a
leading antitrust authority, who has occasionally been consulted by
the government on legal matters.
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to the proposal, which the Justice
Department and states plan to submit to the court on Friday, the
government has concluded that splitting Microsoft in two is the
cleanest, most effective way to restore competition. The
government's plan calls for one company to have Microsoft's
industry-standard Windows operating system and a second company to
have its Office productivity software business and most other
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the two companies will effectively have its own monopoly
franchise: Windows has nearly 85 percent of the personal computer
operating system market, while the Office software _ like its
word-processing, spreadsheet and presentation programs _ hold more
than 90 percent of their respective markets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by separating them into individual companies, according to
government officials, the incentives for each will change, thus
fostering increased competition. The Office business, for example,
may well have a powerful incentive to make sure that it runs on
Linux, an increasingly popular version of the Unix operating
system, a competitor to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his ruling, Jackson referred to the market power
Microsoft derives from the close linkage of Windows with its Office
applications software as the ``applications barrier to entry'' for
prospective rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that is the underlying legal logic for this breakup,''
Hovenkamp said, ``that it removes the applications barrier to
entry.''
</P>
<P>
   The other government arguments for the breakup approach are that
they would require less continuing regulation of Microsoft than a
series of restrictions on the company's conduct, and that such
restrictions were likely to be ineffective in any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Judge Jackson will only take the leap to a breakup if he
convinced that conduct remedies will not work,'' Hovenkamp said.

   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush lamented partisan
divisiveness in the nation's capital Wednesday even as he headlined
a black-tie gala that raised a record $21.3 million for the
Republican National Committee to use against Democrats in the fall
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 Republican politicians, operatives and donors
attended the RNC fund-raiser at the National Guard Armory, hosted
by lobbyists for Republican-friendly tobacco and gun interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the gathering that he will end the partisan bickering
and ``restore civility and respect to our national politics'' if he
is elected president. He blamed President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, for
the partisan atmosphere in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore administration has been the most relentlessly
partisan administration in our nation's history, but sometimes some
in our own party have responded in kind,'' Bush said. ``Americans
have seen a cycle of bitterness, an arms race of anger. ... The
legacy is cynicism, a generic disgust.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were quick to question Bush's sincerity about
civility, noting that a co-host of the gala was Wayne LaPierre,
executive director of the National Rifle Association. Last month,
LaPierre accused Clinton of using high-profile shooting incidents
as justification for more gun control, and charged that Clinton was
``willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his
political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane attacked Bush for advocating less
partisanship while accepting money from groups such as the NRA that
have slammed Clinton and Democrats. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``For George Bush to be talking about non-partisanship at a
fund-raiser headlined by some of the country's most partisan
interest groups is like his talking about tolerance and then going
to Bob Jones University,`` said Lehane _ an allusion to Bush's
primary-season appearance at the fundamentalist Christian South
Carolina college that until recently banned interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told The Associated Press he has no problem with LaPierre
hosting the gala with a pledge to raise more than $250,000 for the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I believe. I support reasonable laws to keep guns
out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, the tobacco conglomerate and a co-host of the GOP
event, gave $300,000 to the party in the first quarter of this
year. Tobacco lobbyists are opposing efforts by some in Congress to
tighten regulations on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The gala's hosts also included Charles Wyly of Dallas, who,
along with his brother Sam, funded $2.5 million in commercials in
this year's primaries attacking Bush's opponent, Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the RNC gala he wants to show he can work with
Democrats and Republicans to do ``what is best for America.''
</P>
<P>
   He ticked off a litany of things Gore has said that Bush
characterized as the ``old Washington blame game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week was Earth Day. Unfortunately, for Al Gore's
campaign, every day is scorched-earth day, and it's time to clean
up the toxic environment in Washington, D.C.,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's fund-raiser broke the $14 million record for money
raised at a single event that was set last spring when Bush's
father, former President George Bush, headlined a national
Republican dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush already has set one record this year, raising $80
million for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also are having a record year. The Democratic National
Committee has raised $26 million so far, and hopes to break the
newly set single-event record at a Washington fund-raiser scheduled
for May 24.
</P>
<P>
   DNC spokeswoman Jenny Baucus said the ``Tribute to Bill
Clinton'' is expected to draw 14,000 people to the MCI Arena for a
concert and barbecue. While the party is expecting some large
donations, Baucus said many of those likely to attend will pay
between $50 and $100, ticket prices designed to attract younger
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our event is blue jeans and barbecue. Their event is
limousines and cavier,'' said Baucus.
</P>
<P>
   On another evening, however, the Democrats are hosting a small
dinner with the president for higher-dollar donors. The DNC also
has hosted a number of exclusive fund-raising events, including a
recent Hollywood dinner that drew celebrities shelling out a
minimum of $25,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's GOP event, the various Democratic committees
were slightly outpacing the Republicans in fund-raising for the
first quarter, raising about $26.7 million compared to $26.5
million for the GOP, according to a Common Cause analysis of
Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   RNC Co-Chair Patricia Harrison said Wednesday's event raised a
combination of hard money and soft money for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Federal election law sets limits on individual donations of hard
money, which is used in candidates' election campaigns; soft money,
ostensibly intended for party-building or publicizing positions on
issues but not candidates, can be given to the political parties in
unlimited amounts.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail Wednesday, Gore took a shot at the
financial ties between Bush and the NRA evidenced by LaPierre's
prominence at the Wednesday gala. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Why does he always do what the NRA says he should do? '' Gore
asked as he campaigned in Connecticut &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Gore has attacked Bush for signing Texas' concealed handgun law
and a law prohibiting local governments from suing gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   The gun issue came to the forefront in Washington this week
after a teen-ager wounded seven children at the National Zoo in
what police believe was a gang-related shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fund-raiser, Bush's day in Washington included a
private meeting with Sens. Judd Gregg, R-New Hampshire, and Bob
Kerrey, D-Neb., to discuss a bipartisan approach to solving
problems with Social Security. Kerrey at one time supported former
U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who unsuccessfully challenged
Gore for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also met Wednesday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov. Bush said he stressed in the private meeting that the
United States and Russia can work together to ensure world peace.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also said he and Ivanov held major differences of
opinion on Russia's invasion of Chechnya and amending the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.

REASON FOR SLUMP STUMPS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The schedule suggested that it was a good
time for the Rangers to make a move. They returned to The Ballpark
in Arlington on April 17 after taking two of three games in
Cleveland, a series win that gave them both a .500 record and some
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   With a nine-game homestand looming, it seemed like a good time
to assert themselves. Not this time, not this team.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers went 2-7 on the homestand, after a 14-4 loss to the
Boston Red Sox yesterday, dropping to 8-13, their worst record
after their first 21 games since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing because it's like we're getting worse
instead of better,'' shortstop Royce Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every phase of the game was lacking in the nine home
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not playing well right now,'' left fielder Chad
Curtis said. ``Even the games we win we're not real crisp.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitching staff had a 5.49 earned-run average, and opponents
averaged 11.3 hits per game.
</P>
<P>
   The defense committed 12 errors, including four in the past two
games that led to six unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out there and basically embarrass yourself,'' Clayton
said. ``The last couple of games have been pretty lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense hit a respectable .276, but had few hits in key
situations. The Rangers hit .171 with runners in scoring position
the past four games. They averaged 4.4 runs per game in the
homestand and scored more than five runs just once in the nine
games.
</P>
<P>
   Young players such as Gabe Kapler, Ruben Mateo, Tom Evans and
Mike Lamb struggled, but veterans such as Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan
Rodriguez and Clayton also failed to deliver key hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everybody,'' Palmeiro said. ``It's not just the young
guys learning how to play. We've got to figure out a way to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The homestand began with a sweep by the Yankees. That could be
dismissed as not that big a deal, considering the Rangers never
seem to beat New York. With the lowly Minnesota Twins coming to
town, surely things would change.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't. The Rangers lost two of three to the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox followed the Twins, and again the Rangers had reason
to hope. Boston hadn't won a series in Arlington since August 1997.
But the Red Sox also won two of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disappointing thing is we don't see any signs of
improvement,'' Clayton said. ``We haven't executed and made the
plays. We've gone backward instead of forward.''

CLARK'S SHORT START CAPS 2-7 HOMESTAND FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers pitcher Mark Clark got rocked by the
Boston Red Sox yesterday, clear proof it's difficult to pitch with
your head in the guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-kept secret around the Rangers is that Clark's time in
the rotation is up the minute Justin Thompson is ready to pitch in
the big leagues. The problem is nobody knows when that will be.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Clark to hold down Thompson's spot, all the while
wondering if he's going to get traded, released or sent to the
bullpen. It's a difficult spot to be in and a 14-4 loss to the Red
Sox didn't help matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the back of my mind, this might happen, that might
happen,'' Clark said. ``But, hey, I'm making no excuses. This is
the big leagues. It's my job to go out there every five days and
pitch. I can't worry about what might happen in one week or two
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark failed to make it through the second inning, the first
time in 18 games the Rangers starting pitcher didn't pitch at least
five innings. His performance put the finishing touches on the
Rangers' 2-7 homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough homestand,'' designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro
said. ``We had some good teams come in, but we didn't play up to
par. Each player needs to focus on what we need to do to get out of
this and start playing good baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Johnny Oates: ``When you're going like this,
probably the worst possible thing that can happen, other than
getting one of your key players hurt, is to get four or five runs
behind in the first inning. Physically, the effort is there, but
mentally it's tough to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark retired the first two hitters before everything fell
apart. Two-out doubles by Brian Daubach and Nomar Garciaparra
started the rally, then Troy O'Leary walked and Carl Everett
smashed a three-run home run into the right-field seats. A single
by Jeff Frye, a walk to Jason Varitek and Wilton Veres' single made
it 5-0 before Clark could get out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up, up and up,'' Oates said. ``Everything was up. He tried
everything, changing speeds, but they didn't miss. He had a couple
outings where everything was at the knees. Today everything was at
the letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach's one-out single in the second followed by Ranger third
baseman Tom Evans' error on Garciaparra's grounder and O'Leary's
single to center brought Clark's outing to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel I hardly got any work in,'' Clark said. ``But
when you give up six runs in an inning and a third, it's hard for
Johnny to stay with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark started the season with two victories, including a 6-4
decision over the Indians in Cleveland in which he gave up four
earned runs in 51/3 innings. But he's lost his past two starts, to
the Minnesota Twins and Red Sox, giving up 11 runs in 61/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get into a difficult spot, I'm trying to make great
pitches rather than be my natural self, go after hitters, say
here's the pitch, hit a ground ball,'' Clark said. ``I've just got
to put it behind me and get back to pitching the way I did the last
five or six years. That's what got me here.''
</P>
<P>
   He's here now, and the Rangers have him scheduled to pitch
Wednesday against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. But that could be his
last start. The Rangers are hoping Thompson can join the rotation
May 7 against the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the Rangers have a lame-duck pitcher in their
rotation.

KOBE BRYANT IS NOT YOUR ORDINARY MAMA'S BOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With 38 seconds to play Sunday and the Lakers
leading Sacramento by 14 points, Kobe Bryant fought Vlade Divac to
the floor for a loose ball, giving up six inches and 50 pounds to
the Kings center but absolutely nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   This snippet from the Lakers' 10-point Game 1 playoff victory
was like a bulging vein, exposing Kobe Bryant's bloodlines.
Wrestling Divac to a draw, Bryant never looked more like his
mother's son.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you read that right.
</P>
<P>
   We realize you constantly hear the Lakers swingman referred to
as the son of former NBA player Joe ``Jellybean'' Bryant, the
implication being he is a Xerox copy of his father, albeit one that
came out slightly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the truth is, Bryant wasn't spit out of a copy machine, he
slipped out of his mother's womb. And Pam ``Jawbreaker'' Bryant's
involvement didn't end there.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's keen competitive nature, the wiring that makes winning
as much a reflex action as a sneeze? He gets it from his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most definitely,'' Bryant said. ``My mom is very competitive.
My dad is more the quiet type. He is more laid-back. I'm more like
my mom. When that side of me comes out, it can get pretty ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   True, that. Just ask the Knicks' Chris Childs, who earlier this
month got caught in Bryant's snarly web in the third quarter of a
game at the Staples Center, site of tonight's contest. The two
players exchanged blows before they were separated and sent to
their respective corners, er, locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The well-placed elbow to the mouth by Bryant that precipitated
the punches was a little trick he picked up in backyard games
growing up. Joe Bryant never coddled his kid in their one-on-one
contests and neither did Pam.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, hell hath no fury like a mother scored on.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was tough,'' Bryant said the other day after a practice
pointed toward tonight's Game 2 of the best-of-five opening-round
series against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled and shook his head as he spoke. This is how tough his
mother was, Bryant said: When he was 14 years old (and already
6-foot-3), he tried to dunk on her during one of their ``friendly''
games and Pam Bryant knocked him nearly into the neighbor's yard.
</P>
<P>
   If it surprises you that a good portion of what Bryant knows
about basketball, he learned from his mom, well, it shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bryant might have been the one who introduced Kobe to the
game, but Pam Bryant was the one who fostered the connection when
basketball, a high-maintenance mistress, took Joe Bryant away from
his family for weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was the one who drove me to practices and bought me
(basketball) videotapes,'' Kobe said.
</P>
<P>
   She also was the one who played Moses Malone to his Earl Monroe
when Joe Bryant wasn't around, a task Pam Bryant came to honestly.
Her brother, Chubby Cox, played basketball at San Francisco State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Had she been born a generation later, Pam Bryant might very well
have been the girl-next-door upon whom Sanaa Lathan's lead
character Monica Wright in the movie ``Love and Basketball'' was
modeled.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she was the mold from which sprang the competitiveness
that keeps Kobe climbing toward a summit nobody else can see, so
far in the clouds is it.
</P>
<P>
   Since his starting turn in the 1998 All-Star game, ``everybody
(has been) setting goals for me,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA suits led the way, trying to make him over in Michael
Jordan's image. ``But I have my own goals,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   He won't reveal them, except to say, ``They're higher than yours
(for him).''
</P>
<P>
   His mega-watt intensity? Bryant said he got that from his
mother, too. It didn't come from Joe Bryant, whose focus when it
came to basketball was diffused, like light filtered through a
lampshade.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother raised me to be an individual, to be independent,''
Kobe said. ``She encouraged me to set my own goals, to follow my
own path. I really appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   From his father, Bryant said, he took ``the Afro and the
ballhandling skills.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. ``That's pretty much it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. The father, like the son, always firmly
believed he could soar higher, if only his coaches would consent to
having the ceiling raised.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bryant saw himself as a guard trapped in a 6-10 body
pigeonholed in a league that hadn't yet come under the spell of a
Magic man. Joe Bryant dribbled behind his back, launched long-range
shots and, his first few years in the league, in Philadelphia, did
a lot of deferring to Julius Erving and George McGinnis.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bryant was about to enter his fourth and final season with
the 76ers when his youngest child and only son was born in August
of 1978. Beginning in 1979, Joe spent three years playing for the
San Diego Clippers. It was there that the seeds for Kobe's NBA
career were planted.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 3, Bryant announced that he wanted to grow up to
be a professional basketball player, just like his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Say this about life: It employs a full-circle stratagem that can
be even more seamless than Tex Winter's triangle offense. People
familiar with Joe Bryant's game in his heyday say the son has grown
up to be the player the father always pictured himself to be.
</P>
<P>
   Only larger. And, yes, smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was about 6-10,'' said Bryant, who comes up three
inches short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed my dad stole my height,'' he said,
flashing a smile that turned his face into a reflector for both his
parents. &QL;

   ``Carolina Moon'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Nora Roberts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Putnam, $24.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Success can be debilitating, and that appears to be the case
with writer Nora Roberts and ``Carolina Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moon'' is one of several instant bestsellers following
Roberts' breakout from the romance genre into the literary
mainstream, whatever that latter term means.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Perhaps she has fantasies of being recognized by
critics as an authentic literary talent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps part of the trouble is that Roberts' 100-plus titles
have collectively sold more than 85 million copies. She's not a
writer. She's her own industry, and she has legions of loyal fans
demanding more.
</P>
<P>
   So, how does one accommodate the readers who have made her rich,
justify an initial press run of 400,000 and produce a book that
will finally satisfy carping critics?
</P>
<P>
   ``Carolina Moon'' ain't the way.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a bad book, but it's not a good one, either. There's
certainly nothing unique about it. ``Carolina Moon'' is 438 pages
of well-traveled fictional territory.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman who once fled to escape her past returns to her
hometown of Progress (nothing subtle there), S.C., where she sets
up a small business and is wooed by a dashingly handsome scion of
the Lavelle family, masters of the oldest, richest cotton
plantation in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both of them come from dysfunctional families, and
both also have names suited to the sort of TV soap operas where the
women are all named Marissa or Nikki, and men are named Thorn or
Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Carolina Moon,'' our lovers are Tory and Cade _ short for
Victoria and Kincade. Cute, huh?
</P>
<P>
   For melodrama, Roberts tosses in the murder of Cade's sister,
Hope, 18 years earlier. An 8-year-old schoolgirl, Hope was
bicycling to see her best friend, Tory, when she was attacked _ so,
of course, many of the townsfolk somehow blame Tory for Hope's
death.
</P>
<P>
   The first chapter shows some promise as Hope's death and Tory's
mistreatment by her father, Hannibal (another soap opera name), are
related reasonably well. But, even then, Roberts resorts to
laughable cliches: ``Her hair was the color of cornsilk;'' ``When
she rode (her bicycle), she rode like the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the eventual sex scenes are yawners. It doesn't get much
better than: ``He rushed wild kisses over her face, foolish and
sweet as a puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a tiresome, plodding, vastly overlong soap opera set
down South on the plantation; the magnolias and honeysuckles aren't
the only thing dripping here, y'all.

MUNOZ PUT ON DISABLED LIST

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Left-handed reliever Mike Munoz was placed on
the disabled list with tendinitis in his left elbow and left-hander
Doug Davis was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma. Munoz is scheduled
to undergo a magnetic resonance imaging exam today to see if
there's more serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what an MRI might show, but the doctors don't
seem to think it's serious,'' Munoz said. ``That's kind of baffling
because the pain doesn't allow me to pull down on my pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz faced four batters yesterday and three reached, on two
singles and a walk. After seven appearances he has a 13.50
earned-run average, and opponents have 11 hits in 18 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it's minor,'' Munoz said. ``But at the same time, I
do need these two weeks because it's progressively worse.''  &QL; 
Davis over hitter
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers recalled Doug Davis from Oklahoma for two reasons.
First and foremost, they want to give him a shot at being their
left-handed setup reliever. With Mike Venafro struggling and Mike
Munoz on the disabled list, the Rangers are looking for somebody to
get left-handed hitters out late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows,'' Johnny Oates said. ``After a couple of outings,
he might be the one in there in the seventh inning getting
left-handers out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could still use a left-handed bat off the bench, but
they didn't see any attractive possibilities in Oklahoma. General
manager Doug Melvin has been looking around the big leagues but
said, ``I'm having a heckuva time trying to find anybody
worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Major-league officials said Quinton McCracken, Karim Garcia and
Luis Polonia are available, but the Rangers aren't interested in
overpaying for somebody who might be needed for no more than two
weeks. The Rangers asked the St. Louis Cardinals about Thomas
Howard but were told he was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said outfielder Rusty Greer is making excellent progress
in his recovery from ankle surgery and both he and Frank
Catalanotto could be back in 2-3 weeks. That would eliminate the
need for a left-handed hitter, which is why the Rangers don't want
to make a big trade or take on a big salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus,'' Melvin said, ``We need to find out what Davis can
do.''  &QL; 
Cordero moving up
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Francisco Cordero is pushing for a more prominent role
in the Rangers bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, who's being used mainly in the fifth and sixth innings,
turned in his eighth consecutive scoreless outing yesterday,
pitching 12/3 innings. Cordero's ERA is 2.38, and opponents are
hitting .190 off him. Both numbers are the lowest on the pitching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cordero threw well,'' Oates said.  &QL; 
Thompson target date
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have scheduled Justin Thompson to pitch for the
Double-A Tulsa Drillers on Monday, putting him in line to return to
the Rangers' rotation May 7 against the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Much still depends on how he pitches, and the Rangers have not
ruled out keeping Thompson in the minors until May 15 when his
30-day medical rehabilitation assignment runs out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll make one more start, and then we'll re-evaluate,''
Johnny Oates said.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ William H. Donaldson is driving hard to
transform Aetna, the nation's biggest health insurer, into a warm,
consumer-friendly company that makes more profits and fewer
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 60 days as chief executive, he has sidestepped
fights with belligerent trial lawyers, embarked on what he calls
first steps toward healing strained relations with doctors, and
hired a search firm to find a leader for Aetna's health care
business.
</P>
<P>
   But he is under pressure from disaffected shareholders who
played a role in ousting his predecessor, Richard A. Huber, on Feb.
25. These investors want even quicker action to bolster Aetna's
stock, which is languishing in the mid-$50 range after sliding 40
percent over the past year. Barring a takeover offer, which Wall
Street views as unlikely, the shareholders want Aetna to rapidly
sell more assets and use the proceeds to buy back shares.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna reports its first-quarter earnings on Thursday, a day
ahead of its annual meeting in Hartford, and a spokesman for
several institutional investors plans to press their case.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said on Thursday that Aetna was talking with 30
business partners in 17 countries about selling some foreign units.
He said these assets could sell for $500 million to $1.5 billion.
But discontented investors say the company should sell even more,
perhaps its entire foreign operation.
</P>
<P>
   They are still dismayed that Aetna rejected a tentative offer to
discuss a takeover for $70 a share from ING, the Dutch-based
international finance group, and Wellpoint Health Networks, a
California managed care company, in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a lot of time,'' said Nell Minow, a
shareholder activist in Washington who is editor of the Corporate
Library, which provides information on shareholder relations and
corporate governance. ``I think we're talking about months.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert A. Denton, president of Providence Capital Inc., which
he described as a brokerage firm for institutional investors and
who was the host of a meeting of holders of some 25 percent of
Aetna shares in early April, said most investors hoped that
Donaldson, a co-founder of the Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
securities firm, would please them by delivering more than he has
promised so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect any precipitous developments at the meeting,
Denton said. But he added that among the shareholders he had met
with, ``There was a consensus that they should strengthen the
split-up plan so more value is delivered with more certainty more
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street traders and investors are also watching the results
of Aetna's $1 billion purchase of the troubled health care business
of Prudential Insurance Co. last year. Prudential's health
maintenance organizations lost $327 million nationwide last year,
according to filings by the Texas insurance department.
</P>
<P>
   Since he succeeded Huber, Donaldson, 68, a Wall Street
investment banker and former president of the New York Stock
Exchange, has been trying to shake up the company. He says he will
stay at the helm ``for the duration,'' until the company's problems
are straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing a plan to split Aetna into separate publicly traded
health care and financial services companies _ what the company
calls health and wealth _ Donaldson hired Russell Reynolds
Associates, the Chicago executive search firm, to seek a chief for
the health company, which generates half of operating income and
more than its share of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's U.S. Healthcare unit is under attack in lawsuits across
the country. And important hospitals like the Baptist Health
Systems in southern Florida are resisting sharp discounts and
refusing to renew managed care contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As for its Prudential subsidiary, Aetna will report improvements
for the first quarter. But because of a lag in receiving and paying
medical bills, actual results will not come in until May, said
William McKeever, a health care analyst at PaineWebber Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential's losses at its health maintenance organizations last
year, including $115 million in Texas and $112 million in Florida,
reflected prices that were too low, Aetna said, along with one-time
costs like payments to departing Prudential executives. Aetna has
since raised prices charged by the units.
</P>
<P>
   Successful chief executives are scarce in managed care, which is
just beginning to climb out of a lengthy downturn, and executive
recruiters are hard pressed to name any strong candidates who are
likely to be interested in the Aetna health care post.
</P>
<P>
   So Aetna is also looking at executives in pharmaceuticals and
other health care fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody not immersed in the old way of doing things'' could
be best, Donaldson said. Aetna needs ``an executive who knows how
to deal with 21 million customers,'' he said, and contend with big
changes in the health care market: customers who insist on choices
rather than tight cost controls and a rapidly growing role for the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna needs ``somebody who is politically astute as well,'' said
Mike Kelly, a health care specialist at Korn/Ferry International,
an executive search firm, referring to attacks on managed care in
Congress and a number of states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to searching for a health care chief, Aetna has
asked Deloitte &AMP; Touche, the consulting firm, to examine its health
care strategies. The board and the new health care executive will
get the Deloitte report, which is expected shortly. Meanwhile,
Donaldson said he was ``well along'' with a previously announced
plan to squeeze payroll costs by $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna has tried to improve relations with doctors, settling a
lawsuit brought by the attorney general of Texas that challenged
managed care practices. But the Texas and American Medical
Associations have attacked the agreement. Donaldson said the Texas
deal was just a start, and implied that Aetna would go further to
smooth relations with care providers.
</P>
<P>
   It may have little choice. Two states, Kentucky and Maryland,
have already banned Aetna's so-called ``all products'' rule that
requires doctors who treat any patients insured by the company to
also accept the lowest-paying members of Aetna's health maintenance
organizations. Other states are considering similar bills. &QL;

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
It's still all about golf for Peter Jacobsen.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's all I know,'' Jacobsen said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   He plays less tournament golf than he has in the past, choosing
instead to devote more time to family and his golf-related
businesses, like his course design company. But his love of the
game hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still fun,'' Jacobsen said. ``It's still golf.''
</P>
<P>
   It's why Jacobsen truly enjoyed himself during the Shell Houston
Open pro-am Wednesday, yukking it up with his amateur partners,
signing autographs and cracking jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Some pros merely suffer through the long pro-am rounds with
high-handicappers. Not Jake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, they're out there having fun and they're all good guys,''
Jacobsen said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the magic is still very much there for Jacobsen, the
music is now gone. The biggest thing missing from Jacobsen's many
golf-related ventures this year is his role as the lead singer of
the musical group Jake Trout and the Flounders.
</P>
<P>
   That ended when Payne Stewart's plane went down in a South
Dakota field just days before the Tour Championship in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Payne gone, it's really over,'' Jacobsen said. ``It's so
sad. The recording company is thinking about re-releasing our last
album as a tribute to Payne. But I'm not sure what's going to
happen. I just know we had so much fun doing it. Payne loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jacobsen finds it hard to believe that just last year,
he and his fellow Flounders _ Stewart and Mark Lye _ were in the
recording studio, working on their second album and giggling like
small schoolboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd look at each other and laugh and say, `Can you believe
we're in here recording with people like Graham Nash, Alice Cooper
and REO Speedwagon?''' Jacobsen said. ``When we were recording, it
was such an emotional high for all of us. Music was such a passion
of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   As fans at the SHO came to know. At last year's tournament,
Stewart and Jacobsen spent several nights singing at a local
watering hole with the popular Austin-based band Duck Soup. In
fact, their impromptu appearances on stage were one of the things
Stewart and Jacobsen looked forward to every year in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a blast,'' Jacobsen said. ``I even used to bring
my guitar on the road. But since Payne died, I just don't have the
feel. Payne was always larger than life.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Jacobsen, the other areas of his golfing life
keep him busy, leaving little time to dwell on what's gone. He and
design partner Jim Hardy are putting the finishing touches on their
latest effort, a 36-hole public tract located on U.S. 290 off
Spring Cypress Road in Northwest Houston known as Black Horse.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen said 15 holes on the north course are now ready to go,
and he hopes to have the entire course ready for play by late
summer. The south tract should be open in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the most unique courses in the United
States,'' Jacobsen said. ``You feel like you're in South Carolina
low country and the Pacific Northwest at the same time. It's really
cool. There are such beautiful trees on that property, and it's
just a very unique, interesting project.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the competitive fires might not be burning as
brightly as they once did, but Jacobsen would still like to make a
run at one more victory.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps take one more stab at finding the music again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duck Soup's playing again this week,'' Jacobsen said. ``I
think I might go over tonight and sing a little. I think it might
be fun.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years ago, one of New York City's most
adventurous school districts set out to tackle a nagging problem:
the math phobia that afflicts many students, and the disparity
between the test scores of white middle-class students and their
poorer black and Hispanic counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The district, which stretches from the Upper East Side of
Manhattan down to Chinatown, embraced a new ``constructivist''
curriculum without textbooks. This approach preaches that it is
more important for children to construct their own solutions to
mathematical problems than to learn the standard rules _ from
multiplication tables to the value of pi _ handed down through the
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Long ranked near the top of the city in mathematics, the
district has held its place. But the new curriculum has enraged
many parents who find that their children cannot multiply easily or
understand basic algebra.
</P>
<P>
   One parent, Anna Huang, said her son, Mack, a fourth-grader,
``felt a lack of clarity'' when his teacher insisted that he
estimate answers, rather than compute them precisely. Another
parent, Anne Cattaneo Santore, said she was troubled because her
son, William, a second-grader at Public School 124 in Chinatown,
spent months counting with coins and solving equations using
``friendly numbers'' _ for instance, converting 71 plus 19 into the
easier 70 plus 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those strategies don't work when you get to larger numbers,''
Santore said, ``and they have been doing those strategies all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Huang and Santore have joined other parents, mathematicians and
many teachers in a rebellion that has shaken education from New
York City to Plano, Texas, and Lincoln, Mass. As school districts
from affluent enclaves in Greenwich Village to poor minority
neighborhoods like Brooklyn's East New York have embraced
constructivist math, parents have formed e-mail networks and turned
out in force at school meetings to protest what they say is ``fuzzy
math'' and the systematic ``dumbing down'' of mathematics teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are worried,'' said Elizabeth Carson, an actress, the
mother of a seventh-grader and a leader of the protest movement in
New York City. ``They're scared that their kids are not going to be
competitive. The math is not in their bones.'
</P>
<P>
   The backlash has drawn the attention of the National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics, the nation's most influential group of
math teachers. Meeting in Chicago on April 12, it revised its
11-year-old standards for teaching mathematics, the closest thing
the United States has to a national curriculum. Though not
abandoning its original constructivist agenda, the council put the
arithmetic back in math by adding language emphasizing accuracy,
efficiency and basic skills like memorizing the multiplication
tables. The chairwoman of the standards committee declared that the
group's new message was ``Get the right answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The new math has at its core a passionate belief shared by tens
of thousands of teachers around the country that they can reach
more children, especially low-achieving minority students, by
dropping standard rules in favor of exercises that allow students
to discover the principles of math on their own. Constructivist
programs are being tried in more than half of New York City's 1,145
schools, Board of Education officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Educators who support the new math say that old-fashioned
teaching through memorization and rules produced generations of
people who hated math and never deeply understood it. Indeed, the
manifesto of constructivist mathematicians, the 1989 standards of
the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, urges teachers not
to demand too much accuracy too early. After all, the standards
say, students will have access to calculators and computers. Math
should be ``flexible,'' the standards say, and ``reasonable''
answers should be valued over a single right answer.
</P>
<P>
   The constructivist movement has led to the widespread rejection
of textbooks, in favor of exercises using blocks, beans and other
materials. One popular program, MathLand, suggests that students
count a million grains of birdseed to get a feeling for the size of
a million. Another, Everyday Mathematics, teaches children an
ancient Egyptian method of multiplication.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests that fourth-graders measure angles with bent
straws instead of protractors. Connected Mathematics, a popular
middle-school program used widely in New York, teaches
sixth-graders to add fractions by folding paper strips into
segments representing halves or fourths or thirds, instead of by
converting to common denominators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child can do something in this kind of problem,'' said
the leader of a recent workshop for parents. ``That's the most
beautiful part. Some children just enjoy the folding.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lucy West, the director of mathematics at Manhattan's
District 2, where the new math has been most aggressively adopted,
said that old-fashioned math had been oversold. ``There is a
misconception that in the good old days everybody could add and
subtract, multiply and divide really easily and efficiently,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But professional mathematicians say the activists have set up a
false dichotomy between conceptual understanding and basic skills.
Parents chafing at constructivist math tell stories of their
children's coming home confused and dispirited by lessons in which
getting the right answer to problems is devalued in favor of
celebrating strategies that are often primitive, cumbersome and
indirect. Used by inexperienced teachers who are weak in math, they
say, the curriculum can be murky. And tutoring services say that
they are seeing an epidemic of children coming to them for basic
math instruction.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   How schools got to this point is a saga of good intentions,
unproven theories and a progressive education movement that has has
had its most profound impact in reading and math. In many ways, the
math wars echo the once ferocious disputes about reading between
advocates of the intuitive ``whole language'' approach, which
stresses acquiring skills through simple reading of books, and the
phonics method, which stresses decoding of letters and words. Until
``whole language'' became a dirty word, constructivist math was
known as ``whole math.'' One obvious solution is to mix a bit of
both. But while educators have called a truce in the reading wars,
deciding that compromise is best, the math wars continue to rage.
</P>
<P>
   The high point for new math advocates came last October, when a
panel set up by the U.S. Education Department endorsed 10
constructivist math programs as ``exemplary'' or ``promising.''
Within a few weeks, nearly 200 university mathematicians and
scholars sent an open letter to Education Secretary Richard W.
Riley warning that the 10 programs had ``serious mathematical
shortcomings'' and would leave students ill-prepared for
college-level courses.
</P>
<P>
   R. James Milgram, a mathematics professor at Stanford
University, analyzed three programs and found that they
consistently neglected to teach basic rules of multiplication,
division, addition and subtraction. The programs are typically one
or two years behind grade level, he said, and aimed at what he
considered underachieving students.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is ambivalence in the teaching field. When the
national council of mathematics teachers endorsed more of a balance
between basics and the constructivist approach at the group's
annual meeting in Chicago, the president-elect, Lee V. Stiff,
ardently defended constructivism. ``If I only teach it the way I
understand, then only students who understand it the way I do will
be successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence to support the educational virtues of new math is
inconclusive at best. Publishers have provided studies in which
they compare the results in pilot schools that adopted the program
to other schools that made no change. But those studies have been
challenged by critics who say improvements may be the result of
better training of teachers, and the extra attention given to pilot
programs. In the last few years, many standardized tests have been
rewritten to match the new techniques, making comparisons even more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   District 2, which has a high percentage of affluent students,
has long ranked near the top of the city school system. Last year,
when a new math test was introduced, scores across the city
declined, and District 2 was the only district in the city to
remain stable.
</P>
<P>
   West, the math coordinator, said that was evidence the program
was working, but there is still a disparity in test scores between
the poorest schools and the more affluent ones. And other officials
noted that the new test was closely aligned with the District 2
curriculum, and many parents attributed the good scores to tutoring
and home schooling. And they noted that the district had been
spending $800,000 a year on training math teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Even experience in the classroom can be ambiguous. Roberta
Schorr, an education professor at Rutgers, is using a computer
simulation of a frog and a clown walking back and forth across a
plane to help teach the concept of velocity at Central High School
in Newark, N.J. Schorr sees the simulation as an intuitive
introduction to calculus that does not require what she called
``formal symbol structure.'' But during a recent class, half the
students seemed baffled, while Tieyon Hendry and Rahul Patel, the
star students, told a visitor that they had arrived at the answer
to one exercise by using a mathematical formula: y equals mx plus
b.
</P>
<P>
   As the new math _ a cousin of the ``new math'' popular in the
1960s _ entered the educational mainstream, first in California in
1992 and then around the country, it sparked waves of opposition.
Hostility came first from conservative parents who opposed any
change in education, then from university math professors who felt
it was not rigorous, and finally from liberal, affluent parents who
were worried their children were not getting enough math to succeed
in school and in life.
</P>
<P>
   In Plano, Texas, parents have sued the school district for
refusing to provide an alternative to Connected Math. In New York,
the opposition first emerged not in a failing school but in one of
the city's best, Public School 234 in TriBeCa. Edgy schoolyard
conversations grew into a parent Math Committee, which gathered
members across the district, sending out surveys and making angry
statements at school board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Parents said they were stunned as they talked to their friends
and realized how many had hired tutors. Those who cannot afford
tutoring tell of scouring educational bookstores for workbooks and
textbooks to help them make sense of the new math.
</P>
<P>
   Huang said she became alarmed when her son, Mack, a
fourth-grader at the Bridges School in Manhattan, came home
complaining that he hated math. The emphasis on estimation, she
said, was confusing him. She bought him workbooks consisting of
straightforward calculations, and he enjoyed the sense of mastery.
Constructivist teachers celebrate the unconventional exercises they
use as a way of keeping weaker children engaged, especially those
from groups that have historically lagged in mathematics
performance, like girls and black and Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   But some parents are insulted by them. Weinberg, a dentist, said
she was appalled when her daughter, Kelly, a sixth-grader at East
Side Middle School, came home with assignments to write her math
autobiography and to write about her favorite number. ``She was
being graded on grammar and spelling,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wilfried Schmid, a professor of mathematics at Harvard, became a
critic of constructivist programs after his daughter, Sabina, began
using one of them, TERC Investigations in Number, Data and Space,
at her elementary school in Lincoln, Mass. When she started second
grade last fall, Sabina knew how to carry tens and add two-digit
numbers, Schmid said. Sabina's teacher, who is well-intentioned but
too inexperienced to deviate from the program, Schmid said, told
the child that she was not allowed to use this method; she had to
demonstrate her work with blocks or by counting on her fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Sabina is reduced to drawing 39 little men to solve
problems like 39 minus 14,'' her father said.
</P>
<P>
   He worries that this rudimentary and tedious approach is
quashing Sabina's spirit. ``Last year, she would have complained
that this is below her level,'' Schmid said, ``but she doesn't
rebel anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a professional mathematician, and I myself very often use
mathematical methods that I understand only imprecisely,'' he said.
``It is while I use them that I begin to understand. After a while,
the use and the understanding are mutually supporting.''
</P>
<P>
   In their worst nightmares, parents fear that schools are
producing a lost generation of math illiterate children. Bruce
Winokur, a math teacher at Stuyvesant High School, New York City's
most selective public school, says he is seeing more and more
students who are gifted in math but unable to keep up with high
school work. They understand concepts, he said, but have not
internalized the rules.
</P>
<P>
   There are some signs of change.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lachman, a spokesman for District 2 in New York City,
said the district was responding to parent concerns. ``We are not
purists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   California recently adopted new standards with a stronger focus
on computation, and many districts will be putting them into place
this fall. Some teachers, often the most experienced, have
instinctively combined the old and the new.
</P>
<P>
   The Daniel Boone School, in West Ridge, a tidy working class
part of Chicago brightened by magnolia trees and the babushkas of
Russian grandmothers, has been a laboratory for the development of
TIMS Math Trailblazers, a constructivist program created by the
University of Illinois. Math scores have risen since the program
was put into effect. The principal, Paul Zavitkovsky, credits the
program, but does not rule out the halo effect _ increased
attention to math, teacher training and collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   In fifth grade the other day, Mila Kell, a Russian immigrant,
taught a crisp lesson in probability, improvising riffs on the
probability that the sun would rise in the morning and that she
would fly to the moon. The class was enchanted.
</P>
<P>
   Kell said she loved the freedom and creativity of the new math.
But on her desk was a secret weapon: a stack of worksheets _ the
antithesis of constructivist math _ pages of classic problems in
long division, the addition of fractions and reducing the sum of
fractions to its simplest terms.

PRIVATE COMPANY TO PULL OUT OF OPERATING TROUBLED PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wackenhut Corrections Corp., the world's largest private
for-profit prison company, announced Wednesday that it was
abandoning a contract to run a juvenile prison in Louisiana after a
New Orleans judge and the Justice Department found that the inmates
were being physically abused and deprived of adequate food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut said it had informed the Louisiana Department of
Public Safety and Corrections that it intended to seek bids from
other states and the federal government to convert the juvenile
prison into one for adults.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to the 226 boys at the prison, at Jena in
central Louisiana, is unclear. In a press release, Wackenhut said
it would ``cooperate fully'' with the authorities ``to ensure an
orderly transition of the juvenile residents currently housed at
the facility to other suitable facilities over a period of several
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and
Corrections did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mark Doherty of the New Orleans Juvenile Court, who has
released 11 boys he sentenced because of the conditions at Jena,
said, ``This isn't a victory for me, but for the kids and for
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty has been holding hearings on the prison and has
denounced Wackenhut for depriving the boys of adequate food and
warm clothing and allowing physical abuse by the guards.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and
Corrections took over the prison after a state investigation
discovered that part of a videotape that reportedly showed abuse by
a guard was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut said that it had made ``extensive improvements'' at
Jena as a result of the criticism but that a series of lawsuits
over conditions at Jena and other juvenile prisons in Louisiana had
made operating Jena very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   David Utter, the director of the Juvenile Justice Project of
Louisiana, which has sued Wackenhut and Louisiana, said,
``Privatization has been a failure in Louisiana and the sooner we
end that experiment the better.''

RETIREE WITH HIGH DRUG BILLS LENDS A HAND TO GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS graf at end with Bush' proposal)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. _ Shirley Kindle, a 65-year-old retired
clerical worker, played a bit part in Al Gore's presidential
campaign Wednesday, but it was enough to win her over to the vice
president's side.
</P>
<P>
   She needs a dozen different prescription drugs each month. All
told, they cost more than $500 a month, which is more than her
Social Security check. To keep up her regimen, she has borrowed
money from her family, although, like many elderly people on fixed
incomes, she sometimes skips certain drugs altogether because she
cannot afford them.
</P>
<P>
   She likes Vice President Gore's proposal that Medicare cover the
cost of prescription drugs. And so Wednesday, after a magazine, to
which she had written a letter about the high cost of prescription
drugs, arranged with the campaign for a ``photo op,'' she posed
with Gore at Pelton's Drug Store here to illustrate her problem.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, she shops around at different pharmacies in her
hometown of Ansonia, and she had already bought her drugs for the
month. But in order to accommodate the vice president's campaign,
she and her son drove 40 miles from her home in Ansonia to East
Hartford, and she re-enacted her purchases at Pelton's, a quaint
family pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the drug store filled a dozen orange prescription bottles
with pills, rang them up at the cash register and declared to the
assembled cameras that her total came to $506.34, more than her
monthly Social Security check of $496.
</P>
<P>
   The event was part of a coordinated effort by Democrats across
the country to demonstrate their concern that drug prices are
soaring out of control and that they are more attentive than the
Republicans to the real-life needs of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said only that Kindle was helping him to illustrate a
larger problem and that ``as a courtesy'' she had ``aggregated''
her purchase at Pelton's.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Kindle said that she did not mind being a prop in
the campaign, even after several calls from Gore aides who were
fretting that she might be overcome with ``stage fright.''
</P>
<P>
   She is registered as an independent. But as she and her son sat
in a hallway outside the vice president's holding room at a center
for the elderly, she said she decided then and there that she would
vote for him. ``The Democrats usually handle the issues that I
believe better pertain to the average citizen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Joe, 31, who had taken time off from his job as an
apprentice optician to accompany his mother, said that he is a
registered Republican but that Gore had won him over too. ``It's
amazing how he's taken an interest,'' he said. ``This is something
that's important to me because it's important to my family. He
definitely has my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore used the event to promote his proposal for offering the
elderly a prescription drug benefit through Medicare, costing $200
billion over 10 years. He also took a jab at the drug industry,
calling it ``out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to the point where the margins are way out of
line with what most other industries and most other lines of
business believe is normal and adequate,'' he said, ``and they're
using the market power to dictate prices that are way above what
the competition would set them at.''
</P>
<P>
   This month's Fortune magazine reports that the pharmaceutical
industry has yielded the highest profits of the nation's top 40
industries. But it also notes that the industry's stock prices are
off considerably, and that this has been the source of considerable
concern at the drug companies _ that any Medicare plan to offer a
prescription drug benefit would ultimately constrain drug prices
and cut into profits. The drug industry worries that whatever it
might gain in new consumers who buy drugs because they are covered
under a government plan, it would lose in profits because the
government would pay less than the prices the companies charge now.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House Wednesday, President Clinton issued a study
saying that prices of the drugs most widely used by older Americans
had increased more than consumer prices in general. The study, by
Families USA, a consumer group, said that prices of the 50
top-selling drugs used by the elderly rose at nearly twice the
overall rate of inflation from January 1999 to January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniors living on fixed incomes simply can't cope with these
kinds of price increases forever,'' Clinton said. ``That's why we
should take action to help them, and do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a proposal outlined recently by House Republicans
did not go far enough. Clinton said it would ``do nothing'' for
those with annual incomes below $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kindle and her husband, Joseph, 70, a retired painter with a
union pension, earn less than half of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created Medicare in the first place because we knew it was
wrong for our parents' basic health to be decided by their
wealth,'' Gore said. His plan would allow those age 55 to 65 who
have no health insurance to buy into Medicare, providing free
coverage for low-income recipients and some benefits for those who
would pay $44 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival, contends
that the Gore plan would force families into a bureaucratic
government program. Bush instead offers low-income families a
refundable tax credit to buy private health insurance.

KNIGHT ERRANT OR ERRING? SOTHEBY'S TALE

or 888-346-9867.) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes fairy tales do not have happy endings, even for
knights in shining armor. That lesson should come as no surprise to
A. Alfred Taubman, the shopping mall magnate who has made a second
career out of rescuing companies in distress from the arms of
unwelcome suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, however, could have dreamed up a tale like that of
Sotheby's, the venerable auction house that Taubman saved in 1983.
As if by magic, Sotheby's recovered, then prospered, under
Taubman's reign as chairman. It hit another rough patch in the
early 1990s, along with the rest of his empire. Then, Sotheby's
rebounded once more _ until federal investigators intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman, 75, resigned in February as chairman and is now
stepping down as a director of Sotheby's, with his armor tarnished.
And the Sotheby's story threatens to overshadow a life that might
well qualify as a Horatio Alger story come true.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors are investigating whether, in 1995, and
perhaps as early as 1992, Sotheby's conspired with its chief rival,
Christie's, to split business and fix commissions. Christie's has
as much as acknowledged antitrust violations by entering a
government program that promises leniency to the first conspirator
in antitrust cases to confess. Scores of customers who contend that
they were grossly overcharged have sued both auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   And fingers are being pointed at Taubman. Prosecutors have been
told that he and the former chairman of Christie's dreamed up the
commission-fixing scheme and ordered their executives to carry it
out, according to people involved in the case. No one, however, has
been charged, and much about the investigation remains murky.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman, while declining to be interviewed, has adamantly denied
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   His son Robert was to replace him as a director at a shareholder
meeting that was set for Wednesday in London. But the meeting was
suddenly postponed on Tuesday because the company's largest outside
shareholder, Ronald Baron, objected to the continuing Taubman
influence. Baron's firm, Baron Capital Management, owns about 38
percent Sotheby's; the senior Taubman still owns about 22 percent
of Sotheby's and has so-called supervoting rights that give him
control of the board.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Taubman's knight errantry has
landed him in trouble. His rescue of the Washington
department-store chain Woodward &AMP; Lothrop cost him hundreds of
millions of dollars and ended in bankruptcy in 1994. Macy's, the
department store in which he had a major stake, also went bankrupt,
in 1992. And he went into New York City real estate in the late
1980s, just before the local economy swooned.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the early '90s recession hurt his department stores
and shopping malls and slammed Sotheby's, where auction sales, and
profits, plunged. In 1992 Taubman began trying to raise cash,
selling off some of his depressed Sotheby's stock, some art works
and, eventually, a major stake in his malls. All this occurred
during the period now under investigation by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the financial pressures he faced, Taubman's friends
and business associates say they cannot believe that he would have
done anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall a single instance in which anyone has said that
he cut a corner or did anything inappropriate,'' said one friend,
Richard A. Manoogian, chairman of Masco Corp. in Detroit. ``I just
can't believe that Sotheby's was that important in the overall
scheme of things that it would be the one area in which he would do
something improper.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of immigrants from Germany (the initial A. stands for
Adolph), Taubman studied architecture at the University of Michigan
but never graduated. In 1950, he borrowed $5,000 and began building
on a small scale, a bridal shop here, a shopping strip there.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two decades, the shopping centers grew bigger and
grander until they turned into the glossy regional malls. Peter
Linneman, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania, said that it was Taubman who ``took the shopping
center from a sort of schlocky product in the 1950s and 1960s into
very creative and exciting places of business and of suburban
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   He became famous in the business world for his good eye, his
attention to detail _ and his bluntness. Leslie H. Wexner, founder
of Limited Inc., likes to tell the story of the first time they met
when Taubman summoned him to Detroit in the early 1970s. They
climbed aboard a helicopter and visited one mall after another.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch, Taubman ordered Wexner to fix up his stores, which
he called ``a blight on my shopping centers.'' Wexner says now that
he was ``really mad,'' but eventually realized that Taubman was
right.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Taubman reached his 50s, though, that he
developed a reputation as an investment whiz after putting together
what turned out to be one of the real estate deals of the century:
the purchase of the Irvine Ranch, then being developed in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman was invited by some members of the Irvine family to come
in as a white knight and rescue the 77,000-acre property from Mobil
Corp., which had won a bidding war for it. He assembled a band of
his rich friends, who bought it for $337 million in 1977. When they
sold out six years later, Taubman and his friends had scored a
profit of more than $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   That was where the cash came from to buy Sotheby's, the English
auction house, which was founded in 1744. Having expanded too
rapidly in the late 1970s, it was forced after an art market slump
to fire half its staff and started losing money. A pair of U.S.
corporate raiders began to buy up shares, sending shudders though
the ranks of the titled gentlemen and Old Etonians who had always
run the place.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman, once again, looked like a white knight. He may have
been another rich U.S. businessman, complete with a perpetual tan,
constant cigar and a beautiful young second wife, but at least he
wasn't a breakup specialist. And he had artistic connections. A
collector himself, he had been a Sotheby's customer, a force at the
Detroit Institute of Arts and a patron of the Whitney Museum of
American Art.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to bid by Sotheby's directors, Taubman once again put
together a group of friends, including Wexner, to buy the auction
house and take it private.
</P>
<P>
   The business executives were surprised to find out exactly how
antique Sotheby's practices were, Wexner said. Records were kept on
file cards and legal pads, the London offices were a rabbit warren,
and nobody could explain exactly how the business operated. ``It
was incredibly goofy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman did not simply drag Sotheby's into the computer age. He
also used his retailing talent to change the very nature of the
business. Sotheby's clients were no longer art and antiques
dealers, they were the collectors _ the shoppers _ themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chance for people to get involved with the auction
social swim,'' recalled John H. Gutfreund, the former chairman of
Salomon Brothers. ``The old money dominated the sellers, and the
new money dominated the buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   To get buyers and sellers in the door, the company added more
cocktail parties, glossy catalogs and blockbuster auctions of
celebrity collections like those of Andy Warhol and Claus von
Bulow. Selling art, Taubman famously said, was not too different
from selling root beer. (And he knew; until 1994 he owned the A&AMP;W
restaurant chain.)
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased with the changes. Dealers, in
particular, complained about the commercialization of the art world
and about how the auction houses were now competing with them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And there were missteps, some involving a rapidly expanding
lending program. Sotheby's was embarrassed when it became known
that in 1987 it had put up about half of the record-setting $54
million an Australian financier paid for a Van Gogh painting. The
buyer promptly defaulted; Sotheby's eventually sold the painting
again. And it stopped lending to buyers without other collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Taubman's methods seemed to work, and his timing was
good. The art market rebounded, and sales began to soar. Profits
rocketed, too; Sotheby's, which had lost more than $6 million in
1984, earned almost $113 million in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Things were so good that Sotheby's sold shares to the public
again, in May, 1988. Taubman made millions of dollars on the sale
and still owned about half the company's increasingly valuable
stock.
</P>
<P>
   His takeover of Sotheby's turned Taubman into a mover and shaker
in New York's social scene, a paradoxical position for a gregarious
man who nevertheless had always claimed to cherish his privacy. His
wife, Judith, was on the cover of Town &AMP; Country magazine; his
perfectly appointed homes in New York; London; Palm Beach, Fla.;
Southhampton, N.Y.; and Bloomfield Hills, Mich., attracted lots of
attention. Meanwhile, he endowed government-studies programs at
Harvard and Brown, donated millions to the University of Michigan
and the Detroit Art Institute and was active in Jewish
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1990s began, real estate tanked. And mall sales slumped.
The art market went into a recession, too, as the rich suffered
from a global economy slump. Sotheby's shares lost two-thirds of
their value in 1990. Auction sales dropped, and so did profits,
falling to less than $4 million in 1992. It was that year,
prosecutors have been told, that Sotheby's and Christie's may have
began to collude; it is certainly the year that they raised the
commissions they charge buyers, by exactly the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman's friends repeatedly say that it would be out of
character for him to have done anything improper, no matter what
his financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   There appear to have been some. In 1992, Taubman was trying hard
to raise money. He sold a third of his stake in Sotheby's, even
though the share price was low, and he had borrowed against much of
his remaining stake.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to sell stock in his malls, a deal that was completed
the following year and brought in a lot less money than originally
hoped. The transaction was complicated because Taubman and his
family had earlier borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from
the giant corporate pension funds of AT&AMP;T and General Motors,
secured by a stake in the shopping centers. The GM pension plan
ended up owning so much of Taubman's company that in 1998 it
swapped its shares for 10 of his malls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these financial pressures, Taubman remained the
model of a modern mogul, with all the lavish living that entails.
Indeed, he served as an inspiration for a major character in a
modern sort of fairy tale, Dominick Dunne's novel ``People Like
Us.'' In the book, about the clash of old and new society in New
York, the Taubman-like character is a rich trader who ends up in
jail. (Some details were so apt that Taubman demanded changes by
Dunne.)
</P>
<P>
   But not entirely apt, Dunne says now. When he wrote the book, he
said, he had watched Taubman only from afar; they have since met
and he has grown to like Taubman. ``I have never heard of a stain
on his reputation,'' Dunne said. ``Sure he's a tough guy; if you're
going to be a billionaire, you've got to be a tough guy.''

 McCAIN, IN VIETNAM, FINDS THE PAST ISN'T REALLY PAST  
(subs 5th graf to correct number of times McCain has been to
Vietnam since 1973; subs 10th graf to clarify reference to pilot in
photograph; subs 18th graf to give title of McCain's memoir) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam _ As he strode through the shadowy hallways and
incongruously sunny courtyards, gesturing here, pointing to a
detail there, Sen. John McCain might have been a father showing a
son his alma mater. Except the landmarks on this tour were dank
cells like the one where McCain spent two years in solitary
confinement, and leg irons, which he once wore as a punishment for
insulting the guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always interesting for me to be back here and show my son
the place where I lived for a long time,'' the Arizona Republican
said as he paused next to a faded photograph of himself as a
grim-faced, unmistakably defiant inmate. ``But I put Vietnam behind
me when I left.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he guided his wife and 13-year-old son through the
remnants of the grim jail known as the ``Hanoi Hilton,'' McCain,
long a proponent of better relations with Vietnam, betrayed
feelings still raw a quarter of a century later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still bear them ill will,'' he said of the prison guards,
``not because of what they did to me, but because of what they did
to some of my friends _ including killing some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his wife, Cindy, had visited the prison, known as Hoa
Lo, on one of his seven earlier trips to Vietnam since his release
in 1973. But McCain, whose visit comes just before the the 25th
anniversary on Sunday of the end of the Vietnam War, said he wanted
to show his son Jack the place.
</P>
<P>
   A sprawling French colonial-era fortress, the jail housed 300
U.S. pilots at various periods during the war. The Vietnamese
authorities tore down much of it 1993 to make way for a luxury
hotel and office complex called Hanoi Towers. But they preserved
one corner as a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, McCain seemed aware that the site of his suffering
had become just another stop on the tourist trail for people
visiting Vietnam's now-popular capital. At several points during
the self-guided tour, he stopped to say hello or to have his
picture taken with American tourists _ most of whom said they
supported him during his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination this year.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered an acidic commentary on how the Vietnamese
portrayed life inside the prison. Alongside the pictures of McCain
and his fellow prisoners, a plaque declared: ``Though having
committed untold crimes on our people, the American pilots suffered
no revenge once they were captured and detained. Instead, they were
treated with adequate food, clothing and shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaking his head, McCain muttered, ``That's entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, another set of photos showed the Americans receiving
letters from their families, meeting with North Vietnamese
journalists and attending Mass. McCain pointed out that one of the
pilots photographed at Mass had placed his hand on his chin, with
only his middle finger extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that sums up how he felt about being here,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has described his five-and-a-half-year imprisonment as a
nightmarish time, in which he was beaten and kept in solitary
confinement. Twice he tried to hang himself, only to be cut down
and assaulted by the guards.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was captured on Oct. 26, 1967, after his Navy plane was
shot down while on a bombing run over Hanoi. He crashed into a
lake, breaking both arms and a leg.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McCain paid a visit to the lake, known as Truc Bac,
where he described to reporters being dragged ashore and beaten by
an angry mob. On this visit, several curious locals stepped forward
to greet McCain _ some posing for photographs with his family.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, McCain said the American inmates communicated by
tapping on the walls of their cells. The prisoners nicknamed their
cell-block Thunderbird, and McCain described how it was lighted
with a single bulb. During the day, loudspeakers that hung from the
ceiling would drone with music by North Vietnamese propaganda
figures like the singer known as Hanoi Hannah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard her every day,'' McCain said. ``She's a marvelous
entertainer. I'm surprised she didn't get to Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese government has expressed anger at McCain's
description of his treatment as a prisoner of war, especially in
his recent memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers'' (Random House, 1999).
Wednesday, despite his sarcasm and fleeting bitterness, the senator
seemed reluctant to add to his earlier accounts of that period.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McCain has long advocated reconciling the two countries
and was instrumental in the establishment of diplomatic relations
with Hanoi five years ago. At his arrival here Tuesday, he said he
had come to ``commemorate the beginning and continuation of a new
relationship between the United States and Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with senior Vietnamese officials, the senator said
he discussed negotiations on a trade agreement between the two
countries. A deal was agreed to in principle last July, but has
bogged down since then as the Vietnamese have balked at several
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for this most celebrated of POWs, the war is the shadow
the lurks behind every meeting and every ritual. On Tuesday, soon
after he landed in Hanoi, McCain attended a ceremony on a
sweltering airport tarmac, in which the remains of six people,
believed to be U.S. soldiers missing since the war, were loaded on
a U.S. Air Force plane and flown to Hawaii for forensic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   For Jack McCain, Wednesday's visit seem to confirm the stories
his father had told him. As he left the prison, Jack said he had
expected the cells to be cramped and dark. Indeed, his knowledge of
the prison seemed so thorough that he expressed surprise at only
one small detail: the iron doors at the main entrance were wide
enough that his father was delivered through them in a truck.

AMAZON.COM REPORTS $308 MILLION LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amazon.com, the biggest retailer on the Internet,
said on Wednesday that it lost $308 million in the first quarter,
five times its loss a year earlier, but that its sales rose 95
percent, beating forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly loss translated into 90 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $61.7 million, or 20 cents a share, in the quarter a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But Amazon said investors should focus on its pro-forma loss,
which excludes the cost of stock options, merger costs and Amazon's
share of the losses of the companies in which it has invested. On
that basis, Amazon lost $122 million, or 35 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $36 million, or 12 cents a share a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the company to lose 36 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon posted sales of $574 million, beating the $521 million
that analysts had expected. The sales were up 95 percent from
$293.6 million in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Before the results were announced, shares of Amazon closed up
$1.0625, to $53.50, but slipped as low as $52 in after-hours
trading. Amazon's stock has been on a steep slide since hitting
$113 in early December, although it has rebounded some over the
last week as two other online merchants _ eBay and Priceline.com _
posted higher sales and lower losses than Wall Street expected for
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised the company for what appeared to be an
increased focus on efficiency and financial prudence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are bringing costs under control and their targets seem
more achievable than they did at the end of the fourth quarter,''
said Henry Blodget, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with investors, Warren Jenson, Amazon's
chief financial officer, stressed that the company was moving
toward profitability.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said that its pro-forma operating loss represented 17
percent of sales but that it hoped to reduce that to less than 10
percent of sales by the fourth quarter of this year. That
improvement will come largely from increased efficiency in the
company's network of seven warehouses. Jenson said the company
expected to have fewer employees to handle the Christmas season
this year than last year despite a vigorous growth in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it spent $41 million in marketing in the
quarter. That represents $13 for each of its three million new
customers, a far lower cost than any other major online retailer.
Amazon now has 20 million customer accounts. Of those customers,
those that were active in the last year bought an average of $121
in the quarter, up from $107 for the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Levitan, an analyst with Robertson Stephens, said she was
surprised that Amazon has been able to add so many customers at
such a low cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 20 million customers they have distanced themselves from
everybody else and shown themselves to be the first place people go
when they think of shopping online,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company had $1 billion in cash at the end of the quarter,
down slightly from $1.01 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.
Investors have increasingly been looking at the cash positions of
Amazon and other money-losing Internet companies wondering whether
they will be able to survive until they reach profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Jenson said Amazon was not at risk of running out of cash.
Indeed, he said that for the next nine months Amazon would generate
enough cash from its operations to cover its planned capital
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of its sales, the company said its book, music and video
business in the United States represented $401 million, up 50
percent from figures in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in its British and German subsidiaries increased by 300
percent, to $75 million. And sales of its other units _ including
toys, tools and auctions _ were $97 million in the quarter and
virtually nil a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it lost $2.4 million in books, music and video,
$27 million from its international business and $69 million from
its other businesses.  &QL;

SUPREME COURT GIVES STATE INMATES BROADER RIGHTS TO APPEALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Nev.)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the third time in a week, a Supreme Court
ruling Wednesday kept the federal courthouse doors open to appeals
by state inmates, with the justices overturning a lower court's
decision that, in the majority's view, had closed those doors
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting the newly amended law governing habeas corpus
petitions, the court ruled 7-2 that an inmate could not be barred
from raising a constitutional challenge to his conviction simply
because a lower federal court had previously dismissed an earlier
habeas corpus petition on procedural grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writ of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting
constitutional rights,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the
majority Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In setting new preconditions for appealing a federal district
court's denial of a habeas corpus petition, Kennedy said,
``Congress expressed no intention to allow trial court procedural
error to bar vindication of substantial constitutional rights on
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters were Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate in this case, Antonio T. Slack, convicted of
murdering a 12-year-old girl when he was 19, is serving a life
sentence in Nevada. Under the ruling Wednesday, Slack will have a
renewed chance to persuade the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to
hear his petition, raising various constitutional challenges to
events that occurred at his 1990 trial and to the quality of his
legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Wednesday, involving several technical aspects of
habeas corpus law, gave added force to a pair of habeas corpus
decisions last week by which the court set aside the death
sentences of two Virginia murderers. The court's broader message
now, as then, was that despite Congress' efforts in 1996 to place
severe new limits on habeas corpus, federal courts retain the
ability, and the obligation, to take these cases seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Among the several issues in this case, Slack vs. McDaniel, No.
98-6322, the central question was under what circumstances an
inmate who had failed with one habeas corpus petition could get a
chance to amend the petition and get back into federal court. A
series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1980s and early 1990s
instructed lower courts to dismiss many second or successive
petitions under a doctrine known as ``abuse of the writ.'' In the
Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which
restricted many aspects of habeas corpus, Congress made the ``abuse
of the writ'' obstacle even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Slack had filed an initial habeas corpus petition in 1991, which
the federal district court in Nevada dismissed under a separate
``exhaustion'' doctrine under which claims must first be presented
to the state courts. After bringing an unsuccessful case in state
court, he refiled his federal court petition in 1995, adding more
claims two years later when a lawyer was appointed to assist him.
The district court then dismissed this second petition as an
``abuse of the writ.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion Wednesday, Kennedy said that a petition filed
after an initial petition was dismissed on procedural grounds, with
its constitutional claims unadjudicated, should not be considered a
``second or successive'' petition within the meaning of the abuse
of the writ doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some new issues were raised in the new petition
should not bar its consideration, Kennedy said, because that result
``would limit a prisoner to claims made in a pleading that is often
uncounseled, hand-written'' and dismissed by the district court
without a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In their dissenting opinion, Scalia and Thomas said the decision
would require a state ``repeatedly to appear and expend its
resources, with no help in sight from supposed limitations on
`second or successive' petitions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   David Merrick, the producer whose gift for creating Broadway
hits was matched only by his genius for attracting publicity and
making enemies, died Tuesday in his sleep at St. George's Rest Home
in London. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   For a quarter century that ended with his last blockbuster, the
musical ``42nd Street,'' in 1980, Merrick was the dominant showman
in the Broadway theater. When Time magazine put him on its cover in
1966, it estimated that 20 percent of Broadway's work force was in
his employment. In a typical season during the 1960s he produced a
half-dozen or more plays and musicals, on occasion as many as four
in a single month. His parallel record of productivity and
profitability has been unmatched by any single impresario in the
history of New York's commercial theater.
</P>
<P>
   His headlines were nearly as numerous as his hits. Merrick was
famous for baiting critics, his own stars and his fellow producers,
all to promote his wares. Frequently likened to legendary
predecessors like P.T. Barnum and David Belasco, he preferred to
glory in his image as ``the abominable showman.'' A study in
darkness _ with his tailored suits, sleek black hair, thin
mustache, dark wit and low, insinuating voice _ he went out of his
way to resemble a villain out of Victorian melodrama. When Al
Hirschfeld drew a particularly unflattering caricature of him as a
grinch-like Santa Claus, Merrick reproduced it on his annual
Christmas card.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick produced some of the most popular musicals of his era,
including ``Gypsy,'' ``Hello, Dolly!'' and ``Promises, Promises,''
as well as ``42nd Street,'' his longest running show and one of the
half-dozen longest-running productions in Broadway history. He
introduced Woody Allen to Broadway as a playwright (``Don't Drink
the Water'') and actor (``Play It Again, Sam'') and produced the
1962 musical (``I Can Get It For You Wholesale'') that catapulted a
19-year-old supporting player, Barbra Streisand, toward stardom.
</P>
<P>
   His productions also gave signature roles to Ethel Merman (Mama
Rose in ``Gypsy'') and Carol Channing (Dolly Levi in ``Hello,
Dolly!''), and he worked with nearly every major songwriter of the
Broadway musical's last heyday: Jule Styne, Harold Arlen, Stephen
Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Harold Rome, Bob Merrill and the teams of
John Kander and Fred Ebb, and Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrick didn't only produce high-gloss entertainment. He
also presented Laurence Olivier's most celebrated postwar
performance (as Archie Rice in ``The Entertainer''), the
breakthrough dramas of John Osborne (``Look Back in Anger''), Brian
Friel (``Philadelphia, Here I Come!'') and Tom Stoppard
(``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'') and two epochal Royal
Shakespeare Company productions directed by Peter Brook
(``Marat/Sade'' and ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''). When few
commercial producers would touch the declining Tennessee Williams
in the '60s and '70s, Merrick took on his doomed projects,
including a revival of one play, ``The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here
Anymore,'' that had failed under another management only a season
earlier. (It failed again.)
</P>
<P>
   The producer's secretive private life was as complex and
contradictory as his theatrical credits. ``I was born on Nov. 4,
1954, the night my first big show, `Fanny,' opened on Broadway,''
Merrick once said. In truth he was born in St. Louis on Nov. 27,
1911, as David Margulois, the youngest child of a hand-to-mouth
salesman, Samuel, and his wife, Celia. His parents were divorced
when he was 7 _ ``It was like living on the set of `Virginia
Woolf,''' he once recalled _ and the young David bounced among
relatives through a grim but stagestruck adolescence which he
called Dickensian but never revealed in detail. Years later he said
he refused to take flights whose routes passed over St. Louis, lest
he be forced to land in the despised city of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   A good student, he won a scholarship to Washington University,
where he said he won second prize in a playwriting contest that
Tennessee Williams, another underclassman, also entered. The young
Margulois then went to St. Louis University, where he studied law,
a trade that would prove handy in his notoriously tough theatrical
contract negotiations. In law school, he haunted a student
playhouse, winning the role of Tubal in ``The Merchant of Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon graduation he did become a lawyer, but, more crucially, he
married a woman he had met in school, Lenore Beck, whose modest
inheritance allowed the young couple to flee St. Louis for New York
in 1939. A year later, he walked into the office of Herman Shumlin,
a prominent Broadway producer, and offered to invest $5,000 in a
forthcoming comedy, ``The Male Animal.'' The play was a hit, and
David Merrick, taking a new name inspired by the great 18th-century
English actor David Garrick, was born. Excused from war service
because of ulcers, he later went to work for Shumlin.
</P>
<P>
   Of his early, minor producing efforts, the most revealing was a
comedy called ``Clutterbuck'' in 1949. Though the show received
indifferent notices, Merrick kept it alive for six months with
discount tickets and a publicity stunt: each night during the
cocktail hour of 5 to 6 p.m. he called hotel bars and restaurants
all over town to page a fictional ``Mr. Clutterbuck.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was ``Fanny,'' five years later, that elevated him to
Times Square stardom.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Marcel Pagnol's cinematic trilogy set on the
Marseilles waterfront could make a musical, Merrick flew to France
three times to persuade Pagnol to give him the rights. After a
bitterly unconsummated effort to enlist Richard Rodgers and Oscar
Hammerstein II to write the score _ a campaign that would lead to a
lifelong feud with Rodgers _ he settled on Harold Rome. The
Broadway titans Joshua Logan and Ezio Pinza served as director and
star.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanny'' did not get glowing reviews, and Merrick himself was
said to be disappointed in it. But he sold the show relentlessly,
plastering men's room mirrors in midtown with suggestive stickers
reading ``Have You Seen Fanny?'' He also ran radio and television
spots long before they were commonplace and took the first
full-page newspaper ads ever for a Broadway show. And he hired a
sculptor to create a life-sized nude statue of the show's belly
dancer, Nejla Ates, installed it in Poet's Corner in Central Park
late at night, then alerted policemen and reporters so they could
discover it at daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity bred theatergoers, and ``Fanny'' made back its
investment in a remarkably fast 17 weeks, then ran nearly another
two years. Thanks to a shrewd rental deal Merrick had extracted
from the Shuberts for the Majestic Theater, ``Fanny'' was on a
weekly basis the most profitable show in Broadway history up to
that time.

 &HT;    Jones run ends
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Ga. _ Opponents of Albany State won't have to keep up
with the Joneses anymore.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 39 years, no Jones from the small town of
McGehee, Ark., is directly involved with the basketball program at
the NCAA Division II school on the banks of the Flint River.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Oliver Jones was cast aside as the Rams'
coach after his second losing season in 28 years. The move capped
the pipeline that had provided Albany State with six tall and
talented brothers from a 100-acre farm in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say that it's the end of an era,'' Oliver
Jones said recently, ``and it's a little tough to take, the way it
ended.''
</P>
<P>
   During a stretch of 18 years, the Rams basketball team had at
least one Jones brother. Four of them _ Wilbert, Caldwell, Major
and Charles _ spent a collective total of 54 years in the ABA and
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past three decades, Oliver and Melvin, who also
had stints on pro basketball rosters, have worked together as head
coach and assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, you've got to have someone you can depend on
and trust, and someone who is not trying to take your job,'' said
Melvin, who had been a head coach at Union High in Leslie before
joining his brother's staff in 1979. ``I never wanted Oliver's job.
All I wanted to do was help him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Joneses' relationship with Albany State began in 1961 with
Oliver. Six years earlier, he had met Rams second-year coach Robert
Rainey, a McGehee resident who had built his reputation by winning
big and consistently at several high schools in southern Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the influence of Rainey, who frequently visited the
Joneses, Caldwell Jones Sr., father of seven towering sons and
6-foot-3 daughter Clovis, abandoned hopes of developing at least
one pro baseball player and turned his focus to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cleared an area around the house and made it a court, then
put a backboard on a tree that he had cut down,'' Oliver said about
his father, who died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   His junior year in high school, Oliver, who at 6-2 was three
inches shorter than older brother Clint, hit a sudden growth spurt
that affected his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In three months, I grew 5 1/2 inches and started to have
problems with my eyesight,'' he said. ``I had to squint to see or
read anything. When my dad took me to a doctor, I was told to read
the writing on a building across the street. I could hardly see the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of three doctors eventually decided that Oliver's sight
had been affected by the rapid growth spurt, and that glasses were
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started wearing glasses, it was like a new world had
opened for me,'' Oliver said. ``At 6-2, I had played the point
guard position. Now I was about 6-7 1/2 and able to play every
position _ and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainey, who became Albany State's head coach in 1960, started to
benefit from his relationship with the Joneses his second season
with the Rams, when Oliver committed to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin followed several years later, and Wilbert several years
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high volume of interest shown him by numerous
college recruiters his senior year in high school, Caldwell, the
tallest of the brothers at 7 feet, was determined to follow
Oliver's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started concentrating on basketball seriously after Oliver
went to college,'' said Caldwell, who played 17 NBA seasons. He was
with the Chicago Bulls when Michael Jordan was a rookie (1984-85),
and with the San Antonio Spurs during David Robinson's first season
(1989-90).
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I had about 150 college offers. Integration was just
becoming acceptable,'' said Caldwell, now the proprietor of an
amusement park in Stockbridge. ``But Coach Rainey had the inside
track.''
</P>
<P>
   To the amazement of many, the Joneses kept on coming, each of
them at least 6 feet 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not surprised by their heights, because my father was
tall, and his father was tall, about 6-foot-6,'' said Cecelia
Jones, the 80-year-old mother of the celebrated brothers. ``I'm
5-11, and my (late) husband was about 6-4. The children got plenty
of exercise, so it was no chance of any of them being short.''
</P>
<P>
   NEXT GENERATION NOT BASKETBALL-MINDED
</P>
<P>
   A Jones from the subsequent generation is unlikely to surface in
the Albany State or any other college basketball program. The six
brothers with Albany State ties have five male children among them.
None has shown much interest in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the pressure, probably,'' Oliver said. ``As I look back,
I think it started with Charles. He was faced with a lot of
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, a four-year starter at Albany State before being drafted
by Cincinnati and sent off to the once-thriving Eastern League,
returned to his alma mater as Rainey's assistant in 1970, only
months after being discharged from the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Rainey died of a massive heart attack. He was
replaced by his most pivotal recruit, who led the team to the
school's first SIAC tournament title in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big blow to me personally, because coach wasn't
feeling well and had tried to call me to come over and sit with
him,'' Oliver said. ``I was sitting outside my apartment and didn't
hear the phone. He was so excited about that upcoming season,
especially since Major was coming to play with Caldwell, who was a
senior that year.''
</P>
<P>
   COACH INSPIRED QUIET RESPECT
</P>
<P>
   In compiling a 395-348 record, Jones, 56, guided the Rams to six
SIAC regular-season titles, six tournament championships and seven
appearances in the NCAA Division II playoffs. And he accomplished
it without raising his voice or using profanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a religious commitment that a lot of people don't know
about,'' said Robert Skinner, the Albany State women's coach.
``I've been here nine years, and I've never heard him cuss. Heck,
I've seen something happen out there on the court that made me want
to cuss for him. But that was never his approach to coaching. He's
always had a calmness about him that players respected and
responded to.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Jones' coaching career was not without its trials and
pain. After the 1990-91 season, he underwent brain surgery for the
removal of a life-threatening tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors told me that if I had been hit in the nose by a
tennis ball or bouncing basketball, I could've bled to death and
nobody would've known why,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six years later, triple-bypass heart surgery forced
Oliver Jones away from courtside during the stretch run to the 1997
SIAC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were headed to Memphis to play LeMoyne-Owen, and everybody
was watching Coach, because we knew something was wrong,'' former
Rams star Erwin Josey said. ``He kept trying to play it off because
he didn't want to disrupt the team. That was his way. He was like a
father to all the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after heart surgery, Oliver was back in the lead
chair at the Columbus Coliseum, where his Rams captured the SIAC
tournament title.
</P>
<P>
   ATHLETICS MAINSTAY GONE WITH DISMISSAL
</P>
<P>
   But none of the basketball program's achievements mattered about
five weeks ago when school athletics director Dan Land delivered a
memo to the athletics program's most stable entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said, `As of the 17th of March, I'm relieving you of all
responsibilities in athletics, specifically basketball,''' Oliver
said. ``In other words, `You're fired.' He said something about a
new direction. I never got an understanding of the direction he was
talking about. ''
</P>
<P>
   Land, a former Rams football star in his second year as
athletics director, refused to comment on the dismissal of Oliver
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personnel issue, and I'm not going to elaborate on
it,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great man, and a lot of people around here are upset
about what happened to him,'' said James White, an Albany State
alumnus and the first-year football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season's dismal 3-24 finish, the worst record posted
by the Rams under Jones was 13-15.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the NCAA penalized the school's athletics
program for a number of rules infractions, but Jones' basketball
team was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   But at the root of any problems he encountered the past few
seasons was the school's lack of commitment to the basketball
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for maybe three years since I've been here, my
recruiting budget consisted mostly of what I pulled out my own
pocket,'' he said. ``Not too long ago, I had a chance to go to a
Division I program with a five-year contract, but I chose to stay
here. I've thought about that decision a lot lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who teaches two classes a day, insists that his
interaction with students is just as special as it has been with
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this is my school and my home, and the students
and my players are part of my family,'' he said. ``At least I can
go out feeling good about that.''

SITE PRESENTS WEB-ONLY DOCUMENTARY ON BOXER

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sportcut.com took a risk when it decided to
feature a six-minute video documentary on heavyweight boxer Michael
Grant in training for his fight Saturday against Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   With 56K modems the standard in most home computers, Grant could
have looked like one of the Rock'em Sock'em Robots. The slower the
modem speed, the choppier the image, and the screen is so small
that it can make it difficult to follow rapid motion.
</P>
<P>
   But filmmaker Brian Harty and Sportcut.com content manager
Nicholas Twemlow understood the flaws of working with streaming
video and adjusted accordingly. Twemlow, who produced the film,
said they framed shots tightly and used cutaways to imply a lot of
movement. As they were shooting, they tracked their shots on the
camera's tiny viewfinder, which is about the size of an browser
audio-player window.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Unifying Michael Grant'', a nicely done film
that rivals the work of a mainstream short-subject documentary.
</P>
<P>
   While film is nothing new to the Internet, ``It's unique that we
had professional filmmakers'' shooting the documentary, said
Sportcut.com spokesman Dan Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in digital video on location in rural Oriental, N.C.,
``Unifying Michael Grant'' includes interviews with Grant, trainer
Don Turner and other members of Grant's camp. Helping
Sportcut.com's effort was cooperation from Grant and his trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Grant caught the vibe and really opened up,'' Twemlow
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sportcut.com is better known as the site that had the most
successful one-day Internet launch in history on Nov. 30. According
to Nielson Net Ratings, Sportcut.com logged 12 million hits in
response to Pete Rose's petition for reinstatement to baseball. The
New York-based startup company's mission is dedicated to covering
celebrities in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The film was conceived as a partnership project between
Sportcut.com and Harty with the intention of making the film
available for distribution through the site. Harty, a University of
Kansas graduate like Twemlow, is a graduate of the New York
University film program.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting Web-exclusive film is better than using
television-first footage made by the big-media or official league
sites, Twemlow said. He compares the Grant documentary to work
featured on Atom.com, a popular video site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There you can see films made only for the Web which probably
won't see the light of day in another form,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper said more multimedia projects might be pursued depending
on the success of the Grant documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent way to tell a story,'' Jasper said.  &QL; 
Speaking of video
</P>
<P>
   Sal LaRocca, vice president of NBA Entertainment's e-commerce
division, said no alerts are in place but NBA.com is ready for
increased traffic for tonight's Celebrity Fashion Show from the NBA
Store in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Will the show rival the Victoria's Secret show that caused major
shutdowns and disruptions on Broadcast.com a year ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're equipped to handle the anticipated traffic
increase,'' LaRocca said.
</P>
<P>
   They better.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity models such as Carmen Electra will walk the runway
wearing basketball-inspired, NBA-licensed apparel and original
designs, including pebble-grain bikinis, his/her pebble-grain
leather pants and a dress made from basketball trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   The show is scheduled to be Webcast live on NBA.com and
broadcast on NBA.com TV, the league's 24-hour digital television
network. The show celebrates NBA.com's relaunch of its e-commerce
site. / nn

   Four back-to-back hits followed, including Thornton Wilder's
``The Matchmaker,'' directed by Tyrone Guthrie, and Peter Ustinov's
``Romanoff and Juliet.'' The Merrick pattern of hoopla was set.
When ``Look Back in Anger'' showed signs of faltering only four
months after its 1957 opening, its box-office fortunes were
transformed when a distraught woman in the audience jumped on stage
at the Lyceum Theater and slapped Kenneth Haigh, who played the
misogynist antihero Jimmy Porter, on behalf of wronged women
everywhere. The story raged in the newspapers for three weeks
before Merrick confessed he had hired the woman for $250. But by
then ``Anger'' was on its way to running another 15 months on
Broadway and the road.
</P>
<P>
   Many more public relations master strokes were yet to come, most
famously and successfully the replacement of the entire cast of
``Hello, Dolly!'' with an all-black company headed by Pearl Bailey
and Cab Calloway when its audiences began to wane in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When Merrick judged the prospects dim for a lesser musical,
``Subways Are for Sleeping,'' in 1961, he turned to the phone book
to find men with the same names as the then-seven daily newspaper
critics _ a stunt he had long plotted but could never execute until
the retirement of The New York Times critic with a one-of-a-kind
name, Brooks Atkinson. Merrick took the critical impostors, among
them a mailman and a shoe salesman, to a preview and dinner, then
got them to endorse the show with such encomiums as ``the best
musical of the century.'' The full-page ad he drew up trumpeting
these ``raves'' was rejected by The Times, but it ran in one
edition of The Herald-Tribune before editors killed it. That was
enough to garner international headlines and keep ``Subways'' on
the boards for a nearly profitable season.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat less benign was Merrick's manipulation at the opening
of ``42nd Street'' in 1980. Gower Champion, the musical's director
and choreographer, had died early on the day of the opening, at age
59, of a rare blood cancer. But Merrick kept the news secret so he
could announce it from the stage at the curtain call, to the
screams and tears of a devastated cast and first-night audience.
Again the show's notoriety and success were assured, but an ugly
aftertaste lingered.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though Champion had guided many Merrick hits, including ``Hello,
Dolly!,'' the two strong-willed men, while desperately needing each
other professionally, had always had a tempestuous personal
relationship. Merrick referred to the director as ``the
Presbyterian Hitler'' and, during the troubled tryout of the
musical ``Sugar'' in the 1970s, the producer's wife at the time,
Etan Aronson, had gone so far as to remove her knitting needles
from a hotel suite for fear the men might assault each other. Now
that Champion was gone, Merrick minimized the director's billing
posthumously on ``42nd Street'' and fought to minimize royalties to
his estate (and to the show's other authors) as well.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This nasty side of Merrick had always been apparent. When Anna
Maria Alberghetti missed performances in the hit ``Carnival!'' in
1961, the producer announced he would challenge his star's claims
of ill health by administering a lie detector test to her in the
hospital. When out of town with a production in trouble, he would
humiliate the creative personnel with tirades belittling their
work, pit collaborators against one another, threaten to close a
show and then bring in other writers behind the authors' backs.
Such was his detestation of Richard Rodgers that even after the
composer's death, he took revenge on his elderly widow by seating
her in the upper balcony at ``42nd Street.'' Once asked why he was
reputed to be so mean, Merrick replied, ``Because I am mean _ what
else?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He was especially hostile toward actors, whom he likened to
``unruly children,'' and the press. In the 1960s he sought to put
Walter Kerr on the defensive by accusing him of being overly
influenced by nudges he received from his wife, Jean, on opening
nights. (When I was drama critic of The Times, he recycled the same
stunt with me and my soon-to-be wife, Alex Witchel, to generate
publicity for a poorly received revival of ``Oh, Kay!'' some 25
years later.) When Stanley Kauffmann was drama critic for The Times
in 1966, Merrick prevented him from reviewing a preview of Brian
Friel's ``Philadelphia, Here I Come!'' by canceling the performance
and announcing that ``a rat'' was loose in the theater's generator.
The story made Page 1 _ publicity well worth the price of the
tickets the producer had to refund.
</P>
<P>
   His taunting of Howard Taubman, the Times' critic prior to
Kauffmann, was particularly notorious. What began as a funny tirade
on Johnny Carson's ``Tonight'' show _ Merrick accused the critic of
removing ``Wet Paint'' signs on benches in Central Park _ escalated
when the producer descended into Nazi analogies. After Taubman
threatened to sue, Merrick issued a rare apology.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The producer's known humanitarian gestures were few, but, as a
consistent foe of racism, he forced the backstage unions to
integrate their crews on ``Jamaica,'' a 1957 musical with Lena
Horne and a largely black cast, by threatening to jettison the
production if they did not. He also had a keen respect for his
audiences. After the out-of-town ministrations of both Abe Burrows
and Edward Albee failed to save a 1966 musical version of Truman
Capote's ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' Merrick closed it during New
York previews despite an advance sale of $1 million (a mammoth
amount for that time) that would have kept it alive for months. He
refused to subject theatergoers to what he pronounced ``an
excruciatingly boring evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his fellow producers, he was contemptuous. ``There's a
horse's ass for every light on Broadway,'' he told the writer
William Goldman in 1968. He refused to belong to the producers'
league and at various times likened himself to a ``lone wolf'' and
to an ``alley cat that's not quite trustful, that's always watching
for someone to leap on him.'' Merrick didn't mind if people hated
him as he battled his way to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he was not without his fans in the theater. Woody
Allen, Arthur Laurents and Jerry Herman, among others, have praised
his professionalism through the years.

   ``He's the only man I know who's made a vice of honesty,'' said
the playwright N. Richard Nash. But Merrick had no close friends
among Broadway's elite, whom he felt never accepted him. At the
theater-district hangout, Sardi's, he always insisted on sitting at
a table in the back, with the tourists, rather than with other
theatrical royalty up front.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Among his toughest industry critics, Merrick was chastised for
not only his misanthropy and financial ruthlessness but also for
being an importer and packager rather than a truly creative
producer who initiated shows from scratch. But if many of his
successes were indeed from London, his biggest hits, like ``Dolly''
and ``42nd Street,'' were his own inspirations, and often his
imports benefited from improvements born of his obsessive attention
to every detail of production and promotion. Though Merrick was
also faulted for producing his riskiest dramas through the tax
dodge of a foundation, his eye for fresh theater was such that even
some of those experiments, like the Brook ``Marat/Sade,'' turned
out to be box-office sensations.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of ``42nd Street,'' which brought Merrick back to
New York after a brief and fruitless Hollywood sojourn producing
movies like ``Rough Cut'' and ``The Great Gatsby'' during the
1970s, his Broadway had disappeared. He and the few other surviving
lone wolves among Broadway producers _ most notably Alexander H.
Cohen, who died Saturday _ were relics from a bygone time. Almost
all Broadway shows were now imports of productions previously seen
in London, regional theaters or off-Broadway. In place of a single
tyrannical producer who ruled by gut instinct and took sole
responsibility for financing, mounting and promoting a production,
there were committees of producers, often investors and theater
owners.
</P>
<P>
   These new producers were ``bereft of ideas, vitality and
imagination,'' Merrick said. ``They're just businessmen who happen
to be in the theater.'' By the 1980s the leading theatrical showmen
aspiring to Merrick's stature were Joseph Papp and Cameron
Mackintosh, a vocal Merrick admirer. But Papp worked primarily in
the non-commercial confines of off-Broadway while Mackintosh
initiated his shows in London's West End and rarely produced more
than one a season, if that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Merrick had a stroke, which curtailed his freedom of
speech and movement as well as his professional activities. He had
long since given up his famous office, decorated in the bloody
color known in the trade as ``David Merrick Red,'' high above the
St. James Theater down the block from Shubert Alley. On the weekend
after New Year's, 1989, ``42nd Street'' closed simultaneously at
the St. James in New York and the Drury Lane in London. After that,
the compulsively litigious producer devoted much of his time to
truly Dickensian legal conflicts arising out of both his theatrical
finances and his stormy domestic history. Using a wheelchair and
often reduced to communicating in grunts, he was frequently in the
company of a young woman named Natalie Lloyd, who served as his
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his marriage to Leonore Beck, Merrick was married
to Jeanne Gilbert, whom he met when she was doing press relations
for the Savoy Hotel in London; Etan Aronson; Karen Prunczik, a
dancer who played Anytime Annie in the original cast of ``42nd
Street''; and then again to Aronson. All five marriages ended in
divorce, the fifth last year after a marathon decade of litigation.
Zack Manna, executive/artistic director of the David Merrick Arts
Foundation, said that Merrick married Lloyd last November.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick is also survived by his children, Cecilia Ann Merrick,
whose mother was Jeanne Gilbert, and Marguerita Merrick, daughter
of Etan Merrick.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The last of his nearly 90 shows, a 1996 stage version of the
1945 Rodgers-and-Hammerstein movie ``State Fair,'' was actually
produced by others, but Merrick took it over by making a large and
impetuous investment during its pre-New York tour. It flopped on
Broadway, though not before the frail showman made a brief ruckus
by suing the Tony Awards for ruling part of its score ineligible
for Tony consideration.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though Merrick's final promotional stunts on Broadway were an
embarrassingly faint and farcical replay of his old tricks, they in
no way diminished the judgment made by the producer Herman Shumlin,
who gave the young David Margulois his start in 1940. Shumlin had
observed before his own death in 1979 that David Merrick's career
was ``a milestone in our modern theater, where the exploitation of
plays has become a lost art.''
</P>
<P>
   But that lasting professional verdict still left unanswered the
question of motive, which had obsessed Broadway for decades: What
made Merrick run? For all the money he earned, and for all his
efforts to keep every last dollar of it, there is no evidence he
enjoyed his fortune. He lived furtively, often in unpretentious
midtown apartments, and was not a party-giver or goer. He
frequently spoke of being depressed.
</P>
<P>
   One friend recalled a rare occasion in the early '70s when
Merrick briefly let down his guard and explained why even his
enormous success had failed to lighten his spirit. ``I'll tell you
what it's like to be No. 1,'' the producer said. ``I compare it to
climbing Mount Everest. It's very difficult. Lives are lost along
the way. You struggle and struggle and finally you get up there.
And guess what there is once you get up there? Snow and ice.''

<P>
   David Merrick, the producer whose gift for creating Broadway
hits was matched only by his genius for attracting publicity and
making enemies, died Tuesday in his sleep at St. George's Rest Home
in London. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   For a quarter century that ended with his last blockbuster, the
musical ``42nd Street,'' in 1980, Merrick was the dominant showman
in the Broadway theater. When Time magazine put him on its cover in
1966, it estimated that 20 percent of Broadway's work force was in
his employment. In a typical season during the 1960s he produced a
half-dozen or more plays and musicals, on occasion as many as four
in a single month. His parallel record of productivity and
profitability has been unmatched by any single impresario in the
history of New York's commercial theater.
</P>
<P>
   His headlines were nearly as numerous as his hits. Merrick was
famous for baiting critics, his own stars and his fellow producers,
all to promote his wares. Frequently likened to legendary
predecessors like P.T. Barnum and David Belasco, he preferred to
glory in his image as ``the abominable showman.'' A study in
darkness _ with his tailored suits, sleek black hair, thin
mustache, dark wit and low, insinuating voice _ he went out of his
way to resemble a villain out of Victorian melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick produced some of the most popular musicals of his era,
including ``Gypsy,'' ``Hello, Dolly!'' and ``Promises, Promises,''
as well as ``42nd Street,'' his longest running show and one of the
half-dozen longest-running productions in Broadway history.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick also presented Laurence Olivier's most celebrated
postwar performance (as Archie Rice in ``The Entertainer''), the
breakthrough dramas of John Osborne (``Look Back in Anger''), Brian
Friel (``Philadelphia, Here I Come!'') and Tom Stoppard
(``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'') and two epochal Royal
Shakespeare Company productions directed by Peter Brook
(``Marat/Sade'' and ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'').
</P>
<P>
   The producer's secretive private life was as complex and
contradictory as his theatrical credits. ``I was born on Nov. 4,
1954, the night my first big show, `Fanny,' opened on Broadway,''
Merrick once said. In truth he was born in St. Louis on Nov. 27,
1911, as David Margulois, the youngest child of a hand-to-mouth
salesman, Samuel, and his wife, Celia.
</P>
<P>
   A good student, he won a scholarship to Washington University,
and then went to St. Louis University, where he studied law.
</P>
<P>
   Upon graduation he did become a lawyer, but, more crucially, he
married a woman he'd met in school, Lenore Beck, whose modest
inheritance allowed the young couple to flee St. Louis for New York
in 1939. A year later, he walked into the office of Herman Shumlin,
a prominent Broadway producer, and offered to invest $5,000 in a
forthcoming comedy, ``The Male Animal.'' The play was a hit, and
David Merrick, taking a new name inspired by the great 18th-century
English actor David Garrick, was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanny,'' five years later, elevated him to Times Square
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanny'' did not get glowing reviews, and Merrick himself was
said to be disappointed in it. But he sold the show relentlessly,
running radio and television spots long before they were
commonplace and taking the first full-page newspaper ads ever for a
Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity bred theatergoers, and ``Fanny'' made back its
investment in a remarkably fast 17 weeks, then ran nearly another
two years.

   Shumlin, the producer who gave the young David Margulois his
start in 1940, had observed before his own death in 1979 that David
Merrick's career was ``a milestone in our modern theater, where the
exploitation of plays has become a lost art.''
</P>
<P>
   But that lasting professional verdict still left unanswered the
question of motive, which had obsessed Broadway for decades: What
made Merrick run? For all the money he earned, and for all his
efforts to keep every last dollar of it, there is no evidence he
enjoyed his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   One friend recalled a rare occasion in the early '70s when
Merrick briefly let down his guard and explained why even his
enormous success had failed to lighten his spirit. ``I'll tell you
what it's like to be No. 1,'' the producer said. ``I compare it to
climbing Mount Everest. It's very difficult. Lives are lost along
the way. You struggle and struggle and finally you get up there.
And guess what there is once you get up there? Snow and ice.''

ELIAN'S FATHER SEEKS TO INTERVENE IN ASYLUM CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 6th graf for updating)   By ADAM CLYMER and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Juan Miguel Gonzalez on Wednesday asked a federal
appeals court to let him intervene in the asylum case involving his
son, Elian, and to oust the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez,
from the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   If the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, granted
both requests, the case could become moot and the father and son
could return to Cuba. Attorneys retained by Lazaro Gonzalez said on
Monday that the boy was seized last weekend as part of a plot to
end the case.
</P>
<P>
   The father's brief, submitted by his lawyer, Gregory B. Craig,
condemned Lazaro Gonzalez as ``an uninvited meddler in Elian's
life'' who maintained ``a circus atmosphere'' in which the boy was
``paraded every day in front of mobs gathered in the streets of
Miami.'' The brief was filed in response to a motion filed earlier
this week in which lawyers for the great-uncle asked that a
independent guardian be appointed for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Craig also argued against a court order sought by those lawyers
that demanded that the boy be kept away from Cuban diplomatic
property where he might be out of the jurisdiction of the appeals
court. ``To Juan Miguel,'' Craig wrote, ``the possibility of taking
Elian to an embassy or hiding behind diplomatic immunity is
non-existent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also filed a brief on Wednesday quoting a
government-appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Paulina M. Kernberg of
Cornell University's Weill Medical College, as saying after a two
and a half hour visit that ``Elian and his father appear to enjoy a
rich, varied relationship.'' Kernberg wrote that ``a visit by the
Miami relatives would not be advisable in their current angry
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Other visitors are being allowed. A cousin of Elian, identified
by The Associated Press as Yasmani Betancourt, 10, flew here from
Cuba on Wednesday night to see him. He was accompanied by a woman
and two officials and landed at Ronald Reagan National Airport at
8:40 p.m. on a flight from La Guardia Airport in New York. The four
were immediately met by officers and taken away in a police car
with flashing lights.
</P>
<P>
   Visas were issued in Havana for four friends of the boy, and for
a parent to accompany each child. They are expected to arrive on
Thursday and remain in the United States for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elian spent his second day on Wednesday with his father,
stepmother and baby half-brother at a secluded estate, the
Carmichael farm at the 1,100-acre Wye River Institute, on
Maryland's eastern shore. The family is living rent-free in a house
owned by Nina Houghton, a philanthropist who is the widow of an
heir to the Corning Glass fortune. The Cuban diplomatic mission is
providing their food.
</P>
<P>
   In another forum, the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled a
hearing for next Wednesday on the raid in which armed immigration
agents took Elian out of his great-uncle's home in Miami on
Saturday. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., said on Wednesday that more hearings
may be scheduled later in the week, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that Senate Republicans do not want to conduct
drawn-out hearings on a raid that most Americans supported, Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah, the committee chairman, said he would not call
the Miami relatives to testify. He said he may call their lawyers
and said he would invite Juan Miguel Gonzalez to appear. If not,
Craig, his lawyer, would be called.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, the Miami relatives continued to push
for a reunion with the boy. They brought with them several
Cuban-American doctors and psychologists who said Elian should be
permitted to see Marisleysis Gonzalez, the 21-year-old cousin who
helped care for Elian during the past five months, to help him cope
with whatever stress he may be experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lydia Usategui, a child psychiatrist who was in the house at
the time of the raid, said during a news conference on Capitol Hill
with the Miami relatives that ``he needs to see this family as
quickly as possible'' because the last time he saw them was when
they were being restrained at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   But the affidavit of Kernberg, the government's child
psychiatrist, said that the boy was clearly happy with his father
and that his removal from Lazaro Gonzalez's home ``although clearly
startling and frightening, was in all likelihood not a traumatic
experience producing lasting effects.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Elian had told his stepmother ``that he has a secret
love, `Mary.''' Kernberg continued, ``In my observations of Elian,
there were indications that `Mary' (his cousin Marisleysis
Gonzalez) may be an idealized love, rather than a maternal figure.
His feelings for Marisleysis are similar to the romantic feelings
of a school boy for his teacher or a wished-for girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Kernberg said that a visit by angry relatives ``would likely be
disruptive for the child, who demands a quiet period of emotional
healing from the last few weeks of stress.'' She suggested that the
relatives ``may benefit from counseling'' and that instead of
visits now, they should send letters, photographs and cassette
tapes with messages.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's court filings by Craig and the Justice Department
came in response to a motion filed on Tuesday by the lawyers
retained by Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They asked the appellate court to make the Justice Department
allow them, the Miami relatives and a Miami psychologist to see the
boy, and asked the court to appoint a guardian to look after the
boy's rights. Both Craig and the Justice Department scoffed at
those requests as unnecessary, since the boy was now in the custody
of his surviving parent.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez's request to intervene, and his request to
remove his uncle from the asylum case, went far beyond simply
answering the demands of the Miami lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In their filings this week, the lawyers for the Miami family
alleged there was a plot to shut down the case entirely, thwarting
their effort to gain asylum for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost assuredly, the INS, Juan Gonzalez and Cuban government
functionaries are working on a devastated, displaced and isolated
child to secure a repudiation of his asylum claim and thus mootness
of the appeal,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Miami attorneys, Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, said on
Wednesday that the legal moves by Juan Gonzalez and the government
had been foreshadowed by a Justice Department negotiator. ``The
last thing I asked him was if you get the boy and give him to the
father, doesn't it moot our appeal?'' Garcia-Pedrosa said. ``And he
said, `Yes, it does.'''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have accused the administration of
colluding with Craig to organize the raid last Saturday and bring
the asylum case to an end. The administration has insisted its only
motive in seizing Elian last Saturday was protecting his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Craig would not say on Wednesday what he would do if the motion
to intervene and to remove Lazaro Gonzalez are both granted. The
court could deny them both, or allow both Juan Miguel Gonzalez and
Lazaro Gonzalez to participate in the case through written briefs
and motions and in oral arguments scheduled for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's brief said his client should be allowed to intervene
``to speak for himself and to assert his rights as a father'' and
``to speak on behalf of Elian, who has no other suitable
representative in these proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that ``lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez _ and they are
Lazaro's lawyers, noyt Elian's _ seek to use machination and legal
sleight of hand to turn this court into the arbiter of an
intra-family dispute in which the primary antagonist is too distant
a relative to be considered even `extended family' under Florida
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig wrote that while it may once have been proper for Lazaro
Gonzalez to speak for Elian in the period immediately after his
rescue, it was no longer acceptable given the arrival of the boy's
father in the United States. He said the fact that Lazaro Gonzalez
was so ``brazenly defiant'' that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service ``was compelled to execute a rescue by force of arms''
showed that the uncle was not dedicated to Elian's interests.

 &HT;    Images show universe's infancy
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Space scientists Wednesday unveiled the first detailed
images of the universe in its infancy _ baby pictures from a time
not long after the big bang when, cosmologists say, everything was
smaller, smoother and a whole lot hotter.
</P>
<P>
   The images, taken from a balloon 120,000 feet above the surface
of Antarctica, capture the faint glow of microwave radiation from
the edge of the visible universe _ traces of structures that were
formed 12 billion to 15 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``These images represent the ultimate limit of our vision,''
said Andrew Lange, a physicist at the California Institute of
Technology who headed an international team of scientists involved
in the research. ``They predate the first star or galaxy in the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   To laymen, the pictures _ color-enhanced clumps of blue, orange
and red that represent minute variations in the cosmic microwave
background that fills the sky _ may not look like much.
</P>
<P>
   But to the team of international scientists of Project Boomerang
_ short for Balloon Observations of Millimetric Extragalactic
Radiation and Geophysics _ the fuzzy hints of structure, from so
early in the universe's development, shore up several key theories
associated with the origins of the universe in a single violent
event called the big bang.
</P>
<P>
   Lange says the images, which measure heat left over from the big
bang, are ``little snapshots of a time'' when the universe was only
a few hundred thousand years old _ and 1,000 times smaller and
hotter than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because our instruments are so sensitive, we can measure the
intricate pattern of minute temperature variation that fills the
sky,'' he said. ``Because it comes from so far away _ 12 billion to
15 billion light-years _ we are literally seeing the seeds of
galaxies and star clusters that formed very early in the history of
the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kamionkowski, a theoretical astrophysicist at Cal Tech,
says the measurements represent a ``watershed event in cosmology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The results suggest that we are on the right track with our
theories for the origin of the universe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also open up a path toward scientifically addressing what
happened in the first micro-micro-second after the big bang.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest images support predictions _ consistent with big bang
theory _ that two-thirds of the universe consists of
still-undetected ``dark energy,'' that today's universe is still
expanding at an accelerating rate, and that the geometry of the
universe is flat. The big bang, which forms the underpinning of
most modern cosmology, holds that the entire universe grew from a
tiny subatomic region during a period of violent expansion that
occurred within microseconds _ an expansion so swift that it
stretched the geometry of space until it was flat.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling universe started out hot and dense and then cooled
as it expanded. Within a few hundred thousand years of the big
bang, it cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of atomic
hydrogen and the release of photons, particles of light, that moved
freely through the universe until they were intercepted by the
team's balloon-borne instruments over Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   The project _ funded by NASA, the National Science Foundation
and scientific institutions in Italy, Britain and Canada _ is the
first step in a decade-long effort to study the residual microwave
radiation left by the big bang that permeates the universe.
Instruments aboard the balloon were able to study only a small
portion of the sky. With the launch of a NASA space probe later
this year, and another in 2007, scientists hope eventually to
construct an atlas of the entire sky.

ADMINISTRATION BAN SNOWMOBILES FROM MOST NATIONAL PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a new effort to protect public lands, the
National Park Service will impose a broad and immediate ban on the
recreational use of snowmobiles at nearly all of the country's
national parks, monuments and recreational areas, Interior
Department officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, to be announced in Washington on Thursday, will
directly affect more than two dozen parks where snowmobiling now
takes place, including Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, which
has been the focus of a major battle over whether the noisy,
high-powered vehicles should be permitted within the park system.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, which Interior Department officials said could
affect thousands of snowmobiles a year, is the latest step by the
Clinton administration to put larger swaths of public land
off-limits to recreational vehicles. It follows a decision this
month that banned the use of the personal watercraft sold under
several brand names, including Jet Skis, from most areas of the
park system.
</P>
<P>
   A ban on the use of snowmobiles had been vigorously opposed by
off-road vehicle advocates and by several Western senators, who had
warned that the move could unfairly disrupt a long-established
practice. But more than 60 environmental groups had petitioned the
Interior Department in favor of the move, and though the policy
will include some notable exceptions, a news release prepared in
advance of Thursday's announcement essentially echoes the
environmentalists' claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come for the National Park System to pull in its
welcome mat for recreational snowmobiling,'' Donald J. Barry, the
assistant secretary of Interior for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, is
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snowmobiles are noisy, antiquated machines that are no longer
welcome in our national parks. The snowmobile industry has had many
years to clean up their act, and they haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the announcement and details about the decision were
provided to The New York Times by Interior Department officials. In
an angry response, an official of the snowmobile industry accused
the administration of bad faith, noting that manufacturers had been
cooperating in the case-by-case reviews of snowmobiling that have
been under way in Yellowstone and neighboring Grand Teton National
Parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden now the Department of Interior comes out and
says regardless of what you've done, we're just going to come out
and ban snowmobiling outright,'' said the official, Edward Klim,
president of the International Snowmobile Manufacturers'
Association. ``This may be happening to snowmobiles today, but I
tell you, tomorrow it will be campers, and the next day it will be
sport utility vehicles. It's part of a planned campaign by this
administration to limit public access to public lands.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 180,000 snowmobiles are used in the National Park
System each winter, said the National Parks Conservation
Association, a nonprofit advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   The most important exception to the ban will apply at Denali
National Park and 11 other parks in Alaska, where snowmobiling is
explicitly permitted by law. At those sites, and at Voyageurs
National Park in Minnesota, which was also established under a law
that permitted snowmobiling, recreational use of the vehicles will
still be allowed, although under stricter guidelines, park service
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the other 29 park sites where snowmobiling now takes
place, the park service officials said, the only exceptions will
apply in limited cases in which snowmobiles would be permitted to
cross a small section of park land so that they could gain access
to adjacent private or public land where snowmobiling was
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   The new ban would not prohibit the use of snowmobiles for
essential transportation, as long as it did not involve
recreational activity, the park service officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the environmental groups pushing for a ban had been the
Wilderness Society, which had joined the Bluewater Network and the
dozens of other organizations in urging the park service to revise
its rules. Bob Ekey, who directs Wilderness Society operations in
the northern Rocky Mountain states, said the group would welcome
any new restrictions on snowmobiling in the parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's clear that the national parks should be places
where the public can go and escape traffic,'' Ekey said. ``And
clearly these snow machines are loud, they're polluting and they
cause conflict with other visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of snowmobiles for recreational purposes has long been
prohibited at some areas administered by the park service, Glacier
National Park in Montana and Yosemite National Park in California.
But it has thrived at more than 40 sites that range from Acadia
National Park in Maine to California's Sequoia National Park and
numerous parks in the Northwest, in addition to those in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing regulations, as set out in executive orders that
date back to the Nixon administration and in Congressional
legislation, public lands are to be closed to off-road vehicles
including snowmobiles only when explicitly authorized. Under those
orders, park service officials said, off-road vehicle use should be
halted if it is determined that the activity was causing harm to
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until last year, when the controversy over
snowmobiling in Yellowstone focused attention on the adverse
environmental effects, that the park service decided to take a
closer look at the activity in other public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Galvin, deputy director of the park service, said an
internal survey had revealed ``years of inattention to our own
regulatory standards on snowmobiles.''

 &HT;    Cirrus Logic soon to be based in Texas
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Cirrus Logic Inc., a Silicon Valley
computer-chip maker that has switched its focus to audio-processing
chips and magnetic and optical storage, said Wednesday it is moving
its corporate headquarters to Austin from Fremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive David French, who has lived in Austin since
becoming head of the company in February 1999, said the move makes
sense because most corporate functions and 900 of Cirrus' 1,300
employees are in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   With the move, Cirrus will become the largest semiconductor
maker based in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and equipment maker
Applied Materials Inc. have more employees, but they are based
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Wednesday, Cirrus said net income for the fourth
quarter was $62.1 million, or 82 cents per diluted share, compared
with a loss of $214 million, or $3.55 a share, for the fourth
quarter last year. The current quarter includes proceeds from sales
of securities in Phone.com Inc. and the sale of Ambient
Technologies to Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding extraordinary events, net income for the quarter was
$6.2 million, or 5 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Cirrus lost $47 million, or 77 cents per share, on
revenue of $564 million. In the 1999 fiscal year, losses totaled
$427 million, or $6.77 a share, on revenue of $628 million. The
1999 losses were tied to discontinued business operations.
</P>
<P>
   The results for the quarter ended March 25 were released after
the close of the stock market. Cirrus shares ended Wednesday
unchanged at $16.
</P>
<P>
   Cirrus in the early 1990s was among the fastest growing
companies in the semiconductor industry and a major supplier of
computer graphics processing chips.
</P>
<P>
   But the company fell out of its leadership position in computer
graphics in 1996 and in 1997 dropped out of the graphics chip
business. At its 1996 peak, Cirrus employed more than 3,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few local jobs will be added in Austin because of the
corporate move. In addition, Austin executive Robert Fay will take
over as the company's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company's divisions for computer-storage-related chips and
for optical-disk storage chips, which employ 400 people, will
remain in California.
</P>
<P>
   Cirrus Logic remains a strong player in developing audio
processing chips for computers, consumer electronics products and
Internet audio players. It also is a leading maker of chips for
rewritable computer CD-ROM drives. It is adding workers in Austin
and in California.
</P>
<P>
   Cirrus Logic arrived in Austin in 1991, when the California
company bought Crystal Semiconductor, a local chip startup.

RUSSIA WANTS TO RESOLVE DISPUTE OVER MISSILES, SAY U.S. OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Rewrites for additional details, quotes and perspective, mostly in
grafs 2 through 7)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a second round of intensive meetings with the
Russian foreign minister about the missile defense system that the
United States wants to develop over Russian objections, senior
administration officials said today that they had detected a
readiness by Moscow to explore all avenues of a possible resolution
to the looming standoff.
</P>
<P>
   But they acknowledged that Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov and
the chief Russian arms control negotiator, Georgi Memedev, had
revealed no significant shift in their opposition to the missile
defense plan. ``The Russians have shown a willingness to intensify
the process,'' a senior administration official said. ``But we're
not seeing a huge shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to show that the United States was standing firm on its
position, the State Department said there was a three-prong
approach it described as the ``three D's.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be no ``deferral'' of the missile defense issue,
there would be no ``destruction'' of the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty of 1972, which limited both Washington's and Moscow's
ability to deploy defenses against missiles. And it said there
would be no ``decoupling'' from Start III, which would cut the cut
the number of nuclear warheads in each country's arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms and other leading conservative Republicans
believe that the ABM treaty is an antiquated relic of the Cold War
and should be scrapped, thus allowing a more robust missile defense
than the one the administration is proposing.
</P>
<P>
   And Gov. George W. Bush, the Republicans' presumptive
presidential nominee, who met with Ivanov on Wednesday, has said
that he would oppose any Clinton deal with the Russians that
limited the ability of a new president ot make his own agreement
with Moscow. And he has also said that if Russia does not make
suitable changes in the treaty, it should be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Helms, Republican of North Carolina and
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had appeared to
urge that negotiations with the Russians be suspended during the
final months of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   He said his committee would be willing to consider amendments to
the ABM Treaty but only after the departure of Clinton. The senator
derided the president for wanting a ``final photo-op'' with
Russians before leaving the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of Ivanov, who was on the second day of a three-day
visit, appeared to be to gauge the political situation in the
United States before President Clinton meets with President-elect
Vladimir Putin in Moscow in early June. Ivanov also met Wednesday
for 90 minutes with 20 Republican and Democratic senators on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the differences between the Clinton
administration and Moscow is the development of a limited missile
defense that the administration says is necessary to defend the
United States against ``rogue'' states like North Korea and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   National missile defense systems are prohibited in the 1972 ABM
treaty, which is based on the principle that the only way to
encourage reductions in strategic arms is to restrict ways to
counter them. But the administration says it is seeking only a
modest change to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   As they counter the administration on national missile defense,
the Russians are urging Washington to agree to deep cuts in
long-range nuclear arms as part of a Start III accord.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they believed the Russians were
judging whether they have to make a decision now and deal with
Clinton or whether they could gamble and wait for the next
administration. Because Clinton would like an arms control treaty,
the administration is trying to convince the Russians that they are
better off to take a deal that they know than one they do not.
</P>
<P>
   As one administration official said, ``The big sell is: `Take a
sure bet now. Don't take a risk in the future.'''

<P>
   In Wednesday's meetings between Ivanov and the administration,
the Russians offered two counterproposals, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first, dealing with curbing the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, involved expanding the current Missile Technology Control
Regime, an international accord that limits the range of missiles a
country can deploy. The second proposal involved working with the
United States to cooperate on theater missile defense systems that
are allowed under the ABM Treaty. These theater systems can spot
incoming missiles early in their trajectory and target them high in
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the State Department said the administration was
``interested in and intrigued by'' the fact that the proposals
showed that Russia understood new threats posed by nations like
North Korea and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration also publicly went out of its way to
state that there was, according to James P. Rubin, the State
Department spokesman, ``no chance of deferral'' of national missile
defense and amending the treaty
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the Russians would like to avoid this issue,'' Rubin
said at the State Department on Wednesday. But Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, who met with Ivanov on Tuesday and
Wednesday, was ``making clear that deferral is not an option,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said in a speech to the National Press Club that the
administration would be making a ``fatal mistake'' if it went ahead
with the missile defense system. He urged the White House not to
hurry on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Using a quotation from an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story, ``The
Swimmers,'' he said that America had been described as ``the
willingness of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is every ground to apply his words to Russia,'' he
countered.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said it was unlikely that an agreement
involving a complicated package of support _ from the Russians,
from NATO allies and from Congress _ would be ready by the summit
meeting in Moscow. ``That's not on,'' said one senior official.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the administration's view of what is best for the
United States ``is to have a treaty that allows us to reduce our
strategic forces with the Russians, get deeper cuts than we have
now, reduce the nuclear danger that way.'' But at the same time,
Rubin said, the United States wants to ``allow a limited national
missile defense that would allow us to defend against a small
number of North Korean or Iranian missile warheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the theater missile defense proposal of the Russians,
countries that were under immediate threat _ for example, South
Korea from North Korea _ would have a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   But such a system would not give universal coverage to the
United States, a factor that made it impossible for the
administration to accept, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov fielded questions from senators Wednesday afternoon. Much
of the focus was on the war in Chechnya and the brutal way that
Moscow was fighting. In response, Ivanov asked for help in fighting
terrorism, Congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Ivanov, accompanied by Albright, was taken to a
secure conference room known as the ``tank.'' He met with Deputy
Secretary of Defense Walter B. Slocombe and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   As an opening gambit for the visit, Albright took Ivanov to
dinner Tuesday night at Les Pinasse, a French restaurant at the St.
Regis Hotel. In doing so, she abandoned earlier plans to take him
to The Palm, which is frequented by Washington lobbyists.

<P>
   MIAMI _ At the corner of Flagler Street and 22nd Avenue, a
procession of cars filled with teen-agers, salsa music blaring,
crawled slowly across the intersection with Cuban flags fluttering
from radio antennas and a big U.S. flag flying upside down, in
scorn.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Havana, in the days since Elian Gonzalez was taken
from his Miami relatives' home in a blur of tear gas and armed
federal agents, upside-down flags and disdain for the United States
are fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   As a city, ``we are more divided than we have ever been,'' said
Max Castro, the senior research associate at the Dante B. Fascell
North-South Center at the University of Miami, and an expert on the
exile community.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone involved in the case lost something in the
five-month standoff and the three-minute raid , say legal,
immigration and political experts who have followed the case,
including his Miami family, the exiles who made Elian a symbol of
freedom, the two mayors who sided with the exiles over the
government, and _ because of the nature of the raid _ the
government itself.
</P>
<P>
   And the clear winner, said the experts, is the man exiles here
see as the devil himself. ``Fidel Castro has taken great
advantage,'' said Osmel Lugo, a political dissident jailed in Cuba
until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Castro did very much to profit from the case.
Others, even those who hate him most, did his work for him, said
experts on Cuba and the exile community.
</P>
<P>
   The exiles and the family that could not bear to give up the
child, no matter how well-intentioned their refusal, gave Castro
material to prop up his sagging revolution and have turned U.S.
support from their cause.
</P>
<P>
   And Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County and Mayor Joseph
Carollo of Miami, though they may have heartened many of their
constituents by siding with the exile community against the
government, stumbled on the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear losers are the hard-liners in the Cuban exile
community who conducted themselves in such a way as to antagonize
and alienate U.S. public opinion,'' said Wayne Smith, a senior
fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington who
served as a diplomat in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed to believe they could take the law into their own
hands, defy the law, defy the federal government, and get away with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people doubt, political and immigration experts said, that
Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and the boy's cousin
Marisleysis Gonzalez both loved Elian and were heartbroken when he
was taken. But, even if a last-minute compromise was close, as the
Miami family and others said, the family clearly had little
credibility with frustrated Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazaro Gonzalez said a number of times they would have to take
the boy by force,'' Smith said. ``Well, they did. I think U.S.
public opinion was turned off by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism that the government used excessive force in
the raid, Americans have overwhelmingly approved of it in poll
after poll.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll released on Monday showed that 60
percent of respondents approved, and 62 percent believed that the
Miami relatives would not have turned the boy over peacefully if
the agents had not been armed.
</P>
<P>
   Only 28 percent of respondents said that Congress should hold
hearings on the raid, and only 25 percent said they believed that
Elian should remain in the United States.

 MIAMI: United States. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Penelas and Carollo had, before and after, harshly criticized
efforts to remove the boy, refused to let their police help in the
effort and made speeches that left no doubt they would not
cooperate with the government, drawing condemnations from around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a startling snub, federal officials did not alert them to
the raid, apparently because those officials felt they could not
trust them. For the top elected officials in a U.S. city to be so
ignored is unusual, said political experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government just went around them,'' said Lisandro Perez,
director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International
University.
</P>
<P>
   If the two politicians plan to seek political office only in
South Florida, where Cuban-Americans remain the dominant cultural,
political and economic force, they probably did not damage
themselves, political experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo, in a city dominated by Cuban-Americans, ``solidified
his position,'' said Dario Moreno, an associate professor of
political science at Florida International University.
</P>
<P>
   But, said political experts, television images of smoking tires
and overturned trash bins burning in the streets and the police
scuffling with violent demonstrators may halt any larger political
ambitions at the Miami-Dade County line for both mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas, the young mayor of Miami-Dade County, had seemed
destined for a political career beyond Miami, but was condemned by
dozens of editorial pages around the nation, and by whites, blacks
and other Hispanics in his own county. ``He hurt his political
career,'' Moreno said, though he added that it was too soon to
write the mayor's political obituary.
</P>
<P>
   Both mayors have said over and over they did what was right,
what the majority of constituents wanted. But in doing so they
ignored almost everyone except Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people really became invested in Elian remaining here,''
Castro, the researcher, said. ``Other people felt alienated, felt
the city was being taken over by one case.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-standing power in the Cuban exile community, the Cuban
American National Foundation, and its chairman, Jorge Mas Santos,
tried but failed to broker a deal for a more peaceful transfer of
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   And, the foundation had a less visible presence at street level
than the much less powerful Movimiento Democracia, led by Ramon
Saul Sanchez. Sanchez was slammed in the head by a rifle butt in
the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point it means that they, the hard-liners, do not have
the monopoly on Cuban policy, do not have the influence they had,''
said Mauricio Font, director of the Cuba Project at the Graduate
Center of City University of New York. But Mas Santos said the
Elian case actually served the exile's fight, because ``people now
have a better understanding about what life is like in Cuba. Fidel
tyranny had been exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush, who insisted that family court should settle the
issue, had no real presence in the case and should not be affected
much by it one way or another. Political experts said Bush, a
Republican, was supportive of the exiles but was not bloodied
because he was never a real factor in how the drama played out.
</P>
<P>
   But votes, power and public opinion aside, Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, seems to have won the ultimate battle, for the
child.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta is expected to
rule on May 11 on the Miami relatives' appeal of a lower court
ruling that Elian, at 6, is too young to ask for a political asylum
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on immigration law and child psychology say that, with a
6-year-old boy, whoever exercises influence over him will
ultimately win the custody battle, which is really what the asylum
hearing is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of persuasion is now in the hands of the father,''
said Pamela Falk, a professor of immigration law at the City
University of New York. That, Falk said, was why the government had
to act so drastically to remove Elian from the Miami family.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family lost a child. Elian's father was without his
son for five months. And Elian endured a nightmare when armed
agents took him from the home and into the chaos of the street
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro, in a time when he needed a shot of power, has it
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every three or four months, Fidel has a speech and talks about
the same thing,'' Lugo said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's story has given him a passionate topic that appeals to
the nationalism of the Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
   He will talk about it, experts on Cuba said, forever.

NEGOTIATORS AGREE ON PROPOSAL TO BREAK MICROSOFT INTO 2 COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to add page 1 note; no other changes.)   (EDS: This is a late add to page 1.)  
(Editors: See also MICROSOFT-SPLIT) By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The state and federal governments that are partners
in the antitrust suit against Microsoft agreed Wednesday to file a
joint proposal on remedies in the case and back a plan to break
Microsoft into two companies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The joint proposal had been in doubt earlier in the day but
Wednesday evening it included elements that state officials had
proposed to strengthen interim restrictions on Microsoft's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   A federal official said the states had made useful suggestions
``that have been incorporated in the draft.'' Some details were
still being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   A state official said that a majority of the 19 state attorneys
general involved had signed onto the plan, but that a few holdouts
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Some were saying they may file minority opinions _ something the
trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, has said he does not want.
But with a Friday deadline for the proposal to be filed with
Jackson, some of them may still be convinced to join the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Among those holding out, one official said, is Betty Montgomery,
the attorney general of Ohio, who has said publicly that she
opposes breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may well be a minority opinion offered,'' one senior
official said. ``But what it will be and how it will be expressed,
we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a state official said, remarks by Microsoft's
leaders helped harden opinions among some attorneys general and
rally support around the breakup plan. On Tuesday, William H.
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, went even further than other company
executives have in defending Microsoft's conduct, which Jackson
called ``predatory'' and illegal in his ruling early this month.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the public television program ``Nightly
Business Report,'' on Tuesday, Gates said: ``It's important to
understand that Microsoft is very clear that it has done absolutely
nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The state official said ``the text of Bill Gates' remarks has
been carefully read today, and he makes it hard for people to be
trusting.'' But Microsoft asserts that it will win the case on
appeal and has every right to state its convictions in public.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said
in an interview with The Washington Post that the company had done
nothing wrong and saw no reason to alter its business practices.
Some attorneys general, working that day on enforcement mechanisms,
``saw this as a real slap in the face,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The joint state-federal plan calls for breaking Microsoft
roughly in half. One-half would be the operating-system company,
the other would hold everything else, including Microsoft's
applications software, such as the word processor Word and the
spreadsheet program Excel, and the Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   But since it is likely that a breakup plan, if approved by the
judge, would be stayed during legal appeals, the proposal includes
a range of interim restrictions on Microsoft's conduct. Among them
are a plan to publish a uniform price list for Windows and to give
other companies free access to the software interface codes for
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for these so-called conduct remedies to remain in
place for three years if the breakup is implemented or 10 years if
it is not. The states want to modify that element by extending the
duration in either case, but no decision had been made this
evening. Many of those conduct remedies were debated during the
court-mediated settlement talks that broke apart early this month.
Then, one clear concern of the states was that a strong enforcement
mechanism must be put in place, to be overseen perhaps by a
court-appointed special master.
</P>
<P>
   The states say they are trying to strengthen the enforcement
provisions of the conduct remedies, noting that if a breakup plan
is overturned on appeal, the conduct remedies will be the only
remaining restraints on Microsoft's behavior. The exact mechanisms
of the enforcement proposal are still being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft calls all of these remedy proposals extreme and
unwarranted. If they are in fact offered, the company will ask the
judge to hold lengthy and detailed hearings, with witnesses and the
opportunity to obtain government documents on the issue, before he
makes his decision.

DIES AT 59

(Attn: N.J.)  SISTER MARY GERALDINE TOBIA, LEADER OF FAMILY AGENCY, By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sister Mary Geraldine Tobia, a longtime co-director
of the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park, a social service
agency serving people in that section of Brooklyn, died on Tuesday
Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 59 and lived at the
center.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Jennifer Howse, a friend who headed
the center's advisory board for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tobia, who was a sister of the Good Shepherd, and Sister Mary
Paul Janchill were the co-founders of the center in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   It provides comprehensive neighborhood services to children,
young people and families in Sunset Park, a generally poor, largely
immigrant neighborhood. Most of the people who live there are
Hispanic, and part of the neighborhood has been mostly peopled by
Chinese immigrants over the last seven or eight years.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1993, Tobia said, ``We are more like the old
settlement house than we are anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time the center's services, besides family counseling,
had come to include child care, a food bank, job placement, a
sports league, centers for teen-agers, even a thrift shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``She treated everybody she worked with as a family member, and
that became the model for the Center for Family Life, and in fact
became a model for similar institutions across the country,'' said
David Saltzman, executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation,
which fights poverty in New York City and worked with Tobia for the
last 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Joseph M. Sullivan, auxiliary Roman Catholic bishop of
Brooklyn for human services, said Tobia ``was a woman of
extraordinary energy and very upbeat mentality and believed in
hands-on dealing with community problems and issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``She believed most of the solutions should be
fashioned within the communities where the kids lived. There was
never a day that I recall, in observing her, where she was down.
She always thought there was a solution to every problem, there was
a way of dealing with reality that could really turn the thing
around.''
</P>
<P>
   From the time of the center's founding until Tobia's death, she
and Janchill were its co-directors, with equal authority in
administering it. The center's financing comes from government
sources and from private charitable organizations like the Robin
Hood Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The honors she received include an Ecumenical Woman of the Year
award in 1978 from the Brooklyn Division of the Council of Churches
of the City of New York and a Robin Hood Foundation Heroes Award in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Tobia was born and raised in Newark, and received a bachelor's
degree, magna cum laude, in 1967 from Fordham, a master's degree in
1976 from the family and community relations department of Teachers
College at Columbia, and a master's degree in 1985 from Columbia's
School of Social Work.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are her mother, Bridget Cappozzi Tobia of Newark, and
numerous cousins.

FRANK ROTHMAN, LAWYER WHO DEFENDED NFL, DIES AT 73 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Frank Rothman, a trial lawyer who represented the
National Football League in some of its most important cases and
who once ran the MGM movie studio, died April 25 in a hospital here
from complications following surgery, his family said. He was 73
and had continued to practice law until early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman was a partner in the Los Angeles office of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, the New York law firm, specializing in
antitrust law and working mainly for big clients in sports and
entertainment. The National Law Journal, calling him a ``legendary
litigator,'' included him several times on its list of the 100 most
influential lawyers in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman considered his biggest victory to be defending the NFL
in a 1986 antitrust case filed by the fledgling U.S. Football
League. A jury ruled that the NFL did violate antitrust law on one
count but awarded the USFL only $1 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank was a combination of Shula, Landry and Noll in the
courtroom,'' said Paul Tagliabue, the commissioner of the National
Football League, in a statement, referring to three legendary
footbal coaches: Tom Landry, Don Shula and Chuck Noll.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, Rothman handled a case involving Spencer
Haywood that invalidated the National Basketball Association's rule
preventing players from entering the league before their college
class graduated. And more recently he successfully defended the NBA
from a lawsuit filed by Latrell Sprewell stemming from his 68-game
suspension for choking his coach.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Rothman's longtime clients was the billionaire Kirk
Kerkorian, who has on three occasions owned the MGM movie studio in
Hollywood. In 1982, despite having no experience in studio
operation, Rothman was named chairman and chief executive of MGM/UA
Entertainment Co. Rothman helped reduce the studio's heavy debts
but the studio's box-office record remained shaky. When Kerkorian
sold the studio in 1986, Rothman left to return to law.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rothman would joke that he was never that comfortable
being a Hollywood mogul. A lawyer, he would explain, is responsible
for the outcome of his own case while a studio chief is always
blamed for the failure of movies he neither writes, directs or acts
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``His heart was always in the law and that was why he was able
to make the transition back to becoming a practicing lawyer,'' said
Ronald L. Olson, a trial attorney in Los Angeles, who said Rothman
was liked and respected even by his adversaries in cases. ``He set
the example for all of us litigators,'' Olson continued. ``He had a
special rapport and respect from judges that the rest of us sought
and few attained.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Los Angeles, Rothman received his undergraduate
degree from the University of California at Los Angeles and his law
degree from the University of Southern California. He worked in the
early 1950s in the Los Angeles city attorney's office and then
joined a local firm that eventually became known as Wyman, Bautzer,
Rothman &AMP; Kuchel &AMP; Silbert. He left that firm to join MGM and then
was recruited by Skadden Arps, which was trying to expand its Los
Angeles office.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman did not always win. He was on the losing side of a case
in which eight NFL players challenged the league's restrictions on
players' becoming free agents. After a jury verdict in 1992 in
favor of the players, the case was settled in a way that led to an
easing of the requirements for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman collected contemporary art and was a passionate sports
fan. He and his son Steven bet each week for 23 years on the
outcome of NFL games, awarding a trophy to the winner, his son
recalled Wednesday. Even when Steven was on his honeymoon off the
coast of Turkey, he called his father with his picks for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his
wife, Mariana Pfaelzer, a U.S. States District Court judge in Los
Angeles, and by three children from his first marriage; Steven and
Susan Rothman, both of Los Angeles; and Robin Wilson of the Atlanta
area. He is also survived by five grandchildren.

RANGERS STUNG BY KILLER B's 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ Figuring out what's wrong with the Rangers these
days is like watching reruns of ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all right there near the top of the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, kids, we're talking about the letter `B.'
</P>
<P>
   B, as in bullpen _ surprisingly shaky.
</P>
<P>
   B, as in balance in the lineup _ there is none.
</P>
<P>
   B, as in bench _ thin as Jason McDonald's resume.
</P>
<P>
   B, as in bottom half of the batting order _ dead weight.
</P>
<P>
   B, as in bad _ really, really baaaad.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say that?
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, let's add one more `B,' as in, boy, does Mark Clark
stink.
</P>
<P>
   Clark says he's too good to pitch in the bullpen but he wasn't
too good to cough up five first-inning runs to Boston _ yep,
another `B' _ and last just four outs into yesterday's 14-4
bloodbath against the Boston Red Sox, closing out a disastrous 2-7
homestand at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   My original intention was to tell you that it's way too early to
be overly concerned about the Rangers' early struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw Clark pitch.
</P>
<P>
   And Matt Perisho relieve.
</P>
<P>
   Hurry, Justin Thompson. Please hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Clark's abominable performance yesterday was an
aberration for the team's starting rotation, which has been the
most promising aspect of he season's first three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's four-out stint broke a string of 17 consecutive games in
which Rangers starters had gone at least five innings.
</P>
<P>
   There, I've said something positive about the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk reality.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one thing the Rangers were confident in when they
left spring training, it was their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Guess again. If the 'pen had done its job adequately, the
Rangers' dismal 8-13 record could easily be a comfortable 13-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get left-handed hitters out,'' general manager Doug
Melvin said. ``The numbers for our right-handers are actually
pretty good. Our bad games have been one pitch here or there. The
concern is that we have given up the runs at crucial times.''
</P>
<P>
   Balance in the lineup _ the Rangers are heavily weighted to the
right side _ disappeared when Rusty Greer and Frank Catalanotto
took their left-handed bats to the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   That has also negatively impacted the bench, exposing the
Rangers' weak underbelly at Oklahoma. The switch-hitting McDonald
(0-for-9), called up from the RedHawks, has failed miserably as a
pinch-hitter and extra outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Catalanotto and Rusty are hurt, our bench is obviously
thinned out,'' Melvin said. ``Somebody who was a fifth outfielder
becomes a fourth outfielder. Somebody you might see as an extra
player on the bench has to become an everyday player. Once
Catalanotto and Rusty come back, our bench will become a strength
again. It's a matter of getting through these few injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might could have signed someone else at Oklahoma City, but
the problem is, when they see you have Chad Curtis, Rusty Greer,
Gabe Kapler and Ruben Mateo, why would they sign here? They ask,
`When am I going to get playing time? You've got those young guys
and Rusty Greer never gets hurt, plus you've got Curtis. When am I
going to get called up?' ''
</P>
<P>
   With Greer out and Juan Gonzalez long gone, opposing managers
look at the Rangers' lineup and tell their starting pitchers,
``Don't let Rodriguez or Palmeiro beat you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After the fifth spot in the batting order, the Rangers' lineup
turns into a black hole. Gabe Kapler and Ruben Mateo are scaring no
one, except maybe Melvin, who nevertheless continues to put up a
brave front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at the stats today,'' Melvin pointed out. ``Gabe
Kapler has 12 hits. Tim Salmon \RAngels\S has 12 hits. Tony Clark
\RTigers\S has seven hits in 52 at-bats. Damion Easley \RTigers\S,
two hits. Brady Anderson \ROrioles\S, 14 hits. And here's the one:
Ken Griffey Jr. \RReds\S, has 14 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the part that leaves you baffled. Everybody's talking
about all the good hitting, but there are a lot of good hitters
that aren't hitting yet. I would like to see us hit a little better
with men on base and runners in scoring position.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all Melvin would like to see the Rangers catch the ball
better. Two errors yesterday bumped the Rangers to 23 errors in 21
games. That's just unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're third in the league in starting pitching,'' Melvin said
before Clark almost single-handedly wrecked those numbers.
``Seattle, Boston, Cleveland, they're all pitching well, but
they've all made just made 10 errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between 12-8 or 8-12, a four-game swing \Rit's
five now\S, is the difference between \R23\S and 10 errors. And
that's not even talking about the mental errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's still early in the season. Plenty of time to turn
things around. But even Melvin has a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to dig yourself too big a hole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Do that and you're facing the worst `B' of all.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say ``buried?''

WHEN A KISS ISN'T JUST A KISS: A LIP-SMACKING TOP 10  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   Lisa Zeidner's fourth novel, ``Layover,'' has just been released in
paperback. She is director of the Graduate Program in English at
Rutgers University in Camden, N.J.  
 By LISA ZEIDNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He hesitates. He dips his head. (The head bend is mandatory, for
the physics of the thing.) While their lips smoosh, up comes her
hand, tentative or grabbing, to his neck, as the score swells and
the camera swoops. Let's face it, most movie kisses are dull and
predictable, about as titillating as a dental hygiene appointment.
But that makes the good ones even more memorable.
</P>
<P>
   I apologize to everyone whose favorite kiss is absent here. I
apologize for the exclusion of certain legendary kisses, like the
360-degree one in the original ``Thomas Crown Affair,'' or firelit
Rhett and Scarlett in ``Gone With the Wind.'' Nor have I included
anything mostly comical, like Dustin Hoffman catching Anne Bancroft
on the inhale in ``The Graduate'' or, fond as I am of Brad Dourif
smooching his creation through bulletproof glass in ``Alien
Resurrection,'' any variety of interspecies foreplay. Only scenes
that produce a quantifiable rise in blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, from incontestable to perhaps slightly more
idiosyncratic (one choice below caused a respondent to my informal
poll to make a bad-fish pucker and say eee-yoo): &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed, jointly holding the phone
to their ears in ``It's a Wonderful Life'' (1946)(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate
necking,'' George Bailey declares. He doesn't fool us. Judy Garland
and Mickey Rooney may get the prize for the most first kisses ever
filmed. But Jimmy Stewart, with his patented slide from restraint
to passion, is the best First Kisser. He kisses as if he's never
done it with anyone before, and will never do it with anyone else
again. Skip the 9{ weeks _ Capra cuts from the first kiss directly
to the wedding. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Baby and Bogey in ``To Have and Have Not'' (1945)(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Bacall initiates it. ``Whadja do that for?'' Humphrey
Bogart asks, startled. ``Been wondering whether I'd like it,'' she
says. Does she? ``I don't know yet,'' she retorts, but allows,
after she kisses him again, ``It's even better when you help.''
</P>
<P>
   Good as the script is _ and we should all be so lucky as to have
dialogue like this provided for our dates _ the power of the scene
resides in the weight of what we now know about Bacall and Bogart
off-screen. He's an uptown boy playing lowdown; she's a girl from
the Bronx playing posh. She seems his equal, but she's also not.
She's 19. For all the subversions and inversions, their complex
chemistry feels as easy as whistling.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, the notorious
three-minute balcony scene in ``Notorious'' (1946, a very good year
for kissing).(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock circumvented the censors, who had strict time limits
on kissing, by having Grant and Bergman peck at each other while
they whisper wetly about whether or not to have chicken for dinner.
They are delayed kisses, full of both longing and the promise of
longing fulfilled, delightfully slow-building _ as close to tantric
sex as '40s movies get.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, have two better-looking pairs of lips ever met? No matter
where she moves, light glints off Bergman's hair, eyes and teeth,
as if invisible fireflies were hovering to provide a perpetual
personal lighting source, except it somehow doesn't look staged or
corny. And Grant has that profile: the cleft of chin, the
sculptural arc of hair around his ear, the ear itself perfectly
shaped, a kind of uber-ear; Bergman can't resist reaching out and
just tracing its curve, speculatively. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway in ``Chinatown''
(1974)(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a nasty cut,'' she notes, by way of understatement, as
she removes the grotesque white bandage that he has worn over the
wound on his nose for most of the film and swats at it with
peroxide. And while she may look china-doll perfect, her hair
marcelled into immobile waves, he is quick to observe, as he gazes
into her eyes, that she has a flaw in her iris. Watching Nicholson
and Dunaway today, they seem almost painfully young and
fresh-faced, but with an edge, as if their performances carry hints
of all the kitschy, self-parodying roles they will play in the
future, from Heeeere's Johnny to Mommie Dearest.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Al Pacino's Kiss of Death to John Cazale in ``Godfather
II'' (1974)(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Corleone grabs his brother Fredo through falling
confetti, on the dance floor, on New Year's Eve in Cuba. ``I know
it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart.'' In
case a reminder is needed that not only in sex is there passion,
intrigue, betrayal. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland in ``Don't Look
Now'' (1973)(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   For the obvious plot payoff reasons, most movie kisses are first
kisses. This long scene is unusual in that the participants are
married. They've kissed before and will kiss again; mixed with
their passion is tenderness, affection, even some humor (``You have
toothpaste all over your mouth''). The scene doesn't come at the
end of the movie, either, but toward the beginning, and rather than
the standard disrobing we get a montage of robing, post-coitally.
Kissing exists, here, in a context _ the context of the couple's
layered history. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster slow-dancing in ``Taxi
Driver'' (1976)(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does this even count? Is there some percentage of measurable
joint lip involvement that must be achieved before an interaction
can be fairly labeled kissing? Does the partner even have to kiss
back? I could posit that almost-kisses on screen are often more
seductive, less clinical, than the full-throttle variety, but then
couldn't I find a sweeter, more Jane Austen-y moment? Still, the
scene sticks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's Jodie Foster's passivity, as Keitel murmurs and
slithers his bejeweled hands with their cocaine-scooping
pinkie-nails around her back and hair, that makes the scene so
queasy. Forget ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' or ``Fatal Attraction,''
indeed forget sexually transmitted disease: Harvey Keitel as
adoring pimp may have single-handedly made the world safe for
monogamy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Klaus Kinski and Isabelle Adjani in ``Nosferatu the
Vampyre'' (1979)(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Most vampire kisses are played for camp, with the lucky lady
donating blood in a tango-style backward swoon. In Werner Herzog's
version, Kinski is bald, with pointy ears, a major need for
undereye concealer and really, really bad teeth. ``You must excuse
my rude entrance,'' Count Dracula actually tells Lucy, on his first
attempt to win her favor. But soon Lucy awaits him, perfectly still
and dressed in coffin-white, pale and placid as a daguerrotype.
Bats fly in slo-mo to Bulgarian chants, and Dracula slurps so loud
you'd think he was a frat boy with a Big Gulp.
</P>
<P>
   It should, in short, be a downright howler. It's not. Kinski
lifting her chiffon skirt with his repulsively long fingernails
(even longer than Keitel's) is the ultimate in dangerous sexuality
_ sex as ``a very severe brain fever.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche in ``Wuthering
Heights'' (1992), or Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas in
``The English Patient'' (1996) _ Fiennes with anyone, since the
actress, no matter how gorgeous, will not register.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes has my nomination to take home the Jimmy Stewart
Memorial Unrequited Love Statuette. With his soulful eyes and slow,
haunted hands, he manages to keep plaintive longing from seeming
silly as he wails for his beloved over the moors, or the desert.
The actual object of his affections becomes baldly, boldly
irrelevant. Which is, of course, as we learned as far back as
``Casablanca,'' the very point of unrequited love: it's always a
solo act. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Greta Scacchi and Peter Coyote in ``A Man in Love''
(1987)(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   They don't get very far into the hotel room. He leans her up
against the back of the door. He unbuttons her blouse before he
kisses her; their first kiss slides, rather quickly, into their
first everything else. Her welcoming blush, his hand to her neck _
it's all fairly standard issue, so it's hard to pinpoint what
they're doing to make the scene so compelling. It may not be
irrelevant that the director was a woman. Diane Kurys focuses on
Scacchi's face, but her gaze is more empathetic than lascivious.
And Scacchi actually smiles. Love isn't always painful, at least in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus for Kurys: she has the good sense to leave the sex
act unscored. The lusty duo does not pause to tune the hotel radio
to ``My Heart Will Go On (Love Theme From `Titanic').'' As someone
who has just fast-forwarded through slews of films to get to the
sex scenes (perhaps, I grant, not the ideal way to savor the
mounting relationships), I can attest that nothing ruins the mood
of the moment faster than a few hundred hyperactive violinists.

 &HT;    Ohio motto was too sacred
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner, Michael C. Bender
 &HT;    and Khalid Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ God may be causing trouble in Ohio, but not in
several other states across the nation that use references to the
Almighty in their mottoes.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona they use ``God Enriches.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota they say ``Under God The People Will Rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's motto, ``In God We Trust,'' mirrors the nation's.
</P>
<P>
   None of those mottoes are in danger of being challenged, but
Ohio's motto of ``With God All Things Are Possible'' was ruled
unconstitutional Tuesday by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed with the American Civil Liberties Union and the
plaintiff, the Rev. Matthew Peterson, a Presbyterian minister, who
claimed the words were a government endorsement of Christian
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safe prediction is that other state mottoes won't suffer
the same fate,'' said Louis Jacobs, an Ohio State University law
professor.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy surrounding Ohio's motto, as opposed to the
other states, is that it comes from Matthew 19:26, which quotes
Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU officials argued that the motto is a clear violation of
keeping church and state separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those other states have much more casual or bland references
to God in their mottoes,'' said Raymond Vasvari, legal director for
the ACLU of Ohio based in Cleveland. ``Officials like (Ohio Gov.)
Bob Taft and (Attorney General) Betty Montgomery are downplaying
the fact that the state appropriated sacred text.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruling, Taft and Montgomery are backing the state
motto and will appeal the court's decision to the full 13-judge
appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling puzzled Dayton-area lawmakers, both Republicans
and Democrats, who said they see nothing wrong with the state
motto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty strongly about the separation between church and
state but I think this decision is off base,'' said state Rep. J.
Donald Mottley (R-West Carrollton). ``In God We Trust, One Nation
Under God, why are those constitutional and this isn't?''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Tom Roberts (D-Dayton) said the motto does not
promote religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a statement of fact, that's all,'' Roberts said.
``I guess we can dispute the religious implications of that all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling against the motto was also criticized heavily
by Dayton-area ministers, who believe society has established a
crusade to eliminate references to God as part of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step backward,'' said Pastor Allen T. Ross of the
Kettering Assembly of God Church. ``It symbolizes an erosion of
values that are beneficial to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Walker, youth pastor at Beavercreek Church, said the
decision is ``disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to great lengths to exclude mention of God in all
sectors of our life and where has it got us? We dismissed God from
schools and look at the state they are in,'' he said. ``I believe
that if I'm going to have a relationship with God, it reigns over
everything in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The state motto was adopted in 1959 when a 10-year-old school
boy, Jimmie Mastronardo, now 52 and living in Kentucky, learned
that Ohio didn't have a motto. That's when he suggested the phrase
``With God All Things Are Possible'' to his teacher because his
mother and grandmother used to say it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU's Vasvari compared the motto issue to the controversy
over whether public school districts should be allowed to display
the Ten Commandments on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   As for state mottoes, most states have chosen patriotic sayings
or slogans that symbolize local history. But some seem a little
unusual, including:
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas _ ``The People Rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland _ ``Manly deeds, womanly words.''
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico _ ``It Grows As It Goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas _ ``Friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington _ ``Bye &AMP; Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin _ ``Forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this week's court ruling, some residents were unaware that
Ohio even had a motto and believe the controversy is a waste of
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer in the separation of church and state, but
I don't think it's hurting anybody to have the motto,'' said
Nannette Anderholdt, general manager at Kinko's in downtown Dayton.
``Just because it's the motto, that doesn't mean you have to abide
by it,'' she said. ``I think it's just a big brouhaha over
nothing.''

BUSH STRESSES BIPARTIANSHIP IN VISIT TO WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For once, George W. Bush was not acting like the
Washington outsider.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his rare visits to the nation's capital, and his first
since clinching the Republican presidential nomination, the Texas
governor Wednesday huddled privately with a Republican and a
Democratic senator on Social Security. He burnished his foreign
policy credentials by meeting with the Russian foreign minister,
Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   And he proved once again that he is a master fund-raiser,
bringing in $21.3 million for his party at a black tie dinner that
was a who's who of lobbyists and businesses with interests before
the government. Those represented included AT&AMP;T, the National Rifle
Association, Philip Morris Cos., the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association and the Chevron Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he was toasted by the Washington establishment, Bush
tried to create some distance from it, criticizing ``eight years of
excessive partisanship and fingerpointing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore administration has been the most relentlessly
partisan administration in our nation's history,'' Bush told the
crowd of about 1,500 Republican officials and lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes some in our own party have responded in kind,''
he said. ``Americans have seen a cycle of bitterness: an arms race
of anger. And both parties bear some of the blame. The legacy:
cynicism, a generic disgust. A feeling by too many Americans that
it doesn't matter who wins the election, you see they're all the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, cited the fund-raising event in
criticizing his Republican rival. Speaking to reporters in
Connecticut, Gore suggested that Bush's positions on issues had
been influenced by his donors, including the Philip Morris Cos. and
Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle
Association, who was a dinner co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fighting for common sense restrictions on the availability
of guns, but Governor Bush is receiving all this financial help
from the NRA and he is opposed to these common sense
restrictions,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush every trip to the nation's capital in this campaign
represents a delicate balancing act. Though Bush was an informal
adviser to his father when he was president, he is positioning
himself as an outsider from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He has cultivated relations with Republicans on Capitol Hill yet
at the same time stands as what he terms a new kind of Republican _
implicitly criticizing the Republican Congress that was led by Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Bush came to Washington for a fund-raiser, he
included a somewhat triumphal tour through the Capitol, where he
was surrounded by Republican lawmakers. This time, he stayed blocks
away from the Capitol and any similar images, instead meeting with
lawmakers from his room at the J.W. Marriott hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, his communications director, said he had meetings
and receptions planned from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. ``It was easier
for him to be able to have the kind of meetings he wanted to have
here without going over to the Hill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his wife, Laura, Bush did make one midday appearance
at a Republican women's forum that seemed the pinnacle of
Oprah-style politics, with the Bushes, two Republican lawmakers and
a series of guests _ young students and teachers _ all sitting on
chairs and couches arranged like a TV talk show set.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, a large poster of girls and women acted as a
backdrop emblazoned with the words ``For Our Daughters.''
Introducing her husband, Laura Bush said, ``Since this is about our
daughters, I think I'll talk about our own daughters and the way
he's been as a dad.'' She said, ``He actually got up in the middle
of the night and fed the babies with me and changed the diapers.''
</P>
<P>
   When he came on stage to cheers and applause, Bush thanked his
wife, saying, ``you read it just like I wrote it.'' He quickly
added that he was happy to be with ``three really brilliant
women,'' referring to his wife and the two moderators, Rep.
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such education events have left Bush running well among women
who in past elections have favored Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the day Bush held closed-door meetings at his hotel,
and senior members of his campaign team planned to stay in
Washington for the rest of the week to meet with senior
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the meeting with Ivanov, Bush held a one-hour
session on Social Security with Sens. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and Bob
Kerrey, D-Neb..
</P>
<P>
   The two have sponsored a wide-ranging measure to overhaul the
Social Security system that includes as one element individual
accounts that would be opened at citizens' birth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointed to that meeting later at the Republican fund-raiser
to show that he was willing to work with Democrats. Kerrey, who is
the chairman of Gore's campaign in Nebraska, but differs with the
vice president on Social Security said he was not bothered by the
mention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it produces some bipartisan middle ground on this issue
I'll think this meeting has been worthwhile,'' Kerrey said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been showcasing Democrats all this week. But for all
his protests about partisanship, he and the other Republican
speakers were unsparing of Gore at the party's gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican National Committee chairman, said,
``Welcome to the RNC's Al Gore retirement party.'' And Bush lashed
into his opponent calling him ``an integral part of an
administration that has waged the same old Washington blame game.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Last week was Earth Day. Unfortunately for Al Gore's
campaign every day is scorched earth day. And it's time to clean up
the toxic environment in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed, ``Make no mistake about this. When I am attacked in
this campaign I will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   As the keynote speaker, Bush helped his party raise an expected
$21.3 million Wednesday night, a one-night record, including the
unregulated unlimited donations that his primary opponent, Sen.
John McCain had campaigned against.

   Last week, it was Sen. John McCain who changed his mind and said
the Confederate battle flag should no longer fly atop the South
Carolina Capitol. This week, McCain's best-known supporter in the
state, Rep. Lindsey Graham of the 3rd Congressional District,
ventured the same opinion, saying he now supports the state
Senate's proposal to remove the flag and put a smaller version on a
Confederate monument in front of the Capitol. But Graham, a flag
supporter who had urged McCain to stay away from the issue in the
South Carolina primary, lest it cost him votes, added a qualifier
to his change of mind. The flag, he told The Associated Press on
Monday, should stay where it is if the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People continues its economic boycott of the
state. Still, said Graham, who has his eye on a Senate seat, the
flag is eventually going to come down.

   The Sierra Club has begun an $8 million television and radio
campaign aimed at 17 House and Senate races. The commercials,
mostly praising Democrats, are focused on tight races in which the
club believes it has the best chance to make a difference. The
commercials will be combined with other campaign efforts, the club
officials say, including mass distribution of voter guides and
fliers. The officials say they also plan to run presidential
campaign commercials that criticize the environmental record of
Gov. George W. Bush in Texas and may throw in advertising that
praises Vice President Al Gore. The club has not made public where
it got the money to pay for the advertising campaign and under
federal tax and election regulations is not required to do so.

   BUSH TOPS $78 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   Continuing his record fund-raising pace, Gov. George W. Bush
pulled in an additional $6.4 million in campaign donations in
March, bringing his total for the race to $78.6 million. But at the
same time, new campaign finance figures show, he spent $10.2
million and ended the month with $6.8 million in the bank. Vice
President Al Gore pulled in $4.4 million in March, bringing his
total fund-raising for the campaign to $40.4 million. He spent $4.7
million and ended the month with $3.8 million on hand. Gore has
aggressively used the Internet as a campaign financing tool,
raising slightly over $1.1 million online through Feb. 15. By
comparison, Bush has raised $350,000 online. Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., remains the most successful online presidential
fund-raiser, pulling in $4.3 million electronically, followed by
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey with $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   RACE FOR NEBRASKA SEAT
</P>
<P>
   As the May 9 primaries approach for Nebraska's open U.S. Senate
seat, fund-raising figures for the two leading Republican
contenders show that in the first half of April, Secretary of State
Scott Moore raised more than twice as much as Attorney General Don
Stenberg _ $51,000 to $24,000. For the year, Moore now leads
Stenberg $224,000 to $144,000 in fund-raising. But polls have
Stenberg running ahead in the race itself, and overall in the
campaign he has raised more than Moore _ $399,000 to $224,000 _ in
part because he started a year earlier. Still, Moore now says he
has the momentum in the contest on the basis of his latest
fund-raising effort. On the Democratic side, former Gov. Ben Nelson
faces no serious opposition in his nomination quest and, despite a
late entry in the race, is well ahead of both Republicans in money
raising, having taken in $129,000 in the first half of April, for a
total of $763,000 for the campaign. More to the point, he also
leads both Republicans in the polls. The incumbent senator, Bob
Kerrey, a Democrat, is retiring. &QL;

COWBOYS ACQUIRE FORMER SMU LINEBACKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys yesterday acquired former SMU
linebacker Chris Bordano from the New Orleans Saints in a trade for
oft-injured cornerback Kevin Mathis, and the Cowboys probably won't
stop there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trade shouldn't be looked at as a reflection on Kevin
Mathis ... \Rbecause\S it wasn't,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said.
``We liked the way \RMathis\S competed for us, and we like the
depth that Chris Bordano now provides at linebacker as well as
special teams. Mainly it came down to what we believe makes our
football team look better numbers-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Translated: The Cowboys had too many cornerbacks and not enough
linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIV starting middle linebacker Barron Wortham, an
Everman native who has expressed a strong desire to play for the
Cowboys, was released by the Tennessee Titans on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Bordano does not preclude the Cowboys signing
a veteran free-agent linebacker with NFL experience, such as
Wortham, Joe Bowden (Tennessee unrestricted free agent), William
Thomas (released by Philadelphia) or Darrin Smith (released by
Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   We will continue to look at \Rimproving\S our depth at
linebacker,'' Jones said. ``We will evaluate Wortham along with
some others out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans released Wortham midway through a four-year, $8.4
million contract in large part due to the free-agent signing of
Randall Godfrey, who left the Cowboys for a five-year, $25 million
deal in February.
</P>
<P>
   This led to the promotion of Dat Nguyen to Cowboys' starting
middle linebacker followed by yesterday's trade for Bordano. It has
been made clear that Nguyen is still the starter, but Bordano is
excited about being back in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity, and we're going to take advantage of
it,'' said Bordano, who tutored elementary school children in
Dallas while attending SMU. ``We're going home. Hopefully, I can
compete this year for a starting job. And if not, I'll do whatever
I can do to help the team, including special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   All 18 of Bordano's NFL starts in two seasons in New Orleans
came at middle linebacker, although he can play outside as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bordano ``brings some depth at a position where we need it,''
Cowboys linebackers coach George Edwards said. ``Everybody is
coming in to compete for a job. Nothing is etched in stone. That's
what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, who missed eight games with injuries last season after
winning a starting job from Kevin Smith at the end of 1998, was
signed to the Cowboys' tendered offer of $472,000 just before the
trade forBordano was made.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Williams, who has all but signed a one-year contract for
the veteran's minimum of $440,000 with the Cowboys, stays because
he has shown more durability than Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders is expected to be released by the
Cowboys after June 1. Still, the Cowboys have seven cornerbacks who
figure to make the 53-man roster: Ryan McNeil, Smith, Williams,

Tennessee, Kareem Larrimore of West Texas A&AMP;M and Mario Edwards of
Florida State. Staff writer Clarence E. Hill Jr., contributed to

COWBOYS ACQUIRE FORMER SMU LINEBACKER

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys yesterday acquired former SMU
linebacker Chris Bordano from the New Orleans Saints in a trade for
oft-injured cornerback Kevin Mathis, and the Cowboys probably won't
stop there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trade shouldn't be looked at as a reflection on Kevin
Mathis ... \Rbecause\S it wasn't,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said.
``We liked the way \RMathis\S competed for us, and we like the
depth that Chris Bordano now provides at linebacker as well as
special teams. Mainly it came down to what we believe makes our
football team look better numbers-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Translated: The Cowboys had too many cornerbacks and not enough
linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIV starting middle linebacker Barron Wortham, an
Everman native who has expressed a strong desire to play for the
Cowboys, was released by the Tennessee Titans on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Bordano does not preclude the Cowboys signing
a veteran free-agent linebacker with NFL experience, such as
Wortham, Joe Bowden (Tennessee unrestricted free agent), William
Thomas (released by Philadelphia) or Darrin Smith (released by
Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   We will continue to look at \Rimproving\S our depth at
linebacker,'' Jones said. ``We will evaluate Wortham along with
some others out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans released Wortham midway through a four-year, $8.4
million contract in large part due to the free-agent signing of
Randall Godfrey, who left the Cowboys for a five-year, $25 million
deal in February.
</P>
<P>
   This led to the promotion of Dat Nguyen to Cowboys' starting
middle linebacker followed by yesterday's trade for Bordano. It has
been made clear that Nguyen is still the starter, but Bordano is
excited about being back in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity, and we're going to take advantage of
it,'' said Bordano, who tutored elementary school children in
Dallas while attending SMU. ``We're going home. Hopefully, I can
compete this year for a starting job. And if not, I'll do whatever
I can do to help the team, including special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   All 18 of Bordano's NFL starts in two seasons in New Orleans

<P>
   Bordano ``brings some depth at a position where we need it,''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Asking a teen-ager to spend time with their
parents is usually like asking a puppy to cuddle with a badger.
</P>
<P>
   They're not doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Paschal senior student-trainer Wende Pippin if she minds
spending time with her father, she doesn't mind so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would just put up with it to meet some hot
football players,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As parents take their daughters to work on ``National Take Your
Daughters to Work Day'' Jim Pippin is in the unique position of
taking his daughter to work not only today, but every day.
</P>
<P>
   He is the head athletic trainer at Paschal High School and his
only daughter is a member of his student staff.
</P>
<P>
   Sound awkward? It can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand it would be a little awkward,'' she said.
``Any problems we have here get carried over a little to home. But,
this gives me time with my dad I wouldn't have had otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 53-year old trainer who has suffered two heart attacks,
it provides him with the opportunity to work with one of his
children, something he hasn't done since sons Cade and Derek worked
alongside him as lifeguards in Fort Worth more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the 18-year old teen-ager who has been more interested in
theater, it provides her with the chance to be around dad, meet
students she probably would never have met, and learn about
something she previously had little interest in: sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned some things about my daughter I didn't know,''
said Pippin, who has been in the business since 1970 and worked at
Paschal for the past two years and with his daughter since January
1999. ``It helps to see her learn some values in athletics and gain
some interest in it. I've seen that come through in her and it
makes me proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been one of the best years I have had in training.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that one of the best years in his professional career
doesn't come without some headaches. After all, she's a well spoken
_ and sometimes outspoken _ teen-ager whose father is laid back and
relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times she gets so mad at him; she thinks he didn't
do something or should have handled something differently,'' her
mother, Marcia, said. ``If she's mad she might come home and only
says, `I'm taking a walk.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the only thing Wende Pippin got mad about her
father's job was the amount of time it requires. Now that she's a
part of it, things are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to only be into theater and didn't really care about
sports,'' said Marcia, who is a self-described football mom. ``She
used to never want to go to games. Now, she understands football.''
</P>
<P>
   She understands it so well she is known to give coaches advice
on plays.
</P>
<P>
   She understands it so well that her grand intention of meeting
the aforementioned ``hot football players'' has a fatal flaw: dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are scared of him,'' Marcia said. ``She might have a
crush on one of them but he will call him stupid or something so
they won't ask her out.''
</P>
<P>
   He understands her so well that if he can't communicate
something to a staff member or student-athlete, she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we can hear him and understand him, we knows he's
serious,'' said Wende Pippin, who is affectionately referred to as
``mom'' by some of the student-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that she is on a path to follow in her
father's footsteps. To the contrary _ she plans on earning her
massage therapy license to help pay for college. If she can work in
athletic training in college to curb some of the costs, great.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens if or when Wende changes her mind and asks her
father to help her become a professional athletic trainer?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask him to slap me,'' she said. / nn

 &HT;    Braves dig the long ball
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the midst of their longest April winning streak
since 1982, when the Braves set a major-league record by winning
their first 13 games, no Brave wants to flinch first.
</P>
<P>
   So to follow Tom Glavine's 1-0 shutout against Kevin Brown,
Kevin Millwood put himself to the task of keeping a good thing
going. Millwood stretched the Braves' win streak to nine with a 5-1
victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Like their Opening Day of 2000, the Braves got back-to-back home
runs _ this time from Andruw Jones and Chipper Jones _ to give
Millwood a 2-0 headstart. That's all he would need, as he allowed
one run in seven innings for his second consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   That kept alive the chances for a perfect nine-game homestand.
The Braves have one game remaining at Turner Field before they head
to the West Coast to play the Padres and the Dodgers. One more
victory today and the Braves will have matched their longest
winning streak since Aug. 19-29.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga chipped in with his eighth home run of the
season in the sixth inning. It moved him into a tie with Steve
Finley and Barry Bonds for the National League lead. Quilvio Veras
added two hits and one RBI, and Chipper Jones drove in two runs for
the first time in more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones had given it a wide smile when hitting coach Merv
Rettenmund dished some grief his way during batting practice
Wednesday. ``I sure wish you'd get an offensive highlight,''
Rettenmund said in reference to Jones' ninth-inning diving catch to
help save Glavine's 1-0 shutout Tuesday night. And then he did
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   He jump-started the Braves offensively with a home run off
rookie Eric Gagne in the third inning, which was followed two
pitches later by Chipper Jones' fourth homer of the year. This one
ended a 41 at-bat homerless stretch for Chipper Jones, who hit his
first three homers at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers broke their string of 24 consecutive scoreless
innings with an unearned run off Millwood in the fourth to draw
within 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The run came on a checked-swing bouncer up the middle by Gagne
with two outs and the bases loaded. Walt Weiss charged in on it but
couldn't secure it for his fifth error of the season as Eric Karros
scored from third.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Millwood allowed only one runner past first in seven
innings. He allowed five hits and struck out seven.

BOURQUE'S FIRST CHANGE OF ADDRESS MEANS ODD SURROUNDINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Do the jerseys fit the same? Is it hard
getting around in a new city? What's it like?
</P>
<P>
   There were so many questions, he couldn't think of them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was nervous,'' winger Dave Andreychuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque doesn't get nervous. Then again, Ray Bourque doesn't
get traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a long talk about it on the plane going to Calgary. He
asked a lot of questions on what to expect,'' Andreychuk said of
his conversation with Bourque after they were traded from Boston to
Colorado in March.
</P>
<P>
   It was move No. 4 for Andreychuk. No. 1 for Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was worried about his family and making sure they are OK
back in Boston,'' Andreychuk said. ``It could be only until June,
but it was a chance he had to take. I told them the organizations
would be different. You are going to see different things.
Hockey-wise, he was going to fit right in.''
</P>
<P>
   How could Bourque know? This is a player who had played 21
seasons in the same city. This is a player who is the Bruins'
all-time leader in scoring and games played.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what shirt he's wearing,'' said Phoenix
Coyotes forward Jeremy Roenick, who grew up in the Boston area,
``there's still a Boston Bruins shirt underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was trading Bobby Orr to the Montreal Canadiens. This was
trading Larry Bird to the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Ray Bourque wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the one who asked for it,'' Bourque said. ``But, when it
happens you deal with a lot of different emotions. I've never been
through it before. It's just a change in terms of a new town, new
teammates, a new jersey, a new room and a whole new situation you
have never been through.''
</P>
<P>
   This was exactly what Bourque _ and Colorado _ needed.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of the nomad athlete, Bourque was the exception. But,
being 39 and his playing days fading, the desire for one last shot
at the Stanley Cup was greater than the need to finish his career
as a Bruins player.
</P>
<P>
   Round 2 of Bourque's shot begins at 9 tonight in Denver when the
Avalanche plays Detroit in Game 1 of a Western Conference semifinal
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a double-sided coin,'' Roenick said. ``You don't
want him to get traded because he's a Boston guy forever. But the
flip side is, with the career he's had, not to have a Stanley Cup
would be a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   The sin is that Bourque, who leads all NHL players in games
played without a Stanley Cup, hasn't had a chance at one since
1990, when Edmonton defeated the Bruins, 4-1, in the Stanley Cup
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado went looking for its own Stanley Cup revival on March 6
when it traded forward Brian Rolston, defenseman Martin Grenier,
center Sami Pahlsson and Boston's choice of a first-round pick in
either 2000 or 2001 for Andreychuk and the five-time Norris Trophy
winner and 18-time All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone believes they have a chance again,'' ESPN hockey
analyst Barry Melrose said. ``I'm not sure Colorado thought they
had a chance \Reight\S weeks ago, but now they feel they can
compete with the Big Three \RDetroit, St. Louis and the Stars\S.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bourque, one of the NHL's best on the power play, the
Avalanche has been playing at its highest level since late last
season, when they pushed the Stars to seven games in the Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like if \RWayne\S Gretzky was with \RJoe\S Sakic
or a guy like \RMario\S Lemieux,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau
said.
</P>
<P>
   With Bourque in tow, Colorado finished the regular-season 14-2-1
as he scored 14 points in 14 games. The Avalanche rolled past
first-round opponent Phoenix, 4-1. Bourque had four assists and is
the key reason why Colorado's power play is firing at 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous player, future Hall of Famer and everything,
so he would make any team much better,'' Detroit defenseman Niklas
Lidstrom said. ``And with the depth that they have already there,
he has kind of helped their team even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey-wise, the move has been easy. But for a man with a wife,
three children and a legacy as long as any Boston sports icon, it's
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a role model for a lot of people throughout the
years,'' Roenick said. ``Myself, Keith Tkachuk, are just two of
them. Going to Boston Garden every Saturday night and watching him,
All-Star game after All-Star game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hard part is about leaving an organization that is as
much of him as the Detroit Red Wings were to Gordie Howe. It's
about being away from his family longer than an average road trip
or extended preseason workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are with me 100 percent,'' said Bourque, whose children
are 16, 14 and 9. ``I talk to them every day. They knew something
would happen, and we talked about it, and they know I am in a good
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche has flown his family to Denver to be with him a
few times already, easing the transition. It also helps that a
familiar face _ Andreychuk _ lives nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more to coming somewhere else than just playing
hockey,'' said Andreychuk, who is with his fifth team in his
18-year career. ``For me, the more you move, the easier it gets.
The good thing is the two of us were there together, and now we're
staying close to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   For Colorado, the move couldn't have come at a better time. The
Avalanche labored through a regular season in which it was supposed
to compete with Detroit and the Stars for the top spot in the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, injuries and mediocre play led to the Avalanche's
fighting Edmonton for first place in the Northwest Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, we had a disappointing regular season,'' Colorado's
Adam Deadmarsh said. ``When Ray and Dave came, it seemed to light a
candle in the room and raise our confidence level. I think it's
what we needed to go in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Is playing another season part of Bourque's direction for the
future? He's not sure. His body has a lot of ice time and frequent
flier miles and it may be telling him ``enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adjustment, and there are a lot of little things to
adjust to, but it's been great,'' Bourque said. ``It's a great
team, and I am with a team I think I can help. It's a situation I
wanted to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation he needed to be in. / nn

DRAFT REPORT BY RIGHTS PANEL SCOLDS NEW YORK POLICE ON RACE
RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A draft report from the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights says that the New York Police Department's own records
indicate that its officers engage in racial profiling and suggests
that the city consider creating a law enforcement ``mechanism,''
independent of local prosecutors, to pursue serious accusations of
police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   In the 250-page draft, the panel applauds the department for
several efforts to improve its relationship with minorities, but
characterizes its overall approach to race relations as flawed in
everything from training to promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member panel, which consists of four Democrats, three
independents and one Republican, is appointed by the president and
Congress and makes advisory reports on civil rights issues. It
cannot compel changes in policy.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's report has been greatly anticipated, in part because
the Police Department's frayed relationship with blacks and
Hispanics is under scrutiny and in part because Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani has called the panel a ``political operation of the
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   He has dismissed the report as an attempt to aid his rival in
the race for the U.S. Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York
Times, was prepared by the commission's staff. It may be amended by
the panel after further deliberations. The mayor and the Police
Department received copies Wednesday and have 20 days to offer
rebuttals.
</P>
<P>
   Even though its findings are largely critical, the draft report
is restrained in its language, and there are several discussions of
disputed issues in which the commission acknowledges that
statistics support the Police Department's version of events. For
instance, although critics have suggested that psychological
screenings were being used to block minority candidates from the
Police Department, the commission found that the statistics did not
support that contention.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most far-reaching recommendations in the report is the
suggestion that the city create an undefined mechanism to prosecute
serious accusations of police brutality instead of using local
district attorneys ``who must work with the police on a routine
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also says that the city should create an independent
monitor to review how citizen complaints of police misconduct are
handled and that the department should reshape its diversity
training, which it found defective.
</P>
<P>
   The report's most biting criticism is the conclusion that ``the
NYPD's data strongly suggests that racial profiling plays some role
in the stop-and-frisk practices of the overall department.'' For
example, the report says that data from 1998 indicated that 51
percent of the people stopped and searched by the police on Staten
Island were black, even though the island's population is only 9
percent black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere African-Americans were stopped far out of their
proportion in any of the communities policed,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the Giuliani administration has sought to portray the
report as a political instrument written by Democrats to tarnish
Giuliani's record and promote the candidacy of Clinton, to whom the
panel's chairwoman, Mary Frances Berry, has made a political
donation of $250.
</P>
<P>
   ``The civil rights commission is a partisan political joke,'' a
spokeswoman for Giuliani, Sunny Mindel, said Wednesday. ``Their
report is predicated on events of over a year ago and does not take
into adequate account the NYPD's record of restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Giuliani's biggest complaints has been his contention
that the commission did little research beyond holding a daylong
hearing last year. Giuliani has also faulted the commission for the
decision to examine New York when other cities like Washington,
where the panel is based, had higher incidences of excessive-force
cases by the police.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission has said it could hardly ignore New York
after the police torture of Abner Louima and the police shooting of
Amadou Diallo led to large demonstrations in which critics charged
that the department had trampled civil rights, especially of blacks
and Hispanics, in its zeal to cut crime.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Police officials would not comment on the draft report, saying
that the commission's rules state that the report should not be
discussed before a final version is approved. But in recent days,
officials have released a series of statistics to demonstrate that
the department is restrained in its use of force.
</P>
<P>
   One tabulation showed that the number of citizen complaints of
excessive force has been dropping rapidly since 1995, when officers
were nearly twice as likely to be accused of that form of
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the commission, Kimberly Alton, said she could
not discuss or elaborate on the draft report until it had been
approved for release by the panel.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which was created by the Civil Rights Act of
1957, is the second outside agency to criticize how the police stop
and search citizens. Last year, Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer
found a similar disproportion in the number of blacks and Hispanics
who were stopped, although he did not accuse the department of
racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have defended the street searches as a pivotal tactic
and have said more blacks and Hispanics are stopped because more
officers are deployed in high-crime neighborhoods with high
minority populations.

SUIT SEEKS TO OVERTURN MOHAWK CASINO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dissident group of St. Regis Mohawk Indians at the Akwesasne
Reservation on the Canadian border filed suit in tribal court
Wednesday seeking to overturn a secret agreement between six Mohawk
chiefs and the largest gaming company in the world, Park Place
Entertainment, to build and manage casinos in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to restore the Mohawk tribe's longstanding
partnership with Catskill Development, a group in the Catskills
that had won federal approval earlier this month to build a $500
million casino at the Monticello Raceway in Sullivan County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed on behalf of 29 members of the Mohawk tribe,
contends that the chiefs were deceived into signing an April 14
agreement that grants Park Place exclusive rights over Mohawk
casinos throughout New York in return for a $3 million loan and a
portion of future profits. They said that Park Place was more
interested in derailing the Monticello project and protecting its
three casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., from competition than in
helping the tribe, a claim vehemently denied by the gaming company.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Place deal and the lawsuit place a cloud over prospects
for gambling in the Catskills just as the tribe and its original
partners appeared to be on the verge of achieving their goal after
more than four years of negotiations and regulatory reviews.
Whatever the intentions of Park Place, the casino project now faces
almost certain delays and other legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chiefs were duped,'' said Michael Rhodes-Devey, a lawyer
who filed the suit on behalf of a group that includes former
members of the tribal government. ``Park Place is attempting to
deprive the people of St. Regis of countless jobs and hundreds of
millions of dollars through their illegal and unethical conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Clive Cummis, general counsel for Park Place, disputed the
claims. ``The tribal leaders were not fraudulently induced,'' he
said. ``We don't do business that way. They made a good deal with a
good company.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the tribal leaders did not consult the lawyers they
hired to work on casino gambling, Cummis insisted that the chiefs
had legal counsel when they signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs, who were meeting Wednesday in Hogansburg, N.Y., to
discuss the Park Place deal, did not return telephone calls
requesting comment. According to one Mohawk executive, the chiefs
were hoping that Park Place could solve the problems at its small,
money-losing casino in Hogansburg and assure lucrative operations
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their agreement specifies that Park Place must begin building a
casino within three years and that the tribe would get 70 percent
of the profits. Some Mohawks and gaming analysts say that Arthur M.
Goldberg, Park Place's chief executive, said he could get approval
for the project within four months, a claim they found improbable.

BONNIE ST. JOHN DEANE DELIVERS STORY OF INSPIRATION TO GIRL
SCOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Her family didn't have much money. Her leg
was amputated when she was 5 because of a birth defect.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie St. John Deane could have admitted defeat at an early
age.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving up, Deane never stopped pushing, never let an
obstacle get in the way of her goals.
</P>
<P>
   That perseverance led her to Harvard, to a Rhodes scholarship,
to jobs in the White House and on Wall Street, and to a career as
an author and motivational speaker. Not to mention silver and
bronze medals as a skier at the Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to more than 900 Girl Scouts on Wednesday at the
Crown Center Exhibit Hall, Deane, wearing her silver medal on a
ribbon around her neck, shared the story of her rise to show the
young women that they, too, could overcome obstacles on their way
to fulfilling their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you know how to overcome obstacles, you can go anywhere
you want,'' Deane told the Scouts and their troop leaders. ``If an
African-American girl with one leg, from San Diego, where there's
no snow, can get to the olympics, what is possible for you?
Anything must be possible, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Deane's speech was part of Sweet Ambitions 2000, sponsored by
the Girl Scouts of Mid-Continent Council. The event was a kick-off
for today's Take Our Daughters to Work Day, occurring at businesses
in the Kansas City area and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of trying to motivate girls,'' said Martha
Singleton, Girl Scouts spokeswoman. ``It's a celebration of girl
power. We want to prepare them for tomorrow and for their
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is especially important for girls on the cusp of
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research shows that's when girls' confidence really
diminishes,'' Singleton said. ``We want to build their options and
their confidence in their futures.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Spencer, a 10-year-old from Kansas City sitting right by
the stage for Deane's speech, was confident in her options. She
plans on becoming a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   And, said her mother, Suzy Spencer, Tiffany knew about
overcoming obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell her,'' Spencer said, ``winners never quit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' chimed in Tiffany, ``quitters never win.''

MRS. CLINTON AND GIULIANI AGREE TO TV DEBATE THIS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton
agreed Wednesday to what aides said was the first in what would be
a series of senatorial debates, accepting an invitation for a
statewide forum with Tim Russert, the host of ``Meet the Press,''
to be broadcast this fall on NBC affiliates across New York.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Giuliani and Clinton said details of this and other
debates remained to be worked out. But the agreement with Russert
appears to have moved the discussion about debates beyond the realm
of political jockeying and into the stage of actual negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Russert sent a personal letter to Clinton and Giuliani,
proposing two debates, one of which would be held Sept. 11 in
Buffalo, where Russert grew up. Giuliani and Clinton's campaign
manager, Bill de Blasio, agreed to the request in separate
conversations with Russert.
</P>
<P>
   Russert said some details, mainly having to do with format,
remained to be worked out, but he had no doubt that the event was
on track. ``From the very first day, both sides seemed very
optimistic and enthusiastic about debating,'' Russert said in an
interview. ``In my mind, both campaigns have accepted, and we're
very pleased. We look forward to very substantive, civil and
informative debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum, said the mayor
had agreed to appear on both debates proposed by NBC, one on Sept.
11 in Buffalo and the other on Oct. 30. They would be shown on
MSNBC, as well as on NBC's New York affiliates. Clinton has so far
agreed to one of those debates but has not specified which one. De
Blasio, in a letter to Teitelbaum, said he had also accepted an
invitation for a debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters,
which would be broadcast over ABC affiliates. The Giuliani campaign
had no immediate response to that offer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's advisers said Wednesday night that they were looking
forward to the debate, asserting that the mayor's experience in
politics and government would make him a formidable opponent to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be refreshing to have Mrs. Clinton in a setting in
which she is finally required to answer real questions without
ducking, bobbing and weaving,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's press secretary, Howard Wolfson, responded by alluding
to Giuliani's relative absence from the campaign trail. ``It'll be
refreshing if Mr. Giuliani is in a setting in which he begins to
talk about what he would do in the Senate and begins to offer a
positive view of what he would do in New York.''

PAY EQUITY SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a disconnect between what we say a job is worth and what
we're willing to pay someone to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Service companies tell their front-line workers they're the most
important customer relations agents they have _ and pay them the
least of any employees on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Our society claims to value its children and creates
organizations to keep child-oriented issues in the forefront of
public consciousness _ yet pays child-care workers barely a living
wage.
</P>
<P>
   We've spent decades talking about gender equality and wage
parity between the sexes _ but women's average earnings are just 73
cents on the dollar compared with men's.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of economic theories to explain why people are
paid what they are. Supply and demand is one. We've heard since
elementary school that the price goes up when the commodity is
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   That's supposedly why the highest of high-tech workers have been
able to write their own tickets in recent years as companies fought
over them. But, despite severe shortages, the theory hasn't boosted
teachers' pay similarly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the theory about paying what the market will bear.
We hear that from corporate compensation boards who explain the
``sun, moon and stars'' pay packages for their CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   In tough, competitive markets, company directors say they need
to pay top dollar for talent with a proven business track record.
Sales and stock prices are up, so the CEO is getting paid nothing
more than he (rarely she) is worth in terms of improved results.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side of ``worth,'' a story last month in The New
York Times highlighted a Vassar graduate who chose to be a
$37,000-a-year librarian. She lamented that fellow graduates ``are
investment bankers and lawyers and are making a quarter-million,
and I can't even afford to go out t dinner with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Is a librarian really worth that much less to society than
someone who decides where to put other people's money?
</P>
<P>
   That's oversimplification, of course, but it's worth serious
thought. We don't spend enough time battering down the pink-collar
ghetto that confines mostly female workers to lower-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the more familiar blue-collar sector _ largely and
historically male _ pink-collar jobs (such as child care) haven't
benefited from collective bargaining and market forces that pushed
blue-collar pay up to and, in some cases, beyond those of
white-collar professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the National Committee on Pay Equity sent out
press materials for its annual Pay Equity Day, the packet contained
a button that asked, ``Where's My 26 Cents?'' in reference to the
earnings gap between women and men.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the press packet sent in advance of the May 11
observation also held a button. This one asks, ``Where's Her 27
Cents?''
</P>
<P>
   Note that the earnings disparity rose by a penny on the dollar.
That's the wrong direction to bring pink-collar relief.
</P>
<P>
   Note, too, that the question is framed differently. At least
this year, someone other than the aggrieved is doing the asking.
It's a question everyone has the responsibility to ask.

NEW EFFORTS TO PROMOTE BEEF AND PORK
</HEADLINE>
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pork is still the other white meat and beef is still
for dinner, but the associations that created those long-running
campaigns are planning multimedia efforts to help freshen them up.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge that the National Pork Producers Council and the
National Cattlemen's Beef Association face is to get consumers
interested not only in their meats, but also in their ads, which
they have been seeing for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns seek to challenge consumers' perceptions, with
the pork ads hoping to position the meat as the ultimate solution
to meal-time monotony and the beef ads trying to bolster women's
awareness of beef's nutritional value.
</P>
<P>
   The new television and print campaign for pork is the most
significant since the introduction of the ``Pork. The other white
meat.'' campaign in 1987. The new effort continues to use that
slogan but plays off the ``other'' by featuring scenes in which a
consumer making a choice for dinner has to choose from the same old
thing or exciting pork.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have chicken fatigue, burger boredom and are tired of
pasta and pizza as alternatives,'' said Al Tank, chief executive of
the National Pork Producers Council, Des Moines, Iowa. ``We think
this campaign will make pork a real attractive and acceptable
alternative to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, created by the pork association's longtime agency,
the Chicago office of Bozell Worldwide, a unit of True North
Communications, is part of a multiyear effort, with spending
estimated at $25 million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The initial 30-second television commercial features a man
pondering menu options at a meat case in a supermarket. As he scans
the meat, the choices he is contemplating pop up on the screen: (A)
ground chuck, (B) chicken (again), (C) crablike meat product? and
(D) other. As he smiles, discovering pork, an announcer says,
``There is an alternative to the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, the opportunity really exists to
underscore that in fact pork's greatest virtue is that it is not
beef or chicken,'' said Mark Williams, senior partner for account
management and development at Bozell Chicago. ``The challenge is to
bring that to life creatively in a way that connects for
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The print portion of the campaign follows a similar creative
format. One ad features a woman in her car. As she is stuck in a
traffic jam, she thinks about what to have for dinner. Her four
options are (A) pasta salad, (B) cheeseburger, (C) bowl of cereal
and (D) other. Other is circled and a headline reads: ``Road rage
may have a direct correlation to one's limited dinner options.
There is a cure.''
</P>
<P>
   A second ad features a man peering into the refrigerator trying
to find something to eat. The four options: (A) chicken pot pie,
(B) Tuesday's Chinese take-out, (C) the previous Tuesday's Chinese
take-out and D) other. The headline reads: ``Meal monotony. The
leading cause of facial freezer burn. Visit your local supermarket
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots began on Wednesday on cable stations including the
History Channel and the Weather Channel, while four initial ads
will appear in the May issues of national magazines like Cooking
Light and Good Housekeeping. Besides television and print, the new
marketing plan includes a revamped Web site at
www.otherwhitemeat.com, as well as other initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The long-running pork campaign helped turn around declining
demand for the product 13 years ago and has kept it level since,
the association said. Williams added that the new effort was the
result of pork producers ``capitalizing on the progress that we've
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The council said the retail value of pork has steadily grown,
outpacing the rate of inflation. Production has increased 37
percent, while per capita consumption has climbed to 53.4 pounds
from 51.5 pounds and the United States has changed from being an
importer of pork to being a net exporter.
</P>
<P>
   For the beef campaign, the new cycle of ads represents the
return of a nutrition campaign after a 10-year absence. This time,
though, the ads are aimed at influencing women ages 25 to 54,
considered by the industry to be the ``gatekeepers'' of dinner
tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``After research revealed women's widespread misunderstanding of
beef's nutritional value,'' said Mark Thomas, vice president for
consumer marketing at the beef association in Denver, ``we wanted
to let women know that they can enjoy beef as a great-tasting
option that also fits a balanced diet.'' In describing the
marketing objective, he said, ``We want to make beef easy to choose
and easy to use for the target audience.''
</P>
<P>
   A new television effort, with billings estimated at $10 million,
was created by the association's longtime agency, the Leo Burnett
Co. in Chicago, a unit of the B Com3 Group. Two 30-second
commercials, which began running on Monday, continue to carry the
industry's long-running theme, ``Beef. It's what's for dinner.'' In
addition, the commercials feature familiar trademarks from previous
beef industry spots including the signature voice of the actor Sam
Elliott and music by the composer Aaron Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for one commercial is a classic steak house, which
are traditionally frequented by men. As two men finish looking at
menus and scan the room, they realize that they are completely
surrounded by female diners. One man says to the other, ``You want
to go? I feel a little ...'' and the other man finishes his
sentence, ``... out of place.'' The announcer states, ``Make room
at the table boys,'' then continues to advocate beef's nutritional
benefits like being a good source of iron, zinc and B vitamins. A
second commercial features a bride and her mother doing a
last-minute count of the meal responses for a wedding reception.
After the bride rattles off the count, totaling 99 to 1 for beef
against chicken, the spot cuts to the wedding reception, where a
disappointed bridesmaid is being served a chicken meal. She quickly
remedies her unfortunate situation by slyly switching her dinner
with another bridesmaid's beef meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted to tell women is, `Jump on the bandwagon, beef
is back,''' said Amy Haddad, vice president and creative director
at Burnett. She added that through focus groups the association
found that women ``love the taste'' of beef, but ``they just have
been not eating it because it's maybe out of vogue a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But once you tell them about these nutrients,'' she added,
``it's like giving them permission to eat it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the association had realized that ``changing
attitudes is not an overnight position.'' Nonetheless, over the
last year, he said, the price that people are willing to pay for
beef has risen, reversing a 20-year trend.
</P>
<P>
   The television spots will run on national cable stations
including A&AMP;E, Lifetime and the Food Channel, in addition to local
networks. A radio campaign promoting beef's nutrients will also be
introduced in local markets. The broadcast portion of the campaign
comes after print ads by Burnett, which have been in national
magazines since January. A separate print campaign focusing on
health professionals is also running; those ads were created by the
Sudler &AMP; Hennessey unit of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York. &QL;

BLACK LEADERS ASK HELP ON LIVERY KILLINGS
</HEADLINE>
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of religious and civic leaders who have long
ranked among the loudest critics of the New York Police Department
urged residents on Wednesday to help track down the killers of
livery cab drivers.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum organized by the New York State Federation of Taxi
Drivers, the speakers set aside their criticisms of the police.
They said that the overwhelming number of crimes against livery
drivers were being committed by young blacks and Hispanics who prey
on the providers of a vital transportation service and who must be
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Among the speakers were the Rev. Al Sharpton, U.S. Rep. Charles
B. Rangel, and the Rev. Herbert Daughtry of the House of the Lord
Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn. In the most passionate speech,
Daughtry asked residents of poor neighborhoods to stop harboring
killers, and to put out a message that criminals would be turned
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give them up, bro, give them up,'' he said. ``Tell them you
are going to give them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight livery cab drivers have been killed this year, and 19 have
been slain in the last 16 months. Almost all of the killings remain
unsolved. Fernando A. Mateo, president of the taxi drivers'
federation, said the crimes were a case of minorities killing other
minorities, and that almost all had been committed by residents of
the communities the drivers served.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a state of emergency in the inner-city community,''
Mateo said. ``We have a major problem, and it's time to assume
responsibility for our problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials were not invited to the forum. In attendance
were civic leaders who have demonstrated against the police over
the fatal shootings of unarmed men, and who have sought an
independent federal monitor over the 40,000-officer force. Marilyn
Mode, a police spokeswoman, said the police appreciated the gesture
of support.
</P>
<P>
   During the forum, word circulated that more livery cab drivers
were attacked in the darkness Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.
The police said none of the drivers were hurt, and one, Hemogenes
Cabrera, 27, was saved by a bulletproof barrier behind his seat,
which kept at bay an attacker who pounded on it with a knife during
a ride through the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxi and Limousine Commission passed a rule last week that
requires livery car owners to outfit their cabs with either a
partition or a digital security camera by next month, and the city
has allocated $5 million to help the owners pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said that livery cabs were a means to move about in
areas where yellow cabs did not venture. He described the drivers
as heroes who ``tread where others will not go'' and who are being
killed by ``traitors to our community.''

DEAL FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE CLEAN-UP HITS SNAG ON COST 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department's plan to hire a British
company to solidify liquid radioactive waste that has been leaking
from storage tanks in Washington State stumbled Wednesday night
when the Energy Secretary said an increase in the company's price
estimate was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson, said the company's
statement a few days ago that the cost of the project was likely to
be more than twice what it estimated 18 months ago amounted to
``unacceptable and unexplained budget escalation.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement is a blow to the company, BNFL PLC, which was
anticipating a multibillion-dollar contract. It also casts doubt on
how the Energy Department will deal with the site, the Hanford
nuclear reservation in Washington State, its most serious long-term
environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
   The leaky tanks contain 54 million gallons of liquids, sludges
and salts, holding about 60 percent of the radioactivity left over
since bomb-making began in World War II. Of the 177 tanks, 149 are
made of single steel shells, all of which have leaked or are
expected to leak. The remainder have two steel shells, and none of
them have leaked yet, but no one is sure of the effects of decades
of high radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The department had planned to privatize the project by having
BNFL build a factory at its own expense to mix the wastes with
extra-strong molten glass to stabilize it and seal it in stainless
steel canisters. The company would have been paid only for the
canisters it produced. But BNFL said a few days ago that the price,
which it estimated 18 months ago at at $6.9 billion, was now likely
to be $15.2 billion, including design, construction, financing and
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the latest estimate, Richardson said, ``These
circumstances raise serious questions about the capacity of BNFL to
carry out the vitally important job of cleaning up nuclear waste at
the Hanford site _ something which is a top priority for the
Department of Energy, the State of Washington and the people who
live in the vicinity of the site.'' The department has an agreement
with Washington State and the Environmental Protection Agency to
solidify the waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still very committed to working with the Department of
Energy,'' said Jeff Harvey, a spokesman for BNFL Inc., the American
subsidiary of the British company. ``We believe we have a proposal
and the technology and the team that can work.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson had previously begun a re-examination of BNFL's work
for the department because of problems that surfaced recently at
the company's main operation, the Sellafield nuclear complex in
England, where workers falsified documents on plutonium fuel
production.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's statement also complained that the company had
shuffled its senior management in Britain ``without consultation or
advance warning,'' and that regarding the Hanford project, the
company had ``chosen to conduct its negotiations in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   The department might look for other contractors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the leakage from the tanks has dumped radioactivity into
underground water, and from there, into the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   The tanks range in size from 55,000 gallons to one million
gallons. While Richardson's announcement Wednesday makes it less
likely his department will proceed with its plan, that plan itself
was not complete; engineers have not figured out how to handle the
wastes without producing benzene gas, which can burn or explode at
some concentrations.

PROMOTIONAL FEES BRING FINES FOR HARRAH'S AND SUSPENSION FOR
EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY _ Missouri gambling regulators alleged Wednesday
that Harrah's executives in North Kansas City solicited, accepted
and might have tried to cover up illegal promotional fees from beer
distributors for boxing matches and other special events.
</P>
<P>
   State liquor laws prohibit such fees, aimed at promoting any
brand of alcoholic beverage. Meeting in Jefferson City, the
Missouri Gaming Commission voted unanimously to fine Harrah's North
Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel $150,000 and to suspend for five days
the gaming license of its vice president and general manager,
Michael St. Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   The state said $50,000 of the fine was for the alleged
promotional payments and $100,000 for Harrah's lack of cooperation
in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's officials did not speak in their defense at the
meeting. But St. Pierre, who was traveling Wednesday, later said
Harrah's officials ``would not have knowingly or intentionally
violated any regulation or failed to cooperate with the commission
or its staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's has 30 days to appeal the penalty and request a Gaming
Commission hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to obtaining a better understanding of the
basis for the allegations and having our opportunity to provide an
appropriate response,'' St. Pierre said. Harrah's officials ``look
forward to having the opportunity to be heard on the matters raised
in these pleadings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Gaming Commission action against Harrah's and
St. Pierre, company officials ``knew it was a violation to enter
into such agreements.'' The commission said there were incidents
between 1997 and 1999 involving Harrah's and boxing promoter Tony
D. Holden, doing business as Holden Productions; North Kansas City
Beverage Co., a distributor of Anheuser-Busch products; and the
Coors Co. in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's top regional executives were apparently aware of the
arrangements, according to at least one internal Harrah's memo that
advised Anthony Sanfilippo, president of Harrah's Entertainment
Inc.'s central division, last fall that interests representing
Budweiser beer were paying $7500 per event for ``advertising
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   A regional Coors executive confirmed Wednesday that the contract
between Coors and Harrah's boxing promoter was signed by a company
official at Coors headquarters in Colorado. A Coors spokeswoman in
Colorado said the company was unaware of the charges and had no
comment at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Poole, a manager with North Kansas City Beverage, said
that company executives were not available Wednesday and that the
company would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mullally, deputy director of the Gaming Commission, told
commissioners that Harrah's accepted an estimated $30,000 to
$40,000 in unlawful advertising fees to promote various beer brand
names during special events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a substantial violation of law,'' Mullally said. The
prohibition against advertising fees ``is a well-known rule of
liquor control in Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullally also said Harrah's had refused to cooperate in the
investigation and still had not turned over some records the
commission had sought. Mullally said Harrah's was fined $20,000
last fall for failing to cooperate and provide records in an
unrelated investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Mullally also said state wholesale liquor regulators had been
alerted to the findings and could take action against the beer
distribution companies. The Missouri Gaming Commission regulates
and issues liquor licenses to casinos.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Taylor, chief enforcement officer for the Missouri Division
of Liquor Control, confirmed that his agency had opened an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In other news:
</P>
<P>
   - Commissioners approved Isle of Capri Casinos Inc. as the
preferred developer for the Boonville market. The unanimous
decision eliminated Five Trails Casino Co., operated by William
Grace, from consideration. The two companies had sought commission
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Isle of Capri officials said they hoped to have their Boonville
casino open by Labor Day 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Biloxi, Miss., Isle of Capri has taken over Davis
Gaming's long-delayed Boonville riverboat project on the south bank
of the Missouri River. The company recently bought out
California-based Davis' interest and will spend about $75 million
on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Isle of Capri operates 11 casinos in Iowa, Mississippi,
Louisiana and Colorado; a racetrack in Florida; and a gambling
cruise ship that sails from New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is in the process of buying the Flamingo Hilton
Casino in Kansas City from the Hilton Hotels Corp., and is seeking
commission approval for a project in the St. Louis market.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, who lost out in the Boonville market, is majority owner
of St. Jo Frontier Casino and lead developer of the $15 million
Mark Twain casino project in LaGrange, Mo., north of Hannibal.
</P>
<P>
   - Wednesday's meeting was the first for new commissioner Muriel
Battle, a retired educator from Columbia who was nominated by Gov.
Mel Carnahan and approved last Thursday by the Missouri Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Battle, 70, is a former teacher, principal and assistant
superintendent in the Columbia public school system. She is a
former chairwoman of the Lincoln University board of curators,
serves on the Stephens College board of trustees, and is active in
many civic and professional organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Battle replaces Jenice Stewart, the last of five original
commission members, for a term that expires in April 2002.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As the U.S. economic boom has spread like
kudzu, rural America's residents have seen more jobs and more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they have lost ground compared with families in cities.
</P>
<P>
   The per capita income of rural residents stood at $19,090 in
1997, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, compared
with $26,861 per capita for urban residents. Moreover, that income
gap widened by $935 over the five years studied from 1993 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The question, say some policy-makers, is whether rural America
will participate in the emerging digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any measure you choose, rural areas have a less-skilled
work force and a brain drain. How will those areas attract the best
and the brightest?'' asks Mark Drabenstott, vice president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and director of its Center for
the Study of Rural America.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which was created last year, will turn that ground
in a two-day conference, ``Beyond Agriculture; New Policies for
Rural America,'' which begins today at the Westin Crown Center
hotel. About 250 people are expected at the invitation-only
meeting, which will include a live video broadcast by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on ``The Outlook for Rural America
in the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is enamored with the center. A grass-roots
collection of ranchers and farmers from around the country think
the center is biased toward industrialized agricultural and against
small, family farms. They will respond with their own meeting this
weekend to formulate their vision for the future of rural America.
Their meeting at the Heartland Presbyterian Camp &AMP; Conference
Center near Parkville is expected to draw 30 to 40 persons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand all is for naught, if we can't convince the
voting public they have been lied to and globalization is not a
panacea. We have to make them understand that after they have
squeezed all of the blood out of the farmer, the consumer is
next,'' said Fred Stokes, a Mississippi rancher and president of
the Organization for Competitive Markets, a group that thinks food
conglomerates have a stranglehold on small farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The rural center's vision, Stokes said, is one in which ``some
farmers may own the farms, but big agribusiness owns the farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Drabenstott shrugs off the group's charges, saying the bank has
reported on the changes in agriculture without advocating for or
against policies. ``We have addressed some of the steps the country
might take to keep farmers in the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the fate of rural America has been entwined with
American agriculture, Drabenstott said. It is time to forge a rural
policy that acknowledges the needs of small-town America to
sometimes diverge from the fortunes of agriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure agriculture is not a victim in this
process,'' Drabenstott said. ``It will still be a part of the
puzzle but there is a realization growing that it is not the only
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives of groups such as the Nebraska Bankers Association in
Lincoln and the Iowa Rural Development Council in Des Moines say
the center gives an authoritative voice to their concern of
isolation from America's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with areas without access to the Internet or
where they do have it, residents and entrepreneurs who don't know
how to take advantage of it,'' said Beth Danowsky, executive
director of the Iowa Rural Development Council. ``One of the really
good things coming out of the center is that we now have a highly
credible organization bringing these issues to the forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's research shows that rural areas of the Rocky
Mountains, where outdoor amenities can attract young entrepreneurs,
have outpaced the rest of America in job growth, Drabenstott said.
Areas like rural Nebraska have failed to keep up. That lag is
decimating pastoral life in areas lacking in allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more agricultural communities are staring disaster in
the face,'' Drabenstott said. ``Their rural water, sewers, street
repairs are all piling up.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, rural areas are closer to inner cities than to suburbs,
says Richard Foster, vice president of the W.D. Kellogg Foundation,
which dedicates its funding to issues of rural life. Rural and
inner-city America have similar poverty rates, high school drop out
rates, drug use rates and rates of outward migration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have are all of these retirement communities that
don't even know they are retirement communities,'' said Foster,
during a trip to Kansas City. ``It is not that old people went
there. Young people just left.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation welcomes the spotlight that the bank conference
shines on rural problems. It also is providing public relations
assistance to the Organization for Competitive Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues Drabenstott sees facing most of rural America
is whether it will produce or can nurture entrepreneurs who
traditionally create businesses and jobs. Beyond friends and
families, where can the money be found to finance fertile ideas?
</P>
<P>
   Many believe technology, if extended to rural areas, could be
the great equalizer. That may require public underwriting like
rural electrification received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecommunications is the wild card,'' Drabenstott said.
``Will rural America get wired to the same extent as urban areas?
``How will e-commerce affect rural America? Will it filter out to
places like rural Kansas or will it serve only urban America?''
</P>
<P>
   Foster agrees wiring rural America will be essential to keep it
vibrant and connected to the rest of the world. But the foundation
also believes small farmers are the stewards of the land, and
``sustainable'' agriculture has as important a role to play in
feeding America as corporate farming, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rural America represents 80 percent of our geographic area and
23 percent of the population, but yet it is where all of the food
is grown,'' Foster said. ``We believe rural America has lost its
advocacy, but it is a national treasure and demands to be nurtured
and preserved.''

HITCHCOCK NOT BUYING THE SHARKS AS UNDERDOGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD AND MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The San Jose Sharks say they are the underdogs
against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, said Stars coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can blow the underdog status wherever you want to blow it,
but it's not going to sell,'' Hitchcock said. ``They just knocked
off the first seed and played one of the best games ever I've seen
a team play in a Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   With the likes of Bryan Marchment, Mike Ricci, Owen Nolan and
Mike Rathje littering the roster, it's easy to see how, too. The
Sharks play one of the most physical games in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made life hard for St. Louis. They were more than willing
to pay that price,'' Hitchcock said. ``There is a physical price to
play San Jose and we have to be willing to pay it.''  &QL; 
This is the reason
</P>
<P>
   If you were wondering why the Stars acquired Dave Manson and
Scott Thornton and called up Brenden Morrow, this series should
answer all of those questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks are a gritty team that doesn't mind getting physical.
Along with Derian Hatcher, Richard Matvichuk and now the
aforementioned trio, the Stars can match the Sharks pound for
pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the pickups knowing the price you have to pay,''
Hitchcock said. ``We made it for now and now's the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Stars now is not to be goaded into bad
penalties by the likes of Marchment and Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the problems St. Louis ran into is they
retaliated a lot, they let some people get under their skin, and
you can't do that,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``We've
played these guys enough to know what they're all about. We know
what they are going to do and, it's up to us to react in a proper
way.''  &QL; 
To play or not to play
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars are happy with the extended rest they received
for disposing of Edmonton in five games, they realize that the
Sharks have done something they haven't: played recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are probably going to be pretty crisp,'' Stars center
Mike Modano said. ``You play a seven-game series beating the number
one team in the league, you are going to have the current going
with you. The first game is going to be crucial to stop that. The
first 10 minutes will be crucial.''  &QL; 
Sloan is now available
</P>
<P>
   As members of the media surrounded Joe Nieuwendyk yesterday,
Stars winger Mike Keane casually sneaked in behind the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blake Sloan is now available for comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters spun around to see the hubbub at Sloan's locker, but
he wasn't there. In his place stood a life-size cardboard cutout of
``Mini Me'' _ the little man from the movie /Austin Powers 2'',
wearing a Stars cap.
</P>
<P>
   Who says the Stars aren't loose?  &QL; 
Backseat for NHL
</P>
<P>
   There are two days off between Games 3 and 4 in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   San Jose Arena already had an event scheduled for that night, a
Latin music concert.
</P>

   The Stars and Sharks shouldn't feel too bad, though. The
Washington Capitals had to schedule their first-round series
against Pittsburgh around a World Wrestling Federation event.

SMALL STEPS BY PETTITTE AND YANKS IN VICTORY OVER TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sean Bergman is a journeyman pitcher who contributes
generously to major league batting averages, but as the Minnesota
Twins thrashed the new York Yankees on Tuesday night, Bergman
challenged Derek Jeter with a fastball, right down the middle.
Jeter swung and missed, striking out, and he turned and gaped at
Bergman, shocked he didn't drive the ball.
</P>
<P>
   His desolate expression might as well have been the face of the
Yankees. They have been losing and don't know why. Joe Torre, their
manager, reminded them in a meeting before Wednesday's game against
the Twins that they are a team that builds victories in small
increments and with ample intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Those increments Wednesday included a strong five-inning
performance from Andy Pettitte, who was making his first start
since April 7, a remarkable throw from catcher Jorge Posada, and
home runs from Derek Jeter and Tino Martinez in a 2-0 shutout of
Minnesota, before 27,919 at a frigid Yankee Stadium. ``This was a
big win for us,'' Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees still haven't emerged from their collective
offensive slump, and they need improvement from the likes of David
Cone and Roger Clemens. Outfielder Paul O'Neill may be out of the
lineup in days to come, after departing in the third inning to have
tests on blurred vision in his right eye. But the victory prevented
the Twins from recording their first three-game sweep in Yankee
Stadium since 1968, and will enable the Yankees to think better of
themselves as they rest Thursday before beginning a three-game
series against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lost two of three games to the Blue Jays last
weekend, and games to the Twins Monday and Tuesday _ four losses in
five games _ and Torre saw frustration in their play, an
uncharacteristic anxiousness. The starting pitchers were getting
hammered, and in the face of early deficits, the hitters seemed to
be trying to do too much with their at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have to do this in small bits,'' Torre said, adding
that to do otherwise would be taking away from the Yankees'
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   A sign was posted on the Yankees' clubhouse door Wednesday
morning _ MEETING 12:00 _ and for about five minutes, Torre spoke
positively, calmly, cajoling gently, reminding the players that the
best teams emerge from slumps rather than drive themselves deeper
into them.
</P>
<P>
   For five innings, it was impossible to see whether Torre's words
made a difference. As Bergman had done Tuesday night, Joe Mays
stifled the Yankees, holding them hitless for the first three and
two-thirds innings. There had been a couple of two-out singles in
the fourth inning, from Martinez and Posada, before Shane Spencer
took a called third strike. The Yankees looked just as lifeless as
they did Tuesday night, as they have for the better part of a week.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte, having recovered from a strained back muscle, held
the Twins scoreless through the first five innings, pitching at an
accelerated pace, catching and throwing and catching and throwing
before coming into range of his 80-pitch limit in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson relieved him for the top of the sixth, and Cristian
Guzman laced a single to center _ a crisis, when the other team's
leadoff man reaches base late in the game and your men aren't
scoring any runs.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman took a lead against Nelson, who is not adept at holding
runners. Nelson threw a fastball far inside to Denny Hocking and
Guzman broke for second, but Posada did not know it; he hadn't
heard any infielders yelling to alert him.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's fastball forced Posada to lunge to his right, to
backhand the ball, and out of the corner of his eye, Posada saw
motion _ Guzman running. Without setting his feet, unbalanced,
Posada turned his shoulders and whipped the ball toward second
base, unsure whether anyone would cover the bag. Nelson couldn't
believe he had thrown the ball; the whole play seemed to be
happening in slow motion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson Delgado, the second baseman, was in position and
deftly caught the ball on a short hop. Guzman slid headfirst into
the tag, and Bob Didier, the Yankees' catching instructor, turned
to scouts sitting around him and said, ``That's all arm strength
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a crucial out, at a crucial juncture. ``Anything in a
game like that can open it up,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter led off the bottom of the sixth, feeling comfortable at
the plate. Even in striking out against Bergman, he had felt fine,
wondering only how he had missed the ball. Jeter fell behind in the
count, one ball and two strikes, fouled off a pitch, took another
outside. Mays threw a changeup down and away, a great pitch, after
five consecutive fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   And Jeter smashed it, reaching down, the ball carrying into the
right-field stands, his first home run at the Stadium this season.
Mays said later that it was most impressive piece of hitting he had
ever seen, how Jeter managed to drive a pitch out of the strike
zone so far.
</P>
<P>
   Three batters later, Mays challenged Martinez with a fastball,
right down the middle. Martinez slammed it over the wall, for a
second run that turned out to be more than enough for the Yankees'
bullpen. He rounded the bases with a serious expression cracked
only by the slightest smile: the old face of the Yankees, and on
this day, a new face for the Yankees.

EDITORIAL: JUSTICE AND STABILITY IN ZIMBABWE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 27:
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after he triumphantly led Zimbabwe to independence
from white rule in what had been Rhodesia, President Robert Mugabe
seems bent on driving his once hopeful nation into violent conflict
and economic ruin. Threatened as never before by a surging
multiracial opposition, he is seeking to preserve his corrupt
regime by unleashing the forces of lawlessness and racism. The
challenge for Zimbabweans now is to avoid being goaded into a cycle
of retaliatory bloodshed that can only end in disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, mobs allied with Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF
party have murdered at least nine opposition supporters and two
white farmers. Mugabe is flouting court orders to remove squatters
who have illegally occupied hundreds of white-owned farms. Instead
he has condoned the seizures and denounced the farmers as ``enemies
of Zimbabwe'' who are coercing workers to back the fledgling
Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that land reform is essential. Fewer than 5,000
white farmers, descendants of British settlers who stole the land,
still own more than half the country's best land while millions of
blacks scratch out a meager existence on barren communal farms. But
much of the land already purchased from whites has gone not to
landless peasants but to cronies of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Land is not the real issue for Mugabe. It is a political weapon
with which to divide and discredit an opposition movement that is
threatening to undermine his party's near-monopoly on power in
parliamentary elections later this year. Lawful land redistribution
would be a legitimate means of winning votes from rural peasants,
but violent coercion and racial scapegoating are a reckless
distraction from a disintegrating economy that now features 70
percent inflation, 50 percent unemployment and chronic fuel
shortages _ all compounded by a costly and unpopular war in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe seeks to portray the opposition as a conspiracy in which
blacks are being manipulated by unreconstructed white Rhodesians
bent on reviving the racist rule of Ian Smith. Smith has in fact
sought to exploit the current crisis to make a comeback. He has
been rejected by most whites, who instead are providing cash and
organizational support for Morgan Tsvangirai, an articulate trade
unionist who leads the overwhelmingly black opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, after five more oppositionists were beaten to death
this week by pro-government activists, Tsvangirai warned that his
followers would defend themselves against lawlessness, declaring
that ``We shall take this violence to their doorstep.'' That kind
of incendiary language will only invite further bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's fledgling opposition must not allow itself to be
lured into retaliating. But it will need support from neighboring
states and friends in the West if it is to stick to its course of
peaceful change. Last weekend the leaders of South Africa,
Mozambique and Namibia met with Mugabe at Victoria Falls and voiced
their support for his land reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Given their common inheritance of the legacies of racial
domination throughout southern Africa, their reluctance to isolate
Mugabe is understandable. But their countries also depend for their
own continued economic growth on stability in Zimbabwe. They should
be using all their influence, with Western support, to ensure that
Zimbabwe's opposition is allowed to compete without fear of further
bloodshed. Free and fair elections and respect for law represent
the best hope for both justice and stability. &QL;

NBA PLAYOFFS HAVE STARTED, OFFICIALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a sacred rite of spring, as much a part of it as blooming
flowers, blustery winds, chirping birds and disillusioned Clipper
players seeking asylum in some faraway venue where Donald T.
Sterling doesn't own an apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, has there ever been an NBA playoff series in which one
of the coaches, usually the one whose team is behind, doesn't
publicly denounce the officials?
</P>
<P>
   I knew before the current Los Angeles Laker-Sacramento King
debate that Rick Adelman, esteemed headmaster of the Kings, would
engage in such gamesmanship because I knew his center, Vlade Divac,
would be woefully overmatched against Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   And, sure enough, as soon as O'Neal dispensed his 46-point,
17-rebound, 5-block masterpiece Sunday in the Lakers 117-107
triumph over the Kings, Adelman loudly made it known that the
7-foot-1, 325-pound O'Neal was taking terrible physical liberties
on his cowering players and that the NBA officials were amiss in
letting him get away with such plunder.
</P>
<P>
   Adelman might have been reflecting on the work of the men who
officiated Game 1, but his comments were calculated to influence
the work of the men who will work Game 2 of the series that resumes
this evening at Staples Series.
</P>
<P>
   A man who has heard such rhetorical posturing before, Jerry West
actually finds Rick Adelman's eruption amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Shaquille O'Neal the one who gets fouled every time down
court,'' says the Lakers' top administrator. ``I think it was the
Kings who shot 35 free throws in the first game compared to only 14
for the Lakers. What he (Adelman) has to say doesn't disturb me.''
</P>
<P>
   What does disturb Jerry West is the widespread perception that
it's a preordained certainty the Lakers will dethrone the San
Antonio Spurs as NBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already heard the coronation of the Lakers as world
champions, and that's ridiculous,'' says West. ``All these games
are going to be difficult for us. The competition in the Western
Conference is fierce. For a team to even think that it has it made
can result in a loss of focus. Everything that you've accomplished
during the regular season can quickly be undone. Just look what
happened to the St. Louis Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers don't figure to lose their focus this spring, not
after being swept out of the playoffs the past two seasons, not at
a time when Shaquille O'Neal has clearly emerged as the most
dominant player in the league, not with a supreme motivator, Phil
Jackson, as their coach.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the St. Louis Blues, who had the NHL's best regular
season record, found out against the mediocre San Jose Sharks,
terrible things can happen in the playoffs to favored teams who
don't show up in prime form.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers might show up listless this evening against the
Kings, the refs might unconsciously react to Adelman's accusations,
O'Neal might get into early foul trouble, and Sacramento might
steal a game at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   You must understand there is a compelling reason for Rick
Adelman to diminish Shaquille O'Neal's monstrous opening-game
performance and shift the attention to the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics sometime do work.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1988 NBA finals between the Lakers and Detroit
Pistons, I was on the airplane carrying the Lakers back to Los
Angeles after they fell behind 3-2 in the series when Pat Riley
went into a lengthy dissertation on the injustices being
perpetuated by you guessed it the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in the final two games of that epic series at the Forum,
the Lakers were the beneficiaries of almost every big call,
including the biggest in the closing stages of Game 6 when referee
John Vanak whistled the Pistons' center, Bill Laimbeer, for a
phantom foul against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar that allowed Abdul-Jabbar
to make the game-deciding free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Riley proudly confided to me, ``You saw what happened
after I complained. Officials are human. Like all of us, they react
to criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting tonight to see if the officials react to
Rick Adelman's tirade, and stifle O'Neal's aggressiveness by
calling fouls against him when he's jostling for offensive
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a player in the league who gets hammered as much
as Shaquille,'' says West. ``Like I said, he gets fouled almost
every time he touches the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings do upset the Lakers tonight and O'Neal is plagued
by foul trouble, then it will be Phil Jackson's turn to harangue
those cursed souls in the striped shirts.
</P>
<P>
   But it's doubtful that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Adelman can complain all he wants about Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   But the ghastly reality for the Kings and Adelman is trying to
defend Shaquille O'Neal with Vlade Divac is scandalously
inequitable, a monopolistic practice I'm sure the
anti-trust-obsessed Justice Department soon will investigate. &QL;

   Amgen Wins Early Ruling
</P>
<P>
   In a drug patent dispute, a federal judge in Boston ruled that
two companies, Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis, had infringed
on an Amgen patent covering its leading drug, an anemia treatment
for patients undergoing kidney dialysis or chemotherapy for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, at a pretrial hearing, was an early victory for
Amgen, but analysts differed on how significant it was because the
trial will proceed, with Aventis and Transkaryotic having a chance
to prove that Amgen's patents are invalid. Shares of Amgen jumped
$2.9375, to $57.25. Transkaryotic fell $4.125, or 17 percent, to
$28.
</P>
<P>
   New Chief Seeks to Revamp Aetna
</P>
<P>
   William H. Donaldson, the new chief executive of Aetna, is
driving hard to transform the insurer into a consumer-friendly
company that makes more profits and fewer enemies. But he is under
pressure from shareholders who want quicker action to bolster the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon Loss Widens as Sales Grow
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the biggest retailer on the Internet, said that it
lost $308 million in the first quarter, five times its loss a year
earlier, but that its sales rose 95 percent, beating forecasts.
Excluding the cost of stock options, merger costs and some other
items, Amazon lost $122 million, or 35 cents a share, which was a
penny less than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks Fall Ahead of New Data
</P>
<P>
   Stocks retreated as investors awaited important economic data.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 179.32 points, or 1.6
percent, to 10,945.50. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 81.14
points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,630.09. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index fell 16.45 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,460.99.

<P>
   Snag Appears in Nuclear Waste Plan
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's plan to hire a British company, BNFL, to
solidify liquid radioactive waste that has been leaking from
storage tanks in Washington state stumbled when the energy
secretary said an increase in the company's price estimate was
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for Durable Goods Up 2.6 Percent
</P>
<P>
   Orders for big-ticket durable goods bounced back in March,
rising 2.6 percent, after two consecutive months of declines, the
government said. The number was helped by a substantial rebound in
transportation orders after Boeing reached a contract agreement
with 17,000 striking engineers.

   Building Business Slowly in Guyana
</P>
<P>
   Working to discard more than two decades of isolation after
independence from Britain in 1966, Guyana's economy has slowly

</P>
<P>
   McKesson HBOC, a leading drug distributor, said that it had

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Dunn likes to say he came in through the back
door.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Universoul Circus went to Miami and Dunn
seized the chance to realize a lifelong dream.
</P>
<P>
   Most circus clowns come from the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP;
Bailey Clown College, not from the local children's birthday party
circuit that Dunn had been working for 17 years. But like an actor
in community theater who dreams of Broadway, Dunn _ Onionhead to
those who like him, and those who do not _ lusted after a shot
under the big top.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, 58, took the only job available, assistant cook. As the
tour traveled he got a promotion, albeit to the tent crew. After a
year, he finally got to do some clowning, so long as he continued
to help with the tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the show was over I would grab a broom and start
sweeping,'' Dunn said. Today, the circus management does not let
him clean up. They want him outside, signing autographs and gently
teasing his fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Universoul Circus, which has pitched its big top in Brooklyn
through May 7, bills itself as the nation's only black-owned
circus. Cedric Walker, the chief executive and a founder of
Universoul, said he tries to showcase black performers and to
inspire a black, urban audience.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike many families, the Universoul Circus has become an
eclectic group of people. Although there was a black-owned circus
that toured the country in the early 1900s, a strong
circus-performing tradition never developed in black communities,
forcing Walker to search for his performers among Las Vegas variety
shows, eager amateur acts and overseas circuses after Universal
began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, Walker found Lucky Malatsi, 9, and Lunga
Buthelezi, 10, the contortionist and acrobatic team. In London, he
found Vicki Amedume, a 24-year-old trapeze artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many black circus families,'' Amedume said.
``Physical black people think about going into dance or sports. But
this circus opens people up to the idea they can do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Count among the inspired Saiydah Weems, 19. When the circus came
last year to her hometown, Cleveland, Weems took a job handing out
goody bags. By the end of the Cleveland run she was convinced she
wanted to become a performer. She drove to Detroit, the next stop
on the tour, and begged the owners to let her run away and join the
circus.
</P>
<P>
   Weems said she wanted to become the first African-American hair
hanger. The only problem was that Weems had never hung by her hair
before. So circus officials hired Elizabeth Rodriguez, whose family
has been dangling by its follicles for five generations, to teach
her.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Rodriguez had shown anyone outside her
family the trade secrets. Each day, she helped Weems hang a little
longer, building her neck muscles and her tolerance for pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get used to the pain, you have to learn how to be
graceful,'' Weems said. ``When I first saw it I thought, it's so
cool. I have long hair so I thought, what else can you do with it?
Why not hang from it?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, during the finale of the show, Weems' waist-length hair is
hooked to a rope and she is pulled 50 feet into the air, with
Rodriguez dangling beside her.
</P>
<P>
   Other performers have also benefited from professional training.
But some performers, including the Dragonmasters, a break-dancing
and gymnastics group from New Orleans, learned their tricks on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do comes from inside,'' said Anthony Coleman, a
member of the Dragonmasters who goes by the name Lil' Country. ``We
are street-taught, self-taught.''
</P>
<P>
   The message directed to black families at the circus is often
blunt: the ringmaster, Cal Dupree, urges young audience members to
sacrifice, have discipline and be obedient. And the finale is a
religious appeal, culminating with the appearance of a Jesus
character.
</P>
<P>
   Other acts are less overt. Dunn's performances as Onionhead are
a respectful lampoon of urban culture and stereotypes. He makes an
appearance as a self-important security guard, a sendup of the
inflated sense of power a badge can bring. He also appears as ``a
player'' in a pair of giant wingtips and an exaggerated zoot suit.
Other times, he plays an overconfident basketball player who is cut
down to size when someone steals his shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all people you see in the black belt, in the
ghetto,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the acrobats and clowns in Universoul, the circus
has been very rewarding, because black audiences can be more
effusive and enthusiastic, but also more demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban audiences are used to watching kids flip down the
sidewalk, so you have to go a step above in the ring,'' said Ameera
Matheny, 28, who has worked for Ringling Brothers and now works
with the animal acts at Universoul.
</P>
<P>
   Each afternoon, after the morning show crowd is ushered out and
before preparations for the night show must begin, a lull descends
on the circus.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Gabonese teeterboard troupe practiced refinements
to its act. The young contortionists were turned over to their
tutor so they could learn geography, as well as how to bend their
foot over their head and touch their nose with it. And the three
elephants _ Jan, Bunny and Marie _ rocked themselves back and forth
and then lay down for a nap.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunn, always in character and his face still in paint,
seemed unable to stop. As he walked by a line of people waiting to
buy tickets, he was spotted.
</P>
<P>

GRACE DOCUMENTS CONTAMINATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bizarre twist to the increasingly contentious relationship
between the Evironmental Protection Agency and W.R. Grace &AMP; Co.,
the agency says that two boxes of documents Grace provided to
investigators are themselves contaminated with potentially lethal
asbestos fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were provided by Grace in response to the EPA's
questions about where asbestos-tainted Zonolite ore was shipped for
processing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Grace shipped five boxes of documents to the
office of an attorney representing the company in Boulder, Colo.
When EPA investigators went to the office to examine the boxes,
they found that documents in two of the containers were covered
with a fine, tan powder. Peronard ordered that the dust be analyzed
before the documents were handled.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EPA, the analysis showed the papers were
covered with tremolite asbestos fibers, the same carcinogenic
material that sickened the miners and their families in Libby and
at the processing plants across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got this information last week and are having our
experts look at these tests that were done and the results,'' said
William Corcoran, Grace's vice president for public affairs.
``Until we know what this means, the boxes will be quarantined'' at
the law office, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the untainted boxes contained shipping papers which
helped the EPA to determine that more than 250 locations around the
country received the Zonolite ore.

MARGARET JONES, WWII OFFICER, DEAD AT 89 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margaret E.B. Jones, a retired Army major who served with the
only battalion of African-American women to serve overseas in World
War II, died April 11 at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington.
She was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Jones spent most of her adult life in military service and had
lived in Alexandria, Va., since 1980, said her husband, Everett
Jones, a retired Army major.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, Jones, then 2nd Lt. Barnes, was one of 31 officers who
accompanied more than 700 enlisted members of the Women's Army
Corps' 6888th Battalion when they were were sent to England. The
battalion had been formed after civil rights organizations and
black newspapers complained that the military was not using
African-American women in meaningful jobs.
</P>
<P>
   When it arrived in Britain, the battalion was told to sort
through piles of mail that filled two hangars in the countryside,
said Charity Adams Earley, who was the battalion's commanding
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Earley said that white women serving in Europe were working as
drivers for officers or doing other tasks equivalent to their male
counterparts, and the women of the 6888th had hoped for the same
kinds of duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us that if we were going overseas, we would be given
assignments men had,'' she recalled from her home in Dayton, Ohio.
``That was a fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in the sealed orders they received, which they were not
permitted to open until the planes carrying them to Britain were in
the air, they learned they would be assigned to the postal unit.
But soon, Earley said, the women realized how vital their new job
was to troop morale in wartime Europe. The women moved 3 million
pieces of mail in three months, much of it letters sent to soldiers
who had been transferred, had died, or been scattered after the
D-Day assault in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``To move the mail with them was a really tough job,'' said
Judith Bellafaire, curator of the Women in Military Service for
America Memorial in Washington. ``They worked in 24-hour shifts and
they cleared that mail out and were credited with raising the
morale of the troops. They have a lot to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was in charge of public relations for the battalion, which
broke records for the amount of mail it distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mail, which had been sitting in storage for months,
contained spoiled cakes and cookies, and there was even a package
of steaks a mother had sent to her son overseas, Earley recalled
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Ellen Barnes was born on Jan. 7, 1911, in Oberlin,
Ohio. Her mother, Margaret Sallee Barnes, was active in community
and civil rights groups, and her father, James D. Barnes, worked as
a chef. Her mother's parents had been slaves in Kentucky, and she
raised her children to value education and to stand up for their
rights.
</P>
<P>
   After three years at Howard University, where she later received
a bachelor's degree, Margaret Barnes joined the military in 1943 at
a time when it was racially segregated and there were few places
for women. She signed up for the same reasons many men did at that
time, said her husband: ``She wanted to do something for her
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones became one of the first African-American women
commissioned as an officer in the Women's Army Corps. At the time,
African-Americans were limited to 10 percent of the overall troops,
said the Army Center of Military History. When 400 women were
accepted as officer candidates for the WACs, the 40 black women
became known as the ``Ten Percenters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordered to Fort Breckenridge, Kan., after her basic training,
she became the executive officer of a company that consisted of 175
black women. Even though many of the women had college educations,
they were assigned to cleaning floors and latrines in the hospital
and working in the post laundry. Jones complained to a superior
officer, and persuaded him to reassign them to other duties,
according to a book about the 6888th Battalion, ``To Serve My
Country, To Serve My Race,'' (New York University Press, 1996) by
Brenda L. Moore.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Major Barnes returned to Howard to complete her
degree, and she did graduate work in American history at the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   She was recalled to active duty in 1949, and placed in command
of a training company at Fort Lee in Virginia. After her marriage
in 1953, her husband was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in
Maryland and she to Fort Belvoir. Later they were both sent,
separately, to France, and then she was assigned as a special
services officer in Kansas. She retired as chief of administration
at Maison Fort in France and later accompanied her husband to a
post in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband.

INDIAN TRIBE PROPOSES A DEAL ON LAND IT SEEKS TO RECLAIM
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying they wanted to extend an olive branch in their
long-simmering land-claim dispute with New York state, the Oneida
Indians said Wednesday that they would not, given the right
conditions, seek to evict or demand rent from 20,000 landowners in
central New York.
</P>
<P>
   The offer _ which will have to be accepted by the state and two
upstate counties to become effective _ is the latest twist in a
case that has dragged on since 1970, when the Oneidas filed a claim
to more than 270,000 acres near Rome and Utica. The claim was based
on the tribe's contention that state and local governments
illegally seized Indian lands 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That claim was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1985. But not much
happened until 1998, when the federal government sided with the
Oneidas and filed an amended complaint naming 20,000 owners of land
the Oneidas claimed as defendants _ setting the stage for a charged
atmosphere of distrust and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the Oneidas have said that they have no
intention of physically seizing anyone's land. And while most
residents have said they do not believe that their land will be
taken, they have long been bothered by the notion that the Oneidas
could do just that at any time. So now, with the case expected to
move to trial soon, the Oneidas have made their strongest statement
yet to try to allay those fears, saying they will do their utmost
to shield owners of private land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landowners in this region have endured nearly a year and a
half of uncertainty over their future,'' said Ray Halbritter, the
chief executive of the Oneida Indian Nation, in a statement. ``We
hope that the steps we have taken today will end that
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the offer is merely lip service or a serious gesture,
though, is something that all parties said late Wednesday they
still needed to determine.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Oneidas filed two documents with Judge Neal P.
McCurn of U.S. District Court in Syracuse: the first was a
stipulation in which the Oneidas pledged to give up their rights to
seek any damages from private owners of land they claim is theirs.
The second was a request to separate the state from the landowner
defendants, and have the case seeking hundreds of millions of
dollars in damages and other relief from the state proceed first.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was made contingent on New York state and Madison and
Oneida Counties agreeing to certain conditions, including not
arguing that the stipulation is tantamount to the Oneidas dropping
the entire land claim.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the counties were not impressed. Among other
problems, they said, was their concern that separating the
defendants would deprive the counties of involvement in the legal
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first reaction is that we are very disappointed,'' said
Ralph J. Eannace Jr., the Oneida County Executive, and Rocco J.
DiVeronica, chairman of the Madison County Board of Supervisors, in
a statement. ``To provide true relief, the claims against
individual landowners have to be removed permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials, meanwhile, had a mixed reaction. Michael
McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George Pataki, repeated Pataki's calls
that the federal government withdraw from the lawsuit altogether.
At the same time, though, McKeon said that ``if the rhetoric of the
press release is matched by reality, then we will give it serious
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Koziol, a Utica lawyer who has become a de facto legal
representative for many of the affected landowners, said that
although he was wary of the Oneidas and the state, the offer did
contain a sliver of hope. ``It is a step in the right direction,''
he said, ``but ultimately the landowners want to see that the
clouds be removed altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government continues to oppose the eviction of the
landowners while maintaining the hope that a fair settlement can
still be reached, said James F. Simon, a deputy assistant attorney
general.

JUDGE RECOMMENDS CLOSING OF TIGER PRESERVE
</HEADLINE>
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey's Tiger Lady lost another round on Wednesday in her
effort to keep and exhibit the big cats on her property.
</P>
<P>
   An administrative law judge upheld a decision by the New Jersey
Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife not to renew the license of the
woman, Joan Byron-Marasek, to operate the Tigers Only Preservation
Society, in Jackson Township.
</P>
<P>
   Finding that the compound in which 26 tigers live is
``unsanitary and rat-infested'' and that Byron-Marasek failed to
keep adequate records or cooperate with state inspectors, the
judge, John R. Tassini, recommended it close.
</P>
<P>
   He gave Byron-Marasek ``a reasonable period of time'' to move
the tigers to properly licensed compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Under New Jersey law, the commissioner of the State Department
of Environmental Conservation has 45 days to accept, modify or
reject the administrative judge's decision. If he accepts it,
Byron-Marasek could appeal the ruling to the state appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Byron-Marasek nor her lawyer, Valter Must, could be
reached for comment on the ruling or on any plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-page ruling, which included details of the zoology and
morphology of tigers, is another chapter in a yearlong effort by
state officials to close the preserve. In the 24 years that
Byron-Marasek has owned the compound in the south-central part of
the state, the once rural area has become more heavily populated,
and the preserve is now hemmed in by subdivisions and commercial
development.
</P>
<P>
   The compound came under scrutiny in January 1999, when a
4-year-old, 431-pound tiger wandering in the area had to be killed
after the police were unable to sedate it.
</P>
<P>
   The tiger was found close to Byron-Marasek's compound and to
Great Adventure, a theme park that also keeps tigers. A check of
the park and its records found all of their tigers accounted for,
but similar efforts to check Byron-Marasek's property and records
were met with denials that the tiger was hers. Neither Wednesday's
ruling nor other efforts by state inspectors have conclusively
determined where the tiger came from.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Tassini found that although the licenses approved
over the years for the preserve had specified that the tigers were
for theatrical and educational use, there were no indications that
they had ever served any such use.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the legal battle over the renewal, Byron-Marasek has
conceded that her motivation is a passion for the animals and their
survival, not a wish to exhibit them educationally or theatrically.
Her property, she once said in an interview, was to be a sanctuary
for the tigers.

`SNUBBED' JACKSON, LAKERS READY FOR GAME 2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Their forced vacation over, the Lakers
resume pursuit of the NBA championship tonight, armed once again
with the time-tested methods of the league's (ital)second(end
ital)-best coach.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson pushed, prodded and psyched up the Lakers, coaxing
a 67-win season out of a band of former underachievers. But he lost
out Wednesday to Orlando Magic rookie Doc Rivers for Coach of the
Year honors, as voted by the media.
</P>
<P>
   Just what the Sacramento Kings needed: Jackson snubbed on the
eve of Game 2 of the first-round playoff series, his preeminence
called into question. But Jackson saved his indignation for someone
else's snub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was extremely upset,'' Jackson said, ``because I personally
voted in The Sporting News for Jerry Sloan as Coach of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the league-sanctioned vote, Sloan, the Utah Jazz's longtime
coach, finished fourth, with two votes.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers, who guided a team of afterthoughts to a 41-41 record,
just missing a playoff berth, won the media poll with 60 votes.
Jackson was second with 53.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson bested Sloan's Jazz in the 1997 and 1998 Finals and
believes his rival deserves more credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy that's had his team at the top for the last decade
and has never won Coach of the Year,'' Jackson said. ``And he's
taken a group of aging veterans that everybody's claimed was on
their last legs three years ago and has again manufactured over a
50-win season. ... That he would get (only) two votes is absolutely
ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte's Paul Silas got three votes. Getting one vote each
were Miami's Pat Riley, Phoenix's Scott Skiles and Toronto's Butch
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all pretty surprised,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``We
felt like (Jackson) had it in the bag, really. But Doc did an
excellent job with that ballclub down there. I don't think anybody
expected them to have the season that they had. So he deserves
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, few predicted the season the Lakers have had _ a
league-best record, second all-time in franchise history. Winning
streaks of 16 and 19 games. A sustained dominance long expected but
never seen when the team was coached by Del Harris or Kurt Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think P.J.'s the perfect fit for this team, what this team
needed,'' Bryant said. ``He's very sharp on the court. Off the
court, he understood people, he knew how to talk to people and how
to relate to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The tasks handed to Jackson and Rivers were starkly different,
``apples and oranges,'' as Jackson noted.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's charge was to take a winning team with two superstars,
Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, and forge it into championship
material. Rivers just missed the playoffs despite starting four
players who went undrafted by the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers are going to win basketball games and it's just a
matter of at what level are they going to play,'' Jackson said.
``So in one area, you're talking about working with talent, in
another area, you're talking about working with potential, and Doc
as brought potential out in these players, which is big. ... Doc
did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bryant, it appeared Jackson was penalized for having better
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny, because if a coach struggles, it's, `Man
he doesn't know how to handle all that talent.' Then when a team
wins, it's all, `Well yeah, it's talent.' So it's kind of a
catch-22 situation. But I don't think P.J. cares about it much, to
be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson indicated as much, joking with reporters, ``You guys are
the ones that vote for it, why should I care one way or the
other?''
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers look to go up 2-0 in their first-round playoff
series _ following a three-day break _ Glen Rice said the team can
get Jackson a better award than Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how he didn't get it,'' Rice said, ``but we
can go out and get the championship for him.'' &QL;

BEHIND THE NEW FACES AT WORK TODAY  
</HEADLINE>
   By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attention, young women of Take Our Daughters to Work
Day: time to meet your maker, Nell Merlino.
</P>
<P>
   Is she committed to the equality of women? Absolutely. Have a
few stories of girl discrimination? Hey, wait till you hear her on
the Dukakis campaign and the Archdiocese of New York. Looking to
the future? Why do you think her press agent called us to do a
story? (No, we cannot explain press agents. It would be too cruel.
Let us put it this way: Merlino is doing something important and a
person to whom she paid money called it to the attention of every
paper and television network in America. This is one of the brutal
realities of journalism, kids. We don't just stumble on these
stories.)
</P>
<P>
   Another brutal reality, regarding Take Our Daughters to Work
Day:
</P>
<P>
   It was a gig. An assignment for pay, the pay being $45,000. Not
that Merlino, 47, doesn't care, because she does, but coming up
with programs that will create social change happens to be her
business. Strategy Communications Action Ltd., it's called. Merlino
has created programs to combat domestic violence; she worked with
the U.N. World Conference on Women in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the way it worked with Daughters was that eight years
ago the Ms. Foundation, concerned about the findings that girls in
early adolescence suffer a loss of self-esteem, asked Merlino if
she could create some sort of public education campaign. She
developed and promoted the program for several months. Last year,
19 million girls participated in the program.
</P>
<P>
   So we can really say one woman started it all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' says Merlino, an exuberant woman who talks not just in
streams, but in geysers, gushers, and who lives and works in a
spectacular Chelsea loft that is itself a life lesson. ``But I
would also say I don't think any of these things are one person.
One person may write the script, but then it takes hundreds of
thousands to make it come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The professional options Merlino was told would be hers growing
up in Trenton?
</P>
<P>
   None of those wonderful opportunities you girls take for
granted!
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Joseph P. Merlino, was a New Jersey state senator,
her mother, Molly McGoogan Merlino, an artist and housewife. In
elementary school, at the Blessed Sacrament, girls were given three
career choices: mother, teacher or nun. Merlino knew only that she
wanted to be ``kind of in charge, to be the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Merlino graduated from Antioch College, worked as a union
organizer, in state government in New York, as an advance person in
the presidential campaigns of Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis.
Typical assignment: being sent to a city to pull together a rally
of 40,000 in five days.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, she quit political work. ``Working on a
presidential campaign is exciting, but long term, it's not very
satisfying,'' she says. ``Someone would ask me what to do, then
they would turn around and ask some 20-year-old boy. It's still
very much a boy's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the end of the Dukakis campaign, she went into
business for herself, a move, she says happily, that enabled her to
own a wonderful apartment. Her new project is count-me-in, a
nonprofit Internet organization (www.count-me-in.org) that will
provide business loans of $500 to $10,000. Women across the country
will be asked to donate $5. Merlino is not consulting on this one,
she is the co-founder and president and will get a salary.
</P>
<P>
   Having made her name with Take Our Daughters to Work, Merlino
could handle all sorts of accounts. Why pursue women's issues?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I care that little girls end up feeling crummy about
themselves and make less money than the boys?'' Merlino says,
annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   No, not why it's an important issue, why does Merlino care?
</P>
<P>
   She goes back to her political work, on the Dukakis campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have Secret Service look at me and ask when the guy
in charge was going to be there. I had the man who was in charge of
public relations for the Archdiocese of New York tell me he'd
negotiate with me when I could be ordained a priest; telling me, in
effect, you're not a man. We were having a discussion about where
the photographers would be for an Al Smith dinner. He said, `I'll
negotiate with you, young lady, when you can become a priest.'''
</P>
<P>
   Steamed. ``This was in a room full of Secret Service agents and
priests and he calls me, young lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to a spokesman for the archdiocese were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   A happier subject: How does Merlino, who is married but has no
children, spend the day she created?
</P>
<P>
   A smile in her voice, now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to Grand Central Station and watch everybody coming in
with their girls. It's mind-boggling, it knocks me out. You see
thousands of them, all different ages, all different jobs. In the
morning they look spectacular, at the end of the day their hairdos
are askew, they're tired. They look just like the grown-ups. It
makes me cry. It makes me cry.''

CYCLIST'S RECYCLED CAREER GIVEN BOOST WITH WIN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRISCO, Texas _ There will be no compromise, vows Erin Hartwell,
the only American male cyclist to medal at consecutive Olympiads.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwell, who secured his silver and bronze medals in track
cycling's sprint events, will become a force as an endurance rider
or leave the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't flounder in this,'' Hartwell said. ``I'll either get
to the top of the game or I'll quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartwell's triumph last night in the men's individual
4,000-meter pursuit final during the U.S. Olympic Track Cycling
Trials suggests prospects for a successful transition.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwell, known better as ``Erv,'' covered the 4,000 meters with
a winning time of 4 minutes, 38.002 seconds to beat Michael Tillman
(4:47.390) at the Superdrome in Frisco and resurrect a career
derailed by injury and sustained by will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a strong person,'' Hartwell said. ``I didn't get to the
top in my event by being weak-minded, so I'm using the same
approach toward the endurance side. Hopefully, I'll make it ... or
I'll die trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Torn meniscus cartilage in Hartwell's left knee prevented him
from training for five months during 1999, and surgery and
rehabilitation did not restore the knee's explosiveness that
sprinters require. That prompted Hartwell's transition from sprints
to endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give myself probably two years and see if I can
get to a good European level and then take that next step,''
Hartwell said. ``If within two years I cannot get to there, then
I'm going to have to make some decisions on coaching and schooling
and some other things I'm interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hartwell labeled this performance ``a start.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I win the Olympic Games in an endurance event or a World
Championships or become a Division I professional rider, I won't
consider myself a success in the transition because I was at the
top level in sprint cycling in Olympic and World competition,''
Hartwell said. ``So, until I'm at that level in endurance, it's
definitely not a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartwell, 30, captured an Olympic silver medal in the
1-kilometer time trial at the 1996 Atlanta Games and the bronze in
the event at the '92 Barcelona Games. His performances at the World
Track Cycling Championships produced five silver medals and two
bronze in the 1-kilometer time trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwell won't settle for less as an endurance rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in this to fail,'' he said. ``I have aspirations in
this sport. I have every expectation to become one of the best in
the world in endurance events and show that sprint cyclists can
make the transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Reed earned the No. 1 seed for today's women's 200-meter
sprint finals with a time of 11.609 seconds during last night's
qualifying time trial. The top 12 U.S. riders advanced to today's
round of 12 and included Nos. 2-6 seeds Tanya Lindenmuth (11.805),
Christine Witty (11.869), Tammy Thomas (12.103), Nicole Reinhart
(12.141) and Suzanne Marshall (12.524).

IT'S SIMPLE: LAKERS WANT A SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ As difficult as it was to get through three
off-days between playoff games, the Lakers' next goal is to earn a
six-day break. If they sweep the Sacramento Kings in this
first-round series, that's what awaits them.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what else happens, the NBA (read: NBC) won't let the
second round begin until next weekend, May 6-7. With a victory
tonight at Staples Center, the Lakers would be in position to sweep
the Kings on Sunday at Arco Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely want to try and put this team away,'' Glen Rice
said. ``If it comes down to being a sweep, then we'll settle with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lakers won Game 1 by 10 points, they know better than
to expect an easy series, however. Sacramento, an unexpected
playoff team in 1999, pushed the Utah Jazz to five games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year they got blown out by Utah in the first game, came
back the second game and were ready to play,'' Kobe Bryant said.
``So we expect it to be another war. You have to know your
opponent. And they play with that type of attitude, that they have
nothing to lose, very emotional, just come out and play hard. ...
You don't want to stretch a series out to be longer than what it
should be. It's imperative for us to defend our homecourt and take
it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson wasn't shy about his goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to sweep the series,'' he said. ``I'd like to sweep
the championship. I'd like to go 15-0. The less you have to play,
the better off you are in the playoffs. The more you have to play,
the more chance of injury, the more excruciating it becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT TIME: Maybe a six-day break next week isn't a great thing
either. The Lakers didn't enjoy the three-day layoff this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think guys are just a little bit antsy, a little bit
agitated,'' Bryant said. ``We're tired of beating up on one
another, so our tempers are naturally a little bit shorter than
what they normally are, because we're so ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson blasted his team for a lousy day of practice Tuesday but
seemed pleased with their focus Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good practice today, short and right to the point of
what we wanted to do,'' he said. ``I think we're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE: The Kings' scoring output (107 points) and shooting
percentage (.435) in Game 1 both exceeded the average for Lakers
opponents this season (92.3 and .416). The Lakers would prefer a
defensive stand to a scoring contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to kind of pack our defense up and play like
we've been playing all year long, because Sacramento is so up and
down, you don't have a chance to set up,'' Bryant said. ``So it's
important for us to just kind of slow them up and not let them get
easy baskets all night. The score can be deceiving. I mean, they
can score 107 points, but yet still taking them out of what they do
on a consistent basis, and that's run up and down and get layups
all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   OUCH REPORT: Reserve center Travis Knight (flu) returned to
practice after a two-day absence and Jackson expects him to be
available tonight. &QL;

REDS WIN AS MET WIN STREAK ENDS 
 
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was obvious from the first couple of Cincinnati
Reds batters on Wednesday night that the Mets' nine-game winning
streak would end, and probably emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   The knuckleballer Dennis Springer started the game with a
fastball to Pokey Reese that went for strike one, but Reese
singled. Then Springer started Dmitri Young with a fastball, but he
left it over the middle of the plate, and Young clubbed it deep
into the left-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Reds had a 2-0 lead for their best starting
pitcher, Denny Neagle, and the Mets never came to life. In
persistent rain and wind and with a game-time temperature of 43
degrees, the Reds prevailed, 12-1, at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those games that kind of started out on the
wrong note, and then got worse,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets sold 33,371 tickets, but the conditions kept most fans
away. Those who came had little to cheer. Their most robust roar
was for the pitching coach Dave Wallace, who emerged from the
dugout in the top of the seventh inning with the Mets trailing,
7-0. It was a signal that Springer had sacrificed enough and would
be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets needed innings from Springer last night; their best
relievers had been used often during the winning streak, and the
long reliever Pat Mahomes was unavailable because he started on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Springer undertook the task gamely, pitching six innings and
facing three batters in the seventh. He allowed 13 hits and 8 runs,
walking 4 and throwing 2 wild pitches. The hits and runs were
season highs for a Mets starter; Springer and reliever Rich
Rodriguez had to ``take one for the team,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to try to eat it up and help the team out as far
as giving some of the guys a night off,'' Springer said. ``If it
were a 2-1 game, I'm not out there still. You realize you've got to
take it to help some guys out.''
</P>
<P>
   After their two-run first, the Reds scored one run apiece in the
second, third and fifth innings to take a 5-0 lead. It could have
been worse: they left six runners in scoring position in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, with one out and Rey Ordonez on first, Valentine
let Springer bat. Valentine said he felt Springer had to go more
than five innings. Springer struck out against Neagle, who fanned
nine battes in seven innings and allowed two hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't ideal conditions, by no means, but he did it,''
Springer said of Neagle. ``It wasn't pretty, but we weren't going
to win tonight. He threw a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace went out to get Springer after the game unraveled in the
seventh. A Sean Casey double bounced in front of left fielder
Rickey Henderson, then caromed off his shin. The next hitter, Ed
Taubensee, buried Springer's next pitch over the right-field fence
for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez relieved Springer after a walk, and with two outs,
Young bashed a ball over the head of center fielder Jay Payton.
Young doubled and singled after his homer, and he ended up a few
feet short of hitting for the cycle when Payton and Ordonez
combined to throw him out trying for a triple.
</P>
<P>
   The only drama remaining was whether Ken Griffey Jr. would join
the Reds' hit parade. Griffey struck out three times in his Shea
debut on Tuesday and was hitless in three at-bats against Springer
last night.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey dropped a single into right field in the eighth, and
the Mets' fans, who have had so much to cheer lately, officially
had nothing to smile about.
