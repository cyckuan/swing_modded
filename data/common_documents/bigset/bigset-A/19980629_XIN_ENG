<HEADLINE> Corner Kicks Important Goal-scoring Tool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Corner kicks have become an increasingly
important goal-scoring in the World Cup finals, FIFA Co-ordinator of
Techinical Study Group Jurg Nepfer said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of goals scored directly with or immediately after a
corner kick has risen to 39.5 percent among the so-called "standard
situations" in the group competition from 13.3 percent in the same
phase four years ago in the United States, the Swiss said.
</P>
<P>
The standard situations include corner kick, direct free-kick,
throw-in and penalty.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen goals were netted in this way in 48 group matches as
compared to only four in 36 game in the last edition.
</P>
<P>
The matches also saw more involvement of midfielders in attacks in
front as they had scored 37 percent of goals, a substantial rise from
about 25 percent four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nepfer also pointed out that although most goals were still scored
from a distance between goal area and penalty spot as they were in the
United States, more goals were scored from inside the goal area.
</P>
<P>
About 26 percent of the goals were blasted from inside the goal
area, a rise from 16 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Late goals also dominated the group matches here, with as much as
28.6 percent of goals netted from a span of 76th to 90th minute while
four years ago the figure was 16.1 percent.

President Clinton's tour of the Great Wall made a dozen Chinese
and American plain-clothed security people, both men and women,
very busy. So there was practically no sightseeing for them and,
if any, they had all the same to be on high alert.
</P>
<P>
When President Clinton and his party left the Wall section at
Mutianyu, the security people were relaxed and at ease. And at the
proposal of their Chinese counterparts, they were happy to pose for
pictures together against the backdrop of the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
The security men of both countries worked in close cooperation
during the Clintons' stay in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
-- Sorry, Cops, I Took "Dinner Invitation Card" for "Great Wall
</P>
<P>
Coverage Permit"
</P>
<P>
This morning, seven to eight American reporters were kept out
of the entrance of the Great Wall section at Mutianyu, since they
did not bring along the pass permit with them. But they were eager
to cover the Clintons' tour, and they were at a loss what to do.
</P>
<P>
The reason was that they do not know a singled word of the
Chinese and mistakenly took tonight's green invitation card for
dinner for their green permit to tour the Great Wall, as the two
kinds of cards very much resembled each other.
</P>
<P>
Finally, these reporters were allowed to follow the president
only when they won the approval of the Chinese Foreign Ministry
and the U.S. embassy after consultations.

<HEADLINE> Annan Desires to Defuse Tension in South Asia: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy Alvaro de
Soto said here Sunday that Secretary General Kofi Annan was
concerned over the rising tension in South Asia after India and
Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary general is concerned about the turn of events
that occurred in the region and that is why he has taken unusual
steps by sending me here," Soto told reporters after meeting with
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan.
</P>
<P>
Soto said Annan is keen to visit the region yet the dates have
not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
"I had very useful talks with Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub," he
said. "I shall be reporting to the secretary general promptly."
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the Foreign Office, during the
talks, Gohar welcomed the U.N. envoy's visit as representing a
first step towards an effective and sustained engagement by the
U.N. on the issue of peace and security in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Soto expressed the secretary general's desire to defuse
tensions in the region through resolution of the problems
bedeviling the relations between Pakistan and India, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
Soto, who came here from Bangladeshi capital Dhaka Sunday
morning, will also call on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and deliver
a message from the U.N. secretary general.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Sharif two weeks ago, Annan
expressed the desire to send his special envoy to Pakistan and
India in a move to help resolve disputes between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The envoy would make arrangements for his visit to the region,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has welcomed the secretary general's move while India
refused to receive the envoy as it opposes any outside mediation
on the disputes between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina just concluded her
brief visits to India and Pakistan. Hasina also expressed
willingness to mediate between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Bestows Honor on Tutu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President
Jacques Chirac Sunday decorated archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairman
of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), with
the Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor, France's highest award
for non-heads of state.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who was on a three-day state visit here, bestowed the
honor on the tiny cleric at a breakfast attended by about 10
South African personalities in Cape Town, a report reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Chirac also presented South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki with the honor.
</P>
<P>
He paid tribute to Tutu, a Nobel peace prize laureate, for his
role in fighting for reconciliation in a new democratic South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said Tutu was "a man who was and is the conscience and
inspiration of South Africa."
</P>
<P>
The TRC special tribunal was set up in 1995 to bring to light
the grave human rights violations committed on all sides in the
apartheid days, and to grant amnesty to those who repent.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said the award was encouragement for the new South
Africa. He thanked the French people for their support to South
Africa during the struggle for freedom.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was due to leave Cape Town on Sunday afternoon for the
Mozambican capital of Maputo on the third leg of his six-day tour
of southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's four-nation tour started with a 24-hour stop in the
western desert nation of Namibia and will end with a trip to
Angola.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Says Kosovo War Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. presidential envoy for Cyprus
Richard Holbrooke has warned the crisis in Serbia's southern
province of Kosovo could develop into war.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Kosovo situation as "explosive", Holbrook told
the Athens newspaper "To Vima" on Sunday that clashes between
Belgrade and the ethnic Albanians seeking independence from
Yugoslavia could "at any moment develop into war".
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo war, the envoy said, if spread, could bring Greece at
the doorstep of its own involvement in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
While calling for a peaceful resolution to the Kosovo crisis,
Holbrook said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would
not rule out military means to end the problem.
</P>
<P>
At least 300 people, most of them being women, children and the
elderly, have been killed in the conflict since February.
</P>
<P>
The presidential envoy siad that the peaceful resolution of the
Kosovo crisis through a change in the status of the region, but
within the present borders of Yugoslavia, was perferable, but
warned that if necessary, the NATO would not sit idle, as in the
case of Bosnia early in the decade.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has refused any external intervention into the Kosovo,
saying it a domestic affair.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Learn From Uganda's AIDS Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of Gender in
the President's Office Oppah Rushesha-Muchinguri will next week
lead a delegation to Uganda to study how Kampala has managed to
lower the levels of HIV/AIDS infections among its people.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will include officials from the ministry of
health and child welfare, representatives from the National AIDS
Control Program (NACP), youths and other organizations involved
in the fight against the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the Zimbabwe News Agency over the weekend
that the delegation was going to study Uganda's success story and
see how its programs could be applied to Zimbabwe's situation.
</P>
<P>
Uganda was ranked the country with the highest numbers of
HIV/AIDS infections in Africa in the early 1990's and it has
since embarked on programs to conscientize people on the scourge
and the numbers of recorded infections haved drastically dropped.
</P>
<P>
''This week-long trip should be able to help us because we
have a problem that needs political will if the country is to
survive,'' Rushesha-Muchinguri said, adding, ''so basically we
are going to study the Ugandan situation and how they managed to
turn their situation around.''
</P>
<P>
According to the current estimates, an estimated two million
Zimbabweans are infected with HIV in a country of about 12.5
million people. About 700 people said to be dying every week
from AIDS.

PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Michael Schumacher led a 1-2 finish
of his Ferrari team to win the title of the French Grand Prix in
Magny Cours of France on Sunday.

He closed within six points of Mika Hakkinen with half the
season to go. Hakkinen still leads the drivers standings with 50
points while Schumacher moved up to 44.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher's Ferrari teammate, Eddie Irvine, acting a a buffer
between Schumacher and Hakkinen for most of the race, came in

A frustrated Hakkinen in a McLaren-Mercedes was third, barely
behind Irvine after trying to pass him for the last 15 laps of the
race.
</P>

It was the first 1-2 finish for Ferrari since the Spanish Grand
Prix in 1990 when Alan Prost and Nigel Mansell took the top two
slots for the red cars.

LENS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Host team France needed 110 minutes and a
golden goal to beat the tough Paraguay team in a World Cup round of 16
match on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The French team went into the game as the favorites and they did
enjoy great advantage during the match.
</P>
<P>
But without their star playmaker Zinedine Zidane due to
suspension, the French team could not play their passing game
effectively and failed to convert any of the scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
Thierry Henry could have put France 1-0 ahead at the 39th minute
but his shot hit the bar and rolled outside.
</P>
<P>
The French goal-keeper Fabien Barthez was also forced to put up
several saves by the Paraguay counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
After the regulation time, the French team launched desperate
attacks on the Paraguay goal, expecially when the game was near its
end. Blanc slamed home a heading pass from David Trezeguet at the
110th minute to put the host team through to the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
The goal is the first ever golden goal in the history of World
Cup finals since FIFA adopted the "sudden death" rule for the first

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects Netanyahu's Proposal for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Sunday denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
proposal for holding an international conference as an attempt to
change the basis of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Gaza, Arafat condemned Netanyahu for
trying to evade Israeli commitments to the signed peace accords by
proposing another international conference on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He urged Netanyahu to respect the principles laid down in the
1991 Madrid Middle East peace conference and implement the Oslo
accords.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Hasan Asfour accused Netanyahu of
trying to kill the peace process. "The only thing he (Netanyahu)
takes seriously is killing the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Saturday on a Spanish newspaper,
Netanyahu suggested Europe host a Madrid II conference to revive
the multilateral Israeli-Arab talks to tackle Mideast regional
issues, but not the Israeli-Palestinian peace deadlock
specifically.
</P>
<P>
The Madrid peace conference, convened in 1991 under the
auspices of the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, created the
framework for subsequent bilateral and multilateral talks between
Israel and its Arab neighbors. It also formulated the landmark
land-for-peace principle, the cornerstone of the current peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's proposal was swiftly rejected by Egypt and Syria,
which charged him for attempting to torpedo the peace process by
overturning all the exiting principles and agreements.
</P>
<P>
Even back home, Netanyahu's proposal came under fire from
both the coalition and opposition politicians.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Yitzhak Levy, head of the far-right
coalition partner National Religious Party, said there is no need
to convene another conference and efforts should be concentrated
on the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The leading opposition Labor Party's lawmaker Yossi Beilin said
Netanyahu proposed the idea only to "manipulate the media and the
public" by distracting their attention from the implementation of
existing agreements.
</P>
<P>
He added that Netanyahu knew well that there was no chance of
success for his proposal, because no country would attend such
conference.
</P>
<P>
Another opposition lawmaker Yossi Sarid, leader of the Meretz
Party, also said that Netanyahu's proposal would not succeed
because "no country will go to Madrid or elsewhere while the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are deadlocked."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio Sunday, Netanyahu defended
his proposal, saying it was aimed at complementing the American
initiative and not replacing it.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Palestinians for holding up progress in the peace
process by refusing to honor their commitments. But he predicted
that the long overdue second Israeli troop redeployment in the
West Bank would be completed by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled since
early last year, and the present sticking point is Israel's delay
in carrying out the second redeployment. The U.S. is now pressing
Netanyahu to accept its proposal for a 13.1 percent pullback in
order to revive the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Caution U.S. Against Vetoing Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians Sunday cautioned
the United States against vetoing an Arab draft resolution at the
United Nations Security Council on denouncing an Israeli plan to
expand the authority of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. exercises the veto power, then it will be showing
its "overt tilt" towards Israel, Palestinian ambassador in Cairo
Zohdi al-Quddra told the Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to debate on Tuesday the
draft resolution outlined by the Palestinian National Authority
and supported by the Arab League, which calls on Israel to refrain
from unilateral actions.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has the "right to resort to the Security Council to
halt the implementation of Israel's decision to expand the
boundaries of Jerusalem and alter its status," al-Quddra said.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the Israeli cabinet approved a plan which will set
up an "umbrella authority" for Jerusalem over eight West Bank
Jewish settlements to the east, north and south of the city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian diplomat criticized the United States for its
"puzzling" stand on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. has denounced Israel's decision, it objects
to the PNA's lodging an official complaint with the Security
Council to address this grave violation, al-Quddra said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. to pressure Israel to rescind the "foolish
decisions," warning against an explosion of the situation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can imagine what the Palestinian and Arab reaction
would be if (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu carries
out his expansionist schemes in Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under agreements signed between the Palestinians and Israel,
neither side should take unilateral actions to change the status
of Jerusalem, whose issue will be negotiated in the final status
talks for a permanent agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Arab League has started a drive to secure the
endorsement of the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls for Anti-drug Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Sunday called for cooperation between Iran and Colombia in efforts
to combat drug trafficking, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Colombian Parliament Speaker Carlos
Ardila Ballesteros, Khatami said fighting narcotics is one of the
areas in which the two countries can exchange experience and
expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Considering it as a human and Islamic duty, Iran spends
significant amount of energy and resources to prevent trafficking
of drugs to European countries," the official news agency quote
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khatami termed narcotics as one of the major threats to Iran,
saying his country has sacrificed many lives in combating the
menace.
</P>
<P>
Iran launched nationwide anti-drug campaigns in 1989 when it
adopted a strict anti-drug law.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country seized some 195 tonnes of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that Tehran and Bogota can also cooperate within
the Non-Aligned Movement, noting that Iran seeks peace and
tranquillity for the mankind.
</P>
<P>
He called for respect for the rights, dignity and equality of
all nations.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, "we should prove that the future
world is one with no masters and one which heralds equal rights
for all nations," he said
</P>
<P>
The Colombian parliament speaker stressed the importance of
expanding Bogota-Tehran ties.
</P>
<P>
"All developing countries should come together to prevent
formation of a unipolar world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros arrived here Friday and has since held talks with
his Iranian counterpart Nateq Nouri, Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and other senior officials.

Glenn Hoddle said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Experience will count a lot in the second round and especially in
the game against Argentina," said Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
The coache said he did not consider it as an opportunity to revenge

the '86 match, when he won the game with his famous hand-ball," he

"I'd simply like to redress the balance - I'm still convinced that
Argentina wouldn't have won 2-0 without this golden hand-ball," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said he was fully aware of Argentines' ability to control
the flow of the game, which will be held in Saint Etienne on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> UN Observer Mission Leader Replaces Beye to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Military leader of the U.N.
Observer Mission in Angola Kofi Obeng will replace Blondin Beye
as temporary chairman of the Joint Commission on Peace Process
to mediate peace in the country, the commission said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a light aircraft carrying U.N.
representative to Angola Beye crashed Friday evening near
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire on his tour of five western African
countries to enlist support for the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
At a special session here, the commission urged the U.N. and
the international community to explain the reason why Beye's
plane had crashed.
</P>
<P>
Beye was a great architect for Angola's peace and when
mourning over him, the commission will redouble its efforts to
mediate in Angola to fulfill Beye's dream of achieving national
reconciliation in the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
Beye had been en route to Abidjan from Togo in his five-nation
tour to discuss the halting peace process in Angola, and he was
feared dead in the accident and rescue workers in Cote d'Ivoire
resumed their efforts to reach the wreckage Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Beye headed U.N.-led talks in Zambia to end Angola's 19-year
civil war in 1993 and helped to broker a peace treaty between
the government and the rebel movement UNITA which was signed in
November 1994.
</P>
<P>
He then helped to oversee the implementation of the treaty,
acting as mediator between Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos
Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The commission urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to name
a new U.N. envoy to Angola to replace Beye as soon as possible to
reduce the influence of Beye's death on Angola's peace process.
</P>
<P>
"If the news is true, then it is a tragedy, but we are still
committed firmly to the peace process," a senior UNITA official
said here Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Demands Iraqi Explanation of Assassination of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran renewed its demand to Iraqi
government Sunday for clear explanation of the assassination of
two Iranian Shiite leaders in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The demand was put forward to the Iraqi charge d'affaires Saleh
Samarmad by the Director General of the Persian Gulf Department of
the Foreign Ministry Ali Aghsar Hojji, the officials news agency
IRNA reported .
</P>
<P>
Since April, two Iranian Shiite Muslim leaders have been killed
by unidentified gunmen in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ayatollah Sheikh Morteza Boroujerdi was gunned down in the
Shiite holy city Najaf on April 22 while performing evening
prayers. In a similar attack on June 19, Ayatollah Sheikh Mirza
Ali Gharavi and three others were shot dead on their way to Najaf
from Karbala.
</P>
<P>
Hojji told the Iraqi diplomat that Iraqi government is
responsible for protecting the lives of Shiite leaders and other
Iranian nationals residing in Iraq, the IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He urged Iraq to shoulder its responsibility to apprehend those
perpetrators and prevent the repetition of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
Samarmad expressed sorrow over the assassinations on behalf of
the Iraqi government, saying that a top level committee has been
formed in Iraq to investigate the cases. He promised to arrest and
punish those who were responsible for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Following the killing of Gharavi, Iran swiftly lodged a protest
to the Iraqi government over the repeated violence against Shiite
leaders, warning a repetition of such incident in future will
damage the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war between 1980 and 1988 that
was triggered by territorial and religious disputes. Iraq is a
Sunni Muslim-dominated country, while Iran is largely a Shiite
Muslim state.

</P>
<P>
Jean-Yves Audouin, Prefect of the Loire region, said the police
force stationed in Saint-Etienne will be increased to 1,500 from 900

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams Clinton's Report to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 28 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi official spokesman
Sunday criticized a report submitted by U.S. President Bill
Clinton to the U.S. Congress on Saturday for attempting to prolong
U.N. sanctions and interfere with Iraq's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman of the Ministry of
Culture and Information as saying that Clinton reiterated
U.S. government's aggressive stance against Iraq and threatened to
use force against the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing Washington for prolonging the
U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Clinton has renewed his government's
insistence on keeping in place the no-fly zones in north and
south of Iraq, in collaboration with the British government.
</P>
<P>
This is an illegal action that does not have the authorization
of the Security Council, only representing a defiance of the
U.N. Charter and all international laws, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman criticized Clinton for trying to justify his
government's decision to maintain military presence in the Gulf
under the name of ensuring the mission of U.N. arms inspections in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"It is now crystal clear that these troops have not been
ordered by the United Nations or other countries. They have been
sent to the region to threaten Iraq's security, establish an
international terrorist force against Gulf countries and impose
U.S. hegemony over the region's oil, as part of the overall
U.S. policy of pursuing hegemony over the world," the spokesman
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Angola Shocked at Beye's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio
de Moura said Sunday that he was shocked by the plane crash which
killed Blondin Beye, the United Nations special envoy to Angola.
</P>
<P>
However, he told the press during a mediating mission in
Guinea Bissau that although Beye's death will affect greatly the
Angolan peace process, the prospect for Angola is bright.
</P>
<P>
"If the news is true, then it is a tragedy, but we are still
committed firmly to the peace process," said a senior official
from the opposition National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Portugal, one of the observer nations of the Angolan peace
process, also made a rapid response to the accident. Its
President Jorge Sampaio expressed his deep condolences to the
death of Beye, saying he had devoted his last moments to the
national reconciliation cause of the Angolan people.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo Sunday paid tribute
to Beye, saying in a statement that Beye had a passionate desire
to promote the best interest of all Angolans.
</P>
<P>
"If it is so, may his untimely death further galvanize the
forces of peace at this critical stage of the peace process in
Angola," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
Beye left Angola on Friday for a visit to five African
countries, namely Sao Tome &AMP; Principe, Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon
and Burkina Faso, to seek support for Angola peace process from
their leaders.
</P>
<P>
On his way from Lome to Abidjan, his plane crashed on Friday
evening several kilometers away from the Ivorian commercial
capital.
</P>
<P>
Also on the plane were his spokesman, two political advisers,
a Portuguese officer, one of his Nigerian guard and two South
African pilots. The plane was rented by the United Nations from
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Angola News Agency Sunday quoted a report from Abidjan as
saying that rescue people went deep into the wreckage spot after
finding it Saturday in a swamp near Abidjan and discovered
several bodies near the wreckage, which were hardly recognizable.
They also spotted Beye's passport and the passports of several
others.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, no survivor is found. A rescuer said 40 hours
after the plane crash that there is little possibility for
survivor as time draws on.
</P>
<P>
Residents near the crash venue said the Beechcraft 200 which
carried Beye crashed after it caught fire.
</P>
<P>
After the crash, the United States, Portugal, Russia and the
United Nations called on the Angolan government and UNITA to
honor Beye by carrying out the peace accord he spent the last
years of his life implementing.
</P>
<P>
"The best tribute the government and UNITA can pay to the
immense efforts and sacrifices of Maitre Beye and his colleagues,
is by rededicating themselves to lasting peace and genuine
reconciliation in Angola," they said in a statement issued in
Luanda and at U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Chief Kofi Anna, also said, "in this difficult time, I
once again appeal to all Angolans, in particular the government
of unity and national reconciliation and UNITA, to continue to
cooperate closely with the U.N. and to bring the peace process to
the earliest conclusion."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Defends Conservative Judiciary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- In a move to defend the judiciary,
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Sunday criticized
"certain persons, political groups and newspapers" for their
efforts to weaken it, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of judicial officials, Khamenei said that
any efforts aimed at weakening the judiciary is "irresponsible and
against the interest of the (Islamic) system."
</P>
<P>
Terming the judiciary as a pillar of the Islamic system, he
said that it provides Iran with security, justice, rule of law,
tranquility and social order.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader praised judiciary head Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi as "one of the most reliable and zealous clerics" in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, meanwhile, called on the judiciary to remove its
"undeniable weak points" in enforcing justice so that the people
will feel rest and calm.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's remark came after the judiciary came under fire of
the moderate groups and the media, which have called for Yazdi's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
The moderates have accused Yazdi and his conservative body of
trying to weaken the government of President Mohammad Khatami
after the judiciary insisted on putting the moderate Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi on trial on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi's case was believed to be politically motivated by
the conservatives with an aim to avenge the disgraced defeat of
the conservatives in the presidential elections in May last year
because of Karbaschi's support for Khatami.

</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a one-day meeting in Saudi capital

<HEADLINE> Kuwait not Against Iraqi Presence at Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said Sunday Kuwait will not oppose
Iraq's attendance at a proposed Arab summit on the peace process
so to facilitate the summit's convening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in the Saudi capital Riyadh,
Al-Sabah pledged that Kuwait would not block any effort to hold an
Arab summit to discuss the Middle East peace process, the Kuwait
News Agency reported .
</P>
<P>
He noted that Kuwait has been attending the Arab League
meetings and "its seat is only a few steps away from the Iraqi
seat".
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait and all other member states of the Gulf
Cooperation Council -- Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates -- support the proposal for holding an Arab
summit.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the proposal put forward by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat for holding an Arab summit to confront the
Israeli intransigence that has stalled the peace process for over
15 months.
</P>
<P>
Most Arab countries have agreed to attend such summit, but no
agreement has been achieved due to the differences among some Arab
countries over what stance should take toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah said the failure of the effort to convene an emergency
summit could lead to the deterioration of the situation in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
But he suggested that the summit should be first coordinated
among Arab states bordering Israel, since they are the parties
involved in the peace process. Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria
are the countries that bordering Israel.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah's statements clarified earlier reports that Kuwait
might oppose holding an Arab summit if Iraq, which invaded Kuwait
in 1990, is invited. Many Arab countries believe that Iraq should

<HEADLINE> Greece Never to Stop Supporting Cyprus: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stefanopoulos said on Sunday that his country would never stop
supporting Cyprus in its efforts to regain integrity, and
safeguard freedom and independence.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Cyprus at Larnaca airport after a four-day
visit, Stefanopoulos told reporters that "the Cyprus problem is
Greece's top priority."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island to protect the Turkish Cypriot minorities after a failed
coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Greek president stressed that during his visit, he tried to
send "a message of friendship and reconciliation" to Turkey. He
voiced hope that Ankara will listen to it.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds with each other over, among
other things, the issue of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Stefanopoulos said that apart from Turkey and Turkish Cypriots,
he also tried to send a message to the international community.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to stress the great responsibility of the
international community for Cyprus, because it has not done what
it should and could have done for justice in Cyprus," he said.
</P>
<P>
The world community, including the United Nations, has been
striving to help reunify the island in a bizonal and bicommunal
formula. But so far, no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Seeing Stefanopoulos off at the airport, Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides stressed that the people of Cyprus have realized
that "Greece and Cyprus walk together and will fight from the same
trenches for justice."
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriots have also realized that "there is close
cooperation between the governments of Greece and Cyprus and
between their political leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We all stand on one point: that we will fight for freedom,
democracy and the rights not only of Greek Cypriots but also those
of our Turkish Cypriot compatriots," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Specifies France's Africa Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac said France wants to cooperate with all African countries
and would allow Africans to solve their problems by themselves.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with South African national television, the
SABC, Chirac denied that France was trying to expand its "sphere
of influence" in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said the word "sphere of influence" was right in the past.
"I would say, instead of sphere of influence, areas of
friendship."
</P>
<P>
In the interview broadcast Sunday night, Chirac said France's
Africa Policy is to extend its area of friendship with the rest
of Africa while maintaining its traditional relations with French
speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally we have very close relations with francophone
countries. We of course keep the same relations with francophone
countries.
</P>
<P>
"But we also want to extend our area of friendship. We want to
cooperate with the other countries of Africa, and specially with
southern Africa, and specially with the engine of Africa of
tomorrow, which is South Africa."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that France and South Africa would not be rivals
on the continent. He said South Africa's influence would increase
in the rest of Africa and that was good.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no rivalry between France and South Africa. We
want to participate hand in hand with South Africa in partnership
to help countries in Africa."
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa would become a very powerful country in
the world, one of the main countries in the world. "The world is
to be a multi-polar world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about France's stand on an international peace-keeping
force in Africa, Chirac said: "In general, we think that Africa's
problems should be solved by Africans."
</P>
<P>
"If Africans decide to have an international (peace-keeping)
force, and if they ask us to help... we would agree completely.
But that is their decision, not ours."
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, we didn't support the American proposition,"
said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The United States failed to persuade African countries into
setting up a U.S.-led peace-keeping force in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said France also had different views with the Americans
on debt relief.
</P>
<P>
He said international and bilateral assistance is a necessity
to show solidarity with poor countries.
</P>
<P>
"That's why we fight for aid, not only for trade, and we win."
</P>
<P>
"We are in a world with globalization, which is a good thing,
because it allows rapid development. But this situation is also
dangerous, because poor countries may become poorer and poorer
and rich ones, richer and richer."
</P>
<P>
Asked about his position on an Organization of African Unity
(OAU) resolution on U.N. sanctions against Libya, Chirac said:
"France is not in favor of sanctions in general, today."
</P>
<P>
The OAU resolution demanded the suspension of U.N. sanctions
immediately. Should the suspension not be in place by July, OAU
members reserved the right to ignore the sanctions, according to
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said it was always the poorest people that fell victims
of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations with South Africa, Chirac said France
supported a free trade agreement between the European Union and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the signature of the agreement between the European
Union and South Africa will be done before the end of the year."
</P>
<P>
He said France supported South Africa's bid for a permanent
seat on the United Nations Security Council. He also promised to
import more South African goods to seek a trade balance.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Reach Quarterfinals in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAINT-DENIS, France, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Denmark reached the last
eight in the World Cup finals by beating Nigeria 4-1 at Stade de
France here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Denmark will meet defending champions Brazil in the quarterfinals
in Nantes on July 3.
</P>
<P>
Striker Peter Moller put the former European champions ahead only
three minutes into the game, slotting the ball home past Nigerian
keeper Peter Rufai after receiving a pass from Ajax Amsterdam striker
Michael Laudrup.
</P>
<P>
Moller, who plays with Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, was also involved
in the second Denmark goal when he blasted a powerful free kick in the
12th minute.
</P>
<P>
Rufai parried it out but Brian Laudrup, Michael's younger brother,
surged ahead to score in the box, making it 3-0 for Denmark before
break.
</P>
<P>
Ebbe Sand scored what could be the fastest goal for a substitute in
the competition so far by tapping home a Michael Laudrup pass less
than 30 seconds after stepping onto the pitch in the 60th minute.
</P>
<P>
Udinese midfielder Thomas Helveg netted the fourth Danish goal from
within the box in the 76th minute but Nigeria answered two minute
later with a goal from substitute midfielder Tijani Babangida.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had a scoring chance in the 28th minute, when defender
Okechukwu Uche lobbed the ball over the bar after Peter Schmeichel
deflected a Nwankwo Kanu header.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Jay-Jay Okocha squandered opportunities twice in a span
of six minutes when he shot the ball over the bar in 33rd and 39th
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Schmeichel was kept busy in the last ten minutes of the game when
the Nigerians rallied strongly.
</P>
<P>
Both Rasheed Yekini and Okocha shot the ball too high.

<HEADLINE> French Bank Opens Beijing Branch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Banque Nationale de Paris
(BNP) officially opened its Beijing branch here today.
</P>
<P>
BNP is one of the world's leading international banks with more
than 2,000 branches and 60,000 corporate customers worldwide. It
ranks as the top French bank in serving large corporations and
financing international trade.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's opening ceremony, Levy-Garboua, chief
executive of international banking and finance of BNP, said that
BNP's business presence in China dates back to 1860. In the 1960s
it became a correspondent bank of the Bank of China and set up
representative offices in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
BNP has developed close links with major Chinese banks and
corporations, particularly as they were expanding abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Levy-Garboua said BNP has built a strong presence in China with
four fully operational branches in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Guangzhou
and Beijing, as well as two representative offices in Shanghai and
Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
During the last 15 years, BNP's total commitment to China has
been constantly growing, he said. The bank has participated in the
financing of such major projects in China as Daya Bay nuclear
power station and the Three Gorges Dam. BNP also is one of the
major financing institutions for the country's airline and
shipping companies.
</P>
<P>
"BNP has been a major investor in China over the past few years
and this branch in the capital was a very important step for our
organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As evidenced by our past and present achievements, our
strategy in China is not opportunistic. We have a clear and strong
willingness to expand our activities in this country with a view
to the long term, because we believe in its extraordinary
potential and bright future."

<HEADLINE> Water Pollution in China Serious, Top Legislator Says  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Water pollution in China is still
serious, with quality deteriorating and shortages worsening,
according to a top legislator.
</P>
<P>
Zou Jiahua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, China's highest legislative body,
today made the remark at a meeting on enforcing the Law on the
Prevention and Control of Water Pollution.
</P>
<P>
"There may be a serious water crisis in China in the early
years of the coming century if no effective measures are taken in
law, economy and technology," Zou stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zou urged the governments and administrators at various levels
not to lower their guard on water pollution but to have a sense of
imminence and crisis.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to ensure the country has a safe and healthy water
environment and sustainable water supply, Zou said that government
officials should approach the issues of prevention and control of
water pollution, as well as the protection of water resources,
from the high plane of survival and development of the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Ministry of Water Resources, the
average per capita availability of water resources in China is
about 2400 tons annually, only a quarter of the world
average. China is considered one of the poorest countries in terms
of water resources.
</P>

With an ever-increasing population, the per capita availability
of water resources and water supply should continue going down,
the ministry report states.
</P>
<P>
Out of more than 600 large- and medium-size cities, nearly 400
are short of water and more than 110 are in desperate need of
water, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, it states, there is a need of water totaling 16
million tons daily. Some 30 billion tons are in short supply
annually for agriculture. This causes a loss of 230 billion yuan
in industrial production, and a grain deduction of 20 billion
kilograms every year.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko Urges Implementation of Stability Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia must put the stabilization
program proposed by the government into practice, Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko said on Monday after meeting with President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not do so, the state security and integrity of the
country will be threatened," Interfax news agency quoted Kiriyenko
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he and the president had discussed
"comprehensive measures that the government should take to speed
up the implementation of the stabilization program".
</P>
<P>
Numerous economic steps have to be taken, on which the
stability of the budget is contingent, Kiriyenko said.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to cooperate with parliamentary committees and
groups.
</P>
<P>
The program must not be a point of contention between the
government and the Duma because it is not ideologically colored,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The stabilization program, which was designed to ease the
tensions in the financial market in the short term and establish a
stronger economy, was initially proposed by Kiriyenko on May 29
and submitted to the State Duma last Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was discussed at an extended meeting attended by Kiriyenko,
government ministers and parliamentary leaders on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parties Urges Int'l Support Over Border Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The nine leftist parties of
Nepal on Monday wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, appealing for international support against "encroachment
and intrusion" of Nepalese territory by India.
</P>
<P>
The letter, which is to be handed over to Annan via the U.N.
office here, said that India has been occupying about 19,600
hectares of land in Kalapani in far-western Nepal and has
stationed its armed personnel there since 1962.
</P>
<P>
Recently, India enlarged the occupied area and erected barriers
to prevent the movement of Nepalese citizens in their own
territory, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"It constitutes a serious breach of international norms and a
provocation on the part of the Indian government," the letter
said. "We are, therefore, compelled to internationalize the issue
and mobilize the world opinion against this illegal occupation,
encroachment and intrusion of Nepalese territory by India."
</P>
<P>
It said there are encroachment and intrusions in other parts of
Nepal as well. The latest instance was in Pashupatinagar in
eastern Nepal where Indian armed personnel demolished the huts of
Nepalese citizens, erected barriers and planned to illegally
construct ranger posts there, it said.
</P>
<P>
"We are eager to settle the boundary issues with India within a
specific timeframe and on the basis of the Sugauli Treaty of 1816
and other documents and evidences," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the nine leftist parties have launched a struggle
against the Indian occupation, encroachment and intrusion of
Nepalese territory.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Working Group between Nepal and India on boundary has
met twice but without any result, it said.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the nine leftist parties including the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), the third
largest in parliament, have raised their voice on the issue.
</P>
<P>
When Indian President K. R. Narayanan visited Nepal in late
May, they issued an open letter to him, demanding that the Indian
army withdraw immediately and that India stop encroaching upon the
Nepalese territory.
</P>
<P>
At the summer session of parliament which opened on Sunday, the
opposition parties demanded that the minority government under the
Nepali Congress party initiate necessary actions to press for the
immediate withdrawal of the Indian army from Kalapani and the
return of encroached land by India in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala told the press early this
month that he would discuss with his Indian counterpart Atal
Bihari Vajpayee the issue of Kalapani on the sidelines of a summit
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation scheduled
for late July in Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Discloses Details of Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan disclosed for the first
time on Monday that the six nuclear tests it conducted last month
included one main test, four sub-kiloton tests and one
miniaturized device, which were "totally contained and safe".
</P>
<P>
The main test was conducted on May 28 at 1516 local time in the
Raskoh range of Chagai, in the remote Balochistan province, said
an official press release received here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"It was detonated by a telecommand station situated 10
kilometers from the zero point. The device was placed in a
one-kilometer tunnel with an over burden of 700-meter high
mountain," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The data gave a yield in accordance with our design
calculations," it said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the main test, "four sub-Kiloton tests were also
conducted in the same mountain range. Extensive technical data has
been generated from these experiments which are under examination
by our scientists," the release said.
</P>
<P>
The sixth test was conducted in the Kharan desert on May 30, at
1155 local time, it said.
</P>
<P>
"A miniaturized device was placed in an L-shaped underground
shaft that was 120-meter deep," it said. "The test gave a yield
which was about 60 percent of the first test and conformed to our
design value."
</P>
<P>
After these tests, an extensive survey was carried out for
detection of radiation at the test sites and their environment,
the release said.
</P>
<P>
"Surveys indicate that there has been no release of
radioactivity as a result of nuclear testing. The tests were
totally contained and safe," it added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's nuclear tests followed five nuclear tests conducted
earlier by India.

WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton made his last public appearance in China's
capital with speech at Beijing University, saying the United
States does not seek to impose its vision on China, but insisting
certain rights are universal. Clinton Administration officials
praised the President for his Beijing performance, while his
critics said he had done only the minimum.
</P>
<P>
-- Seventeen years AIDS was first recognized among gay white
men in New York and San Francisco, the disease in this country is
becoming largely an epidemic among black people and all but
ignored by leading black institutions, say public health

</P>
<P>
-- Friday's announcement that Long Term Credit Bank of Japan

as a litmus test of Japan's promises to clean up its banking mess
quickly. But as the outside world waits to see if the combined
banks take the kind of decisive action that such a litmus test
demands, it might first consider the contradictions that were
already apparent Friday.

<HEADLINE> Food Shortage Facing Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa will face a food
shortage because of reduced crop yields resulting from abnormal
rainfalls in different countries in the region in the 1997-1998
cropping season.
</P>
<P>
Reduced maize harvests compared to last year have been
forecast in all the countries in the region except in Malawi,
Mozambique, Angola and Swaziland, while Maize output declined by
nearly 70 percent in Lesotho because of poor rains, according to
a food security report of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The latest food security assessment for the SADC region
indicates that regional maize supplies for the forthcoming
1998-1999 marketing year will be much less than the previous year
due to erratic rains in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Namibia
and part of Zambia, coupled with excessive rains and flooding in
Tanzania and Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The maize production is expected to be 16.13 million tons in
the 1997-1998 harvesting season compared to last year's 17.05
million tons, said the report made available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The region will have an overall maize deficit of up to 1.72
million tons compared to a shortfall of 204,000 tons for the
1997-1998 marketing year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The regional production of all cereals combined amounts to
21.55 million tons against 22.38 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The production of the 1998 winter wheat crop is projected to
remain close to the 1997 harvest of 2.77 million tons while the
output of sorghum/millet has dropped to 1.92 million tons from
2.03 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
An overall cereal deficit of 3.19 million tons have been
forecast for the 1998-1999 marketing year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 29 (Xinhua)-- Singapore Finance Minister
Richard Hu Tsu Tau on Monday announced a 68-point package of
off-budget measures to boost the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the much-anticipated measures, an estimated 2 billion
Singapore dollars will be injected into the economy.
</P>
<P>
The package, covering all areas in the economy, includes
several tax concessions designed to help ease business costs
during the current economic downturn and help local business
obtain working capital in a situation of tight liquidity, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Based on revised revenue and expenditure estimate, the
introduction of the package will result in a budget deficit of
about 800 million Singapore dollars for fiscal 1998, he told
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized that these measures have 3 broad
objectives -- to reduce business costs, build economic
infrastructure and capabilities and help stabilize specific
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
He also said that based on the worsening economic outlook in
the East Asia region, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry
has revised down the country's GDP growth forecast to 0.5-1.5
percent for this year from 2.5 to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We must brace ourselves for slower economic growth during the
next years of regional transition and recovery," he said.

<HEADLINE> Banks Increase Support for Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China's banking sector has been
adopting active measures this year in support of infrastructure
construction.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said that banks
have raised their efficiency in appraising new projects, while key
state construction projects and enterprise retooling projects are
receiving loans directly from bank headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of all the commercial banks also strengthened
their capital control and unified credit management to ensure the
capital demand of infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
PBOC sources said that the growth rate of infrastructure loans
this year is clearly higher than that of other loans. By the end
of May, the State Development Bank has already finished its
full-year railway investment plan of 16.35 billion yuan (1.97
billion US dollars), and Construction Bank has extended railway
loans of 6 billion yuan (723 million US dollars), accounting for
85 percent of its plan for the year.
</P>
<P>
In regard to highway loans, Industrial and Commercial Bank,
Agricultural Bank and Construction Bank have extended loans of
57.9 billion yuan (7 billion US dollars) by the end of May to
support 140 projects.
</P>
<P>
The banks have handled the relationship between financial risk
control and the support for economic development well, the PBOC
sources said, adding that the banks have been extending loans
strictly according to credit rules.

DHAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Committee of the
Bangladesh National Economic Council has approved two projects
worth 154.93 billion taka (about 3.15 billion U.S. dollars), media
reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They are the Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project involving
1.79 billion taka (about 38.9 million dollars), and the Health and
Population Sector Program Implementation Plan worth 153.14 billion
taka (about 3.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The three-year Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project,
designed on an emergency basis to ensure supply of arsenic-free
water, will start next July, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 127 million, Bangladesh is the most

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Hong Kong Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin met this
morning with a Hong Kong youth delegation to discuss Chinese
history, culture and education at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
The president plans to visit Hong Kong to join in celebrations
for the first anniversary of the homecoming of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In talks with the 500-member delegation, the president said
that young people in Hong Kong represent the future of the region.
</P>
<P>
"Like young people in the inland areas of the motherland, you
are shouldering the same glorious duty and mission in the process
of the great Renaissance of the Chinese nation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the Hong Kong delegates to visit the inland areas
and spoke highly of their activities of "knowing China's culture
and history, and caring about the future of the motherland".
</P>
<P>
Since the return of Hong Kong, the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), headed by Chief Executive
Tung Chee-hwa, has stablized the local economy, with the support
of the central government and under the principles of "one
country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong," and
high autonomy, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the goal for modernizing the motherland,
maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong,
pushing the great cause of the reunification of the motherland is
to make the motherland strong and reinvigorate the nation.
</P>
<P>
Because of the 100 years of colonial rule, young people in Hong
Kong have insufficient knowledge about the history and culture of
the Chinese nation, and the history of the links between the Hong
Kong compatriots and the people in the inland areas, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his hope that, during their tour in the
inland areas, the young people from Hong Kong would learn more
about the history of the Chinese nation as well as the current
reform, opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong delegation has visited local universities,
museums and historical sites.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Expected to Visit Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is on the way for a visit to Nigeria to meet the
country's new leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar, according to
reports monitored here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Expected to be in the west African country Monday night, Annan,
and General Abubakar will discuss ways to solve Nigeria's current
political crisis and break its diplomatic isolation.
</P>
<P>
Annan's visit followed that by British Foreign Office Minister
Tony Lloyd who toured Nigeria last week on behalf of the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
His Commonwealth counterpart, Chief Emeka Anyaoku,
is in the country for discussions with the new head of
state, who assumed office after the sudden death of his
predecessor General Sani Abacha early this month.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the Commonwealth have imposed sanction packages on
Nigeria due to alleged violation of human rights and lack of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The UN also consistently criticized the policies of the Abacha
administration, especially the violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural statement, Abubakar promised to lead
Nigeria to national reconciliation and democracy. He has since
ordered the release of some 30 political detainees, including
former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo jailed for alleged
involvement in a coup plot.
</P>
<P>
The new leader also initiated nationwide consultations in
order to gather the ideas of various interest groups for solution
to the political transition of the military government.
</P>
<P>
All that the general has done so far has won wide welcome both
at home and abroad, particularly the West, which sees the actions
as good gesture for Nigeria to move toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
Both Lloyd and Anyaoku have expressed belief that Abubakar's
commitment to the democratization and release of political
detainees will pave the way for the resolution of Nigeria's
current political crisis and for its return to the international
community.
</P>
<P>
It is expected Annan's visit would help promote the Nigerian
military government's transition to civil rule program under the
leadership of General Abubakar.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Calls for Early Elections, Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
on Monday called for early general elections in light of the
deadlocked peace process, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made his call during a condolence visit to the family
of the fallen Israeli soldier Or Cohen in Jerusalem. Cohen, 19,
was killed in a roadside bomb blast by Lebanese guerrillas in
south Lebanon last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
northern areas from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process has been dragged on so long and the best
thing to do is to organize the new general elections," Weizman
said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman pointed out that he has been waiting for a long time to
present his opinion for holding the general elections, saying it
could be the best way to break the impasse in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and several other cabinet ministers reacted very
quickly to Weizman's call, blaming the president for taking a
political side with the left political parties.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting here with Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar, Netanyahu said the new general
elections will only be held as scheduled, that is in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said he has been working around the clock to form a good
accord with the Palestinians, that could ensure the security for
the citizens of Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said nobody could shrink him from this commitment. He also
blamed the Palestinians for ignoring their commitments, saying
this is the reason why the peace process is deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Other cabinet ministers, including Communications Minister
Limor Livnat and Agriculture and Environment Minister Rafael
Eitan, have slammed Weizman for making the call, and asked him to
be patient until progress is made in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition parties such as the Labor and Meretz
welcomed Weizman's call, saying that they will initiate a
legislation bill to dissolve the Knesset (parliament).

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Protection of Intellectual Property Rights (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities recently
organized an ever-larger crackdown operation on copyright piracy,
crushing more than 2.8 million smuggled compact discs.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of illegal publications is not the only avenue
the Chinese government is taking to combat violations of
intellectual property rights (IPR). The revised Criminal Law of
the country includes punishment for IPR violators.
</P>
<P>
VCD vendors, who often stroll Beijing's Zhongguancun electronic
street for potential buyers, have become more wary. Some have
taken legitimate jobs rather than trading in pirate compact discs,
which could result in heavy fines or imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the illegal producers of such discs are facing
hard times because of stricter IPR laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Yin Pinghua, a 50-year-old man from eastern Jiangsu Province,
was sentenced to six years in prison and fined 300,000 yuan (about
36,000 U.S. dollars) last month. Yin was found guilty of pirating
more than 200,000 copies of best-selling Chinese dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's judicial bodies have given Yin the harshest sentence
yet for copyright violations since the adoption of the revised
Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
The new law added an intellectual property clause and a maximum
penalty of seven years in prison plus fines.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials have been busy enforcing IPR violations.
Guangdong Province has destroyed more than six million pirated
VCD's in the past six months. Authorities have shut down and
dismantled 64 VCD production lines throughout China.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls on Europe to Hold More Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel has made a strong pitch to his French
counterpart, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, for the newly created
European Central Bank to hold 20 percent of its reserve in gold.
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Cape Town Sunday as French President Jacques Chirac
wound up his three-day visit to South Africa, Manuel and
Strauss-Kahn discussed a range of economic issues, Business Day
paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Manuel repeated a call made by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki in
Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year for central banks to
reconsider plans to reduce their gold holdings.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the world's biggest gold producer, has suffered
greatly since the international gold market tumbled last year as
a result of declining gold consumption by Asia during its
financial crisis, coupled by large sales of gold reserves by
central banks.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn had said the French Central Bank did not intend
reducing its holdings as a percentage of total reserves, but did
not say what they were.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Banks's president, Wim Duisenberg, said
recently the bank's six governors agreed that only 10 percent to
15 percent of its reserves would be held in gold. This translates
to about 900 tons of gold.
</P>
<P>
The figure is sharply down from the total gold reserves
currently held by the 11 European countries included in the first
wave of Monetary Union, which is to be launched next year.
</P>
<P>
The 11 countries collectively hold nearly 13,000 tons of gold
- equivalent to five years' supply from the world's mines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Strauss-Kahn told Manuel that Japan's economic woes
could have a serious knock-on effect in Europe as European
commercial banks have great exposure in Japan, the Business Day
report said.
</P>
<P>
On the Euro, Strauss-Kahn predicted that growth rates in
Europe would rise to United States levels after the introduction
of the common currency. He expected the Euro to displace the
Dollar at least partly in its international role.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers had agreed that the United States should not
be allowed to dominate the Group 22, the grouping of G-8
industrialized nations with 14 more advanced developing
countries, including South Africa, the report said.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 48,658 refugees
from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have left Tanzania
for home since last September as the latest trip by ship was made
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) Dar es Salaam Office said Monday that some
42,000 Congolese refugees still remain in Tanzania, waiting for
repatriation to their home country.
</P>
<P>
"The UNHCR will arrange more trips for those who want to be
repatriated home on a voluntary base," she added.
</P>
<P>
Congolese refugees have crossed the border to the western
border areas of Tanzania since late 1996 fleeing a civil war
between rebels led Laurent Kabila, the current DRC president, and
the Zaire army of former president Mobutu Sese-Seko who died
later in exile in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
A UNHCR report says that as of April 30 this year, Tanzania
accommodates a total of 328,737 refugees from neighbouring DRC,
Burundi, Rwanda and Somali.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China has published a collection
of photos and paintings to mark the 100th birth anniversary of
late Chinese President Liu Shaoqi.
</P>
<P>
The collection, including 100 photos and 100 paintings,
records the whole life of the great man, said Liu Zheng, a
participant at a forum celebrating the publication of the book. It
reflects the image and personality of Liu Shaoqi, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 celebrities in the capital attended the forum and
saw an art exhibition that also described the real life of the
late leader.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shaoqi, born in Ningxiang County in central China's Hunan
Province on November 24, 1898, was president in the late 1950s
and early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Liu has been hailed as a "public servant to the society" for
his honesty and battles against corruption.
</P>
<P>
The collection of photos and paintings was published by the
Qingdao Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
According to the forum, a large exhibition will be held

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Protection of Intellectual Property Rights (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official of the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou witnessed the
large-scale destruction of discs on June 15.
</P>
<P>
"China showed its determination to protect IPR and combat
copyright piracy," he commented.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Customs officials also are taking steps to protect the
brand names of foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the Customs Regulation Concerning the Protection
of Intellectual Property in October of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Li Junhuan, an official with the General Administration of
Customs, said: "In most cases, Chinese Customs protects overseas
businesses' rights on our own initiative regardless of application
or not from them."
</P>
<P>
Besides the support from Customs, overseas businesses could
find protection for their advanced technologies through China's
patent system.
</P>
<P>
Patent applications from worldwide enterprises in China have
increased greatly in recent years, especially in the field of
high-tech industry. Some multinational businesses account for the
greatest part of China's total patent applications.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the patent area, we have been very happy with the
progress in China," said Lois Boland, an official with the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, at an international forum in
April in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We even got some anecdotal evidence from our companies
operating here in this respect," she said.
</P>
<P>
Gao Lulin, commissioner of the State Intellectual Property
Office, said: "To protect the intellectual property is to
safeguard all the creative achievements by humans."

<HEADLINE> UN to Reduce HIV Transmission From Mother to Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- United Nations agencies have
launched a new public health initiative designed to help
HIV-positive mothers increase their chances of having healthy
children.
</P>
<P>
At the 12th World AIDS Conference held in Geneva, the Joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) announced on Monday it
would carry out pilot projects in some low-income countries in
Africa, Asia and Latin America where women have high rates of HIV
infection.
</P>
<P>
The projects would be worked together with the UN Children's
Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the
organization said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The initiative aims to offer voluntary and confidential HIV
counseling and testing to pregnant women, and provide better birth
care and safe infant feeding methods for those who are affected by
anti-retroviral drugs.
</P>
<P>
Over the next 12-18 months, the joint initiative will seek to
support about 30,000 HIV-infected women in about 30 different
areas in some African countries such as Botswana, Burkina Faso,
Cambodia, Honduras, Rwanda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In Cote d'Ivoire, Tanzania, Thailand and Uganda, the
anti-retroviral drug trials for reducing mother-to-child
transmission have already been conducted.
</P>
<P>
Activities will start on a limited scale in the 11 pilot
countries and then expand through collaboration with other
governments, donor communities and the private sectors, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> History on England's Side against Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Cao Li
</P>
<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, France, June 29 (Xinhua) -- History will be on
England's side when they face South American heavy-weights Argentina
in a World Cup second-round game at Geoffroy-Guichard Stadium here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
England have only lost twice to Argentina in the past 10
encounters, including their 2-1 defeat which featured an infamous
"Hand of God" goal by Diego Maradona in the quarterfinals of the 1986
World Cup in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
England coach Glenn Hoddle, despite playing down the media-hyped
element of revenge, still recalled that loss with a sour taste in the
mouth.
</P>
<P>
"I'd simply like to redress the balance - I'm still convinced that
Argentina wouldn't have won 2-1 without this golden hand-ball," said
Hoddle, who was in that squad who saw Maradona deflected the ball past
keeper Peter Shilton.
</P>
<P>
The younger generation of English footballers is not less
resentful, including midfielder Paul Scholes.
</P>
<P>
"Argentina is a painful memory for the Englishmen," said Manchester
United midfielder Scholes. "Personally, I admit I was upset by
Maradona's hand-ball in the 1986 World Cup."
</P>
<P>
Then he continued to indicate what Hoddle and all England players
worry most -- the deadly attacks from Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta,
who had scored four goals in three games.
</P>
<P>
"When we play Daniel Passarella's team we have to watch out for
Gabriel Batistuta's speed and ability to win the ball. However, when I
see the quality of our attackers, I'm very confident."
</P>
<P>
Liverpool's 18-year-old Michael Owen is almost definite to start up
front on the left alongside Newcastle United forward Alan Shearer on
the right.
</P>
<P>
Man United's David Beckham, who converted a superb free kick in
their 2-0 victory over Colombia, will be pulling all strings in
midfield.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle believed that his side is peaking at exactly the right time.
</P>
<P>
"We are feeling very good. I see no reason to think we can't beat
Argentina and go all the way," he said. "I think the players relish
this game and just can't wait for it. They are ready. But we will
respect them, not fear them."
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Argentines' common knowledge is that the English
defence is not as strong as theirs.
</P>
<P>
"England have strong points and good players. But they have a weak
point in defence -- they're strong in the air, but not on the ground
and we must exploit this," said midfielder Juan Veron.
</P>
<P>
However, Argentina themselves are less watertight in defence than
before, with defender Roberto Sensini doubtful for Tuesday due to a
thigh strain.

<HEADLINE> Renminbi Will Not Devalue: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese official
said here Monday that China would not devalue its currency
Renminbi although the Asian financial crisis has put mounting
pressure on the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, reaffirmed the Chinese government's commitment when
he delivered a luncheon speech at the Hong Kong Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
"The Renminbi will not devalue because this is necessary for
sustained economic development in China, and the long-term
prosperity and stability in Hong Kong," the trade minister told
the economic seminar.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the strong guarantee also "demonstrated
China's highly responsible attitude towards the economic and
financial stability in Asia as well as in the world."
</P>
<P>
"China is able to maintain the stability of the Renminbi," said
Shi, who backed his point with a string of encouraging facts: The
national economy continues to run smoothly towards the
eight-percent GDP growth target for 1998, plus hefty foreign
exchange reserves of above 140 billion U.S. dollars, and a sound
balance of international payment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official admitted that the Asian financial turmoil
has produced adverse effects on China's foreign trade, and even on
the whole economy. China's exports recorded a negative growth of
1.5 percent in May this year after 22-month consecutive increases,
due to big falls of exports to the ASEAN countries, Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of this year, China made an actual
use of foreign investment of 14.89 billion U.S. dollars, down 1.5
percent from the same period of 1997, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
In face of shock waves of the regional financial storm, the
Chinese government has taken initiatives to enlarge the domestic
demand by developing infrastructure projects, exploring the rural
market, and building houses for urban residents.
</P>
<P>
"These measures have produced, or are producing the desired
results," said Shi, who was optimistic that China can keep the
eight-percent economic growth this year, and at the same time curb
the inflation below three percent and maintain a stable currency.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Economic Forum, jointly organized by the Trade
Development Council (TDC) and the Hong Kong Policy Research
Institute, attracted some 1,000 participants to discuss a variety
of topics on Hong Kong's continued competitiveness, as well as the
regional and global economy.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Macao-Zhuhai Bridge Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Macao and neighboring Zhuhai
authorities in south China's Guangdong Province started on Monday
the construction of a bridge that connects the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The "Lotus Flower Bridge," named after the symbol on the flag
of the future Macao Special Administrative Region, will connect
Macao's Taipa Island and Zhuhai's Hengqin Island after 15 months
of construction.
</P>
<P>
The 1.3-kilometer-long bridge will open a second land crossing
apart from the current border gate to China's inland, when it
opens to traffic before the handover ceremony on December 20,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held a corner-stone laying ceremony on each side
of the bridge on Monday. They are to share the costs of the bridge
of 200 million patacas (about 25 million U.S. dollars). Macao will
be responsible for 82.8 million patacas (about 10.35 million
dollars) of the costs.
</P>
<P>
The bridge will have six traffic lanes. It will be 22 meters
high above water, and has a design traffic capacity of about 10
million vehicles a year. It is also near the Macao International
Airport and Macao's container terminal.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was first proposed last year by the Sino-Portuguese
Infrastructure Coordination Commission (SPICC), which decided the
financial construction earlier this month. Both Chinese and
Portuguese officials described the bridge as important for Macao
and Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
"It will help improve Macao's outward land transportation
conditions and facilitate the development of Macao's islands and
Zhuhai's Hengqin Island," Xie Houhe, chief of SPICC Chinese
delegation, said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Jose Alves Paula, secretary for transportation and public
engineering, said at Monday's ceremony that the bridge will help
ease the pressure at the current border gate, and demonstrates the
friendly cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The SPICC is now considering some other infrastructure projects
concerning the two sides. Further discussions will be made on the
projects including the extension to Macao a Guangzhou-Zhuhai
railway.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Fund Managers Express Confidence in China's B-Share Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) - The prospect of China's economy and
its capital market will remain optimistic in spite of the negative
impact the Asian financial crisis has imposed on the country, some
foreign fund managers here said.
</P>
<P>
"We predict a good future for China and believe that a stable
and prosperous Chinese economy will help enliven the Asian
economy," Robert Scott, president of the Commercial General Union
(CGU), the biggest assurance group in the United Kingdom, said
today at a seminar on China Index Fund.
</P>
<P>
As one indication, the Commercial Union Assurance Group, one of
the predecessors of the CGU, launched the first China Index Fund
in January. The fund was listed in Ireland and channeled about 13
million U.S. dollars into China's B-share market.
</P>
<P>
It is also hailed by managers as the first index fund that
follows all the listed B shares on the two stock exchanges in
Shanghai and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
China Index Fund, though already a main part of institutional
investors on worldwide stock markets, is an entirely new
investment means in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China needs index funds since it does
long-term investing and does not trade so frequently to reduce
transaction costs, thereby providing stable and long-term funding
for the B-share market.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we launched the China Index Fund;, we mainly
intend to draw more and more foreign investors into the Chinese
stock market and therefore facilitate its stability and
prosperity," Scott said.
</P>
<P>
CGU currently manages a total of 100 billion British pounds of
assets, and is hailed as the biggest assurance group in the UK in
term of asset management.

<HEADLINE> HK Rescue Package Not Departs From Policy of Non- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The latest package released by
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government to
address the economic downturn does not depart from the
government's long-standing policy of non-interference with market
operations, a senior SAR official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong Economic
Forum, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang defended the rescue
package announced last Monday, saying, "We are just responding to
market conditions. Our aim is to facilitate economic adjustment,
not to tamper with normal market activities."
</P>
<P>
The measures were designed to ease the credit and liquidity
crunch, to stabilize property prices, to ease the cost burden to
families and businesses, and to help adapt to the economic
adjustment process generally for the next three quarters, Tsang
told some 1,000 participants of the seminar.
</P>
<P>
"We want to demonstrate once again that the HKSAR government
acts firmly and consistently and is alert and responsive to the
needs of the community," Tsang noted. The measures followed "our
largest-ever package of tax concessions, infrastructure investment
and public expenditure" secured in the 1998-1999 budget and a
package of seven measures announced at the end of May, he added.
</P>
<P>
In drawing up this latest package of measures, the government
is guided by four principles: maintain investors and international
community's confidence in Hong Kong, observe market discipline and
uphold prudent business practices, ensure no adverse impact on the
linked exchange rate system and uphold prudent management of
public finances.
</P>
<P>
"Adherence to these crucial principles for the Hong Kong
economy is of utmost importance," Tsang reiterated.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the implementation of the package will worsen
the budget balance for the current financial year, turning an
estimated surplus of 10.7 billion HK dollars (1.4 billion U.S.
dollars) into an estimated deficit of 21.4 billion HK dollars (2.7
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Tsang stressed, "The deficit represents just 1.5
percent of the GDP for the year. Moreover, taking this deficit
with last year's surplus of 80.9 billion HK dollars (10.4 billion
U.S. dollars), the combined balance for two years is still well in
the positive."
</P>
<P>
Under the theme "Free Market Economy -- the Way Forward," the
two-day forum held just prior to the first anniversary of Hong
Kong's return to China will address free economy and other issues
of importance to Hong Kong's continued competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the forum will be more than 40 senior government
officials, think-tank members and business leaders from Hong Kong
and overseas, according to Paul Yip, chairman of the Hong Kong
Policy Research Institute, which organized the forum together with
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.
</P>
<P>
Topics will cover Hong Kong as an international trade and
financial center, information and communications, human capital
development, the future of Hong Kong's industry, Asian values and
global partnership, the Asian economic crisis and the world
economy.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Goodbye! Kai Tak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- It was overcast with a few
showers last Saturday afternoon. On the side of the Olympic Avenue
outside Kai Tak Airport, two little girls, Kathy and Grace, were
taking photos for each other, with aircraft roaring overhead as
the backdrop.
</P>
<P>
The two teenagers were not alone. Around them were families,
lovers, tourists and well-equipped aircraft fans, who were seizing
the last chance to appreciate the beauty of huge iron birds flying
over the rooftop of low-rise blocks of urban Kowloon City.
</P>
<P>
All of them bore in mind that the scene will be gone in a few
days. To meet increasing aviation demands, the overcrowded Kai Tak
Airport will be replaced by a world-class new airport at Chek Lap
Kok, Lantau Island, on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The rooftop of the airport terminal building, a traditional
place to watch plane landing and taking off, was packed by people,
making the scene look like a carnival. Someone joked that
passengers would feel great as they were greeted or seen off by
such a big crowd they never enjoyed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
People were bending over the railing, with eyes closely
following the aircraft -- appearing in the clouds in the west,
coming nearer and nearer, a beautiful turn-around over Kowloon
City, flying overhead and finally touching the runway. "You can
not see this elsewhere in the world, can you?" an old man said to
his friend.
</P>
<P>
The rooftop turned into a playground for kids. Some were posing
for a beautiful photo with a broad smile on the face while others
were chasing each other for fun. A mother was heard asking his two
boys: "Have you watched enough?"
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of policemen walked around to ensure the
safety of the mass of people never seen before.
</P>
<P>
Nearby, on Hau Wong Road, in the Kowloon Walled City Park, on
the waterfront of Kwun Tong, as well as on roofs of many Kowloon
City residential buildings, aircraft fans from Hong Kong itself
and overseas had their cameras adjusted to the sky day and night,
recording the fantastic scene which will never be seen in this
part of the territory again.
</P>
<P>
Actually, farewell to Kai Tak has been a hot topic in town
these days. Local TV stations presented special programs in memory
of Kai Tak, which has served Hong Kong people well for over 70
years and has witnessed the city's rising to economic prosperity
since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Print media gave full-page coverage to places where people can
get a good picture with aircraft in it.
</P>
<P>
Travel agents have been seizing the opportunity to promote
business. Special tours have been organized for departure from Kai
Tak and arrival at Chek Lap Kok and they are reported to have
obtained overwhelming response.
</P>
<P>
For 380,000 Kowloon City residents living under the flight
path, the relocation of the airport will free them from the noise
of the aircraft. But, during the last operational days of Kai Tak,
the long-awaited relief seems overwhelmed by a mixed feeling of
bidding farewell to part of their life.
</P>
<P>
Regal Airport Hotel, which has benefited for years from its
proximity to Kai Tak Airport, has planned a candlelight dinner on
the night of July 5 to say goodbye to Kai Tak, "one of the
greatest airports in the world." After the closure of the
airport, the hotel will renamed as Regal Kai Tak Hotel, to
commemorate the "old friend," while the name "Regal Airport Hotel"
will be given to its hotel at the new airport.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Finds Footprints of Prehistoric Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian experts have recently
discovered 40 footprints of prehistoric animals in Birjand in
northeastern Khorasan province, the official news agency IRNA
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted chancellor of Birjand University Mohammad
Hassan as saying that the oval-shaped footprints, discovered on
sedimentary rocks belonged to the third geological age 50 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Cultural heritage expert Hussein Aliabadi said the footprints
were left on a tiny layer of sediments when giant animals passed
the region, and the layer turned into rocks after millions
of years.
</P>
<P>
The marks were exposed as a result of erosion, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Aliabadi said that study showed a harmony among all the
footprints, with their measurements ranging from 48x26 to 12x8
centimeters.
</P>
<P>
This has led researchers to believe that the giant animals
belonged to one species and were moving from east to west in
groups.
</P>
<P>
And the giants are very likely to be one of the dinosaur
species, he added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Libraries Lack in Modern Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian libraries lack in
modern information equipment that are essential to the development of
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Eight out of 20 regional libraries in the country do not have
television, computer and Internet and other modern equipment which are
used worldwide, said participants at a meeting of the Mbeya Library
Service Board over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Although the equipment are expensive, they are very essential for
providing up-to-date information to the people," The Guardian
Monday quoted Mbeya Chief Librarian Emanuel Lubanda, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Lubanda cited regions without such equipment as Mbeya, Dodoma,
Rukwa and Coast.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lubanda has called on libraries not to rely heavily on
donated books, saying that dependence on donated books will
undermine Tanzania's culture.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that most of the donated books were outdated
as they were printed in 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Mbeya Library Service Board chairman, Robert Chidosa, called on
people to cultivate a habit of reading, which is ignored by most
adults in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chairman of AIG on His Company Group's Links with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is one of the most
prospective metropolises in the world, according to Maurice
Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of American
International Group (AIG) of the United States.
</P>
<P>
As the head of one of the leading insurance companies in the
world, Greenberg has come to Shanghai almost on an annual basis
since he first visit to the city in 1975.
</P>
<P>
"I have had opportunities to witness big changes and
development process in Shanghai over recent years. So I believe it
is one of the most prospective cities in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a founder of the Shanghai Mayor-International Entrepreneurs
Consulting Conference, Greenberg prompted his company to invest in
the largest U.S.-funded project in China in 1985. Moreover, AIG
provided funds for the development of a business center in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He has also personally experienced expansion of all-round
cooperation between AIG and Shanghai in such fields as culture,
medical care, scientific research, education and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
The American International Assurance (AIA), an subsidiary of
the AIG, has been the first foreign insurance company that
obtained an operational license in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Greenberg went on to say that he has special feelings toward
Shanghai and its people as AIG was founded in this city at early
this century. And he is one of the first group of foreign citizens
who became honorary citizens of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, he was entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal Government
to hold a large-scale international forum on reviving Shanghai as
an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
AIA will introduce international vision and advanced management
system and technology of insurance business to Shanghai, so as to
help advance the growth of China's insurance market, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Greenberg, an active advocator of maintaining normal
trade ties with China back in the United States, takes pride in
witnessing his company's interests growing in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
For the expansion of its insurance business, a brand-new AIA
tower mansion has been erected recently in the downtown financial
section along the Bund, where a group of magnificent
European-style architectures built by Western powers about a
century ago overlook the busy Huangpu River.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan PM Meets U.S. Senators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
Monday expressed the hope that the United States would play a
leading role in initiating a credible process to promote Pak-India
dialogue and resolve the grave security crisis in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting U.S. Senators Sam Brownback and
Charles Robb, Sharif thanked them for playing their role in the
U.S. Senate and appreciated the greater understanding in the U.S.
Congress for Pakistan's security concerns and the need to resolve
the core issue of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the Kashmir issue is resolved, peace and security
cannot be ensured in the region," Sharif stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the Foreign Ministry, the two
senators briefed Sharif about the U.S. position on imposition of
sanctions, promotion of global non-proliferation and the need to
restore peace and stability in South Asia, by resolving the
underlying causes of tensions.
</P>
<P>
They also spoke of the steps that had been initiated in the
U.S. Senate regarding the provision of discretionary powers and
flexibility to the President on imposition of sanctions on the
basis of national interest.
</P>
<P>
They also referred to the Senate resolution on Kashmir,
currently under consideration, which underlines the importance of
resolving the Kashmir dispute that had become a nuclear
flash-point endangering regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The senators agreed that the resolution of the Kashmir dispute
was central to peace and stability in the region, and urged
Pakistan to be more responsive to the non-proliferation regime
that may help in the early lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the two senators had a meeting with Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan. The meeting covered most of the issues
raised with Prime Minister Sharif, but in greater detail, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Afghanistan was also discussed in the context
of regional peace and security. The two sides also stressed the
need for removing the irritants that had cropped up and for
further enhancing the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to maintain a regular contact to create a greater
understanding of each other's position.
</P>
<P>
The two senators, who arrived here Sunday night, are the first
American officials to visit Islamabad since Pakistan's detonation
of nuclear devices at the end of May. They also heard a briefing
on the situation in Indian-held Kashmir, particularly along the
Line of Control (LOC), of which they had a tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary-General
Emeka Anyaoku will hold talks with Nigeria's new leader, General
Abdulsalam Abubakar Monday in capital Abuja on relations between
his organization and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku, who arrived at the Lagos airport Sunday afternoon,
told the press that it believed that Abubakar's commitment
to the democratization and release of political detainees will
pave the way for Nigeria's return to the international community.
</P>
<P>
"The Commonwealth and the international community had welcomed
General Abubakar's inaugural statement and the steps he has taken
so far," Anyaoku said.
</P>
<P>
"My hope is that this is the beginning and my presence is the
beginning of the process of Nigeria's re-integration into the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Nigerian-Commonwealth relation, he said he is
optimistic that the suspension of Nigeria's membership may soon
be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
On what it would take for Nigeria to fully regain its position
in the Commonwealth, Anyaoku said the disposition of the
incumbent military regime to ensure democratization, national
reconciliation and adherence to fundamental human rights would
guarantee that.
</P>
<P>
"I think the extent to which the new government has gone in
dealing with those concerns, is a good ground for hope that the
process will lead to normalization of Nigeria's relationship with
the Commonwealth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in November 1995
following the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other leaders
of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People on charges of
murder.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- General Electric (GE) Inc. of the
United States today signed a contract worth 160 million
U.S. dollars with the Shandong Huaneng Power Development Corp. to
provide key equipment for the Dezhou Power Plant in east China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
This is another major deal between GE and China. The two sides
have signed 10 memorandums of understanding (MOU), or letters of
intent (LOI), for future cooperation in the last two months, said
Goran S. Malm, senior vice-president of GE and president of GE
Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the GE Power System will supply an
integrated steam turbine system, including a broad range of

Dezhou Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
At the Great Hall of the People today, Chinese and
U.S. companies signed seven cooperation agreements or contracts
valued at 2.1 billion U.S. dollars. The GE contract was one of the
seven.
</P>
<P>
In August of 1994, Shandong Huaneng became China's first
state-owned power company to be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
GE's Malm, who came from Hong Kong to attend today's
contract-signing ceremony, said in an interview with Xinhua:
"the Dezhou project and the other 10 MOUs or LOIs further
demonstrate GE's long-term commitment to invest in China."

to investigate the investment environment in an effort to find
new cooperative opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said the 10 projects, each involving millions of dollars,
covers GE-Chinese technological cooperation or production
cooperation in Liaoning, Shaanxi and Fujian provinces and the
cities of Beijing and Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Tries Again to Squeeze Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Monday tried again to squeeze the Palestinians,
saying that if they implement their commitments, a peace agreement
would be reached in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with his Spanish
counterpart Jose Maria Aznar on Monday, Netanyahu said that "peace
is very, very close if the Palestinians do their part."
</P>
<P>
"Peace is based on reciprocity," he said, demanding the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) must fulfill its commitments
to the security of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for more
than one year over Israel's intransigent settlement policy and the
long-delayed second stage troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu has repeatedly managed to shift the blame on
the Palestinians. He said earlier that the Palestinians will
determine the fate of the process and the negotiations between two
sides over the second Israeli redeployment could be concluded next
month.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government is under growing pressure from the United
States and the PNA to accept a peace initiative, according to
which Israel would hand over 13 percent more of the West Bank to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also reiterated at the news conference that to hold
another international peace conference in Madrid like the one
seven years ago is a "good idea" to push forward the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that the multilateral conference would only complement
the bilateral negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors,
not replace them.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Aznar said that Spain is ready to make "positive
contributions" to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu idea has already been rejected by the PNA, which
called it another ploy by the hardline Israeli prime minister to
retard any progress in the dying peace process.

GENEVA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Governing Council of the United
Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC) began its 28th session here
Monday to consider the first instalment of corporate claims
involving four large corporates.
</P>
<P>
But the UN commission did not reveal the names of the four
companies which have sought a total of more than two billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The UNCC was established in accordance with UN Security Council
resolutions 687 and 692 (1991) to pay compensation for losses and
damages suffered by individuals, corporations, governments and
international organizations as a direct result of Iraq's invasion
and occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
During its three-day session, the commission will also consider
the appointment of two new panels of commissioners to address
corporate and government claims against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It will consider the sixth instalment of individual claims for
damages of up to 100,000 dollars involving 71,042 claims filed by
74 governments and three international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Funds to pay compensation are drawn from the Compensation
Fund, also established under Security Council resolution 692.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Loses $70m to Graft: report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 70 million U.S. Dollars or 7.6
percent of the Uganda's government expenditure were missing from the
public coffers in the 1997/98 financial year due to graft, a report
has said.
</P>
<P>
Unaccounted expenditures, incorrect spendings and unauthorized
cash withdrawals are held mainly responsible for the loss of the
money, the East African weekly quoted Uganda's auditor-general's
annual report as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
This report is regarded as best indicator of corruption in the
government departments of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The total government expenditure in this fiscal year which will
end this month is 913.4 million Dollars. And a considerable amount
of the money is donated by other countries.
</P>
<P>
As a response to the rampant corruption among government officials,
major donors including Denmark and Japan demand accountability and
refund of their donations.
</P>
<P>
Denmark contributed 46 million Dollars in direct aid to Uganda in
1997, excluding aid channeled through non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Japan gives Uganda between 3.7 and 4.8 million Dollars of aid
annually in chemicals, agricultural inputs and road construction
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid to Uganda totaled some 450 million Dollars in 1997
and its foreign debt is approaching 4 billion Dollars.

that by all reliable accounts Iraq's human rights record was
appalling, and even in the darkest days of apartheid South Africa
had not been as bad as Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The National Party (NP), the biggest opposition party in the
country, also criticized the plan. NP member of parliament Boy
Geldenhuys said Sunday that with Iraq at loggerheads with the
United Nations (UN) over weapons inspections, the time was not
right to establish ties with the middle eastern country.
</P>
<P>
Geldenhuys said that it did not appear that the government
decision was prompted by trade concerns, as South Africa has just
closed down important missions in California, the United States,
and in Brussels, Belgium. It made no sense to close these
missions in favor of Iraq, he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding the criticism, Foreign Affairs spokesman Marco Boni
said Sunday the talks about diplomatic ties with Iraq should be
seen against the background of the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa, which will host the movement's summit in
late August and take over its chair, is considering normalizing
relations with all the movement's members, of which Iraq is one.

<HEADLINE> British Paper Details Libyan Arms Deal With S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A British newspaper Sunday
again insisted on the truth of its report that South Africa and
Libya have stricken a secret arms-for-oil deal, South African
media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The London-based Sunday Telegraph provoked an angry reaction
from the South African government last week when it first made
its allegations that a 500-million-U.S. Dollar deal had been
reached, in defiance of UN sanctions against Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's office dismissed the report as "a complete
fabrication."
</P>
<P>
But in this week's edition, the paper said it had now learned
that the deal was finally concluded during two stopovers Mandela
made in Tripoli on his way to and from last October's
Commonwealth summit meeting in Edinburg, Britain.
</P>
<P>
It said that earlier last year, Musa Kusa, head of foreign
security in the Libyan intelligence service, had made two
clandestine trips to South Africa to discuss the proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
This had led it to conclude that "there seems no doubt that
members of the South African intelligence services have
negotiated a deal to supply the Libyans with arms and military
spare parts in return for the Libyans providing cut-price oil."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the South African military equipment
would be sent to Libya "through private individuals and companies
with close connections to the South African military
establishment," according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
South Africa Sunday criticized the newspaper report again,
saying the publication should be ashamed of its reports.
</P>
<P>
"This second report proves more than before that their earlier
story was a fabrication and a lie. They should be ashamed of
themselves," said Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain, which are at the center of an
international standoff with Libya over Lockerbie bombing, have
accepted South Africa's denial.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official: Loose Monetary Policy Has Drawbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin said here Monday that the adoption of a loose
monetary policy by a country experiencing an economic downturn
could lead to a substantial depreciation of its currency and
additional inflation.
</P>
<P>
It will also deter foreign investments, encourage capital
flight and intensify debt repayment risks for loans denominated in
foreign currencies, he said at a press conference at the end of
his two-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
He agreed to the view that a tight monetary policy may strangle
an economy, but said that a loose policy has its drawbacks too.
</P>
<P>
In a clear defense of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s
prescription of high interest rates and credit squeeze for
economic reform, Rubin said what the IMF has done is about right.
</P>
<P>
He said that the IMF was trying to find the right balance in
the monetary policy and that is why no "one formula fits all
approach."
</P>
<P>
In regard of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's view
that the IMF's strategy on interest rates adopted by Malaysia has
damaged the economy, Rubin said, "I think the Prime Minister's
views on a lot of issues are fairly well known. I guess it is fair
to say that the U.S.' views are fairly well known too."
</P>
<P>
Rubin, however, felt that Malaysia's interest rate policy
should be determined by its own authorities.
</P>
<P>
On feedback from U.S. businessmen operating in Malaysia, he
said they are still confident of Malaysia's underlying strength
and are convinced that their investments in this country would
continue.
</P>
<P>
On his visit here, Rubin said he has had good discussions with
Malaysian leaders and that it was "time exceedingly well spent."
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Rubin called on Mahathir, held talks with
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
and attended a closed-door dialogue on "Responding To The Asian
Crisis", which was also attended by Anwar and Malaysia's senior
government officials and leading local corporate figures.
</P>
<P>
Rubin arrived here Sunday for a two-day visit to Malaysia as
part of his second tour to the economically-troubled Asia-Pacific
region. He will also visit Thailand and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Revokes World Status of 16 Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- In a major crackdown on the
massive movement of illegal goods across South Africa's borders,
the government has revoked the international status of 16
airports.
</P>
<P>
This leaves about 40 airports which are licensed to handle the
movement of international traffic, The Citizen paper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the weekend, the National Inter-departmental Structure for
Border Control (Nids), which comprises officials from the Home
Affairs Department, the border police and the South African
Revenue Service (Sars), said the move was in compliance with
international practice.
</P>
<P>
It said international airports would have to comply with
specific criteria to ensure efficient cross-border movement of
personnel and goods, and duty collection, to curb cross-border
crimes and detect contraband.
</P>
<P>
Sars Deputy Director H Tripmaker said last week that illegal
goods across South Africa's borders was estimated at 17 billion
Rand (3.1 billion U.S. Dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
She said the illegal flow of aliens and goods has an extremely
negative impact on the country's economy and crime rate.
</P>
<P>
Last year the government announced its intention to restrict
the number of international airports to only 10. It also wants to
reduce the 52 land border posts to 19 and the number of seaports
for international freight to seven.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 550 airstrips in South Africa, of which
192 are being licensed as airports with the Transport Department.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Says Crisis Not to Deter Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The present economic crisis
will not deter Malaysia's ongoing efforts to deregulate and
liberalize its economy, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also the finance minister, said Malaysia is
dedicated to reforming the economy to face the challenges of
globalization which is unstoppable and irreversible.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the inherent and destabilizing risks of large
and volatile capital flows could be managed and minimized if the
process of deregulation and liberalization is judiciously
sequenced," he said in his opening address at a roundtable
discussion with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin here.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that to minimize shock and financial instability,
the progress of deregulation and liberalization must take into
account the modernization of the financial sector and the
establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia was pleased that the United States was
spearheading the move towards a new architecture for the
international monetary system that would manage and resolve, if
not prevent, future crises.
</P>
<P>
"To prevent future crises we require greater surveillance of
the international financial markets and capital flows. We demand
transparency and disclosure in domestic finance and we expect
nothing less in the international system," Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said there is also a need to coordinate information-sharing
between national regulators, especially among those with
supervisory insight into the institutions operating in major
financial centers including offshore centers.
</P>
<P>
Anwar held that global cooperation between national regulators
and regular contact between the regulators and the operators of
leverage funds are absolutely necessary in ensuring the stability
of the international monetary system.
</P>
<P>
On measures to cushion the impact of the contagion economic
crisis, he said Malaysia has taken firm preemptive measures such
as mergers in the banking system and other administrative measures
to enhance resilience and transparency.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the banking system still suffered from
insufficient liquidity as a result of the outflow of short-term
capital.
</P>
<P>
"The interest rates, although lower than in the rest of the
region, are already prohibitively high, thus raising the cost of
doing business in this country," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the government had recently announced a
counter-cyclical package to pump-prime the economy and stimulate
growth.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was the largest source of foreign direct investment
(FDI) in Malaysia last year with 684.9 million U.S. dollars of
capital investments in 39 projects approved.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is Malaysia's largest trading partner with a trade
volume of 20.095 billion dollars in 1997, which was 17.7 percent
of Malaysia's total trade in that year. For the first four months
of this year, trade between the U.S. and Malaysia amounted to
9.837 billion dollars, or 21.3 percent of Malaysia's global trade
during that period.
</P>
<P>
The roundtable discussion on "Responding to the Asian Crisis"
was jointly organized by the Finance Ministry, the Institute of
Strategy and International Studies of Malaysia (ISIS) and the
Oxford and Cambridge Club of Malaysia. Senior government officials
and local corporate leaders attended the discussion.
</P>
<P>
Rubin arrived here Sunday for a two-day visit for talks with
Malaysian leaders, as part of his second tour of the
economically-troubled Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Restructuring of Financial Institutions in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea said Monday that its
five non-viable banks will be merged by five well-managed banks.
</P>
<P>
The five sick banks -- Daedong, Dongnam, Dongwha, Kyungki and
Chungchong -- will be respectively taken over by Kookmin, Housing
and Commercial, Shinhan, KorAm and Hana, said the Financial
Supervisory Commission Monday.
</P>
<P>
The five sound banks will take over their assets and
liabilities under a "purchase and assumption" formula.
</P>
<P>
The selection of the five sick banks came from the commission's
evaluation of a list of 12 banks which had failed to meet a
8-percent of minimum capital adequacy ratio set by the South
Korean government.
</P>
<P>
The remaining seven of the 12 banks are also required to take
measures to improve their operation and management under the
government's demands before 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government has vowed to take tough measures against
non-viable banks, which included shutdowns, transfer of businesses
to sound banks, and forced mergers and acquisition.
</P>
<P>
The decision is reportedly in line with preconditions attached
to an agreement signed between the government and the
International Monetary Fund last December for a rescue loan of 57
billion U.S. dollars to help recover South Korea's crisis-ridden
economy.

<HEADLINE> G. Bissau Seeks ECOMOG Intevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- President Joau Bernardo Vieira of Guinea
Bissau has called for the intervention of the west African
peacekeeping force ECOMOG into the situation in his country, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
The president was seeking assistance from the sub-regional body,
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the battle to
overcome a two-week-old rebellion by some of the country's soldiers,
sources at the ECOWAS secretariat in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, said
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Chiefs of staff of the organization will meet in Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire, to look at the rebellion and consider the possibility of
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Guinea Bissau's former Army Chief of Staff Amsumane Mane led the
rebellion shortly after his sacking on June 6.
</P>
<P>
The country's neighbors, Guinea and Senegal have sent some 2,000
troops to help the Vieira government' efforts to end the revolt that
has killed an unknown number of people in the country.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting of chiefs of staff, scheduled for Tuesday, is
expected to make recommendations to the defense and foreign ministers
from west Africa, who will meet on the issue and will also make
recommendations to their respective heads of state.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is coming on the heels of consultive visits to Senegal,
Gambia and Guinea by ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
They explained that the consultation and the meetings were meant to
generate a consensus for sub-regional action in favor of President
Vieira.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's President Charles Taylor last week appealed to West
African leaders to intervene militarily through ECOMOG to restore
peace in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
"A collective regional initiative is necessary to buttress the
current efforts of Guinea and Senegal in Bissau," Taylor said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent to Liberia in 1990 and succeeded in ending
Liberia's civil war in 1997, which paved way for Taylor to become the
country's post-war president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the sub-regional force also helped restore the
elected government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in Sierra Leone
after it expelled the military junta of Paul Johnny Koromah that
seized power in a coup in May last year.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is stepping up its opeartions in eastern and northern Sierra
Leone for an early mop-up of remnants of the junta and allied rebels.
</P>
<P>
Currently, fighting in Guinea Bissau has centered on a big military
complex in the Bra district of the capital Bissau and on the airport.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Committed to Asia's Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
committed to any economic reform undertaken by Asian countries to
resolve the economic crisis, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert E.
Rubin said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We know that the Asian region has the enormous underlying
strength to deal with its economic crisis. However, it requires
recognition of problems and changes (to resolve the crisis)," he
said in his opening address at a roundtable discussion with
Malaysia's senior government officials and leading local corporate
figures here.
</P>
<P>
He told the discussion themed "Responding to the Asian crisis"
that the U.S. believes that the economic crisis could only be
resolved by working together.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a difficult time ahead but there are some signs
of progress as well," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the case of Malaysia, the country is not far
from resolving its economic problems based on its strong
willingness to follow all measures being aimed at the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that Malaysia has been shielded from the "worst
conditions because of a better supervision system."
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin said that on the whole, Asia still has a long
way to go (in overcoming the economic crisis) especially in
restoring investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Citing the lack of transparency as one of the contributory
factors of the regional economic crisis, Rubin suggested five
measures to overcome these economic problems.
</P>
<P>
He said firstly, Asian economists should look into the matter
of reducing restriction on foreign ownership; secondly, financial
institutions should be required to give credit extension on a
purely commercial basis; thirdly, mergers or bailouts should be
conducted on a transparent basis; the fourth, an effective social
"safety net" should be established; and the fifth is to maintain a
sound fiscal and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
He said all these measures are difficult to carry out but the
best is "to recognize the economic problems."
</P>

<HEADLINE> India's HIV Cases on Rise: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- There has been a sharp increase
in number of HIV-AIDS cases all over the country, said a national
survey available here Monday by India's Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the country's States like Maharashtra, Andhra
Pradesh, Manipur and Karnataka is alarming. In Andhra Pradesh, for
instance, out of 700 people tested at clinics for sexually
transmitted diseases, 158 tested HIV positive, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey has also expressed concern over the AIDS situation
in Maharashtra State of southwestern India. The percentage of HIV
positive cases have sharply increased in this State in the last
four years. When the survey was last done in 1994, the prevalence
of HIV-AIDS was five percent and this figure has now gone up to
8.8-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The situation in other northeastern States is no better. The
health officials believe that the main cause of the rising cases
in this region was the drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
The national survey was conducted by the National AIDS Control
Organization (NACO) under the aegis of the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare during February-March this year. The health
officials had selected 151 sites in the country as established by
international rules for carrying out surveys. Over 36,218 samples
were taken from all over the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTPELLIER, France, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Mexicans will be
helped by a nothing-to-lose attitude going into their World Cup second
round game against Germany, coach Manuel Lapuente said.
</P>
<P>
"We came here with a lot of faith in ourselves. We're doing our
best and have nothing to prove," said Lapuente late on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The coach hinted that his team would take a more aggressive way in
Monday's game here, saying "It would be too dangerous for us to stay
on the defensive against the Germans."
</P>
<P>
Lapuente claimed he knew two or three, if not all, secrets of the
European champions Germany.
</P>
<P>
"Their defence is solid, their two forwards (Oliver) Bierhoff and
(Juergen) Klinsmann are very good. Lothar Matthaus will definitely
play, with Olaf Thon alongside," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lapuente had said earlier that he had information on their second
round foes through German trainer Axel Bierbaum who he worked with
when he first began coaching in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"I know all about German football from him," Lapuente had said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Rise For 4th Straight Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices in Tokyo rose for the
4th consecutive day Monday, boosted by last Friday's merger news
regarding the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB).
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange were up 155.69 points, or 1.02
percent, from last Friday's closing of 15,365.73.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 11.40 points, or 0.96 percent, to
1,202.22.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei has surged more than 300 points over the past four
trading days with Monday's rise being the biggest single-day gain.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the First Section was estimated at 400 million
shares, down from 424.95 million last Friday.
</P>
<P>
LTCB, the day's most actively traded issue, was bolstered by
the news of a possible merger of LTCB, Japan's second largest
credit bank, and the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.
</P>
<P>
The banking marriage, if go ahead, would create the country's
largest bank, with 42 trillion yen (296 billion U.S. dollars) in
assets.
</P>
<P>
The merger news, which had given last friday's stocks a sudden
boost, and relatively relaxed currency trading in the morning,
encouraged investors Monday, but traders said much of the buying
was simply covering of short-selling positions.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,334 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outnumbered losers 791 to 299, with 169 issues remaining
unchanged.

Commerce William Daley were among those Chinese and U.S. officials
attending the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Development Planning Commission, the
contracts and agreements signed in the last week will not only
help increase Sino-U.S. economic and trade ties, but also
demonstrate broad prospects for mutually-beneficial and
complementary economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since China and the U.S. forged diplomatic ties in 1979,
economic cooperation has been developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Customs statistics show Sino-U.S. trade volume in 1997
reached 49 billion U.s. dollars, 20 times the 1979 figure.

<HEADLINE> First Contact Between U.S., KLA Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.S. negotiator for the
Kosovo crisis Richard Holbrooke confirmed Sunday that Washington
had held its first official talks with the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA), Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the sidelines of a political and economic forum in
Kran Montana, Switzerland, Holbrooke said the first official
contact took place Friday between the U.S. special envoy for
former Yugoslavia, Robert Gelbard, and representatives of the KLA
whom he refused to identify.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said Ethnic Albanian political leader Ivrahim Rugova,
a non-violence advocator in seeking Kosovo's independence, knew of
the contacts in advance and supported them.
</P>
<P>
Continuation of the contact would depend on whether the KLA
could control the military forces on ground, Holbrooke added.
</P>
<P>
During his Kosovo visit last Wednesday, Holbrooke himself had
an "occasional and brief talk" with members of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
According to Western estimates, the KLA has seized at least
one-third of the land in Kosovo. The army, composed of Albanian
militants, were reportedly outlawed by Belgrade as a terrorist
group.
</P>
<P>
At least 300 people have died in fighting since February
between Serb forces and the KLA.

TOULOUSE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Dutch captain Frank De Boer said he
was delighted with his top form prior to their second-round clash
against Yugoslavia here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that I've been in such good shape, playing

He promised Monday's match would be a great match as both teams
share the same style.
</P>
<P>
"Both teams are strong in attack. They have the same style game and
good players," said De Boer.
</P>
<P>
But he said he was not impressed by the quality of forwards here
until now.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Romanian Striker Says Team Spirit Best Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BORDEAUX, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan said
that the team spirit would be the best weapon when they face Croatia
in the second round in the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"Our own best asset is the team spirit which has already helped
against England," said Moldovan, who plays for Coventry City in
England.
</P>
<P>
"In the match against Croatia, I believe both teams have the same
chances. We know all our opponents. All of them play in European
championships and are very skilled," he said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Romania will depend much on Moldovan and his striking partner
Adrian Ilie from Valencia in the front.
</P>
<P>
"The players expect a lot from us and I hope to score a goal and
help the team win this match," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he thought the hot weather in Bordeaux would be an
important factor to reckon with in Tuesday's game.

scorching heat that rose to 37 degrees Centigrade.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Gets Foreign Aid in Fighting Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has received 8.3 million U.S.
Dollars in aid from Egypt which has decided to help fight the water
hyacinth in Lake Victoria and its spread down the Nile River.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Ashmawy, the Charge d'Affairs of the Egyptian
embassy to Uganda, was quoted Monday by the East African weekly as saying
that the modalities for disbursing the money are being finalized.
</P>
<P>
"The money has been offered to Uganda, it is up to the government
to decide whether they want to share it with Kenya and Tanzania in
the spirit of East African cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania which share the Lake Victoria have
agreed to fight jointly for the elimination and control of the weed
because the wind keeps blowing it from one place to another.
</P>
<P>
The three East African countries have formed a Lake Victoria
Fisheries Organization based in Jinja, some 80 kms east of Kampala
city, to preserve the lake's eco-system.
</P>
<P>
The water hyacinth on the lake has been hampering the operations
of hydro-electric power plants and fishering activities.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda alone, an estimated 2,000 to 4,000 hectares of the lake
shoreline and bays are infested with the weed, with the lake
containing more than 1.25 million metric tonnes of the weed.
</P>
<P>
Lake Victoria is the main source of livelihood for more than 40
million people in the region and the River Nile, which is partly
covered by the weed, serves as a major source of water for
drinking and irrigation in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The weed reportedly covers 599 kms of the banks of the longest
river in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The weed had brought the business of some landing sites to a halt
and is blamed for the unexplained deaths of fish. It also makes
Uganda's Electricity Board lose 2,700 dollar each month by
interfering with the power generation at the Owen Falls Dam in Jinja.

<HEADLINE> Oil Slick Feared as Ship Sinks in Kenya's Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Oil slick fear is spreading as a
cargo ship with fuel and chemical load went under inside Kenya's
Mombasa port, a leading Indian Ocean port in the whole east
African region.
</P>
<P>
The mv Mirage, a 300-ton vessel bound for Mogadishu, took in
water and sank with goods worth millions of Shillings, resulting
in an immediate environmental disaster alert, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 12-man crew of the sunk vessel have scrambled to safety,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
A Kenya Ports Authority anti-pollution vessel, mv Fagio,
rushed to the scene to try and arrest a possible oil slick. Port
police and maritime experts had a hectic time keeping away
looters and cordoning off the area.
</P>
<P>
As chemicals in the cargo met with the water, foul-smelling
and possibly toxic fumes engulfed the area and choked many people
on the berth.
</P>
<P>
The ship, which started going down at about 7:00 p.m.
Saturday, was wholly submerged by Sunday morning. Only
its top mast could be seen above the quay waters amidst the swirl
of broken cartons and an oilly surface.
</P>
<P>
Captain Harun Mohammed said the ship sank due to instability
caused by irregular loading which left it heavier on one side.
</P>
<P>
He said the vessel started listing on one side and took in
water. Efforts to pump out the water were fruitless.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out over-loading as it had not taken its full
capacity of 300 tons.
</P>
<P>
Among the cargo were tins of chlorine, medicine, tea leaves,
cigarettes, iron sheets, vehicle parts and clothing material.
</P>
<P>
The mv Mirage, formerly known as the Bonsella, sank in similar
circumstances inside the port of Tanga, Tanzania, two years ago
as it loaded goods for Mombasa. It was salvaged in an expensive
exercise which rendered it dormant until recently.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants to Build New Relationship With China: Clinton (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton said here today that the U.S. wants to build a new
relationship with the rapidly developing China for a more peaceful
and prosperous world in the new era.
</P>
<P>
"Everything all of us know about the way the world is changing
and the challenges your generation will face tell us that our two
nations will be far better off working together than apart," said
Clinton in an address to the students and faculty members of
Beijing University, which he visited this morning.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President said that both China and the U.S. should
work to see that the productive relationship the two countries now
enjoy blossoms into a fuller partnership in the new century.
</P>
<P>
"If that is to happen, it is very important that we understand
each other better, that we understand both our common interests and
our shared aspirations and our honest differences," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that an "open, direct exchange"
could both clarify and narrow the differences and give the people
a greater sense of confidence that a better future could be made.
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed the necessity to talk about the "critical
importance" of "building a strong partnership between China and
the United States" to the Chinese students, whom he described as
"the next generation of China's leaders".
</P>
<P>
"Now your country has known more millennia than the United
States has known centuries," said the president. "This new century
can be the dawn of a new China, proud of your ancient greatness,
proud of what you are doing, prouder still of the tomorrows to
come."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the American people deeply admire China
for its major contributions to culture, religion, philosophy and
the arts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Now we see China at a moment in history when your glorious
past is matched by your present sweeping transformation and the
even greater promise of your future," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president also spoke highly of the policy the Chinese
government has adopted during the recent Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"China has steadfastly shouldered its responsibilities to the
region and the world in this latest financial crisis -- helping to
prevent another cycle of dangerous devaluations," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Two visiting U.S. Senators told
the reporters Monday morning after their meeting with Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan that the U.S. and Pakistan will "begin a
dialogue on the new chapter."
</P>
<P>
Sam Brownback said that "we have had some very good initial
discussion" on the regional and bilateral matters.
</P>
<P>
"Our major objective here is to listen and begin a dialogue on
the new chapter between U.S. and Pakistan relationship," the U.S.
Senator said.
</P>
<P>
Brownback said that the U.S. and Pakistan have had a very long
relationship. However, "it's gotten frayed recently with the
things that have happened here. But We need to build further and
that is what the dialogue is about."
</P>
<P>
"So far we have had very good discussions on that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. Senator Charles Robb said on the occasion that "we
had a very candid exchange of views this morning with the Foreign
Minister, which we appreciate."
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. Senators, who arrived here Sunday night, are the
first officials from the U.S. to visit Pakistan after its
detonation of nuclear devices at the end of May. They are expected
to meet with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Finance Minister
Sirtaj Aziz later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Charles said that "our principle reason for coming to Pakistan
at this time is to listen and to begin the dialogue that will
help, hopefully, to re-establish the kind of relationship that
will benefit both countries and ultimately ease tensions in the
region which are understandably high at the moment."
</P>
<P>
While the two U.S. Senators are now in Pakistan, Pakistan's
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed is in the U.S. as the special
envoy of the Prime Minister to engage discussions with the U.S.
leadership.

<P>
LHASA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China's central and local
governments have worked hard to protect the cultural heritages
of the Tibetans, according to local officials in the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The national Constitution and the Law on Regional Autonomy of
Ethnic Groups both clearly define respect, protection,
inheritance, and development of the cultural heritage of ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
China has over 50 institutions involved in Tibetology,
employing more than 2,000 people. Hundreds of books on Tibet have
been published and dozens of seminars on various aspects of
Tibetan culture have been held.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan language is widely studied in local schools, and
Tibetan and Chinese are compulsory subjects in primary and middle
schools, and local government documents, newspapers, radio
stations and television stations must use the two languages.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, an effort has been made to adapt Tibetan words to
computer use, and standards for the use of Tibetan have been
published.

Tibetan medicine and pharmacology have been developed over the
past several decades. Tibet now has 14 Tibetan hospitals, and many
counties have their own Tibetan medicine departments.

historical sites and published a great deal about Tibetan cultural
relics.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economist Sees Good Economic Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Liu Guoguang, a prominent
economist and former vice-president of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, was quoted by today's Shanghai Securities News as
saying that China's economy will pick up again in the latter half
of this year or early next year as a result of expanded domestic
spending and a relaxed credit policy.
</P>
<P>
Liu attribute the recent slowdown in economic growth to
inflation controls, economic restructuring in recent years, the
Asian financial crisis and the failures to implement
counter-measures.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu still believes that this year's target of 8
percent economic growth will be realized, mainly because of the
generally favorable conditions China now finds itself in.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's conditions in transportation, energy, raw
materials, agriculture, foreign exchange reserves, and inflation
are good.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has shifted from cooling down to
accelerating economic growth, and many parts of China have set
their own economic growth target at above 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even though he gives his support to economic growth, he still
emphasises the importance of improving the economic structure and
economic returns.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Sydney 2000 Olympics organizers
said on Monday the cost of staging the Games had blown up by 90
million U.S. dollars, largely because of an increase in the number
of events, according to reports from Sydney.

<P>
A spokesman for the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic
Games (SOCOG) said that the total cost to the SOC0G was now
estimated to stand at A$2.6 billion (1.56 billion U.S. dollars),
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said:"The increase is mainly due to additional
disciplines within sports. But that will be covered by
increases in revenue of the same order."
</P>
<P>
The Spokesman added that the increased revenues would come from
marketing concessions and the sale of television rights beyond
those deals already agreed.
</P>
<P>
Additional events added to the Sydney 2000 program include
women's water polo, whitewater canoeing and trampolining.

<HEADLINE> China's GDP Grows at 7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Peiyan, minister of China's
State Development Planning Commission, was quoted by today's
"People's Daily", the country's leading newspaper, as saying that
the GDP for the January-June period will be around 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that greater effort should be made to increase
economic growth in the latter half to meet the goal of 8 percent
for the whole of 1998. China has increased investment in
infrastructure to spur consumer demand and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months, investment in agriculture, forestry,
animal husbandry, fisheries, and water control was up 10.4 percent
from the 1997 figure, while investment in real estate rose 15.2
percent. Investment in railways for the same period rose 50
percent and for highways, 47.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 59 percent of the housing spending went for apartments for
individual use, a rise of 3.4 percent, and apartment sales were up
45.4 percent, with 63.7 percent of those going to individuals.
</P>
<P>
The increased spending in agriculture, forestry, water control,
railways, highways, telecommunications, environmental protection,
and municipal works will continue, Zeng said, pointing to the need
for finding ways to speed up construction and concentrate manpower
and investment for priority industries.
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, he said, there will be more spending on
state-owned grain depots, power grids in rural areas, more
economic and practical housing, and ecologically-sound
construction.

<HEADLINE> Interest Levels Down on Kenya Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Treasury Bill (TB) yields
continued to drop last week with the Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK)'s 91-day TBs auction yielding an interest level of 25.11
percent, down from 25.42 percent the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The CBK only accepted TBs worth 1.2 billion Shillings (20
million U.S. Dollars) at the lower interest rate compared to the
3.2 billion Shillings (53.3 million Dollars) tendered, the East
African newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A CBK official explained the trend as part of the government's
efforts to reduce the domestic debt from public borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The down in TB yields, combined with measures to reduce cash
ratio from 16 to 15 percent with effective from July 1, have also
led to a drop in the base lending rates of most commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Lending rates have averaged 28 percent and have been cited as
too high and unattractive for most businesses.
</P>
<P>
"The cash ratio does not attract interest and banks have to
charge a high interest rate to recover this from borrowing
customers," said a CBK official.
</P>
<P>
The official said the drop in base lending rates was a
positive and direct result of the reduction in cash radio.
</P>
<P>
The daily cash ratio was also reduced from 12 to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank, Standard-Chartered, Kenya Commercial Bank and
other commercial banks announced last week a one percent drop in
their base lending rates, which now average 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
If the lending rates drop further, it may spark off investor
borrowing, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic debt currently at 160 billion Shillings (2.7
billion Dollars) and being serviced at 43 million Shillings
(716,666 Dollars) monthly, they said externalizing the debt may
lead to inflation if all the government debtors are paid off.
</P>
<P>
In addition, external debts may have stringent time-specific
repayment periods which must be met, unlike the domestic debt
which the government can roll over with a new TB auction, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Resume Passenger Service on Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Railways Corporation
(KRC) will resume domestic passenger transport on Lake Victoria
in July after nearly one year's suspension of the services.
</P>
<P>
KRC has rehabilitated three vessels with modified locomotive
engines fitted to improve the services on the world's second
largest fresh water lake, the East African weekly newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Passenger services in Lake Victoria were suspended last year
after the water hyacinth covered a large area of water routes,
leading to high maintenance costs, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"We want to start with the Mbita, Mfangano, Takawiri, Uyoma
and Asembo bay routes, which i am sure are viable," said Gordon
Owino, KRC's Marine Superintendent.
</P>
<P>
The Homa Bay and Kendu Bay routes are left out because the
two areas are easily accessible by road and will necessitate a
change in time-table.
</P>
<P>
However, there are no plans to re-introduce international
passenger services linking Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
A Tanzanian vessel, mv Bukoba, which used to provide the
regional service, sank in 1995, killing some 800 passengers.
</P>
<P>
In another development, an overnight passenger train from
Nairobi arrived in the Lake Victoria port town of Kisumu on
Sunday -- the first since El Nino floods and landslides washed
away part of the line two months ago.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Opens Court Trials to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- At 8:30 a.m today, Wang Xiangqian,
a teacher from the Beijing Agriculture College, rushed to the
Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court to hear a court trial.
</P>
<P>
"The case to be tried today has nothing to do with me," said
Wang, "I came here just to see how a case is tried in court," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court issued a circular
recently stipulating that, effective June 10, Chinese citizens 18
and older are allowed to attend court hearings by presenting
appropriate identification, with journalists permitted to report
on any open trials.
</P>
<P>
This is the country's first intermediate court to enhance
external supervision by opening trials to the public. Open trials
are part of China's basic judicial system. According to related
Chinese laws, all cases -- excluding those involving state
secrets, privacy and those cases specially ruled by concerned laws
-- should be tried openly and allow non-clients to hear the trials
and allow reporters to cover the trials.
</P>
<P>
However, the open trials have not been implemented fully due to
the small number of courts, a large number of cases and the length
of time for court hearings.
</P>
<P>
Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court has invested more than
200,000 yuan (24,096 US dollars) to install electric screens and
safety examination facilities before allowing citizens to attend
court hearings by presenting identity cards.
</P>
<P>
The court also has worked out corresponding regulations and
work disciplines.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiangqian, with a hearing certificate in hand, wrote down
the trial time and name of the case provided on an electric screen
at the west gate of the court.
</P>
<P>
At 8:50, Wang was allowed to take a visitors' seat in the court.
</P>
<P>
The case to be tried in the court involved compensation for
smuggled mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
Pan Gang, judge of the court, said that open hearings require
judicial staff members to work hard and improve their ability to
handle cases.
</P>
<P>
The new system has been warmly welcomed by local lawyers who
said that the system enhances supervision by the public on court
investigation and debate and also stimulates lawyers and court
workers to improve their personal quality and the capability to
use laws.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 Beijingers and journalists have attended court
hearings each week at the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court
since the new system was adopted on June 10.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Spend Less Time on Cooking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai residents have shortened
their cooking time by 50 percent compared to five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The difference has been attributed to a change in the living
pattern of local people and the rapid development of service
industry.
</P>
<P>
At present, the average daily cooking time for a three-member
family is 69 minutes, while that of five years ago was 125
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Increasing pressure from work and a strong desire for
entertainment have driven more Shanghai residents to eat prepared
foods and vegetables and go to restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Local chain stores and supermarkets can provide some 30 kinds
of semi-finished vegetables and food, and some provide dishes
according to customers' desires.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that most Shanghai residents want to shorten
their cooking time within 45 minutes daily to save time for study
and entertainment.

<HEADLINE> Ex-servicemen Finding Jobs in the Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China's ex-servicemen are trying to
find jobs in the market instead of being assigned by concerned
government departments.
</P>
<P>
To date, nearly 300 ex-servicemen have found jobs through the
labor market in Qingdao, a city in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of a method developed this year by the
Shandong Provincial Labor Bureau of arranging jobs for
ex-servicemen, which provides freedom for them to choose jobs and
freedom for work units to employ workers.
</P>
<P>
Many work units say they employ ex-servicemen because they
think that ex-servicemen are hard workers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Desert Reclamation Project To Benefit Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Reclaiming the Kubch Desert in the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region could improve the water quality
in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, said a
Japanese desert reclamation expert and his Chinese partner.
</P>
<P>
Seiei Tohyama, 92, presides over the Kubch Desert reclamation
project. The elderly Japanese said he came to that conclusion on
the river after working in the desert for nearly 10 years with
Chinese partner Wang Haiming.
</P>
<P>
The Kubch Desert, one of China's eight major deserts, is
located on the south of China's Yellow River and is the source of
one-fourth of the sand in the river. In summer, heavy rains wash
more than 300 million tons of sand into the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
"To reclaim the desert with flood and to control flood with
sand" is the successful experience of the Chinese and Japanese
developers of Engbey, which lies in the recesses of the Kubch
Desert.
</P>
<P>
Planting trees and restoring vegetation is the main task of
reclaiming the desert in Engbey, said Tohyama, who added that
nearly 10,000 Japanese volunteers have come here to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the flood season each summer, the Engbey developers
build a sand dam, which is several kilometers long, to block the
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
When the water rushes into the enclosed sand dam, it flattens
dunes with the force of water and wind. The flood carries large
amounts of mud and humus from the Ordos Highland, and a fine
stretch of arable land forms as a result.
</P>
<P>
In this way, not only is the desert reclaimed, but the flooding
also is controlled.
</P>
<P>
At present, 2,000 hectares of arable land planted with 2
million trees has been developed in the 20,000-hectare in Engbey,
which used to be an isolated desert without residents 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,600 hectares of desert have also been reclaimed in
Engbey and the percentage of forest cover has climbed to 90
percent from the previous 5 percent, said Wang Haiming, director
of the desert development exemplary zone of Engbey.
</P>
<P>
Developers also built two reservoirs and a canal by enclosing
gullies that formed after the encroachment of floods. The
reservoirs and canal can store as much as 100 million cubic meters
of water.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday
that negotiations with the Palestinians over the second
redeployment will be concluded by July 29, when the Knesset
(parliament) recesses for the summer. He also urged the
Palestinian National Authority to implement its commitment to
fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian negotiators rejected several days ago a
U.S. proposal to hold direct talks with Israeli officials on some
of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ideas for the peace
process, sources close to the negotiation say.
</P>
<P>
Under the Netanyahu initiative, 3 percent of a proposed 13
percent second redeployment in the West Bank should be subject to
special restrictions. And Israel would have veto power over
Palestinian planning and construction in this 3 percent zone.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Deputy Chief of General Staff Matan Vilnai said on
Sunday that Israel must draft a new national security doctrine
that takes into account the growing missile and non-conventional
threat in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Vilnai said the Israeli Army must "update everything,"
including the means to deter states such as Iraq and Iran which do
not share a border with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Incentive Projects for Investment Fall in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Investment (BoI) in
Thailand approved promotional privileges for 328 projects worth
130 billion baht (3.17 billion U.S. dollars) during the first five
months of this year, far below the 414 projects a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Some 414 projects worth 196 billion baht (7.84 billion dollars)
were recorded during January to May in 1997, the Bangkok Post said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
By way of comparison, during the period, investors were
primarily interested in electronics, agro-industry and garments
and textiles.
</P>
<P>
The BoI approved 65 projects in the electronics sector which
represent 19.8 percent of total approvals against 13.5 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The agro-industry and light industry also saw an increase over
the period.
</P>
<P>
The BoI said the approved projects could create 65,322 jobs for
the period.
</P>
<P>
Japan remained the biggest investor during the period, with 95
projects approved, though down from 126 projects over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Europe ranked second with 56 projects approved compared with 49
projects a year before. Investment projects from the United States
also went up to 41 from 27 of last year.

<HEADLINE> BOC to Help Housing Items </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) pledged
to provide six billion yuan (722 million US dollars) in loans to
the Famous Brand Construction and Development Co Ltd under a
Ministry of Construction program designed to speed up construction
of experimental residential quarters this year, today's "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest loan agreement ever between a Chinese
commercial bank and a real estate company.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Construction started construction of
experimental residential quarters in 1989. By March, the ministry
had built more than 400 residential quarters in more than 300
cities across China.
</P>
<P>
According to bank sources, BOC will increase its proportion of
real estate sector loans by two percentage points each year,
raising the rate to 8 percent from the current 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The proportional increase means that BOC's outstanding loans
for the real estate sector will soon increase from 20 billion yuan
(2.41 billion US dollars) to 56 billion yuan (6.75 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
BOC, China's major foreign exchange bank, budgeted 11 billion
yuan (1.33 billion US dollars) in loans for housing construction
and consumption this year. The figure is 18 percent of the bank's
increased loans for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lending priority will be given to ordinary residential housing
construction and to real estate projects now under construction,
the paper reported.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Media Follow Closely Clinton's China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Major Finnish newspapers are
paying close attention to U.S. President Bill Clinton's China
visit, hailing that the historic event would enhance the
partnership between the two powers and exert great influence on
the world situation.
</P>
<P>
The national newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, said in an editorial
on Saturday that Clinton's trip was one of the most significant
events in the world this year and that the economic reality played
an important role in his visit.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also noted China's economic reforms and growing
prosperity have created a market that attracts even the most
powerful country in the world.
</P>
<P>
China's unrelenting efforts not to devalue its currency RMB
have already won high praises from the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
An editorial in the leading Finnish newspaper, Aamulehti, said
Friday that China, with a 1.2 billion population, could not be
isolated. It would be impossible for the world to achieve economic
stability without China, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
It said that China's efforts to ease the economic crisis,
including promising not to devalue its currency RMB, have earned
worldwide appreciation. The Asian giant was proceeding to a market
economy step by step with democracy and freedom following closely
behind, the editorial added.
</P>
<P>
Another Finnish newspaper, Etela-Suomen Sanomat, said in a
commentary Friday that the top priority of Clinton's China trip
was to develop friendship and trade relations between the U.S. and
China.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also have similar interests in the Asian
financial crisis, tension and concerns over nuclear proliferation
provoked by India's and Pakistan's nuclear tests, the commentary
said.

<HEADLINE> Credit Set to Boost Thai Imports From Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- An export credit worth more than
100 million U.S. dollars from an Italian financial institution is
ready to be granted to Thai industrial manufacturers importing
Italian capital goods, the newspaper The Nation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Franco Passaro, trade commissioner of the Italian Trade
Commission, said the 100 million dollar credit, supported by
Mediobanca, an Italian private financial institution, was geared
to help the Thai industrial sector through the Industrial Finance
Corporation of Thailand (IFCT).
</P>
<P>
The minimum contract value to be granted through the loan is
750,000 dollars per project. Mediobanca will offer financing for
85 percent of the total contract value, with the remainder being
paid in cash by Thai importers.
</P>
<P>
The life span of the loan is around five to eight years with an
interest rate close to the London Interbank Borrowing Rate
(Libor), the newspaper quoted Passaro as saying.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be extended to match rising credit demand.
Passaro said this credit would assist the industrial sector to
make productivity and efficiency more competitive in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
To survive in tough competition, technology and product quality
need to be upgraded, he said.
</P>
<P>
The current economic crisis has led to shrinking Italian
machinery imports, which was worth 5.2 million dollars last year
compared with 19.64 million dollars in 1996 and 21.37 million
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to Passaro, several Italian investors are eyeing
Thailand for investment, particularly in the sectors of frozen
food processing, textiles, plastic machinery and property.

<HEADLINE> Italian Media Hail China as Leading Force for World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Italian media gave wide coverage
to U.S. President Bill Clinton's tour of China over the weekend,
saying China, with its importance growing in the international
arena, is a leading force for peace and stability in Asia and the
world.
</P>
<P>
Leading newspapers, news agencies, radios and TV stations
across the country devoted lengthy and detailed reports to the
summit between Clinton and his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin on
Saturday and the following press conference.
</P>
<P>
Eye-catching headlines accompanied by large photos depicting
Clinton's China visit appeared on the front pages of almost all
Italian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The media and public opinion here are of the view that
improvement of Sino-U.S. relations, with its significance reaching
beyond a bilateral framework, not only benefits the two countries
concerned but also contributes to the peace and stability in the
region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Italy's top economic daily Il Sole-24 Ore, leading national
newspapers Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica, and ANSA news
agency all prominently highlighted China's renewed promise not to
devalue its currency RMB.
</P>
<P>
Their reports said Beijing's pledge reflects its economic
strength and confidence, marking the stability of its currency and
the entire financial market.
</P>
<P>
Noting a stable RMB was making valuable contribution to the
financial order in Asia and even the world, the reports said
China's enormous efforts helped the world avert a financial crisis
that had once threatened to go out of control.
</P>
<P>
An economically developed and powerful China is a leading force
in maintaining stability and security in the world and in Asia in
particular, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Sino-U.S. agreement on stop targeting their
nuclear missiles against each other, the Italian media said the
accord laid a solid foundation for the prevention of a nuclear war
between the two countries and provided a reliable assurance for
world peace.
</P>
<P>
The reports hailed that the two countries have established a
"constructive strategic partnership" towards the 21st century,
turning a new leaf in the bilateral relations and striking a new
political balance in Asia.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton on Improving Mutual Understanding Between China, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton today
expressed the hope that his state visit to China would help
improve mutual understanding and respect between the people of
China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that my trip would help to show a full and balanced
picture of modern China to the U.S., and that my coming here would
encourage others to come here, and others to participate in the
life of China," the President told students and faculty of Beijing
University, which he visited this morning.
</P>
<P>
At a gathering of nearly 1,000 people, a student of the
university pointed out that the Americans don't know as much about
the Chinese as the Chinese do about them, and asked President
Clinton what he planned to do to change this situation.
</P>
<P>
Calling the question "a very good point," Clinton said that one
of the reasons for his visit to China is to improve the mutual
understanding and respect between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes many more Americans would come here to study,
to tour and to do business.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that "there is no easy answer" to the
student's question, and that "it's something we have to work at."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka Affected by East Asian Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka, which was initially not
affected by the East Asian currency crisis, is now feeling the
impact.
</P>
<P>
Within the last week the Colombo Stock Exchange recorded a drop
of 5.22 percent, the second biggest after a 6.07-percent decline
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The all share price index closed at 606.4 points, down from
639.8, and the sensitive index closed at 926.6, down from 977.1.
Turnover also dropped drastically to 1.27 million U.S. dollars at
the weekend from 4.23 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the Asian region have since July last year had a
rough time in terms of investment. The Colombo Stock Market too
has witnessed a net outflow of foreign funds amounting to 24.1
million dollars with a net outflow of 6.65 million dollars in May
this year alone.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between India and Pakistan for nuclear supremacy in
the South Asian region has only made the crisis worse for Sri
Lanka. The total share capital fund base of the stock exchange now
stands at 1.8 billion dollars of which only 25 percent is foreign
share capital.
</P>
<P>
At the moment the quantum of foreign investment coming in is
negligible. Foreign purchases in May 1998 was 8.95 million dollars
while the sale of shares held by foreigners was nearly double that
figure at 15.61 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen here bemoaned that the stock market is "reeling"
but they are hopeful that foreign fund managers will return once
the regional crisis settles. When that will be nobody could
confirm, however.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here said Sri Lanka's local economy is sound,
with local companies having recorded good profits. Especially the
plantation sector has performed extremely well.
</P>
<P>
Despite favorable conditions, there is no overall upward
movement  in the market as Sri Lanka leans heavily on foreign
funds. Hence it has been impossible to avoid the impact of the
regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
With currencies in Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and India being
devalued, Sri Lanka will find it difficult to compete
internationally if it does not devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank believes that there is no need for
any sudden devaluation. The Sri Lankan currency is allowed to
adjust on its own and on this basis, it has already depreciated by
6 to 8 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative financial sources here recently have warned that
foreign funds operating in the region might dry up totally and
they are likely to flee South Asia altogether to avoid the impact
of sanctions against India and Pakistan imposed for their nuclear
tests in May.
</P>
<P>
Local investors have been cautioned that it is not prudent to
buy shares held by foreign investors which are on offer these days
as such shares are said to bear a very high price in value and
they would provide liquidity for the foreign companies moving out.
</P>
<P>
Projects undertaken by foreign investors particularly from
Asian countries have virtually come to a standstill in Sri Lanka.
The investors are short of funds due to the currency crisis and
some of them are even putting their investments up for sale.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister G. L. Peiris is however optimistic and
said that it is only temporary that the investors are moving out
and that the Sri Lankan government is finding alternative means to
attract other investors.
</P>
<P>
He sees no need to devalue the Sri Lankan rupee as it is not
artificially propped up. He even deems the sanctions imposed on
India and Pakistan as an opportunity for Sri Lanka to attract
investment.
</P>
<P>
To prevent cheap goods flowing into Sri Lanka because of the
currency devaluation in neighboring countries, Peiris said Sri
Lanka will introduce anti-dumping legislation.
</P>
<P>
Peiris claimed that Sri Lanka has not suffered as much from the
currency crisis as some other countries in Asia because Sri
Lanka's macroeconomic fundamentals are sound.
</P>
<P>
Former Finance Minister Ronnie De Mel rules out the chances of
the East Asian crisis frizzling out soon. He believes that the
effect of the large-scale devaluation of currencies in countries
in the region will have a serious impact on Sri Lanka's economy.

<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton today
reiterated that the United States will stick to its one-China
policy, arguing that the U.S. sales of weapons to Taiwan is not an
obstacle to the peaceful reunification of China's mainland and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remark in response to a question posed by a
Beijing University student on whether U.S. arms sales to the
Taiwan and the renewed U.S.-Japan security treaty, reportedly
covering Taiwan, run against the U.S. government's one-China
policy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he reaffirmed the U.S. policy that recognizes only
one China in the meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. encourages the cross-Taiwan Straits
dialogue to achieve a peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is that any weapons sales therefore to Taiwan must
be for defense purposes only," Clinton asserted, " and China must
not believe we are in anyway trying to undermine our own one-China
policy."
</P>
<P>
On the renewed U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, he claimed that the
U.S.-Japan security agreement is not directed against any country.

today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
To ease traffic congestion in large Chinese cities, the State
Council recently approved the construction of Shanghai Pearl Line
(Line 3), Metro Shenzhen and Guangzhou Metro Line 2. Meanwhile,
construction of other lines in Wuhan, Nanjing, Chongqing, Qingdao
and Dalian are expecting approval.
</P>
<P>
"Completion of these metro lines will demand a large number of
railway cars, which created a golden opportunity for us," said
Teng Maogen, vice-director of Changchun Car Co., the only railway
car supplier in China.
</P>
<P>
As the State Council has required a minimum of 60 percent local
content in construction of railway cars, the company has
established with the Europe-based ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation
GmbH the Changchun Adtranz Railway Vehicle Co. Ltd in Changchun.
</P>
<P>
The new joint venture will focus on local manufacturing,
assembly and testing of metro cars, light rail vehicles, multiple
units and aluminum car body shells. The annual production capacity
is planned at 160 vehicles, which are to supply the demand in
Shenzhen, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Since the first metro was turned out in 1965, China has had 70
kilometers of subways operating in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and
Guangzhou, according to China Railway Society Statistics. The
Changchun Car Co. has supplied all of China's domestically
produced 453 metro vehicles in Beijing and Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Contacts With Kosovo Liberation Army Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations Richard Holbrooke has confirmed that U.S. officials had
made formal contacts with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke revealed in Switzerland that on Friday a U.S. envoy
on the Balkans held the United States' first official contact with
KLA representatives at a site he did not disclose. The KLA is the
armed wing of Kosovo ethnic Albanians who are seeking independence
from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke also disclosed that during his visit to Kosovo he
himself "accidentally and briefly chatted" with KLA members on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States is likely to continue its contacts with the
KLA, he said, adding that Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
knew about the contact before hand and supported it.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has sunk into chaos since pro-independence ethnic
Albanians clashed with local Serb police in February. More than
300 persons have been killed since then. Reports said the KLA had
taken loose control over more than a third of Kosovo in less than
four months.

<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton said here today that he will do his job to build good
relations between the United States and China, which is in the
interest of the American people rather than containing China.
</P>
<P>
When asked by a class 1997 student after his address at
Beijing University this morning whether he has a "secret design"
behind his smile to the Chinese people, Clinton said: "No, I don't."
</P>
<P>
"You ask me if we really want to contain China. The answer is
'no'," he told Chinese and American audience in a stadium in
Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that it will be far better for the people of the
United States to have a partnership on equal, respectful terms
with China in the 21st century than to have to spend enormous
amount of time and money trying to contain China because we
disagree with what's going on," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I do not want it (to contain China). I want a partnership
(between the two countries. So I am not having another design
behind my smile. It's what I really believe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at American people," he added, "they always have a
warm feeling toward China."
</P>
<P>
"If you go back to the history of our country, there's
always been a feeling on the part of our people that we ought to
be close to the Chinese people," President Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Communications Up in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar stepped up installation of
modern communications facilities in the 1997-98 fiscal year,
bringing about a 16.3-percent growth in the sector's services
value over the previous year, said a latest official economic
report.
</P>
<P>
To expedite its posts and telecommunications services, Myanmar
extended its mail services including express money order services
in the fiscal year ending March, a current report of the country's
financial, economic and social conditions said.
</P>
<P>
Especially since the beginning of the fiscal year, the Myanmar
communications authorities have been carrying out the foremost
express postal services in collaboration with the Netherlands' DHL
Worldwide Express Ltd. on a joint-venture basis, linking 227
countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also expanded the installation of facsimiles, sending
telegraphs by computers for rapid communications services.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Myanmar extended construction of long-distance lines,
installation of new microwave links and auto-telephone exchange
lines in rural and border areas.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of microwave links in 1995, the capital
of Yangon had been able to connect with nine other cities through
the system at the end of the fiscal year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The number of telephones in Myanmar also increased by 33,000 in
1997-98 to exceed 232,000. Of the telephones, cellular phones rose
by 1,700 in number, adding up to 8,947.
</P>
<P>
The number of international direct dialing (IDD) telephones
went up to 2,907 from 1,914 and that of facsimiles to 1,945 from
1,695.
</P>
<P>
A total of 62 towns and cities had already had auto-telephones
at the end of the fiscal year, it stated.
</P>
<P>
In 1997-98, Myanmar began introducing a CDMA radio-telephone
system in the capital with an initial 3,000 lines in operation.
</P>
<P>
For overseas services, the country added more than 800
telephone channels in the year to directly link 16 countries.
</P>
<P>
Under an Asia-Europe marine communications project, Myanmar
participated in building terminal stations in the year,
anticipating further improvement in international telephone
communication services.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's posts and telecommunications sector contributed 1.6
percent to the gross domestic product in the 1997-98 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Budget Deficit Seen to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's budget
deficit is expected to rise to as high as 21 billion pesos (525
million U.S. dollars) in the first half of the year, a newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are already off track vis-a-vis the country's fiscal
program this year... Estimates for the first semester deficit run
to as high as 21 billion pesos," incoming Finance Secretary
Edgardo Espiritu was quoted as saying by Manila Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit was already 15.4 billion pesos (385 million
dollars) at the end of May following a revenue collection
shortfall brought about by a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
The government has committed under an International Monetary
Fund program to post a 5-billion-peso (125 million dollars)
surplus by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to Espiritu, however, the year-end budget position
would reach a deficit of about 40 billion pesos (1 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rising budget deficit is seen to keep banks' interest rates
high and force the government to reduce allocation for
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu and other members of the new cabinet will assume
office Tuesday afternoon after President-Elect Joseph Estrada
takes his oath of office at noon Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Private Companies In East China Province Tapping Global Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Qiu Jibao, a farmer from Taizhou
County in east China's Zhejiang Province, set up a small sewing
machine factory with his hard-earned savings 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has seized every opportunity to expand his
business abroad. He first cracked the Peruvian market and now his
products sell well in South America, the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
His company manufactures 600,000 sewing machines a year to
become one of the largest in China.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of Qiu's products are exported to 73 countries
and regions, which ranks his enterprise first among its Chinese
counterparts in earning foreign exchange for five consecutive
years.
</P>
<P>
Qiu's success story is not surprising in Zhejiang. Many local
companies have established branches or offices abroad to
streamline the export of local products and small commodities.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 3,200 local private enterprises have been
engaged in exporting, with annual earnings of 6 billion yuan (722
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The success of private enterprises has also aroused the
attention of the provincial government, which has vowed to give
more preferential treatment to private enterprises.

"We do not seek to impose our vision on others. But we are
convinced that certain rights are universal...that, as one of the
heroes of our independence, Thomas Jefferson, wrote in his last
letter 172 years ago 'all eyes are opened, or opening, to the
rights of man.' I believe that everywhere, people aspire to
be treated with dignity...to give voice to their opinions...to
choose their own leaders...to associate with whom they wish... to
worship how, when and where they want. These are not American
rights or European rights or developed world rights. They are the
birthrights of people everywhere..."
</P>
<P>
"Economic security is an essential element of freedom. In
China, the extraordinary strides you have taken in nurturing that
liberty and spreading freedom from want will be a source of
strength for your people in the 21st century. But true freedom
must mean more than economic opportunity. In America, we believe
that freedom itself is indivisible."
</P>
<P>
"...We believe, and our experience demonstrates, that freedom
strengthens stability. In the global Information Age, freedom is a
powerful engine of progress. China's greatest source of strength
resides in the minds and hearts of its citizens. It is profoundly
in your interest - and the world's - that those minds be free to
reach the fullness of their potential. That is the message of our
times and the mandate of the 21st century."

<HEADLINE> Over-Pessimism Will Cause Recession: Singapore Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, JUNE 29 (XINHUA) -- Singapore Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew said here Sunday night that over-pessimism will cause
recession in face of the present economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at a fund-raising dinner held by the Tanjong Pagar
Community Development Council to mark its first founding
anniversary, Lee said Singaporeans must not become
over-pessimistic and drastically reduce spending because that will
cause the domestic economy to contract more.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore's economy is in for a longer downturn than he
expected six months ago. But in all probability Singapore will
avoid negative growth this year unless further disastrous external
events intercede, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore had 5.8 percent growth in GDP in the first
quarter and preliminary figures show positive growth in the second
quarter. But the figures trend downward, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On ways to stimulate the economy, he said the best strategy is
to cut costs for employers to boost their competitiveness and
increase liquidity in the money market, and keep retrenchments to
a minimum.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government is expected to announce in the
parliament later Monday the much-anticipated off-budget measures
to boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
The senior minister pointed out that the economic slowdown in
Singapore is not going to go away as easily as in 1985/1986
because then the cause of the recession was in Singapore and
problems could be corrected domestically.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the setbacks suffered by Singapore on external
factors including a deep regional downturn and a severe reduction
in external demand.
</P>
<P>
He said that this time the cause is not in Singapore, but in
the outside, in the region including Japan which has problems big
enough to affect the United States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Noting that recent economic and political troubles in Indonesia
and the economic recession in Japan have brought all economies in
East Asia to a lower level, he estimated that Singapore would take
 12 to 18 months to get out of the problems while its neighbors
might take two to three years.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore and the region will not fully recover until Japan
recovers and nobody at the present can say with confidence when
that will be," he stressed.

BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
deliver a speech to students and faculty of Beijing University
(Beida) this morning during his tour of the campus. The following
are excerpts of his speech:
</P>
<P>
"As you build a new China, America wants to build a new
relationship with you for a new century. We want China to be
successful, secure and open... working with us for a more
peaceful and prosperous future. There are those in my country who
question whether working with China is in our interests. There are
those in China who ask whether closer relations with the United
States make sense for China. But everything we know about the way
the world is changing and the challenges your generation will face
tell us that our two nations will be better off working together
than apart."
</P>
<P>
"... I would like the productive relationship we now enjoy to
blossom into a fuller partnership for the new century. If that is
to happen, it is important that we understand each other better --
Our common interests and aspirations and our differences. I
believe the kind of open, direct exchange President Jiang and I
had Saturday -- which I know many of you watched on television --
can both clarify and narrow our differences, and more important,
can change lives for the better."

</P>
<P>
The "Pocket Atlas of China" was printed by a publishing house
in Tokyo on March 1, 1943, according to its back cover.
</P>
<P>
The atlas has a deep green cover and is the size of an adult's
hand. It includes 13 folded maps, each 35.5 centimeters (cm) long
and 17 cm wide when unfolded.
</P>
<P>
The content page of the atlas lists the names of the 13 maps
which include "Map of China," "Guangdong and Guangxi," "Xinjiang"
and "Tibet." Taiwan is not included on any of the maps.
</P>
<P>
On the "Map of China," the northeast three provinces of China
were marked outside China's border and were named "Manchuria,"
which completely exposed the aggressive ambitions and actions of
the Japanese militarists to invade and occupy northeast China's
Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin provinces during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The atlas is in the possession of Xue Guangyao, who got it from
his father, Xue Ming.
</P>
<P>
"My father was the secretary of the Changzhi County Committee
of the Communist Party of China in north China's Shanxi Province
during the anti-Japanese War," Xue said. "He seized seven atlases
including the 'Pocket Atlas of China' from Wang Dehou, a puppet
army officer, at a battle."
</P>
<P>
"Wang confessed he got the atlas from a Japanese lieutenant who
used it for military purposes," Xue said.
</P>
<P>
The other six atlases were lost during the Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976), according to Xue.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only one that survived," he said.
