Five Dead in Suburban Pa. Shootings
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   McKEES ROCKS, Pa. (AP) -- A white man opened fire in several suburban
Pittsburgh communities, killing five people and critically wounding a sixth in
what police called a racially motivated shooting spree. The man was apprehended
and charged. The shootings took place within a 20-mile range through suburbs
surrounding Pittsburgh during about an hour span Friday afternoon. The gunman
fatally shot a person of Indian descent at an Indian grocery store, two
employees at a Chinese restaurant and a black man at a martial arts school. A
Jewish woman who lived next door to the suspect's relatives was found dead in
her home. The suspect, Richard Baumhammers, 34, a laywer, was charged with
criminal homicide and reckless endangerment in the martial arts school shooting.
He was being held without bail.

U.S. Urges Breakup of Microsoft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the largest trust-busting move since AT&AMP;T, the
government asked a federal court today to break software giant Microsoft into
two companies. If accepted by a federal judge, the proposal would bar Microsoft
officers and directors, including billionaire co-founder Bill Gates, from owning
stock in more than one of the new companies. Under the government proposal,
Microsoft would be split into rival companies. One would produce its Windows
operating software, the other company would handle other software applications,
such as word processing, spreadsheet and database programs.

U.S. Wants Missile Treaty Changes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has outlined to Russian
negotiators a two-phase program to defend the United States against missile
attack from Asia and later from the Middle East, a senior U.S. official said
today. Deployment of a limited defense, involving 100 launchers and improved
radar, is envisaged for 2005. North Korea, at this point, is considered the
mostly likely Asian country to attack U.S. targets. The second phase, involving
additional interceptors and radar and a second deployment site, would rely on an
orbiting satellite system that is not due to be completed before 2010, the
senior U.S. official told The Associated Press.

Miami Police Chief Resigns
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A day after the Miami mayor fired the city manager, the police
chief resigned today amid the Elian Gonzalez furor. Stepping down, Police Chief
William O'Brien lashed out at Mayor Joe Carollo, who had criticized him for
failing to notify the mayor about the federal raid to seize the 6-year-old Cuban
refugee. ''I refuse to be the chief of police in a city that has someone as
divisive and destructive as Joe Carollo as mayor,'' O'Brien said. O'Brien said
he didn't want to tip off the mayor to the Elian raid because the mayor is
Cuban-American and had openly sided with the Miami relatives.

   BLUEFIELD, W.Va. (AP) -- Two executives in one of the nation's biggest bank
failures were convicted today of obstructing a federal investigation into how
$515 million in assets vanished from the only bank in a West Virginia coal town.
Terry L. Church, former senior vice president of now-defunct First National Bank
of Keystone, and Michael H. Graham, a bank vice president and director, were
found guilty in a case that could cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as
much as $750 million. Church was convicted of one count of conspiracy and two
counts of obstruction. Graham was convicted of one count of obstruction.

with many saying they had been trying to reach Florida. They were among 288 boat
people, many weakened or unconscious from exposure and dehydration, stranded on
a deserted Bahamian island. The Haitians, discovered Wednesday night, were from

<HEADLINE> CSEA members vote to accept contract  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Pending Legislative approval, workers in New
York's largest state employee union will soon be working under
contract for the first time in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Civil Service Employees Association members voted 44,245 to
2,478 to approve the new contract to replace the one that expired
April 1, 1999, the union announced Friday. The union represents
about 77,000 state workers.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature must also approve the contract before it
can take effect. Lawmakers traditionally approve contracts
negotiated and approved by Gov. George Pataki and unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this sends a message across the state to every
politician in every town and village that CSEA members are alive
and well and strong in their union,'' said CSEA president Danny
Donohue. ''Not only did they stand up for their rights, but they
got a contract that was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract gives workers across-the-board wage increases of 3
percent retroactive to October 1999, 3 percent effective April 2000
and 3.5 percent in both April 2001 and April 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The contract also has provisions to eliminate the 3 percent
yearly pension contribution for state employees who have worked 10
years or more. All workers will receive a $500 bonus and workers
with more than 24 years experience will get pension credits based
on how long they've held their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The incentives mean workers with more than 10 years service will
receive a 22 percent increase in salary over the life of the pact.
</P>
<P>
   Union members and Pataki's negotiators reached a tentative
agreement on the new contract in March to end a year of bitterness.
Union members contended Pataki was showing little respect for them
with his administration's contract offers.
</P>
<P>
   CSEA, often joined by members of another contract-less public
employee union, the Public Employees Federation, picketed Pataki at
numerous public appearances over the past year both in New York and
in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Also possibly fueling the resentment of CSEA members during the
contract impasse was the fact the union's leadership had endorsed
Pataki for re-election in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a fair contract that recognizes the contributions of
our CSEA employees and protects the taxpayers,'' Pataki said Friday
in a statement released by his office. ''This contract positions
our employees and the state well for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue also called the new contract fair, although he said it
should have come earlier and included more.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an old axiom about what labor really wants is more ...
clearly we would have liked more, but this is a fair contract,'' he
said. ''When you get 44,000 people saying yes and only 2,000 saying
no, I think that says something.''
</P>
<P>
   CSEA's mainly blue-collar state workers rejected by a
9,251-17,194 margin the first tentative contract agreement their
negotiators made with the state in March 1999. That contract would
have raised wages by 11 percent over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Workers represented by PEF, New York's second-largest public
employees union, are still without a contract.

<HEADLINE> Clinton and Giuliani courting Independence Party  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton and her
cancer-stricken Senate rival, Rudolph Giuliani, planned to court
support today from the New York arm of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, it had been unclear if the first lady would attend
the Independence Party forum in Buffalo. The mayor had earlier
announced his intention to attend and reiterated that even after
announcing Thursday that he had prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon's forum amounts to a job interview with
Independence Party leaders who will select their Senate candidate
in late May or early June at their state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton has been concerned that having the
Independence Party Senate line could put her on a ticket headed by
conservative Pat Buchanan, a leading contender for the Reform
Party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a problem with Mr. Buchanan,'' the first lady said
Wednesday during a campaign stop in western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has expressed similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the last-minute decision to attend the forum,
Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said Friday that
''Hillary is determined to travel around the state and talk with as
many people as possible about why she is running for the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton is also concerned about being linked with
Lenora Fulani, a leader of the left-wing New Alliance Party who is
now a major force in New York's Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the attraction of third-party nominations is strong
in New York when candidates expect a close race. Polls show the
Clinton-Giuliani race is just that. Unlike other states, New York
allows major party candidates to also run on third-party ballot
lines and combine their vote totals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Republican George Pataki beat Democratic incumbent
Mario Cuomo in the governor's race on the strength of the
Conservative Party vote.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Independence Party became New York's third
largest political party. As of March 1, it had more than 172,471
members. The Conservative Party fell into fourth place with 171,496
members. Both are dwarfed by the Democratic (4.96 million members)
and the Republican (3.09 million members) parties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the line brought more than 109,000 extra votes to
Democrat Charles Schumer as he beat Republican incumbent Alfonse
D'Amato in the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has said he will decide within a few weeks, after
consulting with his doctors about treatment options, whether to
continue with his Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party is in the midst of turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, a state judge reinstated Jack Essenberg as
the state party chairman, ruling that he had been ousted illegally
by Fulani's faction and other party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Essenberg said Friday that while the Senate forum had been
arranged by his opponents in the party and he would not be
attending, he was encouraging other party members and the
prospective candidates to attend.
</P>
<P>
   But Essenberg made it clear that he also wanted nothing to do
with Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rather have the (presidential ballot) line blank than
have Buchanan,'' Essenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulani is backing Buchanan.

<HEADLINE> Upbeat Giuliani campaign trail  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- In his first campaign appearance
since revealing he has prostate cancer, an upbeat Rudolph Giuliani
says he ''wants to be senator'' but needs to determine treatment
before making a decision on his Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully I'll be able to do that and run and give you the
kind of candidate you deserve.'' Giuliani told about 1,000 upstate
voters at a dinner Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City mayor was greeted with standing ovations and
cheers a the $50-a-plate event hosted by the Saratoga County
Women's Republican Club.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief question and answer session before the event,
Giuliani said he ''needs a little more than a day and a half''
before he could make any decision on the race against first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton. The mayor announced his cancer diagnosis on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need the next week, 10 days, maybe two weeks, to figure out
the proper course of treatment. I'm going to do that and than I'm
going to make a decision and whether I can or cannot campaign,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who he would support if he decides not to run,
Giuliani said, ''I'm not going to get into that. I know who I don't
want to support.''
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Giuliani drew laughter when he joked about
being mayor in the heavily Democratic New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in a state of confusion. I've never seen so many
Republicans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While not mentioning his opponent by name, Giuliani again
attacked the Clinton administration in his speech, charging the
president's claim of a successful bomb attack against Iraq late in
1998 over Saddam Hussein's refusal to conduct weapons inspection
was a ''Clintonian victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Clintonian words do not mean what they say,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani referred to declining crime rates and increased job
growth his crime-fighting record and the city's job growth in
recent years, saying he's elected senator, he would bring those
qualities to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who had previously criticized Mrs. Clinton as a
carpetbagger, said, ''I want to be a senator because I was born in
this state, because I worked for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, also at the event,
said he's ''confident that (Giuliani) will do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no second choice,'' Bruno said. ''He overcame
obstacles and he will overcome whatever life brings him.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Giuliani's speech, Beth Liebich, former chairwoman
of the Republican Committee in Clifton Park, said the mayor is
''magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He is enthusiastic and ready to go forward,'' Liebich said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Giuliani made a brief appearance at New York
City Hall, where he received a gift of get-well cannolis fresh from
a Staten Island bakery. City Councilman James Oddo, R-S.I., told
Giuliani that ''my mother is setting record laps on the rosary on
your behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani took a bite of the cannoli and posed for pictures
during the public hearing. ''The cannolis look great,'' Giuliani
said. ''Cannolis cure everything.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, the mayor, who has received hundreds of
calls from well-wishers, returned many -- including one to Yankees
Manager Joe Torre, who had surgery for prostate cancer last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you hear the word cancer, it's frightening. It's still
frightening, but cancer is no longer a death sentence. That has to
be first and foremost in your mind,'' Torre said later during a
pre-game media availability at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He said the mayor seemed in good spirits, and that the only
advice Torre offered Giuliani was that he should listen to his
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he will cut some of his campaign stops to make
time for consultation with doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cancel about half and do about half and that'll give me the
time to do this properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first cancellations were two speeches before lawyers' groups
scheduled for Monday -- one in Syracuse, the other in Rochester --
commemorating Law Day. Both were originally set up as part of
Giuliani's mayoral duties, not his Senate campaign, a spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   A scheduled stop today in Buffalo where Giuliani will court the
support of the Independence Party will proceed as planned, aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign spokesman said the first lady will also
attend the event hosted by New York's arm of the Reform Party.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Ante Razov scored two of Chicago's four
second-half goals as the Fire rallied to rout the Tampa Bay Mutiny
5-1 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 1-0, the hosts tied the game in the 26th minute, when
Peter Nowak took a return pass from Jesse Marsch and fired a shot
past Tampa Bay goalkeeper Scott Garlick from the edge of the
penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire (3-3-1) jumped ahead two minutes after halftime, as

made it 3-1 in the 53rd minute thanks to Diego Gutierrez's cross.

   Razov then assisted on Kubik's goal in the 71st minute and
capped the scoring with four minutes left with help from Nowak and

<HEADLINE> Rocker Makes Road Return Vs. Padres  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- John Rocker emerged from the Padres bullpen in
the left-field corner and walked along the warning track to the
opposing bullpen all the way in the other corner of the stadium
Friday night, accompanied by a security guard in a red jacket.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the normal way a visiting reliever shows up for work in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this wasn't the start of a normal trip for Rocker.
It was his first road appearance since his two-week suspension for
his comments about gays, minorities and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker never needed to warm up as the Braves beat the Padres 7-2
for their 11th straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Fans perched along the rails, watching out of curiosity as
Rocker took off his Atlanta Braves warmup jacket and started
playing catch before the game. A teen-ager found an opening and
called Rocker a ''jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   A fan in a Padres cap shouted back, ''Hey, he's a human being,
leave him alone.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Rocker walked over to the stands and the
fans closed in to get autographs. With the exception of Rocker's
snide comment to a photographer, it might have been any reliever
signing autographs on a spring evening.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who had no comment, just sneers, for the media before
the game, even signed a New York Yankees cap for Eddie Solivan, 34,
who said he was of Puerto Rican descent, grew up in Spanish Harlem
in New York and now lives in suburban San Diego. Rocker signed a
ball for Solivan's 7-year-old son, Steven.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a good day,'' Solivan said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rocker's disparaging remarks, Solivan said: ''At first
you get mad, then it takes time, you think about what he said. The
man did apologize. Everybody has a right to say something in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to get booed,'' Solivan said. ''Padres fans are
proud, too. My friends who are coming to the game, they're all
coming just to boo him.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rocker walked from the Braves dugout through foul territory
to the bullpen in the right-field corner before the top of the
third inning, he was greeted by hearty boos.
</P>
<P>
   When the Braves finished batting practice, Rocker was the last
to walk across the field to the dugout. He was warmly greeted by
fans, many wearing Atlanta caps, T-shirts and jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ''John, everyone should be able to voice their opinion,'' one
woman shouted.
</P>
<P>
   A young man gushed as he got an autograph: ''Oh yeah, Rocker,
man!''
</P>
<P>
   But in another section, a Padres fan wasn't pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, Rocker, I've got a white sheet I want you to sign,''
hollered Harry Maker, who said he was of Welsh, Irish, Spanish and
Blackfoot Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a fan of anyone who makes racist remarks,'' Maker said
after Rocker went into the clubhouse. ''I thought that was totally
inconsiderate, totally stupid that he put his mouth in a gear and
didn't put his brain in action.''
</P>
<P>
   Maker said he doesn't hate Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate his viewpoint. Racism has no place in baseball,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It figures that Rocker will get a harsher reaction when he makes
his first trip to New York in late June. His comments were directed
at people he had seen in that city.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker went on the road following a nine-game homestand in which
he had four saves.
</P>
<P>
   Braves teammate Brian Jordan, who had been one of Rocker's main
critics after the remarks were published in a magazine, thought the
reliever would get booed by Padres fans, who generally are laid
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm quite sure they will because, to be honest, a lot of
Latins sit in the outfield,'' the right fielder said before the
game. ''I know. They get on my case all game long. So I can imagine
they're going to be rebelling a little bit. It's going to be
interesting.''

<HEADLINE> Braves 7, Padres 2  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- On a relatively quiet night for John Rocker,
the Atlanta Braves made some noise extending their winning streak
to 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla drove in the go-ahead run with a pinch-hit triple
and Brian Jordan hit a three-run homer to snap an 0-for-22 slump
and the Braves beat the San Diego Padres 7-2 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who never even warmed up, got a mixed reception at the
start of his first road trip since his two-week suspension for
comments about gays, minorities and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The reliever signed several autographs before the game, many to
fans wearing Braves apparel, but was greeted by hearty boos as he
walked in foul territory from the dugout to the bullpen in the
right-field corner before the top of the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had pitched in the last two games, getting a save in
Thursday's win over Los Angeles that completed a 9-0 homestand.
</P>
<P>
   It is the longest winning streak for the Braves since they
matched their own club record of 13 straight in July 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla made a winner of Greg Maddux, who started 4-0 in April
for the second straight season.
</P>
<P>
   With the scored tied at 2, ex-Padre Wally Joyner drew a one-out
walk in the eighth and was replaced by pinch-runner Walt Weiss.
Bonilla hit a soft liner off Brian Meadows (2-2) that rolled into
the Braves' bullpen and chugged into third ahead of Tony Gwynn's
throw.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux allowed two runs, one earned, on seven hits in seven
innings, struck out four and walked none. Mike Remlinger got his
fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan hit his first homer with one out in the ninth after
Carlos Almanzar hit Quilvio Veras and walked Chipper Jones to open
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first game between the teams since their blockbuster
trade on Dec. 22, when Ryan Klesko and Bret Boone joined the Padres
in exchange for Joyner, Reggie Sanders and Veras.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga hit his NL-leading ninth homer with one out in
the seventh inning, sending a 0-1 pitch from Brian Meadows over the
center field fence for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres came right back in the bottom of the inning with
consecutive singles by Klesko and Boone and an RBI grounder by Eric
Owens.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when Jordan drew
a one-out walk, stole second and scored on Andruw Jones' double.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego tied it in the bottom of the inning. Owens reached on
a two-out infield single to first and took second when first
baseman Galarraga overthrew Maddux covering the bag. Owens scored
on a single by Carlos Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows gave up three runs and four hits in 7 1-3 innings,
struck out three and walked three.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Maddux improved to 9-9 lifetime at Qualcomm Stadium in 19
games. Three Rivers Stadium (7-9) is now the only stadium where
Maddux has a losing record. ... Sanders' slump reached 0-for-34.
... San Diego placed RHP Brian Boehringer on the 15-day disabled
list, retroactive to April 21, with a right shoulder strain.
Boehringer is 0-3 with a 6.08 ERA in three starts. The Padres
recalled RHP Rodrigo Lopez from Triple-A Las Vegas. Rodrigo, 24,
will make his major league debut when he starts Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 5, Marlins 3  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shawn Green hit a two-run double and
continued home on an error as the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied in
the seventh inning to beat the Florida Marlins 5-3 Friday night and
snap a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers trailed 3-2 when Green doubled down the right-field
line to drive in Devon White and Gary Sheffield. Green scored when
first baseman Kevin Millar threw wildly past Mike Redmond at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams (2-1) got the victory, giving up one run in two
innings of relief. Jeff Shaw pitched the ninth for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Penny (3-2) took the loss, giving up four runs on seven
hits in 6 1-3 innings, while walking five.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 2-all in the top of the seventh, David Berg
led off with a single and Redmond hit a grounder that appeared to
be a double play opportunity for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But F.P. Santangelo, starting in place of second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek, threw wildly past shortstop Kevin Elster, who was
covering second. Berg scored from first as the ball went halfway
down the left-field line to give the Marlins a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers failed to score with the bases loaded in the
first inning, the Marlins took a 2-0 lead in the second on RBI
singles by Berg and Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles tied it in the fourth on a two-run RBI single by
Elster. Green singled and stole second and Penny issued consecutive
one-out walks to Todd Hundley and Adrian Beltre that loaded the
bases. Elster singled to left to make it 2-all.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Dodgers were one of the bright spots in Florida's bleak
season last year. They lost seven of nine games to the Marlins,
including four of six at Dodger Stadium. ... Marlins infielder Luis
Castillo begins a rehab assignment with Triple-A Calgary this
weekend. ... Dodgers left-hander Jeff Williams, originally optioned
to Triple-A Albuquerque on April 24, instead has been placed on the
DL retroactive to April 20 with a left wrist strain. The Dodgers
requested the change in Williams' status and it was granted by
league officials. ... Eight of Florida's players and two coaches
are California natives. Five Marlins played collegiate baseball in
the state.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   McKEES ROCKS, Pa. (AP) -- A white man opened fire in several suburban
Pittsburgh communities, killing five people and critically wounding a sixth in
what police called a racially motivated shooting spree. The man was apprehended
and charged. The shootings took place within a 20-mile range through suburbs
surrounding Pittsburgh during about an hour span Friday afternoon. The gunman
fatally shot a person of Indian descent at an Indian grocery store, two
employees at a Chinese restaurant and a black man at a martial arts school. A
Jewish woman who lived next door to the suspect's relatives was found dead in
her home. The suspect, Richard Baumhammers, 34, a laywer, was charged with
criminal homicide and reckless endangerment in the martial arts school shooting.
He was being held without bail.

U.S. Urges Breakup of Microsoft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the largest trust-busting move since AT&AMP;T, the
government asked a federal court Friday to break software giant Microsoft into
two companies. If accepted by a federal judge, the proposal would bar Microsoft
officers and directors, including billionaire co-founder Bill Gates, from owning
stock in more than one of the new companies. Under the government proposal,
Microsoft would be split into rival companies. One would produce its Windows
operating software, the other company would handle other software applications,
such as word processing, spreadsheet and database programs.

U.S. Wants Missile Treaty Changes

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has outlined to Russian
negotiators a two-phase program to defend the United States against missile
attack from Asia and later from the Middle East, a senior U.S. official said
Friday. Deployment of a limited defense, involving 100 launchers and improved
radar, is envisaged for 2005. North Korea, at this point, is considered the
mostly likely Asian country to attack U.S. targets. The second phase, involving
additional interceptors and radar and a second deployment site, would rely on an
orbiting satellite system that is not due to be completed before 2010, the
senior U.S. official told The Associated Press.

Miami Police Chief Resigns

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A day after the Miami mayor fired the city manager, the police
chief resigned Friday amid the Elian Gonzalez furor. Stepping down, Police Chief
William O'Brien lashed out at Mayor Joe Carollo, who had criticized him for
failing to notify the mayor about the federal raid to seize the 6-year-old Cuban
refugee. ''I refuse to be the chief of police in a city that has someone as
divisive and destructive as Joe Carollo as mayor,'' O'Brien said. O'Brien said
he didn't want to tip off the mayor to the Elian raid because the mayor is
Cuban-American and had openly sided with the Miami relatives.

<HEADLINE> Museum of Modern Art employees go on strike  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- The usually contemplative atmosphere that
surrounds the Museum of Modern Art was shaken as staff members
picketed, chanted and blew whistles in front of the building after
voting to strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Professional and Administrative Staff Association, which is
a local of the United Auto Workers union, voted 115-25 Friday
morning to authorize the strike after working for six months
without a contract, union official Scott Sommer said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike is the first at the museum since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 100 employees picketed in front of the museum and
the gift shop, blowing whistles whenever anybody walked in, handing
out fliers and asking people to go to the Guggenheim or Whitney
museums instead.
</P>
<P>
   Local 2110, which represents 250 of the 650 museum employees,
includes archivists, conservators, curatorial staff, librarians,
registrars and salespeople. The union met with members of the
museum's negotiating staff for the last time on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made concessions, and the museum did not budge,'' said John
Alexander, a five-year museum employee, as he walked the picket.
</P>
<P>
   The union says that museum salaries are too low, starting at
$17,000, with a median salary of $29,000. Another major sticking
point is job security during the period of the museum's $650
million expansion, which will begin in 2001. The museum has planned
for staff reductions during that time.
</P>
<P>
   The union also accuses the museum of trying to bust up the union
through pressure tactics against union supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum's chief labor negotiator painted a different
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe this strike is about a change in the union. The UAW
is not prepared to deal with an open-shop policy without mandatory
union membership,'' Robert Batterman said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum says its latest contract offer amounts to a 3 percent
wage and minimum salary increase each year for the next three
years, an improved pension plan and a comprehensive severance
package for any employees laid off during the museum's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are satisfied that our wages are fully comparable and
within the appropriate scale for museums in America,'' Batterman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 250 employees in the union, Batterman said somewhere
between 50 and 100 of them returned to work Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When shown a copy of the contract offer given to reporters,
Local 2110 President Maida Rosenstein angrily said that the figures
were a ''total lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike drew a mixed reaction from visitors, with some
continuing on their way into the museum and others refusing to
cross the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am terribly sympathetic,'' said Pierre Epstein, a museum
member for 20 years. ''This is an elitist institution which
underpays their employees.''
</P>
<P>
   No new negotiations were scheduled, and union members said they
planned to strike every day until an agreement is reached.

<HEADLINE> Wisc. Gov. To Chair GOP Committee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEFOREST, Wis. (AP) -- At the request of presumptive presidential
nominee George W. Bush, Gov. Tommy Thompson said Friday he has
agreed to chair the Platform Committee at the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The role is a challenging one, since it will likely require
negotiating a unified position on such controversial issues as
abortion and trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not seek this; it was sort of thrust upon me,'' Thompson
told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. '' (Bush) asked me to do it
for him, and that's what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he would take the position on the condition that
he has direct contact with Bush and his aides, so that he can
develop a platform that the Texas governor is comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to be my ideas, what I think it best for the
party,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he expects to hold regional hearings across
the nation before the July 31-Aug.3 convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Each state sends two delegates to the Platform Committee, whose
first decisions are made by subcommittees and then forwarded to the
full committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson refused to speculate about what the Republican Party
platform might embody.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going in there with an agenda at all,'' he said. ''I
will . . . develop a platform that is common sense and which
unifies this party. That's my goal, to unify this party and develop
a platform that is going to be successful for this campaign in the
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois was GOP Platform Committee chairman
in 1996, and Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma had the job in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Journalist Was Also a Spy  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- During the war he lived in two
worlds -- on the surface a high-profile journalist for Time magazine
who mingled with South Vietnam's power elite; below it, a Viet Cong
commander working for the communist North.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 73, Pham Xuan An sits with bare feet caressing the
cool tile floor, a retired general at ease in his living room.
Behind the couch is a painting of deer in a forest glade. Fish
glide aimlessly in a tank. The sound of city traffic is buffered by
the trees in An's front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fought for two things -- independence and social justice,''
An said of the wartime role he successfully hid from his
journalistic colleagues in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   Taking old pictures and a collection of dog-eared press cards
from a file cabinet, An recalled events that earned him the respect
of his fellow journalists, the trust of the South Vietnamese
officials he secretly was working against and the silent
appreciation of his real bosses in communist North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The slender, smiling An was the chief Vietnamese reporter for
Time magazine's Saigon bureau during the war, but was best known as
the unofficial voice of ''Radio Catinat'' -- the nickname of
Saigon's political rumor mill.
</P>
<P>
   From the Givral coffee shop on the corner of Rue Catinat -- now
Dong Koi (Uprising) street, An doled out tidbits of information and
political scuttlebutt to his Vietnamese counterparts who worked for
other foreign news organizations. They in turn dutifully reported
back to their own offices.
</P>
<P>
   Given the South Vietnamese penchant for convoluted political
intrigue, the potential for mischief was immense. But An says he
never dispensed disinformation or communist propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth was that I knew many things that I never told
anyone,'' he said, laughing. ''And because of this I was able on a
couple of occasions to save Time from major embarrassment by
telling them that a certain piece of important information was not
true.''
</P>
<P>
   An said among the things he knew, but did not report, was the
Cambodian military's plot to overthrow Prince Norodom Sihanouk in
1970, and the date of the final attack on Saigon in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Born in a mental hospital -- then the only medical clinic in Bien
Hoa, east of Saigon -- An was drafted by the colonial French
military, worked for weekly newspapers and studied at California's
Orange County Community College. At various times he also was a
bookkeeper, customs official, teacher and even a cyclo (pedicab)
driver.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is the way to know the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But An's life was most influenced by his early association with
the Vanguard Youth, a nationalist movement opposed to the colonial
French, in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't know anything about communism, but believed in the
ideas of independence, freedom and happiness,'' he said. ''It fit
into the Vietnamese aspirations of nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   When the United States pledged to support the French in their
war against Ho Chi Minh's communist Viet Minh, the choice for An
was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Vietnamese were a thirsty people for independence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was a true believer in the communist insurgency
against the South, An replied without hesitation. ''Absolutely.''
But he said the U.S. involvement with South Vietnam was ''not
really a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a very long story,'' he said. ''It was the beginning
of the Cold War. ... How could you know (what would happen)?''
</P>
<P>
   During what Vietnam calls the ''American War,'' he was one of
the few Vietnamese reporters accredited to the U.S. Military
Command. He seemed so well-informed that many American friends
suspected he worked for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   When South Vietnam started to unravel in the face of the North's
final offensive in 1975, An had time to get his own family out of
the country, and worked feverishly to save key friends, including
Saigon's former security chief -- marked for death if caught by the
communists.	   Thus the shock when, after the fall of South Vietnam on April
30, An revealed himself to be not only a spy but a senior military
officer on the communist side.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has been widely reported that he was a colonel in the
North Vietnamese army, An says the truth is that he was a
''regimental commander in the liberation forces'' -- the Viet Cong.
''I was a commander with no troops,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam's communist leadership was cool to An in the years
immediately after the war, but in 1990 he was made a one-star
general.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them that I was so familiar with five armies -- the Viet
Minh, the French, the Viet Cong, the Americans and the South
Vietnamese -- that I should have five stars,'' An said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they understood my sense of humor.''

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 11, Angels 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Greg Vaughn broke out of a 4-for-33 slump
with two homers and four RBIs Friday night, leading a 19-hit attack
as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat the Anaheim Angels 11-2.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn tied a career best with his fourth four-hit game and also
matched a Devil Rays record for hits in one game. The 19 hits, off
five Angels pitchers, are the most the third-year team has had in a
nine-inning game -- and the most ever in a road game.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Cairo had three hits and John Flaherty had a pair of RBI
singles to help right-hander Esteban Yan (1-1) win for the first
time in eight starts in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The converted reliever allowed two runs and five hits in seven
innings, after being pummeled for 20 earned runs and 23 hits over
14 2-3 innings in his previous three starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays built a 6-0 lead in the first two innings against
Jason Dickson (2-2). The right-hander gave up seven hits and
retired only three of the 13 batters he faced -- one on a double
play. He was forced out of the game by a strained right hip flexor
after making 40 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   After Fred McGriff's two-out RBI double in the first opened the
scoring, Vinny Castilla and Flaherty followed with RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, trying to join McGriff and teammate Jose Canseco as the
only players in major league history with to hit at least 30 homers
in a season for three teams, made it 6-0 with a three-run shot into
the left-field bullpen after a leadoff double by Cairo and a walk
to Dave Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn led off the sixth against Derrick Turnbow with his
seventh homer and 299th of his career, giving the Devil Rays a 9-2
cushion. The 12-year veteran, who signed with Tampa Bay as a free
agent in December after hitting 95 homers over the previous two
seasons with San Diego and Cincinnati, recorded his 26th multihomer
game.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbow surrendered three more hits in the sixth, including an
RBI single by Flaherty that made it 10-2. He walked the next two
batters to force in another run.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored their runs in the second inning, as Garret
Anderson dueled Yan through 12 pitches before driving the 13th to
right-center for his fourth homer. It followed a leadoff single by
Tim Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays got both runs back in the third against Kent
Mercker on a two-run single by Martinez, who has five RBIs in his
last two games after driving in only seven runs during his first 18
games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Darin Erstad, hitting a major league-leading .459, singled
in the eighth for his 45th hit, breaking the club record for hits
in a month set by Anderson in July 1998. ... Yan, whose victory was
his ninth in the majors, had surrendered 33 earned runs and 49 hits
over 34 2-3 innings in his previous seven starts in the majors. ...
The Angels claimed outfielder Scott Morgan off waivers from
Cleveland and placed him on the 40-man roster. Outfielder Jeff
DaVanon was transferred from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day
DL to make room for Morgan. ... Vaughn, McGriff, Castilla and
Canseco, who hit a combined 305 homers over the previous two
seasons, had been homerless in 30 at-bats against Dickson prior to
Vaughn's shot. ... Cairo has struck out only twice in 81 plate
appearances, the best ratio in the AL. The Devil Rays are 7-5 with
Cairo batting ninth, compared to 0-6 with him in the two hole.

<HEADLINE> Sumo Grappling With Scandal  </HEADLINE>
By GINNY PARKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Like many men his age, Hiroshi Okuda has been a
sumo fan all his life.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up playing with paper sumo wrestlers, followed the
tournaments on television and just a few months ago -- at age 56 --
finally saw a bout in person for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sumo is an easy sport to understand,'' Okuda said, slurping
stew in a restaurant specializing in ''chanko nabe,'' the sumo
wrestler's traditional soupy fare of tofu, meat and vegetables.
''Sometimes, you'll see a small guy beat a big one -- there's
nothing the Japanese like more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone shares his devotion.
</P>
<P>
   A nagging scandal over alleged bout-fixing was back in the
headlines this week, and sumo has come under fire for being sexist.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts see a deeper dilemma: Is the very emphasis on
tradition that aficionados say makes sumo a part of Japan's soul
pulling it out of touch with the nation's modern realities?
</P>
<P>
   With roots in the religious rituals of Japan's Shinto faith,
sumo has never been just a sport. Before a bout, wrestlers toss
fistfuls of salt to purify the ring and shove their feet into the
dirt to squash any demons that may be lurking below.
</P>
<P>
   But sumo's claim on purity has taken a beating since former
wrestler Keisuke Itai set off a media frenzy in January by
announcing that many bouts had been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Itai, who retired in 1991, said he intentionally threw bouts and
named top wrestlers he said were on the winning side.
</P>
<P>
   The Japan Sumo Association, the professional sport's
ultra-conservative ruling body, investigated the allegations and
denied them this week. Officials said they questioned all those
Itai identified and found no evidence to support his allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found nothing to back up what he said,'' said Tokitsukaze,
the sumo association chairman and a former wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the allegations do not seem to bother die-hard
fans as much as they have angered the general public. They are, in
fact, almost considered part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   The way sumo tournaments and rankings work is a big factor, said
Ryohei Nakamura, editor of Ozumo, a popular sumo magazine.
Wrestlers are ranked according to their cumulative record after
each of the six, 15-day tournaments each year.
</P>
<P>
   If a wrestler is one bout away from demotion in the closing
days, it hasn't generally been seen as such a bad thing for an
opponent to let him win, or for the favor to be returned sometime
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Customs and traditions like this continue because sumo, in a
sense, is still a traditional Japanese art,'' Nakamura said. ''It's
part of the charm.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that bout-rigging has become an issue may be more
significant than the allegations themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Proud of its ancient roots, sumo has tended to hold itself aloof
from the changes that have dramatically transformed the rest of
Japanese society -- and its values -- over the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
   The sumo association does little to promote the sport, and has
kept its internal affairs closed to all but a select group of
former wrestlers granted the privilege of opening their own
training stables. Only wrestlers from these sanctioned stables are
allowed to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The spartan, communal life in those stables is bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestlers toil virtually every day through rigorous training
regimes. Injuries are common. For those who do not make the top
ranks, pay is meager. With Japan's modern affluence providing far
more options to athletic youngsters, few are willing to accept such
hardships.
</P>
<P>
   Nakamura and other other sumo experts warn that if something
isn't done to open the sumo world, these factors will likely
further alienate the public and cut off the flow of competitive
talent the sport needs to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go to the tournaments and you see empty seats,'' Nakamura
said. ''That didn't used to be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Young fans in particular are growing hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so out-of-date,'' said Tomoko Matsumoto, a 25-year-old
office worker in Tokyo. ''It's something for grandmothers and
grandfathers to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, meanwhile, a movement aimed at bringing sumo into the
modern world -- by getting it into the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   With little help from the more powerful professional ranks,
supporters of amateur sumo have been trying for years to build up
enough of a worldwide following to get an Olympics berth.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting tradition is not their major concern. Amateur
wrestlers are allowed to wear shorts underneath their loincloths,
and are even promoting sumo for women.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the professionals were embroiled in a controversy
earlier this year over their ban on women in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Sumo officials have long refused to allow women in the ring for
any reason, because the ring is considered sacred ground and Shinto
belief holds that women are impure.
</P>
<P>
   But Fusae Ota, Japan's first female governor, said in February
that she wanted to present an award to the winner of a local
tournament. The association said she wasn't welcome and Ota ended
up sending a man to present the award.

<HEADLINE> Italy Coalition Wins Confidence Vote  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Having survived an essential test of parliamentary
support, a stopgap coalition led by new Premier Giuliano Amato is
pledging to devote its short run to reforming a fractious electoral
system that has given Italy 58 governments since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The 58th, Amato's 4-day-old government, won a vote of confidence
Friday in Parliament's lower house by a surprisingly comfortable
margin -- staving off, for now, early general elections demanded by
conservative opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reform of the electoral system is one of the reasons this
government was born,'' Walter Veltroni of the coalition's leading
Democratic Left party declared after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   When that reform is achieved, Veltroni said, Italy can hope for
a future in which ''governments are decided by the citizens, and
which have the possibility to govern with stability for the entire
run of Parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   What is now an eight-party center-left coalition came to power
in 1996 elections. It managed to stay on despite infighting that
helped bring down its previous two premiers. The last premier,
ex-Communist Massimo D'Alema, resigned after the conservatives made
a strong showing in April 16 regional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, D'Alema's treasury minister, took over, reshuffled the
Cabinet, and urged lawmakers to let his new government stay in
power until next spring's scheduled elections.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left argued its leadership was essential to seeing
through election reforms, starting with a May referendum giving
voters the choice of doing away with a proportional allotment
system for seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The system is blamed for giving disproportionate influence to
tiny, troublesome parties -- currently, there are more than 40
parties in Parliament. The profusion makes for unwieldy coalitions
that are easily toppled.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which even Italians are accustomed to the rise and
fall of their governments could be seen in TV's handling of the
crucial vote of confidence. TV stations didn't cut in to announce
the vote -- even those that had their evening news shows airing at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Amato managed to persuade his allies to stay
together. Friday's vote was a convincing 319-298, with five
abstentions -- broader than the razor-thin margin that had been
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat would have brought down the fledgling government. While
it still faces a vote of confidence in the Senate next week, the
margin there is expected to be wider.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is good news, because now we can go ahead with the
referendum,'' Franco Bassanini, the new government's public
administration minister, said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi made clear that Amato's government would face plenty
of trouble from him, denouncing the prime minister as the
''bankrupt caretaker of a moribund majority.''
</P>
<P>
   The media magnate and ex-premier had contended that the
coalition's poor showing in the regional elections represented a
voter mandate for early elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day isn't far off in which the citizens, using the vote
that you fear so much, will take back the power to decide, which
you have for so long held hostage,'' Berlusconi warned the
center-left just before Friday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, Amato's chief danger in the lower chamber had been
defections among followers disgruntled over the distribution of
Cabinet secretary and undersecretary seats.
</P>
<P>
   He won over wavering supporters in part by coming through on a
pledge they had sought to purge voter lists of the dead, a padding
that helped doom previous reform referendums, by making it more
difficult to get a quorum of qualified voters.
</P>
<P>
   Amato first served as premier for 10 months in the early 1990s,
earning respect for rigorous budget cuts at a time when corruption
scandals were pulling apart Italy's political order. Detractors see
him as a remnant of the system that produced the scandals.

<HEADLINE> KLM Breaks Alliance With Alitalia  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italy's loyalty to a hugely unpopular airport that's
up to a $100 cab ride outside Milan appears to have cost its
national carrier a vital partnership, leaving leaders fretting
about the future of the Malpensa airport and Alitalia itself.
</P>
<P>
   Italian politicians hoped to talk KLM Royal Dutch Airlines out
of its announced decision Friday to immediately sever its less-than
2-year-old partnership with Alitalia.
</P>
<P>
   But KLM's chief was quoted as putting blame squarely on the
Italian government -- and the opposition demanded government and
airline executives come before Parliament to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's bad choices have created a situation that
risks creating problems for the very survival of Alitalia,''
lawmakers of the opposition National Alliance said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   KLM abruptly killed its deal with Alitalia late Friday, saying
the venture had become ''an unacceptable business risk that could
jeopardize its financial position.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The alliance with Alitalia is not viable, considering the
continuing uncertainty, mainly with regard to the future of
Malpensa and the proposed privatization of Alitalia,'' KLM said.
</P>
<P>
   It demanded $91 million in compensation for the failed venture.
</P>
<P>
   KLM entered the deal looking to Malpensa as a second hub in
Europe. But for years Malpensa has been plagued with problems,
including a poor on-time record and long waits for baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to force Malpensa into use, Italian Transport Minister
Pierluigi Bersani in March ordered airlines to switch most flights
from Linate, six miles from downtown Milan, to Malpensa, 33 miles
from Italy's financial capital. The government said the move was
essential to easing congestion at Linate.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign airlines -- including British Airways, Lufthansa and
Air France -- complained that the move would unfairly favor Alitalia
and filed a complaint with the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Alitalia said Friday it still was waiting to learn details of
KLM's complaints. In advance of an explanation, it defended both
the pace of development at Malpensa and of privatization of the air
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   KLM Chief Executive Officer Leo van Wijk, in an interview with
Italy's ANSA news service, was quoted as saying the responsibility
''clearly is the Italian government's.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If this is definitive, there go our chances of developing our
company into a top player in European air transport,'' said Ernesto
Stajono, president of the transport commission of Parliament's
lower house.
</P>
<P>
   The financial ramifications for Alitalia were not immediately
clear. But Finance Minister Ottaviano del Turco said Italy would
have to move quickly to ''remedy the situation, either by
re-establishing the relationship or by finding another partner for
our national carrier.''

<HEADLINE> Balaguer Could Lead Dominican Rep.  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNAH A. NESMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Joaquin Balaguer is 93
years old, blind, barely able to walk and reviled by many
Dominicans as a symbol of a repressive past. And he might be the
country's next president.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign is remarkable for how little he says. Balaguer's
public appearances are carefully orchestrated events at which aides
physically support him as he delivers simple, stock messages about
''putting Dominicans first'' -- a thinly veiled nod to many
Dominicans' dislike and fear of the large migrant community from
neighboring Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't come here with a bag of promises. I will govern as I
always governed,'' he said in an unwavering voice at a recent rally
in a poor Santo Domingo neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   With three weeks to go before the elections, Balaguer is running
even with Danilo Medina, the candidate of the governing Dominican
Liberation Party. Balaguer and Medina, a centrist, are widely
expected to unite in a second round of voting against leftist
leader and current front-runner Hipolito Mejia.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the alliance: Balaguer's support was critical to
getting the Liberation Party's Leonel Fernandez elected president
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Balaguer's Social Christian Reformist Party promises a return to
the days when a paternalistic state kept everything from crime to
the price of gasoline under control. His proposals include
reinstating trade barriers, government housing projects and massive
public works projects.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign slogan: ''One more time, by necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   That would make it his seventh term as president.
</P>
<P>
   Balaguer was a top lieutenant to Rafael Trujillo, the country's
dictator from 1930 until his assassination in 1961. After the
assassination, Balaguer was briefly exiled, only to return in 1965
and win election as president a year later.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected president twice more before being forced by
international pressure to concede defeat and order the military to
return stolen ballot boxes in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   He won again in 1986 and was re-elected in 1990. Claims that his
1994 election victory was rigged forced him to shorten his term.
</P>
<P>
   Balaguer's amazing longevity seems to have his rivals somewhat
spooked -- and many Dominicans fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Balaguer has been converted into a political myth,'' explained
sociologist Teofilio Barreiro. ''He's the man who can bring order
to the disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Liberation party candidate, Medina is running on the
record of President Fernandez -- generally respected for reducing
rampant corruption and inefficiency and carrying out economic
reforms. Because of a law inspired by Balaguer's disputed 1994
election, Fernandez cannot seek a consecutive term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Many Dominicans, however, remain frustrated by poverty, even as
Santo Domingo is transformed by construction of highways and the
economy grows by 8 percent a year -- the fastest growth rate in the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia's calls for creating jobs through huge public works has
wide appeal -- even though his Dominican Revolutionary Party is
remembered for extraordinary corruption during its last term in
power two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls show Mejia with 40 percent to 50 percent support with
Medina and Balaguer splitting the rest. If no candidate gets an
absolute majority -- as appears likely -- a second round is held
between the two top finishers.
</P>
<P>
   Some find the idea of Balaguer returning tough to stomach.
</P>
<P>
   It ''verges on the ridiculous,'' complained Senate President
Ramon Albuquerque of the Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Balaguer is treated with kid gloves by rivals aware of his
potential kingmaker role.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two parties are being coquettish with the old man,''
Barreiro said. ''They visit him. They speak well of him. They can't
afford to risk angering him.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Missile Treaty Changes  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing to
Russia that it clear a legal path for an elaborate anti-missile
system to shield the United States from an attack from the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the second phase in a program that requires
modifying the 1972 U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
Russia so far has refused, warning that changes could touch off an
arms race, but its negotiators have been willing to talk about the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase, as outlined to The Associated Press on Friday
by a senior U.S. official, would involve 100 launchers and new
radar. President Clinton is expected to urge Russian President
Vladimir Putin to go along with amending the treaty to legalize the
limited defense system when the two leaders meet in Moscow on June
4-5.
</P>
<P>
   Deployment is envisaged for 2005. The shield would be designed
for protection from attack from Asia. North Korea, at this point,
is considered the mostly likely Asian country to attack U.S.
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase, involving additional interceptors and radar
and a second deployment site, would rely on an orbiting satellite
system that is not due to be completed before 2010, said the senior
U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the administration, while notifying Russian
officials of the program, is leaving negotiations over the details
of the second phase to its successor, the official said. That phase
is focused on threats from the Middle East. Iran already has been
identified as a potential attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Together, ''this will be enough to knock out several dozen
warheads ... but inadequate to counter a large Russian
counter-strike,'' according to papers that the private Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists reported were drafts of U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The statement appeared designed to assure Russia that the U.S.
program would not neutralize Russia's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the administration told the Russians
that U.S. nuclear forces would be on constant alert or on crisis
alert ''to deliver many hundreds of warheads in response to any
assailant,'' according to the scientists' account.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia have begun negotiations on a new
treaty to set a new and lower ceiling of 2,000 to 2,500 for their
long-range nuclear weapons stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Russia and the United States could deploy more than
1,000 intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched
ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads for the next decade and
thereafter, according to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they could not confirm that the
texts distributed in the bulletin were accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Spurgeon Keeny, president of the private Arms Control
Association, called the documents extremely disturbing and said
they indicated Clinton had already made a decision to deploy a
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Keeny said in an interview, they suggested Russia could
count on keeping 1,500 to 2,000 strategic nuclear warheads deployed
on alert indefinitely against a U.S. missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. program, particularly the second phase, appears to be
clearly in conflict with the ABM Treaty, which limited defenses on
the theory a potential attacker would be inclined to hold its fire
if was exposed to devastating retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Russian negotiators have exchanged their own ideas with American
counterparts about how to respond to a missile threat, the senior
U.S. official said. But the Russians have not talked about amending
the treaty, which would be required to implement both steps.

<HEADLINE> Judge finds against MP3.com in copyright infringement case  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Internet-based music service MP3.com plans
to continue operating as usual after a judge concluded it is
infringing the copyrights of the nation's major record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Richards, president of MP3.com, said the company would
conduct ''business as usual'' and would appeal the Friday ruling by
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page order by Rakoff was the first significant ruling
challenging the San Diego-based company, which allows Internet
users to hear music and add their personal music to a play list.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawsuits nationwide seek to help define the rules of how
music will be played on the Internet, a venue that did not exist
when the vast majority of tens of thousands of records and compact
discs were produced.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed in the case in Manhattan before Rakoff show that
the record companies themselves are creating alliances with various
companies to ensure they get paid for music played and sold on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The major record companies argued in a lawsuit filed earlier
this year that MP3.com made unauthorized copies of 45,000 compact
discs, loaded them onto computer servers and permitted its
customers to download the unauthorized copies.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Robertson, MP3.com's chief executive officer, promised
an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a heavyweight fight, and there are five heavyweights
(the five major labels) in the ring against us. We will take shots,
but this is by no means the end of the fight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Katherine Forrest, representing plaintiff Warner Brothers
Records Inc., called it ''a straightforward case of copyright
infringement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that the conduct ... should cease,'' Forrest said.
''Now we move on to the next phase.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how the ruling would affect MP3.com
or its practices on the Internet, though Robertson said the company
planned to keep the site operating for its estimated 400,000
customers unless a court order forces it to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had $350 million cash on hand for any
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said ''copyright chaos'' resulted from the challenge
to his company by the record companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''While many may perceive this as a victory for labels, we
perceive it as a loss. ... It leaves a vacuum that will be filled
with other technologies unfriendly to artists and record
companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carlinsky, a lawyer representing MP3.com, called the
ruling ''round one.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of fight left in this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry had argued that MP3.com was not
authorized to use the music because it does not own it and has not
obtained permission from recording companies.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase in court will determine damages and other relief.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said in a one-page order that he will explain the
reasoning behind his ruling in a written decision to be issued in
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit had claimed that MP3.com's Instant Listening Service
and Beam-it violate copyright laws. Instant Listening Service
allows customers to listen to a CD after they have purchased it
while Beam-it is a program allowing users to add their own CDs to
their MP3.com personal playlist online.
</P>
<P>
   Cary H. Sherman, senior executive vice president and general
counsel of the Recording Industry Association of America, said in
court papers that it assisted the plaintiffs in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a market to license the creation of a digital music
library of the very sort defendant MP3.com created,'' he said.
''Internet entrepreneurs are regularly coming up with new and
exciting ways for consumers to enjoy music and new and innovative
business models.
</P>
<P>
   ''The record companies themselves have been actively exploring
and implementing new opportunities for the benefit of their
consumers, their artists and their own businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another company facing legal action is San Mateo, Calif.-based
Napster Inc. Founded by two college students, Napster provides a
free software application whereby users who are logged on to the
Internet simultaneously can download MP3 music files from each
other, free of charge.

<HEADLINE> Expos 9, Giants 3  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Giants still can't win at
their new bayside ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Widger homered and doubled to drive in five runs, keying a
late rally that carried the Montreal Expos to a 9-3 win over the
Giants on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped San Francisco to 0-6 at Pacific Bell Park, one
defeat shy of the worst start by a team playing its first season in
a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion New York Mets dropped their first seven games at
the Polo Grounds in 1962. It's the first time a team has ever lost
six straight games to start its stay in a newly constructed
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Widger, who had a two-run homer off Russ Ortiz (2-3) in the
seventh to forge a 3-3 tie, had another key hit in Montreal's
six-run eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro began the inning with a single and Ortiz then walked
Wilton Guerrero. Felix Rodriguez relieved and walked Vladimir
Guerrero to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens greeted Aaron Fultz with a two-run single and Widger
lined a three-run double down the third base line off John
Johnstone. Pinch-hitter Geoff Blum finished off the outburst with a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Telford (3-1) got the win with an inning of perfect
relief.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 1, Jeff Kent doubled off the brick facade
in right to start the sixth and Ellis Burks followed with an RBI
triple. J.T. Snow's sacrifice fly scored Burks to put San Francisco
up 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal came right back in the top of the seventh to tie it
again. Michael Barrett beat out on infield single and Widger
followed with his fourth homer, driving Ortiz's 1-1 offering into
the left field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro added a first-inning RBI single for Montreal and San
Francisco got an RBI double from Bill Mueller in the bottom of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Hideki Irabu, who didn't figure in the decision,
went six innings and allowed three runs on nine hits while striking
out four and walking one.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Expos left fielder Rondell White was scratched from the
lineup shortly before gametime because of a bruised left knee.
Wilton Guerrero replaced him. ... The Expos became the last team in
the majors to play a game on grass when they opened their weekend
series at Pac Bell Park. Their previous 20 games all were played on
an artificial surface. ... Left-hander Graeme Lloyd, on Montreal's
disabled list with shoulder tendinitis since March 29, underwent an
MRI in San Francisco. Results were not immediately available. Lloyd
threw on the side for two minutes prior to Wednesday's game before
stopping because of shoulder pain. ... San Francisco has scored in
the first inning in 13 of 21 games. ... San Francisco hasn't won a
home game since beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 last Sept. 29
in the second to the last game at their old stadium on Candlestick
Point.

   DENVER (AP) -- Mike Piazza left because of wrist and elbow
injuries in the fifth inning and Mets starter Mike Hampton was
chased moments later as the Colorado Rockies beat New York 12-5
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is expected to be out of the lineup for at least a few
days. The All-Star catcher sprained his right wrist and
hyperextended his right elbow in a play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The diagnosis right now is we're going to lose him for some
days, there's no doubt about that,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who played through a thumb injury during New York's
playoff run last year, was taken to Rose Medical Center for X-rays,
which were negative.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza returned to the clubhouse after the game with his wrist
wrapped. He said he did not know how long he might be sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   ''Immediately, I felt some pain in my wrist,'' Piazza said.
''Initially, I thought it was going to be OK. I tried to shake it
off, but it was pretty persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was hurt as Todd Helton scored on an errant throw from
second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo during a play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just slid into me. I felt some tenderness in my wrist and
elbow,'' Piazza said. ''The next couple of days will tell how it
feels. From my experience with sprains, usually if they're severe
they get worse in the first couple of days. If not, maybe it will
be feeling a little bit better. We'll just wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Valentine: ''He hardly ever comes out, so there's something
there. We're hoping for the least.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who have lost three straight after a nine-game winning
streak, trailed 6-0 when Piazza left. They never recovered as
Hampton (2-4) equaled his loss total from all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up in last year's NL Cy Young Award voting, Hampton
has struggled to measure up to last year's standards when he went
22-4 with a 2.90 ERA for the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to be New York's ace after an offseason trade, the
left-hander has allowed 24 earned runs with 30 walks in six starts
covering 33 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies tagged him for seven runs, six of them earned, and
eight hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're facing a guy like Hampton, you're always hoping
that you score enough because he's going to battle you on every
at-bat and every pitch,'' Rockies manager Buddy Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton broke out of a 1-for-15 slump with three hits, and
Jeff Cirillo drove in three runs for the Rockies. Colorado batted
around twice, scoring six runs in the third and four in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Astacio (2-2), making his first start in nine days, gave
up five runs and 12 hits in 6 2-3 innings. The Mets finished him
with five straight two-out hits to cut Colorado's lead to 11-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, playing only their eighth home game, never trailed
as they took a 6-0 lead in the third on the strength of two walks
and five straight hits off Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   After Hampton walked Brian Hunter and Mike Lansing, Larry Walker
capped an 11-pitch at-bat with a two-run triple into right-center
field. Cirillo, Helton and Jeffrey Hammonds added RBI hits, and
Brent Mayne hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Walker finished 3-for-4 and scored twice.
Notes: Hampton had been 4-0 at Coors Field. ... Colorado RHP Jerry
Dipoto was placed on the 15-day DL and is scheduled to have surgery
next week to repair a bulging disc below his neck. The Rockies
recalled Mike DeJean from Triple-A Colorado Springs. ... RHP Eric
Cammack made his major league debut for the Mets. He gave up four
runs and four hits in two innings. ... Astacio made his first start
since April 19. His scheduled start Monday was rained out, and he
did not travel with the team to Montreal because he did not want to
risk visa problems.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Could Lose NCAA Tournaments  </HEADLINE>
By DAN LEWERENZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina risks losing the chance to
play host to future NCAA tournament events if lawmakers fail to
remove the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse dome, NCAA
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The group's executive committee voted Friday to cancel future
NCAA-sponsored events in the state unless the flag is removed
before the committee meets again Aug. 11. The decision would not
affect individual schools' game schedules or conference
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   A cancellation by the governing body of college sports would be
the most prominent move since the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People began a tourism boycott Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wethington, NCAA executive committee chairman, said the
flag creates ''an intolerable environment'' for many athletes and
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no question that to a significant number of our
constituents, the flag is a symbol of oppression,'' Wethington
said.
</P>
<P>
   Flag opponents say the banner is a symbol of racism. Supporters
say it honors Confederate veterans and is a symbol of Southern
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate earlier this month passed a bill to remove the
flag and fly a similar banner in front of the Statehouse at a
monument honoring Confederate soldiers. The bill was approved this
week in the House Judiciary Committee and is headed for debate on
the House floor. The Legislature, which has sole authority to
remove the flag, adjourns June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Republican House Speaker David Wilkins of Greenville, a flag
supporter who is leading efforts to get the bill passed, said he
didn't think lawmakers would be swayed by the NCAA's decision to
honor the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is my belief that the General Assembly will resolve the
flag issue with honor and dignity and finality this year,'' Wilkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight James, executive director of the NAACP's South Carolina
Conference of Branches, said the decision by the NCAA would bolster
its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that this will be a signal to the state Legislature
that it's time for them to make the right decision and remove these
divisive symbols from the Statehouse campus,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's decision comes less than two weeks after its baseball
committee decided not to exclude South Carolina and Clemson from
consideration as regional hosts this year. Wethington said the
executive committee's decision would not affect events scheduled
this spring.

<HEADLINE> School Hosts National Dream Hotline  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDYVILLE, Mo. (AP) -- Sometimes we fly, other times we fall.
Often we're being chased by wild animals or monsters. And even more
frequently, we're naked.
</P>
<P>
   Each night, we might have as many as six or seven dreams. But
for those of us lucky enough to remember even one of them, the big
question is: ''What does it mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Condron, chancellor of the School of Metaphysics, will
tell you. This weekend, Condron and others at the school's campus
will be running their 12th annual National Dream Hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Through midnight Sunday, people can call the school and describe
their wildest, weirdest or most entertaining dreams. Faculty
members on the other end of the line will interpret them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The subconscious uses pictures to tell us things, that's what
dreaming is all about,'' says Condron, who has been studying dream
interpretation for more than 20 years. ''Understanding those dreams
is one path toward realizing your purpose in life and leading a
happier existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Every dream is about the dreamer, Condron says, and every dream
is unique to that person. However, there are common themes that his
''Dream Team'' hears repeatedly during their weekend dreamathon.
</P>
<P>
   Try this old favorite: The dreamer is chased by a wild animal or
a dog. Animals represent habits in dreams, and being chased by your
habits -- be it smoking or biting fingernails -- means you might be
having trouble controlling them, Condron says.
</P>
<P>
   Another typical dream is finding yourself back in high school or
college on the last day of the semester and realizing you're
unprepared for final exams.
</P>
<P>
   ''School is a place of learning. This dream is saying you have
passed up opportunities to expand yourself or to grow,'' Condron
says. ''It's also a sign that you may be living in the past and
that you need to progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Flying is a good thing, it means the dreamer is trying to get
beyond those self-imposed limitations. Death in dreams symbolize
change, and being killed might indicate that the dreamer feels
helpless about those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the dreams where we bare it all.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being naked in a dream is very common, and it's usually
accompanied with a crowd of people or a public place,'' says
Condron. ''It tells us that we are being more open, perhaps too
open, about our personal lives. It's something few of us are
comfortable with, but we all need to try and be ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone dreams, but not everyone will remember, says Condron.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to remember your dream, you have to tell yourself
before you go to bed that you're going to remember it. Then write
them down as soon as you wake up,'' he says. ''If you can wake up
without the aid of an alarm clock, it's even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Some courses at the school are meant to help students master
skills like concentration, listening, memory recall, re-energizing
and relaxing of mind and body. There are four students enrolled
full-time at the school's headquarters, located on 1,500 acres of
rolling hills near this tiny Ozarks village. They raise their own
food, churn their own butter and lead a self-sustaining life on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   One of those students, 25-year-old Greg Brown, of Manhattan,
Kan., said he enrolled two years ago to help himself sort out his
own recurring nightmares and to try to learn something about
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to have this dream over and over that I was being
chased by wild animals or by people with guns,'' said Brown. ''Now
I dream of flying. I have really come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   The campus, which is not affiliated with any college accrediting
group, began in 1968 as a series of classes in Springfield. It
became an incorporated, nonprofit school in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a hippie commune, it's just a school of like-minded
people who want to better themselves,'' staff member Paul Blosser
said. ''We are offering something different from the traditional
ideas of school.''
</P>
<P>
   Condron says his staff and faculty provide the dream hot line as
a kind of community service. After that, he says, it's up to the
dreamer to decide what to do with that information.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will assist you in understanding the images in your
dreams, and you, the dreamer, will be the final authority in
applying the information in your life,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> 9th driver killed, NYPD steps up efforts  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hours after the ninth livery cab driver was
found murdered, police Commissioner Howard Safir assigned more
officers to the same task: protect the other 41,000 drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven livery drivers were killed in 1999. Fernando Mateo,
president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, met
with Safir Friday for about 30 minutes to discuss the drivers'
safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 300 officers are on the task force. Safir didn't give
any numbers but promised a ''substantial'' number of extra cops to
watch over the drivers, Mateo said after the meeting, which was
closed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Safir showed Mateo a video about the livery cab industry that
will be delivered to all precincts. Among the video's reminders for
cops: All cabs in the city have amber warning headlights they can
flash if they are in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spoke about the flashing lights and how a lot of police
officers are not acknowledging that the flashing lights are on ...
it's what signals when a livery driver is in trouble,'' Mateo said.
</P>
<P>
   He added no cabbies who complained their signals were ignored
have been harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, police will set up more checkpoints where they stop
drivers to see if they're OK, and task force officers would work
longer hours and patrols would increase. The FBI has been asked by
Mateo's group to assist the NYPD. FBI spokesman Jim Margolin said
no federal statutes have been violated and there is no jurisdiction
for the agency to intervene. But the agency will provide assistance
if requested, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In separate appeals, Safir and Mateo begged livery drivers not
to pick up street fares, a practice that is against Taxi and
Limousine Commission rules. All but one of the slain drivers were
killed by street fares, police have said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the extra few dollars, your life isn't worth it,'' Mateo
said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest driver slain, Cesar Lopez, 43, of Staten Island, was
allegedly killed by one of two passengers picked up in Brooklyn at
3:55 a.m. Friday, police said. Lopez, a native of the Dominican
Republic, had been a livery driver for 12 years, working the past
five for Livonia Car Service. He is survived by his wife and three
young children.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a nice person, always laughing, always joking around,''
said colleague Julio Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Like the cars of the eight drivers killed before him, Lopez's
car was not equipped with a bulletproof partition, police said. In
response to the killings, the TLC voted last week to require all
drivers to install either bulletproof partitions or digital
security cameras in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the TLC made it mandatory for yellow cabs and livery
cars owned by more than one driver to have the partitions. But cars
owned and operated by individual drivers -- 90 percent of all livery
cars -- could have either partitions or tiny surveillance cameras
installed behind the rearview mirror. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
recently pledged $5 million toward a grant program to help pay for
the security devices.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., asked for $600,000 in
federal funds to purchase 2,000 partitions.
</P>
<P>
   The recent increase in driver murders and the new requirement
has apparently overwhelmed shops that install partitions, which are
cheaper to install than cameras. Partitions cost between $250 and
$350, and cameras start at $600. The waiting list to have
partitions installed ranges from one week to two months.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why livery drivers pick up street fares, Mateo said
it was a combination of finances and understanding. Drivers can
make more money with street fares, he said. And because they live
and work in the inner city, they know the community depends on them
for transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo urged residents to come forward if they have information
on the killings. Police have made arrests in only two of the nine
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're crying for your help, we're the people who transport
you, we're the people who work for you, your parents and your
grandchildren,'' he said.

U.S. Urges Breakup of Microsoft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Under a plan submitted Friday to a federal judge by the
Justice Department and 17 states, the Microsoft Corp. would be divided into one
company that would produce the Windows operating system, and another that would
make software programs such as the Microsoft Office suite of spreadsheet, word
processing and other business applications, including the Internet Explorer Web
browser. ''If this breakup plan were to make it all the way through appeals, it
could create a lot of confusion in the marketplace,'' said Rob Enderle, an
analyst with the Giga Information Group. Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates,
called the proposal ''out of bounds and out of touch,'' and says he will
continue to fight in appeals court even as the company tries to continue
conducting business as usual.

   McKEES ROCKS, Pa. (AP) -- A white man opened fire in several suburban
Pittsburgh communities, killing five people and critically wounding a sixth in
what police called a racially motivated shooting spree. The man was apprehended
and charged. The shootings took place within a 20-mile range through suburbs
surrounding Pittsburgh during about an hour span Friday afternoon. The gunman
fatally shot a person of Indian descent at an Indian grocery store, two
employees at a Chinese restaurant and a black man at a martial arts school. A
Jewish woman who lived next door to the suspect's relatives was found dead in
her home. The suspect, Richard Baumhammers, 34, a laywer, was charged with
criminal homicide and reckless endangerment in the martial arts school shooting.
He was being held without bail.

U.S. Wants Missile Treaty Changes

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has outlined to Russian

attack from Asia and later from the Middle East, a senior U.S. official said
Friday. Deployment of a limited defense, involving 100 launchers and improved
radar, is envisaged for 2005. North Korea, at this point, is considered the
mostly likely Asian country to attack U.S. targets. The second phase, involving
additional interceptors and radar and a second deployment site, would rely on an
orbiting satellite system that is not due to be completed before 2010, the
senior U.S. official told The Associated Press.

chief resigned Friday amid the Elian Gonzalez furor. Stepping down, Police Chief
William O'Brien lashed out at Mayor Joe Carollo, who had criticized him for
failing to notify the mayor about the federal raid to seize the 6-year-old Cuban
refugee. ''I refuse to be the chief of police in a city that has someone as
divisive and destructive as Joe Carollo as mayor,'' O'Brien said. O'Brien said
he didn't want to tip off the mayor to the Elian raid because the mayor is
Cuban-American and had openly sided with the Miami relatives.

<HEADLINE> Study links good day care to crime prevention  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton made a rare appearance
at the White House to take the wraps off a new study showing that
children who spend their early years in quality day care are less
likely to commit crimes later in life.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by law enforcement groups, found that youths who
spent their early years in quality day care were half as likely to
be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Child care is not only a lifesaver for working families, it is
a crime-fighting strategy for our communities,'' the first lady
said Friday. ''For every dollar we invest in child care, we save $5
in crime costs down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made child care a key issue in her U.S. Senate bid
in New York. The appearance, her first in Washington in slightly
over a month, came a day after her Republican rival New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced he has a treatable form of
prostate cancer and is not sure if it will scuttle his Senate
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady made no mention of the mayor in what was billed
as a non-campaign event Friday. But in a sure sign that she had
left the campaign trail, Clinton ditched her trademark black
pantsuit in favor of a one that was a bright mint green.
</P>
<P>
   She was joined at the White House by Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., and Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md. They said the report
provided fresh evidence of the need for more money for child care
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The report is a compilation of studies from North Carolina and
Chicago in which children in programs were compared with those who
weren't in programs. It found that troubled children who didn't go
to preschool or receive home visits from social workers were five
times as likely to become chronic lawbreakers -- arrested four or
more times -- by age 27. The children in the study had similar
socio-economic and family backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The report was issued by Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a
700-member bipartisan coalition of police chiefs, sheriffs and
crime victims. Former police chiefs William Bratton, of New York
City, and Jerry Sanders, of San Diego, were among the report's
authors.
</P>
<P>
   It called for increased spending, saying for many poor families
child care consumes a quarter of their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   It also proposed better training and higher salaries for
child-care workers -- whose median hourly wage is $4.69, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Dodd and Cardin are pushing for an additional $3
billion to create slots for another 950,000 children in Head Start
and for block grants to expand early education and child care for
kids under 5.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is also pushing a plan to provide tax breaks for
parents and employers that offer day care for workers' children.
</P>
<P>
   The report's author, Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, of Harvard
University, said ''scientific research now proves the early
childhood development programs that help kids in so many other ways
are also our most powerful weapons in the fight against youth
violence. We have every kind of evidence that this works and works
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, polls released along with the child studies
showed that parents and police alike overwhelmingly support
child-care and after-school activities.
</P>
<P>
   There was less agreement on whether children should be charged
as adults, kept in prisons or subjected to other increasingly
punitive measures, organizers said. The polls found that 17 percent
of police chiefs favor charging more juveniles as adults, compared
with 12 percent of the public.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rescues Shipwrecked Haitians  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Ragged and weary, 288 Haitians rescued
from a shipwreck in a dramatic U.S. Coast Guard mission have
arrived in the Bahamian capital, with many saying they were trying
to get to Florida and that up to 17 people died in the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Crews rescued the Haitians on Thursday, with U.S. Coast Guard
helicopters evacuating 65 people suffering from severe hypothermia,
dehydration and kidney failure. Their ship ran aground Wednesday
off Flamingo Cay in the Ragged Island chain, about 250 miles from
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   At least 22 of those hospitalized were released and placed in
detention on Friday, when the remaining passengers arrived in
Nassau aboard a Bahamian Defense Force cutter. They also have been
placed in detention and will be questioned before being sent back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We left Haiti in a boat because of the situation in the
country. There's a thousand riots,'' said Barnabas Estime, one of
the survivors. ''There's a lot of other persons who leave for the
same situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The boatload -- the largest single group to arrive in the Bahamas
in years -- comes amid a dramatic increase in the number of Haitians
seeking refuge here and coincides with increasing violence in Haiti
as the nation gears up for long-postponed legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident, 122 Haitians landed Wednesday on Inagua,
the southernmost Bahamian island 100 miles from Haiti's north
coast. On April 21, 224 Haitians arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Some fear that the Bahamas and the United States could face a
new flood of Haitians headed for their shores.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know that election will be held in Haiti and the situation
has become harder,'' Estime said.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrivals may just be a usual increase during the Easter
season, when migrants believe there will be fewer Coast Guard
patrols, Bahamian immigration director Vernon Burrows said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ''there is major concern as to whether or not there is
going to be some mass exodus of persons out of Haiti into the
Bahamas or the United States during the next few months,'' Burrows
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, rescuers found two bodies on the
half-submerged Haitian vessel, a 50-foot wooden slope intended to
carry no more than 50 people, according to Petty Officer Gibran
Soto of the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Nedly Martinborough of the Bahamas Defense Force said
survivors told him Friday that as many as 17 may have died.
Earlier, officials said survivors reported eight people had drowned
in a storm and when the boat ran aground, and another six died of
dehydration on Flamingo Cay.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known how long the survivors were on the
cay -- a 10-foot sliver of scrub land and rocks -- without water or
food before the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.S. sailing vessels spotted the wreck and alerted
officials.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Coast Guard helicopters ran dozens of flights, ferrying
survivors and supplies flown by a C-130 aircraft from a Coast Guard
base in Clearwater, Fla. The operation ended Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Martinborough said the survivors told him the group allegedly
stole a boat and scraped up enough money for food and water and to
pay a captain to take them to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian ambassador to the Bahamas, Joseph Etienne, said many
Haitian-Bahamians have called the embassy for information on those
who died, which officials have not yet been able to compile. He
said Haitian authorities have promised to step up patrols along the
coasts to avoid more potentially deadly trips.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the government cannot allow the situation to worsen,''
Etienne said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Troops Take Stronghold  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Troops fought today to take
control of the final reaches of a mountainous Muslim rebel
stronghold, after seizing most of the camp but failing to find 27
hostages, mostly children, held there for nearly six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elite troops pursued fleeing Abu Sayyaf rebels along an upper
ridge of the heavily forested, 2,950-foot mountain, spokesman Col.
Hilario Atendido said. Others shelled rebel positions, while planes
dropped bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers found shallow graves believed to contain the bodies of
about 20 rebels, and suspected other bodies were hidden in the
camp's network of foxholes, bunkers and tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get near caves and tunnels the smell of dead bodies
is overpowering,'' Deputy Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim said. ''We
hope this is not of the hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were among about 50 people seized March 20 from two
schools by the rebels, who are demanding the release of three
terrorists from U.S. jails, including the mastermind of the World
Trade Center bombing. The rebels released some hostages and said
they beheaded two last week as a ''birthday present'' to President
Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said 80 percent of the rebel base, located on the
southern island of Basilan, was under the control of government
troops, and that the hostages were likely hidden in bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier was killed and seven wounded in Friday's fighting,
bringing the government toll to six dead and 32 wounded since about
1,500 government troops launched the rescue operation a week ago,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 21 hostages were seized Sunday from a Malaysian resort
island and believed taken to near the Philippine town of Talipao on
Sulu island, about 50 miles southwest of Basilan. Officials said at
least some of the kidnappers are members of the Abu Sayyaf, but no
direct link has been made since the group is loosely connected.
</P>
<P>
   Jamasali Abdurahman, a Muslim religious leader acting as a
go-between, said today that the hostages, including 10 foreign
tourists, were doing well.
</P>
<P>
   He said the kidnappers had conveyed three verbal demands and
would present a full written list that could include a ransom
demand. The demands so far included fulfilling a 1976 agreement
that provided for a 13-province autonomous region, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for direct negotiations were unclear after Abu Sayyaf
commander Galib Andang told a local radio station that they would
negotiate only with ambassadors from the hostages' countries.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed station DXRZ to interview one of the hostages, Carel
Strydom from South Africa. In comments dictated by someone
whispering next to him, Strydom asked the United Nations to tell
the Philippine government to stop its military actions against the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate radio interview, Abu Ahmad, spokesman of the
Basilan rebels, warned that the tourists held in Sulu would be
beheaded if their ambassadors refuse to negotiate. But Andang did
not make a similar threat.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada has ruled out any ransom payment. A police official said
the kidnappers are demanding $2.4 million and the release of
relatives jailed in Malaysia for various crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the military will not
halt the offensive in Basilan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost over,'' he said. We will complete it.''

<HEADLINE> Lindenmuth Wins at Cycling Trials  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRISCO, Texas (AP) -- Tanya Lindenmuth insists she's still in the
learning stage of her cycling career. Her competitors might try to
dodge her if she gets any better.
</P>
<P>
   Lindenmuth, of Trexlertown, Pa., won the women's match sprint
Friday at the U.S. Cycling trials, beating Jennie Reed of Kirkland,
Wash., in the first two races of a best-of-three format.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rematch of last year's national title match, when
Lindenmuth took the championship from Reed, an old friend from
their training days.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the second time I've been able to be competitive
against her,'' Lindenmuth said. ''She's always been so strong and
I've admired her so much, her poise and her strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindenmuth, 20, isn't doing poorly herself. Although she and
other cyclists won't know the Olympic team until U.S. coaches fill
the roster in July, she made a strong case for herself.
</P>
<P>
   In match sprint, riders try to position themselves in the first
two laps to beat the opponent during a final-lap sprint. Strategy
comes into play when a rider tries to disrupt the other's
positioning.
</P>
<P>
   Lindenmuth won with wits and power.
</P>
<P>
   Reed started ahead of her in the decisive second sprint, setting
a rapid pace. Lindenmuth's thighs burned, but she stayed within
striking distance and then blew past Reed on the homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew after the first ride she'd want the front and she was
going hard,'' Lindenmuth said. ''And that hurt, it definitely hurt.
But it felt really good to come across the line first.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Trexlertown rider won men's sprint, but Marty Nothstein
established himself years ago as one of the world's top riders.
He's comfortable carrying most of U.S. Cycling's medal hopes for
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not a problem for me,'' he said. ''I want the load. I
want to be the guy who's expected to win. I can race well under
pressure, and I wouldn't even call it pressure. I know what I can
do, and I know I can win.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's sprint final, Nothstein dispatched Jeff Solt of Los
Altos Hills, Calif., in two races.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm real pleased with the way I rode,'' Nothstein said. ''I
rode with good power, with a lot of strength. But by all means,
I've got a lot of work ahead. I'm right where I want to be, but I'm
not an Olympic gold medalist yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein was cheered by fans who filled the stands at the
Superdrome. After beating Solt, Nothstein raised his index finger
as he crossed the finish line. On the victory lap, he raised both
arms and waved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just part of the game,'' he explained later.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein isn't finished yet. He is scheduled to compete in
today's keirin, where a pack of riders follows a pace motorcycle
for two kilometers. The cyclists sprint over the final two laps.
</P>
<P>
   In an exhibition event, he planned to go after the one-lap track
record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I plan on demolishing it,'' Nothstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Jame Carney, a purple-haired distance man from Flagstaff, Ariz.,
won the 25-kilometer points race. He also won the miss-and-out, a
non-Olympic race where a pack is thinned by removing the last-place
rider on each lap.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Tyler, an Australian with dual American citizenship, won
the 20-kilometer women's points race. She's estranged from the
Australian cycling team and, training in Miami, is seeking a
release to compete for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   In the final event, Tanya Dubnicoff of Winnipeg, Canada,
established a women's single-lap track record. She covered the
250-meter track in 14.69 seconds to beat nine other riders.

<HEADLINE> Stadler Shares Lead at Houston Open  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stadler, who lost 50 pounds on a steady diet, shot a 3-under-par
69 Friday to gain a share of the second-round lead at the Shell
Houston Open with Loren Roberts and Robert Allenby.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a lack of any other word, I've worked my butt off for the
past couple of months,'' Stadler said. ''I've dropped a couple of
inches on my waist line. I've been staying steady and found a good
little zone for the swing. I just haven't been able to score.''
</P>
<P>
   He scored well enough on Friday, joining Roberts and Allenby
with 9-under par 135 totals to lead the 77 players who made the
2-under par 142 cut.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Franco, the first day co-leader, shot a 1-under-par 71 in
the second round for a 136 total, leading a group of six players
sharing second place at 8 under.
</P>
<P>
   The others are Fred Funk, Matt Gogel, Paul Stankowski, Mark
Brooks and Scott Hoch.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Kuehne, who shared the first-round lead with Franco,
dropped back with a 2-over-par 74 for a 139 total.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler had three birdies and three bogeys on the front nine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried for the first few holes to avoid disaster,'' Stadler
said. ''I just kind of got myself through the front nine. Then I
got more confident with the putting on the backside, and coming in
was pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadler got up and down on the first three holes of the back
nine, then settled down. His birdie on the final hole got him a tie
for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby and Roberts each shot 5-under-par 67s. Roberts birdied
four of his first six holes and overcame consecutive bogeys on Nos.
1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   After the bogeys, Roberts had three birdie putts, finishing on
No. 9 by running in a 12-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been pretty lucky to shoot some low numbers,'' Roberts
said. ''I think for me it's a matter of, when I putt well, that's
it. When I get on a roll with the putter sometimes, it gets pretty
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch was happy to be near the top of the leader board, but he
thought the rough was cut too short to be challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably would have missed the cut given the normal
conditions here,'' Hoch said. ''But since they decided to put the
ladies' rough out there ...
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody's got the idea that we want to play with less rough
and harder greens.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's go ahead and let the long hitters win every week.
They're what runs the tour. They're what makes the Neilsen ratings
go up and everything else. Maybe that's what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch didn't drive the ball well on Friday, but didn't feel he
was penalized for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't drive it any good and I shoot 7 under. That's not
supposed to happened,'' Hoch said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus was on the course as a spectator, watching his son
Gary shoot a 1-over par 73 for a 1-under-par 143 total, missing the
cut by one shot.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus declined to sign an autograph during the round saying,
''I'm a Dad today.'' Nicklaus later accommodated a large crowd of
autograph seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton, the only top 10 money-winner in the field, had a
second-round 69 for a 140 total.

<HEADLINE> Webb Defends Round at Chick-fil-A  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKBRIDGE, Ga. (AP) -- Karrie Webb is so dominant on the LPGA
Tour that she had to defend herself after shooting a 68.
</P>
<P>
   Webb faded down the stretch, but still put herself in position
for another victory, lurking just three shots behind leader Sophie
Gustafson after the opening round Friday of the Chick-fil-A Charity
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I left a couple of shots out there,'' admitted Webb, who was
at 6-under-par through 10 holes, but played the rest of the round
at 2 over. ''A 68 was probably the worst I could have shot today.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, coming off a month-long vacation, struggled with her
mental focus as the round dragged on for more than five hours at
Eagles Landing Country Club. Her threesome, which also included
Nancy Lopez and Lorie Kane, was put on the clock for slow play. By
the end, Webb looked like a mere mortal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's easier to forgive myself because I have seen a lot of
birdies and a lot of putts go in,'' he said. ''I know I can turn
things around.''
</P>
<P>
   So does everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Although 46 of the top 50 money-winners are playing in the
Atlanta-area tournament, no one can match Webb's numbers. The 1999
player of the year has been dominant during her first five
tournaments in 2000, winning four times and finishing second in the
other event.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just try and keep up out there,'' said Val Skinner, who
was two shots off the lead with a 67. ''She has really raised the
bar out here for all of us. Her play is extremely impressive and
there is no need to look at the leader board when she is out there,
because you just know that you have to be 3 or 4 under just to
assure that you keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, playing the back nine first, birdied five holes before
making the turn, then knocked in a 12-footer for birdie at No. 1.
Her troubles began at No. 3 -- a short par-5 that's a par-4 for
members -- when her second shot from 176 yards landed in the creek
that trickles in front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could have played more conservative,'' Webb said. ''But I
was 6 under through 10 and things were good.''
</P>
<P>
   That mistake seemed to slow her momentum. Webb muddled through
five straight pars before taking a bogey at the final hole when she
missed a 12-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, I'm pretty happy with my round,'' she said. ''I
made some mental errors. I was little tired -- mentally, not
physically. That's natural when you've had four weeks off.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb took advantage of a lull in the schedule -- only one
tournament since her victory at the Nabisco Championship on March
26 -- to spend some time fishing and playing golf at her home in
Boynton Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson, seeking her first victory as she plays her second
full season on the tour, shot a 7-under 65 for a 2-shot lead over
Skinner and Amy Fruhwirth. Another shot back were Webb and Michelle
McGann.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Gustafson overcame a double-bogey at 14 by
making several long putts, including a 30-footer for birdie at No.
1 and another 30-footer for eagle at No. 3. She completed her round
with a flourish at the 465-yard 18th, knocking a 4-iron within 15
feet and making the eagle putt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was able to hit the ball good out there, and I had some
putts that went in,'' said Gustafson, who benefited from playing in
the morning when the wind was calmer and the greens softer after
heavy overnight rains.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner is a six-time winner on the LPGA Tour, but her last
victory was in 1995. She bogeyed her first hole, sailing an 8-iron
over the green and into a back bunker, but that was her only major
mistake. Skinner had six birdies and 11 pars the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some reason, I was very patient and I hung in there,''
said Skinner, who has won only $6,263 this year and missed the cut
in three of her four events. ''When the chances came, I was able to
make it, and that was the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Fruhwirth, seeking her second LPGA victory, also started with a
bogey, but played her final seven holes in 5 under, including a
streak of four straight birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit straight and long off the tee and I had some good iron
shots into the green,'' she said. ''Overall, it was kind of a
boring round.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, serving as official host of the $900,000 tournament for
the first time, and Kane, runner-up in the Chick-fil-A for two
straight years, both struggled to 73s.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Rachel Hetherington, who beat Kane in a
playoff last year, was nine shots off the lead after a 74.

<HEADLINE> 5 Dead in Suburban Pa. Shootings  </HEADLINE>
By TODD SPANGLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   McKEES ROCKS, Pa. (AP) -- A white man opened fire in several
suburban Pittsburgh communities Friday, killing five people and
critically wounding a sixth in what police called a racially
motivated shooting spree. The man was apprehended and charged.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings took place within a 20-mile range through suburbs
surrounding Pittsburgh during about an hour span Friday afternoon.
The gunman fatally shot a person of Indian descent at an Indian
grocery store, two employees at a Chinese restaurant and a black
man at a martial arts school. A Jewish woman who lived next door to
the suspect's parents was found dead in her home.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Richard Baumhammers, 34, smirked at onlookers as he
was led into a magistrate's office in Beaver Falls on Friday night
wearing a bulletproof vest. Baumhammers, a lawyer from Mount
Lebanon, was charged with criminal homicide and reckless
endangerment in the martial arts school shooting. He was being held
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spree was the second of its kind in the region
since March, when a black man allegedly yelled racial epithets and
killed three white men.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not again. Those are the first words that come to mind. Not
again,'' Gov. Tom Ridge said Friday night in Pebble Beach, Calif.,
where he was speaking to a Republican group. ''Across Pennsylvania,
and particularly in southwestern Pennsylvania, we are struggling to
make sense of what appears to be yet another brutal racist
rampage.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described the shooter as appearing calm as he climbed
into a Jeep to drive from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   Police received first word of the shootings shortly before 2
p.m., when a small fire set in a back bedroom of a home triggered
an alarm that alerted officers. When they responded, they found
Anita Gordon, 63, shot twice inside her house.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was an angel,'' said her husband, Sanford, adding that
Baumhammers' family lived next door since the suspect was a child.
''(They were) pillars of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   While they were at the Gordons' house, police got a call of
shots fired at Beth El Congregations, a synagogue less than a mile
away where Gordon was a member. The synagogue's glass doors were
shot out, the word ''Jew'' was painted on the front and swastikas
were painted on its outside walls.
</P>
<P>
   Police then received reports of two Indian men being shot at an
Indian grocery store in Carnegie. A 30-year-old man was killed and
a 25-year-old man was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Kretzler, who owns a travel agency next to the grocery,
said he saw Baumhammers walk out of the store wearing a sport coat
and tucking his gun into his holster or waistband. He calmly walked
40 yards to his car, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got in and sat for maybe five or ten seconds without doing
anything, and just very calm and collectedly pulled out as if
pulling out after buying a bag of groceries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing there to make you think he had done anything
wrong,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Shots were fired shortly afterward at another synagogue in
Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, police received a call reporting two
employees had been shot at a Chinese restaurant in a McKees Rocks
shopping plaza. Killed were Thao Pham, 30, a deliveryman of
Vietnamese descent, and Ji-Ye Sun, 34, the manager of the Ya Fei
Chinese Cuisine restaurant who was of Chinese origin.
</P>
<P>
   Police received call of man shot at karate school in a Monaca
shopping plaza about 3 p.m. A 22-year-old black man, Garry Lee, was
shot and killed, police said. Baumhammers was arrested 15 minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   A witness at the martial arts school had called police and gave
a description of Baumhammers' sport utility vehicle; officers
caught up with him as he was crossing a bridge into Aliquippa and
pulled him over.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wolf, acting Allegheny County Police superintendent, said
Baumhammers had a gun and several rounds of ammunition with him
when he was stopped. He did not offer any resistance when he was
arrested, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are taking a tack of ethnic intimidation -- a hate crime,''
Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers was armed with a .357-caliber handgun, the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   An arraignment was pending on the other slayings, which occurred
in adjacent Allegheny County.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers passed the Georgia bar exam in 1993 and belonged to
the Georgia Bar Association. He was listed as a legal reference for
immigration matters on the Web page for an attorney in Latvia. His
parents, Inese and Andrejs, are both dentists and his father taught
at the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Gazette said the family had emigrated from Latvia after
World War II. Their neighbor, Gordon, said Bauhammers had spent
time in Latvia recently.
</P>
<P>
   In the March shooting spree, a black man, Ronald Taylor,
allegedly killed three white men and wounded two others. Taylor,
39, is accused of fatally shooting a maintenance man at his
apartment building in Wilkinsburg, setting his apartment on fire,
then shooting four people -- two fatally -- at fast-food restaurants.

<P>
   Taylor, who has since been diagnosed with schizophrenia, was
charged with homicide and remains at a state mental hospital. He
was charged with ethnic intimidation.

<HEADLINE> 5 Dead in Suburban Pa. Shootings  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The violence started at a suburban home, where
a Jewish woman had been shot dead, and quickly spread to an Indian
grocery store, a Chinese restaurant and, finally, a karate school.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of an hour, police say a man targeting
minorities calmly drove across the four Pittsburgh suburbs Friday
afternoon and methodically picked out his victims.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, five people had been shot dead. They included the
Jewish woman, a black man, two men of Asian descent and another man
of Indian descent. A second Indian man was critically wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Richard Scott Baumhammers, 34, an immigration
lawyer and the son of Latvian immigrants who lived in suburban
Mount Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   He remained jailed early today in Beaver County, where he was
arrested shortly after a 22-year-old black man was shot and killed
in a karate studio. Baumhammers was charged with homicide and
reckless endangerment in that shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said his arraignment was pending on the other
slayings, which occurred in adjacent Allegheny County.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are taking a tack of ethnic intimidation -- a hate crime,''
said Paul Wolf, acting Allegheny County Police superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly shooting spree was the second of its kind in the
region since March, when a black man allegedly yelled racial
epithets and killed three white men.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an attack against us all, because it sought in its
violence to divide us by the color of our skin and the nations of
our ancestors,'' Gov. Tom Ridge said from Pebble Beach, Calif.,
where he was speaking to a Republican group.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are struggling to make sense of what appears to be yet
another brutal racist rampage.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Baumhammers' brief arraignment Friday in Beaver Falls,
about 25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, a crowd jeered him and
called for his execution. He smirked as police led him around in a
bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   The killings took place within a 20-mile range through suburbs
surrounding Pittsburgh. The shooter was armed with a .357-caliber
handgun, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Police received first word of the shootings shortly before 2
p.m., when they responded to a small fire at the home of Anita
Gordon in Mount Lebanon, next door to the home of Bauhammers'
parents. Gordon, 63, was found dead inside the home. She had been
shot twice.
</P>
<P>
   While they were at Gordon's house, police got a call of shots
fired at Beth El Congregations, a synagogue less than a mile away
where Gordon was a member. The synagogue's glass doors were shot
out, the word ''Jew'' was painted on the front and swastikas were
painted on its outside walls.
</P>
<P>
   Police then received reports of two men being shot at an Indian
grocery store in Carnegie. Anil Thakur, 31, died at Allegheny
General Hospital about four hours after he was shot. Sandip Patel,
25, was in critical condition early today at Mercy Hospital in
Pittsburgh, authorities said. The Post-Gazette said he was shot in
the neck and was facing the possibility of permanent paralysis.
Both men are of Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Kretzler, who owns a travel agency next to the Indian
grocery, said the shooter appeared calm as he walked out of the
store, tucked away a gun and walked to his car.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got in and sat for maybe five or 10 seconds without doing
anything, and just very calm and collectedly pulled out as if
pulling out after buying a bag of groceries,'' Kretzler said.
</P>
<P>
   Shots were fired shortly afterward at another synagogue in
Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, police received a call reporting two
employees had been shot at a Chinese restaurant in a McKees Rocks
shopping plaza. Killed were Thao Pham, 30, a deliveryman of
Vietnamese descent, and Ji-Ye Sun, 34, the Chinese manager of the
Ya Fei Chinese Cuisine restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m., police received call of man shot at karate school
in a Monaca shopping plaza. Garry Lee, 22, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers was arrested about 15 minutes later, after someone
at the karate school provided police with a description of a
suspect driving a black sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said Baumhammers had a gun and several rounds of ammunition
with him when he was stopped, and was taken into custody without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has joined the investigation because of the possibility
that the crimes were racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers passed the Georgia bar exam in 1993 and belonged to
the Georgia Bar Association. His parents, Inese and Andrejs, are
both dentists and his father taught at the University of
Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Gore Offers Education Plan  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore took a
record-setting four hours of questions at a town hall meeting
before making a midnight stop at a rollicking Native American
pow-wow.
</P>
<P>
   Gore apologized for arriving so late to the Gathering of
Nations, which was in the midst of a late-night dance contest, with
dancers in traditional Native American feathers and paint stomping
to the beat of pounding drums.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I start these (town hall) meetings I always say to the
people there that I will not leave as long as anyone has a question
to ask me. What I didn't understand at the beginning of this
meeting was that everyone had a question to ask me,'' Gore told the
Gathering of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's question-and-answer session was meant for undecided
voters, although there were a good number of students too young to
vote there, too. Education dominated the discussion, with about one
in three questions focusing on schools.
</P>
<P>
   One teacher asserted that all politicians promise help for
schools yet help never seems to arrive in her classroom. Why was
Gore any different, she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded that he hoped to win the presidency with a
mandate from voters that would give his education plans momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will have your voices
backing me up when I go to the Congress and the country and say, 'I
said this is my No. 1 priority and you elected me,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore answered questions on topics ranging from the environment
and immigrants to Elian Gonzalez and political gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed with one man that not enough gets done in Washington
but disagreed that eliminating political parties was the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore agreed that more money is needed for health research, but
he declined to endorse Gary Taylor's request for a huge increase on
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   And when a man in black leather began explaining the benefits of
drug legalization, Gore shot back, ''I'm not for it,'' a response
that was met with applause from the audience and mock relief from
press aides.
</P>
<P>
   The questioner, Paul Hilliard, said he was ''happy enough'' with
Gore, who went on to discuss his support for drug abuse treatment
and other initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a politician, that's what he does,'' Hilliard said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took questions from the audience for more than two and a
half hours. Then, for another hour and a half, he talked with
participants one-on-one. Some just wanted autographs or snapshots,
but others engaged him in extended policy discussions on a host of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the previous record for a Gore town meeting was three
hours and 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One man questioned him at length on his position that Elian
Gonzalez' fate should be decided by a family court that would
consider the child's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision shouldn't be made on the basis of politics,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The man responded, ''If I could really believe that this had
nothing to do with the calculation of trying to win Florida I would
feel a lot better about voting for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Well thank you,'' Gore responded.
</P>
<P>
   Participants were pretty frank, even as they talked with the
vice president up close, one-on-one, albeit surrounding the Secret
Service officers.
</P>
<P>
   Marcela Diaz questioned Gore on immigration issues. The pair did
not agree on several points, and she told him: ''I would like to
vote for you, but I really need to think about it.''

<HEADLINE> Voters Nix Altered Crops at Kellogg  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- An effort to force Kellogg Co. to
stop using genetically altered crops failed when shareholders
overwhelmingly defeated a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's vote came amid claims from two groups of nuns that the
crops are unsafe and put the company at risk for lawsuits.
Regardless, the resolution was voted down by 94 percent of the
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we thought there was anything ... that even hinted at these
products being unsafe, we would have taken them our of our food a
long time ago,'' chief executive Carlos Gutierrez told
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Activists, including Greenpeace, have lobbied the world's
leading cereal company to end use of genetically altered
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The company has removed or is in the process of removing such
ingredients from its European and Australian products, but has
declined to do so in the United States, citing a lack of consumer
interest and insufficient scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the proposal called Friday's vote a success,
saying the resolution received enough support to be considered
again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need 3 percent to get it on the ballot for next year.
That's pretty good for a first-year resolution on a subject that a
lot of people never heard of six months ago,'' Greenpeace spokesman
Charles Margulis said.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Judy Schroeder of Sisters of St. Joseph called it a
victory that their voices were heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have an obligation to future generations to not
harm the very fragile balance of the ecosystem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other food and beverage companies also have been targeted with
similar anti-biotech proposals, including General Mills, Quaker
Oats and Sara Lee. Coca-Cola's shareholders rejected a similar
proposal last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, Kellogg has twice been picketed by
Greenpeace activists, who want Kellogg to adopt a commitment
similar to that made by Gerber. The baby food maker says it won't
use genetically altered products in its products.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gordon Judd, a spokesman for the groups pushing the
proposal, said keeping genetically engineered food on Kellogg's
table could potentially hurt its market share and stock price, and
''needlessly expose Kellogg to liability.''

<HEADLINE> Same-Sex Couple Prepares for Prom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLOYD, Va. (AP) -- A teen-age girl and her female date are
preparing for a high school prom, despite strong opposition from
community leaders and concerns over their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of parents and other community members have turned out at
recent school board meetings to oppose Tiffany Lapine's plan to
attend the Floyd County High School junior prom with another girl.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union took Tiffany's side and told
school officials on March 29 that barring her from taking a female
date would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   School officials ultimately decided that Tiffany could attend
tonight's prom with her date, who is not a student at Floyd County
High.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a lot of difficulty over this,'' principal Norman
Blanchard said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those against same-sex couples attending prom is County
Supervisor Fred Gerald, who fears the girls' attendance will ruin
the prom for other students and set a poor moral precedent.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes most county residents agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want these same-sex dates,'' he said. ''It's just
got the whole county upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools Superintendent Terry Arbogast declined comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's father, Warren Lapine, said reports of angry residents
worry him and he plans to escort Tiffany and her date to the dance.
</P>
<P>
   He said the angry people are likely just a vocal minority.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really thought as a country we had moved beyond this kind of
intolerance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid the publicity and discord, Tiffany said attending the
dance will be worth the effort. She called it a small step for gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just hope the pictures turn out well,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Teen Gets Jail for Columbine Threat  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE TSAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A Florida teen has been sentenced to four months
in prison for threatening in an e-mail to finish what two student
gunmen started last spring at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Tom Strickland said Friday's sentencing of Michael
Ian Campbell, 18, delivered a message that Internet threats will
not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we first charged this case, we made it clear that this
kind of conduct was serious conduct that had serious consequences,
that these types of threats would not be tolerated,'' Strickland
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, Campbell sent an online message telling Columbine
sophomore Erin Walton he would finish what gunmen Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold started when they killed 13 people at Columbine High
School, then shot themselves in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's message, sent under the screen name ''Soup81,''
prompted school officials to close Columbine for winter break two
days early.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager's lawyer, Ellis Rubin wanted to argue Campbell was
innocent in an ''Internet intoxication defense'' that said victims
cannot distinguish between reality and cyber-reality after spending
excessive time on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham also ordered Campbell to
serve three years' probation, stop using the Internet and receive
mental health treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he believed Campbell had accepted responsibility,
but evidence showed he had deliberately sought out a Columbine
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Walton, who cried during her statement before sentencing, left
the courtroom in fresh tears when Campbell's mother jumped up to
help her fainting son and wagged a finger in Walton's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may have been a stupid prank, but that prank stole away the
innocence of my daughter,'' Jackie Walton told the judge. Her
daughter has since left Columbine.

<HEADLINE> Sweatshop Watchdogs Urge Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK RIDGE, Ill. (AP) -- If the Worker Rights Consortium wants to
improve conditions at foreign factories where college sports
apparel is made, it needs to work with the manufacturers,
universities involved in the new anti-sweatshop group say.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from 37 schools met at the Big Ten Conference
headquarters and agreed the watchdog group should give universities
more than three seats on its 12-member governing board, and should
find ways to cooperate with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to put these issues on the table if this organization
is going to work,'' said Larry Mann, associate chancellor of the
University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Labor practices at foreign factories under contract to shoe and
sportswear makers have come under criticism from universities
across the country. Forty-seven schools have joined the consortium,
many after student protests.
</P>
<P>
   The WRC is meeting resistance from corporations such as Nike,
which has vowed not to permit surprise inspections desired by the
WRC's student founders. Nike also has dropped out of contracts with
schools that joined the WRC.
</P>
<P>
   Nike spokesman Vada Manager said contract disputes that ended
deals with the University of Michigan and Brown University are
related to terms of the individual contracts -- not the schools'
decisions to join the WRC.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Nike Chairman Phil Knight withdrew plans to
donate $30 million to his alma mater, the University of Oregon,
after that school joined the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   University officials at Friday's meeting said they are not
pushing to give manufacturers seats on the governing board. But
consensus is building to give industry leaders a chance to be
partners in the effort -- instead of adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The students have made it clear they don't want industry
representation on the board, but we have to decide what's an
acceptable alternative,'' said Melany Newby, vice chancellor at the
University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin joined the WRC after student protests. The school
withdrew from another monitoring group, the Fair Labor Association,
which activists criticized because its board includes heavy
representation from apparel-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Among Nike's problems with the WRC is a demand for companies to
provide workers an undefined ''living wage'' and calls for surprise
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ''They seem to have set up a system of 'gotcha' monitoring,''
Manager said. Nike prefers the attitude of the Fair Labor
Association, which ''sits down with the companies to talk about
issues and rectify problems together.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Roeper, a former student activist at Haverford College who
is now the coordinator of the New York-based WRC, said that while
students would likely oppose any industry seats on the board, she
doubts students would oppose the position that several university
officials repeated during Friday's meeting -- ''engaging the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Roeper said she also was encouraged by the number of schools
that sent representatives to the meeting -- a sign they are serious
about the WRC's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Several schools that are not yet members sent delegates to
observe, including Notre Dame.

<HEADLINE> Staples Ctr Workers Approve Contract  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Concession workers at the Staples Center have
approved the first labor contract, averting potentially
embarrassing labor strife at the site of this summer's Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The contract covering 450 workers at the arena was approved
Friday by a vote of about 65-0, said David Koff, a senior research
analyst with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
International Union. There was no minimum number of votes necessary
to ratify the contract, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The union and concessionaire Ogden Entertainment had been
feuding since the center opened in September, and were under
pressure to reach a deal before the Democratic convention starts in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Concession stand attendants, who make up the bulk of the
workforce, will see their hourly pay increase from an average of
$8.76 to $10.55 immediately, Koff said. Yearly increases will push
the wage to $12.50 an hour by March 1, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The 4{-year deal also provides family health insurance, vacation
time, paid holidays, a pension plan and a legal services plan, Koff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers, labor leaders and officials from Ogden and Staples
Center praised the contract at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''In just a few short weeks from now, this is going to be the
centerpoint of the world's attention. We intend to have a very
smooth convention,'' said Miguel Contreras, executive secretary of
the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved is a labor agreement for operating engineers at
Staples Center, but Contreras said he expected those issues to be
resolved before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to announcing to the DNC and the delegates
that will be here in Los Angeles that they've entered a 100 percent
union house,'' Contreras said.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Returns to Campaign Trail  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- A day after revealing he has
prostate cancer, an upbeat Rudolph Giuliani said that he still
wants to be senator but needs to determine a course of treatment
before deciding on his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully I'll be able to do that and run and give you the
kind of candidate you deserve.'' Giuliani told about 1,000 upstate
voters at a dinner Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City mayor was greeted with standing ovations and
cheers at the $50-a-plate Saratoga County Women's Republican Club
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arizona Sen. John McCain, a close friend and ally of
the mayor, said he will stand in for Giuliani as he decides how to
treat the disease, the New York Post reported in today's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The maverick senator who won some presidential primaries this
year before dropping out of that race aims to keep pressure on
Democratic Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who announced his cancer diagnosis on Thursday, was
asked who he would support if he decides not to run. ''I'm not
going to get into that. I know who I don't want to support,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who phoned her get-well wishes to Giuliani on Thursday,
was back in Washington on Friday, unveiling a study showing that
children who spend their early years in quality day-care are less
likely to be arrested down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Giuliani made a brief appearance at City Hall,
where he received a gift of get-well cannolis fresh from a Staten
Island bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the mayor, who has received hundreds of calls from
well-wishers, returned many -- including one to Yankees Manager Joe
Torre, who had surgery for prostate cancer last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you hear the word cancer, it's frightening. It's still
frightening, but cancer is no longer a death sentence. That has to
be first and foremost in your mind,'' Torre said later during a
pre-game media availability at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said the only advice he offered Giuliani was that he
should listen to his doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he will cut some of his campaign stops to make
time for consultation with doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The first cancellations were two speeches before lawyers' groups
scheduled for Monday -- one in Syracuse, the other in Rochester. The
speeches originally were scheduled as part of Giuliani's mayoral
duties, not his Senate campaign, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   A scheduled stop today in Buffalo, where Giuliani will court the
support of the Independence Party, will proceed as planned, aides
said. The first lady also plans to attend the event, a campaign
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Gunman Found Sane, May Go Free  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The gunman in the death of a local boxer has
been declared sane and could soon be freed, two months after he was
found innocent of murder by reason of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at St. Elizabeths Hospital recently concluded that Tomar
Cooper Locker, 25, shows no sign of major psychiatric problems and
requires no treatment. He was charged with opening fire in a
crowded lobby of the Washington Hospital Center on Feb. 5, 1998,
killing Reuben Bell and wounding five bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Locker had long blamed Bell for the April 1994 killing of his
girlfriend, Keisha Cragg. Locker was shot eight times in the
attack. Bell was never charged with Cragg's killing.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, a D.C. Superior Court jury was swayed by a
defense psychiatrist who said the crime was a split-second reaction
to post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   However, more recently, doctors concluded he was sane. Those
findings came as no surprise to prosecutors, who had argued all
along that he knew exactly what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's basically ridiculous,'' said assistant U.S. attorney
Peter R. Zeidenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Lee Satterfield had sentenced Locker to
serve 20 to 60 months in prison on a charge of carrying a pistol
without a license, the maximum under the law. But because Locker
has already been in custody for 26 months, he is eligible for
immediate parole.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Satterfield released Locker from the hospital's
custody. The parole board could require Locker to serve all 60
months, but defense attorneys hope to persuade the board to release
him within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a case where it's a thug beating the system,''
defense attorney Bernard S. Grimm said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Will Try To Pass Education Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a threatened presidential veto, Senate
Republicans will soon try to pass an education bill that gives
parents and teachers more authority to make decisions for their
schools, Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said today.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents and educators in your community will be able to target
funding towards your students' greatest educational needs,'' Gorton
said in the weekly Republican radio address. ''Whether it is for
small classes, a program focused on improving student's reading
skills, computers in the classrooms, or whatever is needed most.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, House Republicans narrowly passed the Academic
Achievement for All Act, or ''Straight A's,'' which gave 10 states
in a pilot program more freedom in complying with federal school
programs.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has pledged to veto ''Straight A's,'' saying
it would turn federal education programs into a lump sum that
states could invest in children who are neither poor nor
low-achieving.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said Democrats oppose the bill because they believe they
know better than parents and teachers what is right for children.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Clinton wants to move in a different direction,'' he
said. ''Whether your school is located in Walla Walla, Washington;
the Bronx, New York, or somewhere in between, he thinks he knows
what's best for your school.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill seeks to increase parental involvement in
education and make schools safer from violence, Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every child, regardless of income or where he or she lives,
has the right to a quality education -- free of unfair and
inappropriate restrictions set by Washington, D.C.,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Seton Hall academic year ends with questions about unsolved dormfire  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- The flags at Seton Hall University no
longer fly at half-staff. The police tape surrounding Boland Hall
is long gone. Students passing each other on the college green chat
about finals, parties and dorm assignments for next year.
</P>
<P>
   But more than three months after a smoky, intense dormitory fire
killed three freshmen and injured 58, the school year is ending
with so many unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be nice,'' said sophomore Eric Nunez, staring at
Boland Hall, ''to know what happened, exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunez most likely will go home for the summer next week without
learning the cause of the blaze that began in a third-floor lounge
before dawn on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The fire sent hundreds of terrified freshmen staggering
half-dressed into the predawn cold outside. Some jumped out
windows; at least four were critically burned. Authorities found
the bodies of Frank Caltabilota, John Giunta and Aaron Karol, all
18, in the lounge and in a nearby bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo stopped giving any public
updates about the investigation within days of the fire. Campolo
refused recently even to say how many people are still assigned to
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Fire safety experts say that because evidence is often burned
away, fire investigations can take months to complete. But the
delay worries many.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if they'll ever find a cause,'' said Edwin
Matthews, the attorney for the village of South Orange who said he
has worked on about 30 fire cases. ''Usually, you find these things
out relatively quickly if you're going to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a feeling that the cause lies in one of the kids that
died,'' said Lauren Covino, a 19-year-old freshman. She said she
does not believe that any of the victims is responsible for the
fire, but ''maybe one of them saw how it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting law enforcement sources who request anonymity, The
Star-Ledger of Newark has reported that investigators are focused
on three Seton Hall students who they believe either set the blaze
or know about it.
</P>
<P>
   One of those students had admitted to vandalizing the lounge
where the fire started, but not to setting the fire, the newspaper
reported. The investigation has stalled because the suspects have
refused to grant additional police interviews, the sources told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Campolo said the length of the investigation is not unusual, but
didn't say he was confident the fire would one day be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident that we're doing the best we can and will
continue to do so,'' he said. ''I'm not in the business of making
predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Campolo is a 1975 graduate of Seton Hall, a fact he calls a
''nonfactor'' in the investigation. A commuter student, he never
lived in Boland Hall as a freshman and said his attachment to the
campus hasn't made his determination to solve the case stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I would have reacted the same way with respect to any
campus and any set of parents who lost their children this way,''
Campolo said. ''It's just a tragedy, regardless of where it
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Seton Hall dedicated a bell tower to commemorate the
victims of the fire -- a metal cylinder the height of a flagpole
with a cross and three bells for each student who died.
</P>
<P>
   University president Monsignor Robert Sheeran, who moved into
Boland Hall after the fire, will preside over commencement
ceremonies on May 8.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone's going forward, but there's still a very deep sense
of loss,'' said university spokeswoman Lisa Grider. ''My guess is
Commencement will be sort of bittersweet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the university still must face questions from students,
parents and state officials over its fire safety policies.
</P>
<P>
   The university acknowledged that for years it never held
organized fire drills, as required by state fire codes, because it
believed that false alarms that resulted in evacuations counted as
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The state Division of Fire Safety in February took over
inspection duties of the university from the South Orange Fire
Department and found hundreds of unchecked fire violations at
campus buildings. More than a dozen students and the families of
Caltabilota and Giunta have filed papers saying they intend to sue
Seton Hall for millions.
</P>
<P>
   And the lack of sprinklers in Boland Hall led to a statewide
debate on fire safety, with several lawmakers introducing bills to
require sprinklers in all college dormitories. Seton Hall has begun
installing sprinklers in all of its dorms.
</P>
<P>
   Candy Karol, the mother of victim Aaron Karol, said that parents
must take responsibility along with the universities for the safety
of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a parent's going to send their child to school, you
better ask that school, do they have sprinklers,'' Karol said. ''It
never occurred to us.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why didn't I ask? It cost me my son's life.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect In Custody in Pa. Shootings  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The violence started at a suburban home, where
a Jewish woman had been shot dead, and quickly spread to an Indian
grocery store, a Chinese restaurant and, finally, a karate school.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of an hour, police say a man targeting
minorities calmly drove across the four Pittsburgh suburbs Friday
afternoon and methodically picked out his victims.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, five people had been shot dead. They included the
Jewish woman, a black man, two men of Asian descent and another man
of Indian descent. A second Indian man was critically wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Richard Scott Baumhammers, 34, an immigration
lawyer and the son of Latvian immigrants who lived in suburban
Mount Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney William Difenderfer, who said he is representing
Baumhammers, answered the door this morning at the Mount Lebanon
home where the suspect lived with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're devastated as to what happened and they are extremely
sympathetic to the victims and their families,'' Difenderfer said.
''Right now we're trying to piece things together.'' He declined
further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers, meanwhile, remained jailed early today in Beaver
County, where he was arrested shortly after a 22-year-old black man
was shot and killed in a karate studio. He was charged with
homicide and reckless endangerment in that shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said his arraignment was pending on the other
slayings, which occurred in adjacent Allegheny County.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are taking a tack of ethnic intimidation -- a hate crime,''
said Paul Wolf, acting Allegheny County Police superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly shooting spree was the second of its kind in the
region since March, when a black man allegedly yelled racial
epithets and killed three white men.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an attack against us all, because it sought in its
violence to divide us by the color of our skin and the nations of
our ancestors,'' Gov. Tom Ridge said from Pebble Beach, Calif.,
where he was speaking to a Republican group.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are struggling to make sense of what appears to be yet
another brutal racist rampage.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Baumhammers' brief arraignment Friday in Beaver Falls,
about 25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, a crowd jeered him and
called for his execution. He smirked as police led him around in a
bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   The killings took place within a 20-mile range through suburbs
surrounding Pittsburgh. The shooter was armed with a .357-caliber
handgun, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Police received first word of the shootings shortly before 2
p.m., when they responded to a small fire at the home of Anita
Gordon in Mount Lebanon, next door to the home of Bauhammers'
parents. Gordon, 63, was found dead inside the home. She had been
shot twice.
</P>
<P>
   While they were at Gordon's house, police got a call of shots
fired at Beth El Congregations, a synagogue less than a mile away
where Gordon was a member. The synagogue's glass doors were shot
out, the word ''Jew'' was painted on the front and swastikas were
painted on its outside walls.
</P>
<P>
   Police then received reports of two men being shot at an Indian
grocery store in Carnegie. Anil Thakur, 31, died at Allegheny
General Hospital about four hours after he was shot. Sandip Patel,
25, was in critical condition early today at Mercy Hospital in
Pittsburgh, authorities said. The Post-Gazette said he was shot in
the neck and was facing the possibility of permanent paralysis.
Both men are of Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Kretzler, who owns a travel agency next to the Indian
grocery, said the shooter appeared calm as he walked out of the
store, tucked away a gun and walked to his car.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got in and sat for maybe five or 10 seconds without doing
anything, and just very calm and collectedly pulled out as if
pulling out after buying a bag of groceries,'' Kretzler said.
</P>
<P>
   Shots were fired shortly afterward at another synagogue in
Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, police received a call reporting two
employees had been shot at a Chinese restaurant in a McKees Rocks
shopping plaza. Killed were Thao Pham, 30, a deliveryman of
Vietnamese descent, and Ji-Ye Sun, 34, the Chinese manager of the
Ya Fei Chinese Cuisine restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m., police received call of man shot at karate school
in a Monaca shopping plaza. Garry Lee, 22, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers was arrested about 15 minutes later, after someone
at the karate school provided police with a description of a
suspect driving a black sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said Baumhammers had a gun and several rounds of ammunition
with him when he was stopped, and was taken into custody without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has joined the investigation because of the possibility
that the crimes were racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers passed the Georgia bar exam in 1993 and belonged to
the Georgia Bar Association. His parents, Inese and Andrejs, are
both dentists and his father taught at the University of
Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Fire Damages James Brown Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Fire damaged soul music legend James Brown's
office building.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters arrived at about 9:45 p.m. Friday and found smoke
billowing from the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The building houses James Brown Enterprises and more than a
dozen employees who coordinate concerts and tours for the Godfather
of Soul. No one was in the building at the time of the fire,
though.
</P>
<P>
   The office space also contained some memorabilia. Gifts from
fans were on display throughout the building, and the upstairs
corridor featured mementos from Brown's career.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta-Richmond County Fire Chief Ronnie Few said the extent of
the damage had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 66, left for Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Thursday for two
concerts.

<HEADLINE> Cochran Libel Suit Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- If it doesn't dis, you must dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Friday,
Johnnie Cochran wasn't libeled by a New York Post column that said
he ''will say or do just about anything to win, typically at the
expense of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The court upheld a Los Angeles federal judge's 1998 decision
that columnist Andrea Peyser was merely exercising her
constitutionally protected right to criticize Cochran's defense
strategy in the O.J. Simpson murder trial. The column, clearly
labeled an opinion piece, did not accuse Cochran of violating legal
ethics or lying in court, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran's lawyer, Deborah Drooz, said she disagreed with the
ruling but would not appeal further.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Cochran's lead role in the successful defense of
Simpson on double murder charges, Peyser wrote that he was part of
a team of ''legal scoundrels'' who ''dazzled a Los Angeles jury
into buying his fantasy tale of a citywide police conspiracy, in
order to set free a celebrity who slaughtered his ex-wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran's $10 million libel suit said the column accused him of
unethical conduct in the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Kim Wardlaw dismissed the suit without a
trial, saying any reasonable reader would recognize that Peyser was
simply expressing her ''contempt for Cochran and his trial
tactics'' -- an expression that could not be proven true or false.
</P>
<P>
   Slade Metcalf, a lawyer for the Post, called the ruling ''a
reaffirmation of the 9th Circuit's protection for really robust
opinion under the First Amendment.''

<HEADLINE> Woody Harrelson Sues Insurance Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Woody Harrelson is suing an insurance
company he claims wrongly stopped defending him against a lawsuit
filed by two tabloid photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson filed the breach-of-contract suit against Allstate
Corp. on Thursday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from a 1996 federal civil rights suit filed by
the photographers after they scuffled with the actor at an airport
in Martha's Vineyard, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson said he tried to grab one man's camera after the man
ignored his request not to photograph his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate allegedly withdrew its defense of Harrelson just before
the lawsuit went to trial in 1998. Harrelson claims Allstate
attorneys should have represented him because he had a ''deluxe
homeowner's policy'' to protect himself against personal injury
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson also claims errors by Allstate lawyers forced him to
pay about $3,000 in damages to the photographers and $80,000 in
legal fees to their attorneys. The insurer's negligence cost him an
additional $150,000 in legal fees of his own, he claims.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dodas of the Northbrook, Ill.-based insurer said the suit is
routine and will ''stand or fall on its merits.''

<HEADLINE> Andy Dick Says He's Staying Sober  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Former ''NewsRadio'' actor Andy Dick has been
sober for nine months and he's trying to take control of his
comedic career.
</P>
<P>
   For years, he felt like he had marionette strings attached --
''you pull the string and I'll pick my nose.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was always appreciative to just let people take advantage,''
he tells US Weekly in its May 8 edition.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dick pleaded guilty to charges of possessing cocaine
and marijuana after a May 15 car crash in which he toppled a
utility pole near the Hollywood Bowl. He also pleaded no contest to
charges of driving under the influence and hit-and-run.
</P>
<P>
   But now he's eager to rebuild his reputation -- and career. ''I
really want to take the bull by the horns, do my own thing,'' says
the 34-year-old comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Things are looking better for Dick, who has a small role in the
upcoming movie, ''Road Trip.'' He's also taping a pilot for NBC
written by ''American Pie'' writer Adam Herz, and he has several
films in the pipeline.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Pelosi Eyes Leadership Post  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If money equals power, Rep. Nancy Pelosi is
poised to exert serious clout.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, a seven-term Democrat from San Francisco, has given
$557,000 to other House candidates -- more than the combined total
of the rest of the House Democratic Caucus. And that has helped put
her in contention for a leadership position should Democrats win
back the House this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, who for years championed liberal causes in relative
anonymity, is campaigning to be majority whip, the third-ranking
job in the House. If she succeeds, she would be the highest-ranking
woman in congressional history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nancy Pelosi's ascension to the leadership of the Democratic
Party will be a milestone both for women in America -- she will be
the first woman ever elected to the leadership -- and it will be an
enormous benefit to the state of California,'' said Rep. Tom
Lantos, D-Calif., who works with Pelosi on human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi believes the key issues facing California, such as
immigration and regulating the Internet economy, are important for
the whole country. She said her experience working on them makes
her ready for a leadership position.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to have somebody imbued with these issues,''
she said. ''It's not only about economic issues, it's about
education, environment, just about how we approach the challenges
of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, 60, was born into a political family in Baltimore while
her father, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., was in the midst of serving
five terms in the U.S. House. He later became mayor of Baltimore,
as did her brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politics is the only life I ever knew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Raynor, a Baltimore contemporary of Pelosi, joked she was
so young when she started stuffing campaign envelopes in the
basement of her family's home that it might have violated
child-labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''She learned politics at her father's knee,'' said Raynor, who
served 40 years as Maryland's state election administrator. ''They
were always very fine people and had their door open to anyone any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi learned California's political ropes after marrying
businessman Paul Pelosi, with whom she has five children, and
moving West. She became chairwoman of the state Democratic Party,
which landed the 1984 national convention in San Francisco, and
then joined the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   She won a special House election in 1987 after the incumbent
died, and has been entrenched in the liberal downtown San Francisco
district ever since, winning more than 80 percent of the votes in
her last three re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, who serves on the Appropriations Committee, enjoys top
rankings from groups supporting abortion rights, gun control, AIDS
research, unions and the environment. But she gets zero support
from abortion critics, business groups like Associated Builders and
Contractors, and the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ABC criticized her for votes against bills limiting liability
for Y2K problems, reducing paperwork small businesses must file and
cutting taxes on capital gains and estates.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at Ms. Pelosi, she has not been a friend of
small business and reform,'' said Scott Brown, spokesman for ABC,
which represents 22,000 companies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   While she generally has backed President Clinton's initiatives,
she sharply clashes with the administration on trade with China.
Pelosi is among the most outspoken critics of Clinton's call for
extending permanent most-favored nation trade status to China.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi says Clinton is ''either in denial or ill-informed''
about human rights abuses in China.
</P>
<P>
   While that position has put her at odds with some key
congressional Democrats, including California Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, who is otherwise an ally, Pelosi's fund-raising prowess
endears her to even more.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of 1999 through early February, she had given
away $557,000, compared to $554,000 from the House Democratic
Caucus. She also raised $1.1 million for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, the fund-raising arm for House
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi tapped contributors almost entirely from San Francisco
and surrounding areas. She gave money to dozens of candidates but
said she targeted donations to those seeking to unseat Republicans
or in tight races.
</P>
<P>
   Should Democrats gain the six seats needed for a majority, those
who received money from Pelosi will be expected to support her for
whip, said Gary Jacobson, a political science professor at
University of California, San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ''In politics, support is supposed to be reciprocated,'' he
said. ''It's a good strategy. It also shows that once you're
elected, you can protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi faces some stiff competition for the whip's job. Maryland
Rep. Steny Hoyer, who was caucus chairman when Democrats last held
the House, and Georgia Rep. John Lewis, the chief deputy minority
whip, are pursuing the job.
</P>
<P>
   Whips line up votes and shepherd legislation, an often
exhausting task. Supporters say Pelosi is well-suited to such a job
because she is among the hardest-working and most respected members
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nancy is a real straight shooter and she'll do the job for the
country,'' said Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Gen. Taking NATO Command  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, who takes over as
supreme commander of NATO forces in Europe on Wednesday, has earned
great respect as both a warrior and diplomat in his 35-year Air
Force career. But unlike most of his predecessors in the NATO job,
he has little experience in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston, 56, will replace Army Gen. Wesley Clark as the top
commander of NATO forces. As is traditional, Ralston also will be
commander of U.S. European Command, in charge of all 100,000 U.S.
forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Officers who have worked with Ralston speak in glowing terms of
a man who entered the Air Force in 1965 through the Reserve Officer
Training Corps program at Miami University in Ohio, flew 147 combat
missions over Laos and North Vietnam and has been vice chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is absolutely the right person at the right time for this
job,'' Gen. James Jones, the commandant of the Marine Corps, said
in an interview Friday. Jones is a member of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were a European and I saw an officer the caliber of Joe
Ralston taking this job I would take it as a very strong sign that
the United States is serious about the importance of this
alliance,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston has held a wide variety of Air Force posts, including
commander of Alaskan Command at Elmendorf Air Force Base from 1992
to 1994 and commander of Air Combat Command at Langley Air Force
Base, Va., from 1995 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Ralston was Defense Secretary William Cohen's first
choice to replace Gen. John Shalikashvili as chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, but Ralston withdrew his name after word got out
that he had had an affair 13 years in the past. At the time, the
Air Force was under heavy attack for having discharged a female
pilot, 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn, for lying about an illicit relationship
with a married man.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston, who was vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
then, stayed on and was reappointed for a second term. The man who
became chairman instead of Ralston was Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Shelton said Ralston's experience makes
him well suited for the NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is more qualified than Joe Ralston to command the
military forces of this great alliance,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton and Cohen plan to fly to Mons, Belgium, home of NATO's
military command headquarters, to attend a public ceremony
Wednesday making Ralston the 13th supreme allied commander. A
similar ceremony will be held Tuesday in Stuttgart, Germany, for
Ralston's assuming command at U.S. European Command.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for taking the job, Ralston consulted with
several former top NATO commanders, including retired Gen. George
Joulwan, who held the post for four years before Clark took over in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's very well suited for the job,'' Joulwan said in
an interview. He said there is little significance to the fact that
Ralston -- unlike most of his predecessors -- has never been
stationed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''More importantly, working for two chairmen (of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff) and two defense secretaries, he is very well aware
of the issues with regard to the alliance,'' Joulwan said. Ralston
also knows, through his years of contact with other NATO leaders,
that the commander job is demanding and sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be a statesman, a diplomat, you have to be
politically aware without being politically involved,'' Joulwan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston is only the second Air Force general to serve as supreme
NATO commander in Europe in the alliance's 51-year history. The
other was Gen. Lauris Norstad, who held the job from November 1956
to January 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston, a native of Hopkinsville, Ky., had been prepared to
retire to Alaska this year when Cohen asked him to take the NATO
post. His term as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ended
Feb. 29, and by law he had to either assume another command within
60 days or end his career. Because of that constraint, Clark's
departure as supreme NATO commander was accelerated by a few months
to get Ralston into the job on time.

<HEADLINE> Singer Adapts to U.S.-Vietnam Roots  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- Growing up during the Vietnam
War, Phuong Thao knew she was different. She was bigger than her
classmates, and she had hair on her arms and white skin, all thanks
to an American father she never had met.
</P>
<P>
   She also could sing.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, her deep-throated voice put her at the top of the
country's pop charts and has helped her conquer the discrimination
that children of U.S. servicemen often face in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Phuong Thao, 32, and husband Ngoc Le, who also sings and
composes many of their songs, have made two successful albums and
have big plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to introduce Vietnamese music to Asia and then to the
world,'' she said during a break between shows at the Trong Dong
nightclub. ''It's very difficult, but we dream -- we try.''
</P>
<P>
   Phuong Thao's stage success is tempered by her private struggle
to find out more about herself and her roots.
</P>
<P>
   Raised by her grandparents in the Mekong Delta province of Sa
Dec, now called Dong Thap, she never had enough to eat. Children on
the street made fun of her because she was half-American.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't have a close relationship with her mother, and they
never discussed her father.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very delicate,'' she explained. ''I did not want to
make her sad.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the U.S. government offered the children of American
GIs -- ''Amerasians'' -- the opportunity to move to the United
States. But Phuong Thao said she couldn't bring her grandparents
''who I love very much, so I decided not to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, her mother applied to go under that program, but
Phuong Thao again chose to stay, to pursue a singing career.
Besides, she didn't know if she could find her father in America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, she moved to Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, to
see if she could make it. She joined a group and a year later was
on her way to stardom.
</P>
<P>
   An American writer doing a story on Amerasians interviewed her
in 1990 and asked whether she wanted help finding her father. She
said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to know if he was alive or dead,'' Phuong Thao said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother provided a name and the base near Sa Dec where her
father had worked. Three years later, the writer reported success.
</P>
<P>
   James Marvin Yoder, superintendent at a detention facility,
lived in Farmville, Va. and since the war had married a woman who
already had four children.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was at first surprised he had a daughter in Vietnam,''
Phuong Thao said. ''He did not know.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said there was never any doubt they were related. Her
mother said she looked like her father, and when he saw her
picture, he agreed: ''It's my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years, they wrote letters and chatted by phone.
Finally, in November 1996, when she was 28, he came to Vietnam to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first time I saw him, I cried like a child -- like a
child,'' Phuong Thao said, her voice breaking with emotion. ''The
first time I touched my father -- and he held me in his arms.''
</P>
<P>
   She learned he was a military adviser at the base where her
mother was a secretary. The U.S. military had a ban on dating
Vietnamese women, believing many were communist Viet Cong. Yoder
moved to another base, and they met again by chance on a Saigon
street. A brief affair followed.
</P>
<P>
   Yoder, now 61 and suffering from skin cancer, has invited her to
meet the rest of his family. But she hasn't been able to get
approval from the U.S. and Vietnamese governments to visit with her
husband and young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we went there as Amerasians, that would be easy. But I
don't want to go to the states on Amerasian status. I want to live
here. So this is a problem,'' she said. ''My father is not in good
health, so I worry.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Re-Examines Holocaust Story  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An Israeli army officer stood before two
sculptures, one depicting Jews trudging toward Nazi slaughter and
the other portraying Jewish rebels, proud and muscular.
</P>
<P>
   The officer told young recruits visiting Yad Vashem, Israel's
Holocaust memorial, that Israel used to emphasize heroism in
remembering the Holocaust but that today the victims of the Nazis
who did not fight back are no longer scorned.
</P>
<P>
   As the Jewish state enters a new century, Israel grapples with
what to remember. Next week, immediately after Tuesday's Holocaust
Remembrance Day, Yad Vashem will break ground for a new $25 million
museum that will reflect some of the changes in how the story of
the Holocaust is being told.
</P>
<P>
   James Young, a professor at the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst who has written on Holocaust memorials, said
the original Yad Vashem, established in 1953, reflected the need of
the young embattled state to tell a Holocaust story that would lead
to the creation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that the state is secure, a new generation is very willing
to re-examine founding myths. Other people are coming into view and
the plight of other histories is coming to Yad Vashem,'' Young
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Yad Vashem museum will also deal with the persecution of
other groups targeted by the Nazis, including Gypsies, homosexuals,
the handicapped, Freemasons, Jehovah's Witnesses and others.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the same broader outlook, Israel's education minister
announced last week that the genocide of 1.5 million Armenians by
Ottoman Turks will be studied in Israeli schools.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the murder of 6 million Jews during the Nazi occupation
of Europe remains a cornerstone of Israeli identity and collective
memory. ''We don't need to forget it, but (need to) decide what we
want to remember,'' said Tom Segev, an Israeli author who wrote
about the impact of the Holocaust on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are arguing about what the Holocaust tells us,'' Segev
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the museum say Yad Vashem remains devoted to
telling the story of the Jewish Holocaust. ''It's a Jewish museum
in the Land of Israel,'' said Avner Shalev, the director of Yad
Vashem.
</P>
<P>
   American businessman Joe Wilf, 75, who survived the Holocaust in
a Siberian forced labor camp, said the new complex should be not
just a museum, but also a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Wilf has donated generously to the new project to ensure that
the memory of the Holocaust won't be lost as the number of
witnesses to the genocide shrinks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has special meaning to me,'' Wilf said in a phone interview
from Short Hills, N.J. ''It's very important that something like
this is built for the future -- for education and creating
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is part of a larger $66 million project that will
also create a media center. By 2003, new buildings blended
unobtrusively into the wooded Jerusalem hillside will be filled
with video screening rooms and computer workstations linked to
databases holding records of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the exhibition rooms, visitors will use computers to see
maps and photographs of camps, survivors, and documentation of
Jewish life in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The video rooms will screen documentary and feature films on the
Holocaust, as well as detailed testimony of survivors, including
material collected by filmmaker Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia classrooms are already in use at a new building
housing Yad Vashem's International School for Holocaust Studies and
computer work stations have been set up in a new archive building
giving access to information on specific Holocaust victims, photos
from the period, and information on Yad Vashem's archival
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, most of the institute's database will be available on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are laying down the digital building blocks for how to
transfer the message and content (of the Holocaust) to the
future,'' said Michael Lieber, who is in charge of documentation at
Yad Vashem.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally renowned architect Moshe Safdie, who designed
the new complex, said the cave-like exhibition rooms cut into the
hillside created a sense of continuity -- the continuity of Jewish
existence that is Israel's purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, the Israeli-born Safdie said, represents ''the
confirmation of life and optimism that the Holocaust did not
succeed, and that we have overcome.''

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Women Still Seek Equality  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- As Saigon was about to fall,
Kuong Thi Tam drove her American boss to the airport, dodging fires
and fighting. Do Thi Huu Bich, a top female Viet Cong leader,
emerged from her underground hideout and took charge of a key
district in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 years since the Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975,
Tam hasn't been able to get a job, citing her work for the U.S.
Agency for International Development. And despite repeated
attempts, she has been denied a visa to the United States for
unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bich, in contrast, was rewarded by the newly installed
communists with a series of high-ranking jobs until she retired in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the battlefields in Vietnam -- and occasionally on the
front lines -- millions of women like Tam and Bich joined the war
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Bich, now 75, got their revolutionary credentials
fighting against the French in the late 1940s and early '50s and
became ardent followers of Communist Party founder Ho Chi Minh.
Others, like Tam, now 63, supported the freewheeling capitalist
lifestyle of the South Vietnamese and their American backers.
</P>
<P>
   Now women from both sides in the war are trying to find equality
in today's Vietnam, where men still dominate the highest positions
of power. They also face the same problems as their male
counterparts, including the legacy of the war's divisions: To many
it seems that the winners and losers in 1975 remain the winners and
losers today.
</P>
<P>
   Female guerrillas from the north and south who backed the
victorious communists have climbed the party hierarchy, though not
yet to the top, while women associated with the defeated Americans
and the South Vietnamese army have trouble finding jobs -- with few
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Dao Thi Nhien, director of the Women's Museum in Hanoi and a
member of the powerful Women's Union's leadership committee, said
unemployment is a problem nationwide and dismissed reports that
women who worked for the Americans are excluded from government
jobs. ''There is no discrimination,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tam and others with American connections say that despite
strenuous efforts over long periods, they always have been turned
down for official positions -- and so were their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 1975, I tried to apply for a job with the government,
but they said there was no job for me because of my background,''
said Nguyen Thi Mui, 74, who worked as a cook for an American
couple during the war. She became a street vendor and worked until
she fell and broke a leg four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Truong Thi Thuan, one of thousands of bar girls who catered to
American GIs during the war, hid her past at the ''Lucky Seven''
and other famous Saigon watering holes when the communists came to
power.
</P>
<P>
   Now 57, she shares two tiny, dark rooms with her son and his
family, earns a living selling Vietnam's traditional pho soup on a
street nearby -- and dreams of going to America.
</P>
<P>
   Only with the opening of the private sector in 1986 have some
women linked to the Americans been able to find jobs that aren't
menial.
</P>
<P>
   While Vietnam's constitution guarantees gender equality, even
the government's most stalwart supporters aren't satisfied because
women have yet to ascend higher than second-rung jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''For thousands and thousands of years, men looked down on
women, so it's not easy to change,'' said Dr. Nguyen Kim Cuc, who
spent nearly 10 years running a clinic for guerrilla fighters and
sympathizers in the mountains between Chu Lai and Nuoc Nam in South
Vietnam and is now vice president of the Vietnam Family Planning
Association in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in rural areas, she said, the old saying is still
true that ''one son means you have children, but 10 daughters is
nothing'' because a wife moves in with her husband's family.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in her granddaughter's lifetime, women will achieve real
equality, Cuc said.
</P>
<P>
   Le Thi Thoan joined the communists in 1941 and launched a
women's guerrilla movement against the French in Hun Yun province
in the north in 1950 which became the model for the campaign
against the Americans in South Vietnam. She went on to head Women's
Union branches, including in Hanoi -- but she said she never got a
top party post because of her sex.
</P>
<P>
   ''My own opinion is it is unfair,'' she said, ''but it is still
great progress from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 75 and retired for 18 years, Thoan believes women need to
learn to network and play politics like men to crack the glass
ceiling but must ''do it in a very honest way.''
</P>
<P>
   Women do have relatively high representation in the National
Assembly -- 26 percent -- and ''the government is still trying hard
to promote women in the political sphere,'' said Dagmar Schumacher
of Germany, the U.N. Development Program's deputy representative in
Hanoi. ''It's still a long way from equality.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight for equal rights is not the only legacy of what is
called the ''American war.''
</P>
<P>
   At least a million Vietnamese soldiers died and hundreds of
thousands remain missing, a loss that still casts a shadow over the
wives, mothers and children they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Women guerrillas in the south, nicknamed the ''long-haired
army,'' fed the fighters, gathered intelligence about U.S. and
South Vietnamese forces, traveled behind enemy lines and sometimes
went into combat.
</P>
<P>
   The only official figures on female casualties show that of the
70,000 young women, mainly from the north, who volunteered to help
oust the French and then the Americans, about half died, Nhien
said.
</P>
<P>
   Women also have suffered in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Tran Hong Nhat, a Viet Cong guerrilla leader who went on to head
the Women's Union school in Tu Duc which trains party cadres,
miscarried in 1976 -- tests showed the fetus was allegedly deformed
from her exposure to the toxic defoliant Agent Orange. She has
never had children since.
</P>
<P>
   Still, women in the north and south are united in hopes for a
better future for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Thi Thep, 78, dropped out after third grade to help her
parents farm in rural North Vietnam. She struggled through two wars
trying to raise three sons and three daughters. She succeeded well:
one daughter is a teacher, another is a travel agent and the third
works for the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best thing now is ... that women can look forward to
managing and raising children without wondering whether they have a
future at all,'' she said at the Chua Tay Ho Temple in Hanoi, where
she goes every day to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   With 50 percent of the country's 76 million people under 25,
Schumacher said, ''the memories of the war are fading away.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those like Thoan, the guerrilla leader from the north
who lost her 19-year-old son in combat in 1973, not a day passes
without her eyes wandering to the photo of the handsome young man
on an altar in her living room.
</P>
<P>
   Wiping away tears, she described how her son asked if he could
volunteer for the military at 17 -- a year before he had to --
because the war was nearing an end and he wanted to do something
more than clean up the debris left by American soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Review L.A.-Based Cases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The U.S. Attorney's office has ordered a
review of all federal prosecutions involving police officers
implicated in an ongoing corruption probe.
</P>
<P>
   The review was ordered about two weeks ago and announced Friday
by U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas, who said he believed ''only a
handful'' of potentially tainted cases were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Public Defender Maria E. Stratton said she hopes the
U.S. attorney's office will work with public defenders to identify
more cases. The public defender's office has started its own review
of about 1,000 cases dating back to 1993, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office also has asked the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to stop the deportation of a Guatemalan
citizen who claims he and his girlfriend were terrorized by corrupt
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Toscano was scheduled to be released Thursday from an
Imperial Valley prison and transferred to the INS for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   In an April 17 letter to the INS, Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney
Consuelo Woodhead said Toscano could be a potential witness to
federal civil rights violations by police officers. Toscano's
attorney, Stephen Yagman, claims that his client was beaten and
robbed in 1997 by disgraced former Officer Rafael Perez and his
partner, Nino Durden.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, in a plea agreement, cooperated with authorities and told
of widespread corruption in the police department's Rampart station
in exchange for a lighter sentence for stealing cocaine from an
evidence room.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 67 convictions have been overturned and about 30
officers have been relieved of duty, fired or suspended.

<HEADLINE> Elian Fallout Affects Miami's Image  </HEADLINE>
By AMANDA RIDDLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Armed federal agents raid a Little Havana home and
whisk away a 6-year-old Cuban boy. Baton-wielding riot police beat
demonstrators and arrest hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor criticizes the police chief and fires the city
manager. The police chief quits, saying he's tired of the mayor's
destructive politics.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder Miami comes across as a chaotic, polarized city
that Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said ''can't control itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Images broadcast worldwide a week ago showed Miami in turmoil:
Protesters torched piles of tires and toppled park benches into the
street to vent their anger over federal agents' seizure of young
Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives' home; police fired tear
gas into the crowds and arrested more than 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Joe Carollo demanded the police chief's firing for failing
to inform him about the raid. City Manager Donald Warshaw refused,
and Carollo fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo insisted Warshaw's firing had nothing to do with the
Elian case. He said Warshaw has been criticizing him, lying and
trying to turn department heads against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politically, it makes Miami the laughingstock of the United
States,'' said Jim Corey, a University of Miami political science
professor. ''It will be a long time for healing, if it ever
occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Author and Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiassen, in a recent
column in The New York Times, described Miami as a place where
''fact is routinely more fantastic than fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of 375,000 has been beset for years by periodic
episodes of crime, political corruption and economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s it was a scene of drug deals and killings
committed by ''cocaine cowboys.'' In the early 1990s, six tourists
were slain in the Miami area.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo became mayor after his predecessor, Xavier Suarez, was
unseated over a vote fraud scandal in 1997. A year earlier, a
former city manager was sentenced to prison in a corruption
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, the state appointed a fiscal oversight board -- a
first in Florida -- after the city discovered a $68 million budget
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last Thanksgiving, Elian was found clinging to an inner
tube at sea after a boat carrying his mother and other would-be
refugees sank in attempt to sail from Cuba to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Elian became the center of an international custody fight
between his Cuban father who wanted him returned to Cuba and his
Miami relatives who said he deserved U.S. citizenship. Scores of
members of Miami's anti-Castro Cuban exile community gathered
around the house where Elian was staying in the city's Little
Havana section, demanding the boy not be sent back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The attention and political wrangling over the case further
fractured Miami's ethnic community.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian residents criticized local leaders for failing to rally
behind their causes as they had the Cubans'. Some people outside
the Cuban-American community were appalled at Elian's Miami
relatives' defiance of Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''The picture that is being painted is an unstable Miami, a
Miami that can't control itself, a Miami that can't govern
itself,'' Bush said last week on a visit to the city, where he has
a home.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo has decried the criticism and comparisons of Miami city
government to third-world countries. He said the nation would
quickly forget the city's latest public relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Blumberg, chairman-elect of the Greater Miami Chamber of
Commerce, said people outside Miami need to understand that only a
small portion of the 800,000 Cuban-Americans in the Miami area are
protesting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not what Miami is about,'' he said. ''It's what an
impassioned group of people feels on a weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Adams, a journalism and public relations professor at
Florida International University in Miami, said the disruptions
surrounding Elian shouldn't harm tourism, the city's second-largest
industry. He noted that visitors continued coming even after 18
people died during a 1980 race riot that erupted when five white
police officers were acquitted in the beating death of a young
black man.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were suddenly to lose the sun and the warmth and the
water,'' Adams said, ''then we'd worry.''

<HEADLINE> Benetton, Toscani End Partnership  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Benetton and the photographer who used everything
from AIDS victims to U.S. death row inmates in his shocking ads for
the company have split after an 18-year creative partnership, a
statement announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Benetton thanked Oliviero Toscani in the statement for his
''fundamental contribution to the 'new' advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Luckily, nothing is forever,'' Toscani said in the statement.
''It's good to have the courage to end something that was
fantastic, and still have the enthusiasm to take on new projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Toscani's in-your-face campaigns for Benetton's clothes have
been both damned and praised. Some defend them as fearless social
activism, while others say they are nothing more than crass
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   To sell trendy clothes, the ads used a host of unconventional
subjects -- including smooching nuns and priests, mating horses, a
bloodied soldier's uniform, newborn babies, AIDS victims and
condemned murderers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no such thing as going too far,'' Toscani once said.
</P>
<P>
   His partnership with Luciano Benetton, who gave Toscani a very
free rein, was legendary. Toscani once compared his patron to a
Renaissance pope and himself to Michelangelo.
</P>
<P>
   The statement gave no reason for the breakup, and neither
Toscani nor company officials were available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Toscani's wife, Kristi, said by telephone that ''after so
many years the decision was mutual.'' She also said it had nothing
to do with the death penalty campaign, which cost Benetton an
important U.S. contract.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. dumped Benetton's line from its stores in
February after an outcry from victims rights groups and threats of
a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also created legal problems. The state of Missouri
is suing Benetton, claiming the state was deceived by the law
professor who arranged the death row visits. The suit claims the
project's commercial purpose was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Toscani, the ''bad boy of advertising,'' is also the creative
director of Tina Brown's Talk magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Benetton said its advertising would be turned over to Fabrica, a
cutting-edge multimedia research group in Treviso. Fabrica was
founded in 1993 by Toscani and bankrolled by Benetton.
</P>
<P>
   Under Toscani's guidance, Fabrica produced the Benetton magazine
Colors, and increasingly did projects for outside clients as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrica is as provocative as its founder. One issue of Colors on
AIDS included a computer-generated image of former President Ronald
Reagan with the skin blemishes associated with the disease. An
issue on motherhood featured several pages of close-up photos of
female genitals.

<HEADLINE> GOP Will Push 'A' Education Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans will soon try to pass an
education bill that gives parents and teachers more authority to
make decisions for their schools. President Clinton has threatened
to veto the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents and educators in your community will be able to target
funding towards your students' greatest educational needs,'' Sen.
Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said Saturday in the weekly Republican radio
address. ''Whether it is for small classes, a program focused on
improving student's reading skills, computers in the classrooms, or
whatever is needed most.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, House Republicans narrowly passed the Academic
Achievement for All Act, or ''Straight A's,'' which gave 10 states
in a pilot program more freedom in complying with federal school
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says ''Straight A's'' would turn federal education
programs into a lump sum that states could invest in children who
are neither poor nor low-achieving.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said Democrats oppose the bill because they believe they
know better than parents and teachers what is right for children.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Clinton wants to move in a different direction,'' he
said. ''Whether your school is located in Walla Walla, Washington;
the Bronx, New York, or somewhere in between, he thinks he knows
what's best for your school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every child, regardless of income or where he or she lives,
has the right to a quality education -- free of unfair and
inappropriate restrictions set by Washington, D.C.,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sunday's gay rights march causing rift in New York  </HEADLINE>
By GARY CRAIG, 
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A major gay and lesbian march planned for
Sunday in Washington, D.C., has caused a schism among activists,
many of whom are refusing to attend.
</P>
<P>
   While not urging a boycott, New York's Empire State Pride
Agenda, a gay and lesbian lobbying organization with 25,000
members, has not endorsed the ''Millennium March on Washington for
Equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Major groups nationwide that lobby for gay and lesbian rights
are not backing the march, either.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers expect 300,000 people at the fourth rally for gay,
lesbian and bisexual people in Washington in the past 21 years. The
march has been planned for years to mobilize supporters into a
voting bloc this presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, the rift is because of disagreements with the national
organizations that have planned the march, including the Human
Rights Campaign. But some gay activists say there's another reason
many won't attend: It will be a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that the timing of the march is ill-advised at best,''
said Matt Foreman, Pride Agenda's executive director. ''It's a
lame-duck Congress, a lame-duck president.''
</P>
<P>
   As well, Foreman said, most of the legislative battles for gay
rights are waged at the state, not national, level, and many state
legislatures are now in session. That's where political pressure
needs most to be exerted, not in the nation's capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just saying it's not a good use of our community's
scarce resources,'' he said of the march.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Richards, the western New York field organizer for the
Pride Agenda, said activists here are marshaling their energy to
push for a New York ''hate crimes'' bill, which increases criminal
penalties for bias-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel spending time locally is more productive,'' said
Richards, who works out of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester resident Sabrina Kinckle is traveling to the march.
She said she thinks the event can energize people like herself, who
then can return to fight for changes at the local and state levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that there are a lot of politics behind going to
the march,'' she said. ''But some people still find it necessary to
go.''

<HEADLINE> Elian's Life Is Changed Forever  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Too young to understand, but too old to
forget, Elian Gonzalez is a little boy whose life is forever
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether it will sink him or not,'' said Alan
Levy, professor of social work at Loyola University Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   America or Cuba? Stay or go? Happy ending or sad? As the world
awaits the next chapter in the castaway saga turned international
political custody battle, no one, of course, can predict Elian's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Few even know exactly the details of his past -- what he's seen,
how much he's been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Elian lost his mother at sea, then was delivered into the hands
of never-before-seen relatives who refused to relinquish him. After
he came to love them too, he was snatched away at gunpoint,
returned to his father, then moved into seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know all the circumstances,'' said David Elkind,
professor of child development at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Did he see his mother drown? What did she say to him? Did his
great uncle and cousin, Lazaro and Marisleysis Gonzalez, help him
deal with his mother's death while he was in their Miami home? What
did he make of Miami protesters who idolized him and watched his
every move? What did the Miami relatives tell him about his father?
His communist fatherland?
</P>
<P>
   Now that Elian has been reunited with father Juan Miguel,
stepmother Nersy and baby half brother Hianny, several
psychiatrists said, he should be helped to work through his grief
in peace.
</P>
<P>
   His father has agreed to keep him in the United States while the
asylum case brought by the American relatives plays out. So his
Cuban family has set up house at an idyllic estate on Maryland's
Eastern Shore to wait.
</P>
<P>
   The next court hearing is scheduled May 11, but lawyers say the
case could go on for months if the Miami relatives appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a reunion with them may also be somewhere in Elian's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Many child advocates believe a bond was formed between Elian and
the Miami relatives. But a psychiatrist for the U.S. government
this week advised against a visit by his Miami kin ''in their
current angry state'' and said letters, photos and recorded
messages would have to do for now.
</P>
<P>
   And is it unthinkable -- or could a court eventually rule that
Juan Miguel can not take his son back to Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has argued that Elian
is too young to speak for himself and that only his father could
request asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea that a 6-year-old is going to be seeking asylum is
absolutely crazy,'' said Elkind.
</P>
<P>
   ''A child ... might want to go away from his family -- may want
to run away from home, down the block,'' he said. ''He doesn't have
a sense of seeking asylum in another country.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Atlanta federal appeals court has criticized the INS for
not interviewing Elian ''about his wishes ... particularly the
child's separate and independent interests in seeking asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   If and when Elian returns to Cuba, President Fidel Castro has
said there'll be no big street celebrations, no parades.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Elian will be sheltered from the media and Cubans in
general and live for three months with his former first-grade
classmates from the town of Cardenas in a specially prepared
boarding school in the capital of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future holds for Elian, he now romps in lush
Maryland farm country with playmates sent from Cuba this week to
make life more normal while he bides his time in America.
</P>
<P>
   And though he's too young to understand either the death of his
mother -- he's said he thinks she's only lost -- or the politics
dividing his family and keeping him in America, analysts say there
will be plenty of time for that in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's understanding things through a 6-year-old's eye,'' said
Levy.
</P>
<P>
   In adolescence, he'll understand them differently, and in
adulthood differently again.	   ''But he'll be pondering this for the rest of
his life.''

<HEADLINE> Lake Huron Stranded Ship Refloated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- A freighter that blocked 30 ships while
stuck in Lake Huron's shipping channel for almost a day has been
refloated.
</P>
<P>
   The American Mariner, which was carrying iron ore pellets,
struck a light just north of Port Huron early Friday, tearing a
hole in the hull, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship lay across the Huron Cut shipping channel, halting
other vessels trying to sail south into the St. Clair River or
north into Lake Huron.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 26 American Mariner crew members were in danger and
remained aboard as the 730-foot-long vessel took on water.
</P>
<P>
   The ship used its own pumps and portable pumps from the Coast
Guard to remove the water, and about 1:45 a.m. Saturday, the
waiting vessels were allowed to begin navigation through the
channel, the Coast Guard said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton and Rudolph Giulinai court Reform Party support  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. (AP) -- Cancer-stricken Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
said Saturday that he would announce his decision about whether he
would continue with his Senate campaign before the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   ''I promise you that I'll make a decision long before you have
to make a decision ... and I hope that decision is that I can
run,'' the New York City mayor told members of the Independence
Party at a forum for Senate candidates at a hotel in suburban
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Courting support from the New York wing of the national Reform
Party despite its flirtation with Pat Buchanan, Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Senate rival Giuliani made separate appearances at the
event. The Independence Party state convention at which it may
select a party nominee is to be in late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance at the Independence Party forum marked Giuliani's
second day of campaigning since he announced Thursday that he had
been diagnosed with prostate cancer and said his continuing in the
Senate race would depend on the treatment of his disease. He said
the cancer had been detected early and was treatable. He told about
1,000 cheering Republicans on Friday night in Saratoga Springs that
he wanted to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   That was his message again Saturday at a morning meeting with
Republican leaders at a Buffalo restaurant, at the forum and in a
later news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to run, I'm prepared to do it ... but there's
this other thing that I have to consider,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the New York City mayor has already begun cutting
back on his schedule to deal with his medical problems. He canceled
Law Day speeches in Syracuse and Rochester that had been scheduled
for Monday to accommodate medical appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Referring repeatedly to Sen. John McCain in his remarks to the
Independence Party members, many of whom admire the Arizona
Republican, said ''if you're looking for a candidate that can be
honestly described as an independent ... I think we're a natural
fit,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that he supported many of the party's government reform
goals, including term limits for elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, the reason I am here talking about running for the
Senate is because I'm term limited. I'm out of a job in a year and
a half,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan factor has been much on the minds of Clinton and
Giuliani. Both have criticized the conservative commentator and
said they have concerns about running on a ticket that could be
headed by him in the presidential slot.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while Giuliani had earlier accepted an invitation to
appear at Saturday's event, the first lady didn't signal her
intention to attend until Friday. She has also been concerned about
the strong influence of Lenora Fulani, a leader of the left-wing
New Alliance Party, in the Independence Party. In a strange
political marriage, the left-leaning Fulani is backing Buchanan's
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   On top of it all, the Independence Party in New York appears
even more the victim of rival factions than the national Reform
Party. On Wednesday, a state judge reinstated Jack Essenberg as
party chairman, overturning his earlier ouster by Fulani and others
in the party. Essenberg said Friday that he would rather leave the
Independence Party presidential line blank than have Buchanan as
the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   While Essenberg's opponents had organized the Senate forum, he
said he was happy it was being held and showed up at the event that
was being run by the court-ousted chairman, Frank MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility that Independence Party convention
delegates could authorize a Sept. 12 primary that would feature
Giuliani and Clinton. The mayor said he would welcome that and
predicted he would beat her in such a test.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the Wild West,'' MacKay said Saturday of the feelings
within the party about who the Senate candidate should be. ''It's
completely up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of third-party nominations is strong in New York
when candidates expect a close race. Polls show the
Clinton-Giuliani race is just that. Unlike other states, New York
allows major party candidates to also run on third-party ballot
lines and combine their vote totals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Republican George Pataki beat Democratic incumbent
Mario Cuomo in the governor's race on the strength of the
Conservative Party vote.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Independence Party became New York's third
largest political party. As of March 1, it had more than 172,471
members. The Conservative Party fell into fourth place with 171,496
members. Both are dwarfed by the Democratic (4.96 million members)
and the Republican (3.09 million members) parties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the line brought more than 109,000 extra votes to
Democrat Charles Schumer as he beat Republican incumbent Alfonse
D'Amato in the U.S. Senate race.

<HEADLINE> Scion of wealthy family dies of possible overdose  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A scion of the internationally-known Rothschild
family collapsed on a Manhattan sidewalk and died of an apparent
drug overdose following a downtown party.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael de Rothschild, 23, died on the afternoon of April 22
after partying with a friend in a Chelsea loft, authorities said. A
friend of the dead man was arrested and charged with heroin
possession after the death, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner,
said toxicology results were still pending. But a police source
told the Daily News, ''We have little doubt he died of a drug
overdose.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rockefellers in the United States, the Rothschilds
played a major role in French business and culture. They helped
make Paris one of the most significant financial capitals in
Europe, and are famed for their wineries in the Bordeaux region,
including the baron's Chateau Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The family gained prominence by financing such massive projects
as European railroads and the British military campaign that led to
the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at Waterloo in June 1815.
</P>
<P>
   With their vast wealth, they acquired first-rate art and period
furnishings, much of which has been donated to French museums like
the Louvre. The current generation of the family expanded to both
London and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild, an aficionado of the Manhattan night life, died
outside 136 10th Ave. He had just graduated from Brown University a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Nathaniel de Rothschild, heads an $8 billion
financial services company.
</P>
<P>
   The man arrested on the heroin charge, William Corbin, denied
any involvement in Rothschild's death.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan Protesters Ignore Ban  </HEADLINE>
By ELCHIN TEIMURKHANOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) -- Police with batons beat back more than
1,000 demonstrators seeking to stage an unsanctioned rally in
Azerbaijan's capital of Baku on Saturday and detained three
opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people were clubbed, including 13 prominent opposition
figures and five reporters who covered the rally, according to the
information center of the Musavat opposition party. At least one
person was hospitalized, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   As police in green helmets and riot shields advanced, pushing
back protesters, three men were left lying on the road, their heads
and faces smeared with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties wanted to hold a rally in central Fizuli
Square to demand that this fall's parliamentary elections be free
of fraud and government intimidation of opposition groups. City
authorities refused to allow the protest on Fizuli Square, but said
they could gather at a raceway on Baku's northern outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the refusal, a few hundred protesters broke through
police cordons around the square Saturday, and police beat them
back with batons.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition crowd grew to at least 1,000, and spread to the
nearby Palace of the Republic and the central bank headquarters.
Scattered clashes continued into early evening.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders said Arif Gadzhiyev, secretary of the Musavat
party, Panakh Guseinov, chair of the People's Party of Azerbaijan,
and another prominent opposition leader, Fazil Gazanfarogly, were
detained.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan's authoritarian President Geidar Aliev has been
criticized by international human rights groups for cracking down
on dissent and independent media in his former Soviet republic. His
re-election in 1998 was boycotted the opposition and called
undemocratic by foreign observers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A massive blaze ripped through a
military armory, killing three civilians and blowing up nearly
10,000 tons of ammunition, but leaving missile stockpiles
untouched, news reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 people were injured by flying metal during the blaze
at the armory of the Bharatpur Ordnance Depot in northern India,
which set off deafening explosions throughout the day Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities ordered thousands of residents of Bharatpur to leave
the town immediately, fearing damage by shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   After battling the blaze for 20 hours, fire fighters brought it
under control Saturday, Press Trust of India news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The dump stores heavy caliber shells of 130mm long-range guns
and other explosives. Press Trust of India said surface-to-air and
anti-tank missiles also at the site were not damaged in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister George Fernandes met Saturday with military
commanders in New Delhi about the fire, then visited Bharatpur, 110
miles south of New Delhi, to inspect the dump.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes told reporters that a preliminary investigation
suggested that the dry elephant grass in the complex caught fire,
leading to explosions, but he said the full facts were not yet
known.

<HEADLINE> Somalia Cholera Outbreak Kills 43  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- A cholera outbreak, compounded by
drought, has claimed 43 lives in 24 hours in central Somalia, local
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abdulleh Qalad, the governor of Hiran region, said 25
people were reported dead in villages around the regional capital,
Belet Huen, about 90 miles north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   Another 18 deaths were reported in villages around Gelib in the
Middle Juba region, about 220 miles south of Mogadishu, local
leader Hassan Abbdiqani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not know it was cholera before today,'' Qalad said by
radio of the outbreak in Hiran. ''Now some tents and huts have been
set up as a temporary quarantine for the cholera patients in some
places.'' He appealed to international relief agencies to send
dehydration solutions and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of cholera, which is spread by contaminated water, is
being intensified by a drought that has dried up fresh water
sources and parched lands also in neighboring Ethiopia, Kenya,
Eritrea and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, officials in several Somali regions suffering from
severe drought and famine reported nearly 400 people had died of
cholera in the previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to verify the figures independently because
Somalia has had no central government since 1991, when dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted by a coalition of clan leaders who
later turned on each other.
</P>
<P>
   Intermittent fighting among rival clans and banditry make it
very difficult, if not impossible, for international relief
agencies to provide medical and food aid to those who need it.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program estimates 1.2 million Somalis are
faced with severe food shortages.

<HEADLINE> Report: Europe Exchange Merger Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A planned fusion of the Frankfurt and
London stock exchanges, which would create the largest such
operation in Europe, appears to be set, a major newspaper said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, citing sources negotiating
the plan, said the German side planned to announce its merger plans
Wednesday, with the merger's completion expected by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The London Stock Exchange announced last week it was in merger
talks with Deutsche Bourse. Such a merger would unite the
continent's two largest stock markets and lead to volume that could
make stock trading cheaper, the London exchange said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper, the supervisory board of Frankfurt's
Deutsche Bourse AG has now decided in favor of a fusion. The
supervisory board of the London exchange is to discuss the plan
further on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides would have a 50 percent share in the partnership,
which is to be headquartered in London, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The joint trading system would be the so-called Xetra, retaining
the current indicators, such as the DAX.
</P>
<P>
   Werner Seifert, the current board chairman of the Deutsche
Bourse AG, would probably be named to head the merged operations,
the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a three-way regional exchange was formed by stock
markets in Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Leader Plans To Seize Land  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HARTNACK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- President Robert Mugabe plans to invoke
special powers to seize white-owned farms and distribute the
property to landless blacks, Zimbabwe's justice minister said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The move was immediately denounced by white farmers, caught in a
standoff with armed black squatters who have seized more than 1,000
white-owned farms since February demanding land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Within 10 days, the legal framework to take land and
redistribute it to the people will be in place,'' Justice Minister
Emmerson Mnangagwa was quoted as saying by the national news agency
Ziana.
</P>
<P>
   At least 13 people have died in violence that has accompanied
the occupations by the squatters, who claim to be led by veterans
of Zimbabwe's independence war in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a promise by the veterans' leader to put a stop to
violence, at least 27 farm workers were attacked overnight and five
more farms were occupied, said an official for the Commercial
Farmers Union who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the farmers' union immediately condemned Mugabe's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that this is a lack of good faith on behalf of the
government while we are trying to negotiate in good faith with the
war veterans in an attempt to stop violence and prepare the
situation for free and fair elections,'' said David Hasluck.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has accused Mugabe of organizing the occupations
to increase his diminishing support among voters before
parliamentary elections. No date has been announced for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler, has refused to
provide $57 million earmarked for land reform until Mugabe holds
free elections and halts the violence.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook condemned Saturday's
announcement as ''a big step backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no justification for this,'' Cook said in a
statement in London. ''This cannot be the way to solve the genuine
problems of land reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's government has insisted the farm occupations are a
legitimate protest against a colonial legacy that left one-third of
the productive farmland in the hands of 4,000 white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Britain's stance is not our problem,'' Mnangagwa said. ''It
does not matter what they think or say. We are going ahead with our
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the main opposition party said Mugabe was
overreaching his authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite clearly an election gimmick. It cuts through the
separation of powers,'' said David Coltart, a spokesman for the
Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of renewed violence comes in the face of an
agreement between the farmers and the war veterans who are said to
be leading the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Chenjerai Hunzvi, the leader of the National
Liberation War Veterans Association and Nick Swanepoel, an official
with the Commercial Farmers Union, announced they had drafted a
plan to end the crisis. As part of the agreement, violence on
occupied farms was to end.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers' union said Saturday it has contacted Hunzvi and
told him that the ruling party supporters who are occupying farms
were not respecting what Hunzvi had agreed to.

<HEADLINE> Barely bearable day for bruins awakening from hibernation  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Bears in northern New Jersey were a bit late
awakening from
their winter slumber this year, but some motorists and residents
likely wish the huge creatures had slept even longer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Friday alone, three bears were struck by vehicles on North
Jersey highways, two of them fatally, while another who got stuck
up the tree kept wildlife officials on the run for hours, and a
fifth bear somehow fell into an open septic tank.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's spring, and they're coming out of their dens late, so
things are starting to happen,'' said Sharon Southard, spokeswoman
for the state Department of Environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials on Saturday received reports of bears getting
into garbage and bird feeders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bears killed Friday was a 150-pound young male
crossing Route 80 in Mount Olive, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In Vernon, a 350-pound male that apparently suffered two broken
legs after being struck on Route 515 was put down by police.
</P>
<P>
   Another large bear that was struck in Byram survived his
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just shook his head and said, 'You'll have to do better
than that,' and walked away,'' Bob Erikson, a biologist with the
state Division of Fish and Wildlife, told The Star-Ledger of Newark
in Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   In Butler, a male climbed a giant tulip tree and stayed for
seven hours until he was shot with a tranquilizer and lowered in a
fire truck bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials who tranquilized the bear said it was likely
chased off its territory by larger males.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big males chase smaller males out of their territory around
this time of year,'' Ken Kroeze, a division officer, told The
Record of Hackensack in Saturday's editions. ''That's probably what
happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Erikson predicted residents in the northern half of the state
could expect many more bear encounters until hot summer weather
slows the animals down.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in New Jersey, 62 bears were struck and 46 were killed
by motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints that the larger and more brazen black bear population
in northern New Jersey have invaded back yards, killed pets and
scared small children prompted the state Fish and Game Council to
propose New Jersey's first bear hunt since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The bear population, which numbered fewer than 100 two decades
ago, has reached an all-time high of more than 1,000 in 11 of the
state's 21 counties, according to the council. Damage complaints
soared from 285 in 1995 to 1,659 in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Releases AP Photographer  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A photographer for The Associated Press
was released from a cold and dirty jail cell Saturday after
spending three nights behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   But police confiscated Obed Zilwa's passport and plane ticket
and ordered him to report to authorities Tuesday morning. At that
time, Zimbabwe's attorney general will issue a document saying the
government has no interest in prosecuting him, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces arrested Zilwa, a highly regarded South African
photojournalist, on Wednesday and accused him of the April 22
bombing of The Daily News, Zimbabwe's only independent daily
newspaper. Zilwa, who had photographed the damage caused by the
blast, repeatedly said he was innocent. International press
organizations demanded his immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest was widely seen as an attempt to intimidate the
foreign press, which has been covering political turmoil and
violent occupations of white-owned farms in this southeast African
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole thing was politically related,'' Zilwa said. ''There
were police officers who called me 'journalist bomber,' but after
that I was treated quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before his release, Zilwa was reunited for the first time
since his ordeal began with his pregnant wife, Leonora de
Sousa-Zilwa. Accompanied by a South African diplomat, Zilwa's
attorney and an AP reporter, the couple then got into the
diplomat's Land Rover and were dropped off at their hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa told colleagues that police informed him Friday they had
no case against him and sought higher authority to free him. The
duty officer in the attorney general's office ordered the police to
release Zilwa into his lawyer's custody.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa, who is based in Cape Town, said he was not mistreated
though he described uncomfortable conditions in the jail cell at
Harare's central police station.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not pushed around,'' Zilwa said. But he added that he
had been worried about his fate, especially after a 48-hour
deadline for him to have been charged or released passed with no
action taken.
</P>
<P>
   He described hygiene standards in police cells as ''not up to
standard.'' His shoes had been removed and he suffered from the
cold until colleagues sent in warm clothing and blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the bombing, police said they were
suspicious that foreign journalists arrived at the scene so
quickly. Many of the journalists were staying at the nearby Meikles
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa said he was driving back to his hotel on April 22 after
socializing with friends when he heard an explosion and stopped to
question two policemen on duty near government buildings two blocks
from the newspaper's offices in downtown Harare.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I journalist, I stopped to ask police in the area. I went
back to the hotel to get my gear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said eyewitness accounts implicating Zilwa had either
been disproved or were untraceable.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa's attorney, Jonathan Samkange, said police had
acknowledged the photographer's continued detention was illegal
under the 48-hour limit for charging or release.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa was arrested as he waited in the Harare airport for his
flight back to South Africa. He has been covering the political
violence in Zimbabwe for the past month.

<HEADLINE> Rothschild Heir Dies of Possible OD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A scion of the internationally known Rothschild
family collapsed on a Manhattan sidewalk and died of an apparent
drug overdose following a downtown party, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Raphael de Rothschild, 23, died on the
afternoon of April 22 outside a Chelsea loft. William Corbin, a
friend of Rothschild, was later arrested and charged with heroin
possession, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Corbin has denied any involvement with the death.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner,
said toxicology results were pending. But a police source told the
Daily News, ''We have little doubt he died of a drug overdose.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rockefellers in the United States, the Rothschilds
played a major role in French business and culture. They helped
make Paris one of the most significant financial capitals in
Europe, and are famed for their wineries in the Bordeaux region,
including the baron's Chateau Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The family gained prominence by financing such massive projects
as European railroads and the British military campaign that led to
the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at Waterloo in June 1815.
</P>
<P>
   With their vast wealth, they acquired first-rate art and period
furnishings, much of which has been donated to French museums like
the Louvre. The current generation of the family expanded to both
London and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael's father, Nathaniel de Rothschild, heads an $8 billion
financial services company.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Health Bills' Passage  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With five months left before Congress is to
adjourn, President Clinton on Saturday called on lawmakers to
quickly pass a strong patients' bill of rights and prescription
drug coverage for seniors on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''This critical legislation is long overdue,'' Clinton said in
his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, said the GOP has led the way toward
meaningful health care reform. The president is ''scaring
seniors,'' said House Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts
Jr., R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Congress should strengthen and modernize Medicare
with a voluntary prescription drug benefit to all 39 million
Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of their income. For a $26
monthly premium, the plan would pay up to $1,000 in drug costs a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one creating a Medicare program today would even think of
excluding coverage for prescription drugs,'' Clinton said. ''Yet
more than three in five older Americans still lack affordable and
dependable prescription drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders say the drug coverage should be
only for seniors who need it most.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president loves to demagogue the Medicare issue by scaring
seniors and promising big-spending proposals that are fiscally
reckless,'' Watts said in a statement. ''What Republicans want to
do is create a prescription drug coverage system for low-income
seniors that is affordable, available and voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP proposal calls for private health plans to offer drug
benefits and government subsidies to pay drug costs for the
neediest seniors. Most of the $40 billion they earmarked for a
five-year overhaul of Medicare would go toward the drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says the GOP plan to provide
subsidies to cover drug costs for seniors at the poverty level
would leave out 6 million Medicare beneficiaries who have no drug
coverage but have incomes above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also cited a study commissioned by the advocacy group
Families USA that showed wholesale prices for 50 prescriptions
frequently used by older Americans rose by 3.9 percent last year --
faster than the overall 2.7 percent rate of inflation at the retail
level. According to government figures, prices for all prescription
drugs jumped 5.8 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On getting a patients' bill of rights, Clinton said he backed
legislation the House approved last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bill I would sign. But more than six months later, the
bill is still languishing in Congress,'' he said. ''The Republican
majority has not only delayed action, it's actually considering
legislation that would leave tens of millions of Americans without
federal protections.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said in a
statement that several pieces of health care legislation are in the
hopper, including a patients' bill of rights crafted by Sen. Bill
Frist, R-Tenn., that is being reviewed by a House-Senate conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Bill Clinton and (Vice President) Al Gore I'm reminded of
the old song 'All, or Nothing at All,' because it seems that's the
only way they know how to do business,'' Nicholson said. ''Anyone
who doesn't agree with them 100 percent is wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Urges Synchronized Primaries  </HEADLINE>
By EUN-KYUNG KIM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to prevent a repeat of this year's rush
by states to be among the first to hold presidential primaries, a
Democratic panel approved a report Saturday that urged the
Republican party to adopt the same nominating calendar as
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee allows states to hold their
primaries and caucuses as early as the first Tuesday in March and
as late as the second Tuesday in June. Only Iowa and New Hampshire
may hold their elections outside that window.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican National Committee sets no such limits,
causing states to leapfrog each other and crowd the GOP calendar
with many primaries and caucuses as early as February.
</P>
<P>
   The ''front-loading'' problem has forced Democratic officials in
many states to unsuccessfully seek permission to hold their
primaries earlier to save money and stay competitive with state
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A report approved unanimously by the Democratic Party's rules
committee urges the Republican party to adopt a window similar to
the one used by Democrats. It also encourages Democratic officials
to ''urge the Republican Party to establish sanctions to enforce
its window and discourage states from going before the window in an
attempt to leapfrog other states.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will be sent to the party's national chairman, Joe
Andrew. While Democratic rules don't require action on 2004 prior
to this election, Democrats agreed to work closely with Republicans
to examine potential changes.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Purpuro, a spokesman for the RNC, said he couldn't address
specifics of the Democratic report but said that both parties
''have made every effort to at least keep each other informed of
their respective efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a Republican advisory panel also has been examining ways
to curb the front-loading problem. The committee will present its
own report during a news conference Tuesday in Washington. Those
recommendations will then be considered by the party's rules
committee next month in Indianapolis. Any changes would be made by
the full RNC at the national convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Various primary plans have been considered by both parties over
the last year, but Democrats decided to leave what it considered a
good system untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ''Criticism about a front-loaded schedule has to be weighed
against a process that seems to be working well,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other options that have been suggested by both parties: a
regional primary plan that would divide the country into four areas
and rotate which one could hold primaries first.
</P>
<P>
   Another plan would be based on size and allow smaller states,
somewhat larger states, midsize states and finally the largest
states to hold primaries in groups of 10 to 12 on one-a-month
primary days.

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The daughters of Mexico's rich and famous are
known for extremely extravagant weddings in beautiful colonial
settings.
</P>
<P>
   But Mariana Salinas, the niece of former Mexican president
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, gave up that oppportunity to wed with
her father present -- in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Raul Salinas married Mexico City lawyer Luis
Gerardo del Valle during a group wedding Friday with 10 inmates at
the Mexico State prison in Almoloya de Juarez west of Mexico City,
the Mexico City newspaper Reforma reported Saturday. The former
president did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   The justice of the peace brought the couples cake, and the
Salinas family brought sandwiches, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas gave his daughter a picture he painted of potted
sunflowers. He is serving a 27{-year sentence for masterminding the
1994 murder of his former brother-in-law, Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu, who was secretary-general of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Jail Frees AP Photographer  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A photographer for The Associated Press
was released from a cold and dirty jail cell Saturday after
spending three nights behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   But police confiscated Obed Zilwa's passport and plane ticket
and ordered him to report to authorities Tuesday morning. At that
time, Zimbabwe's attorney general will issue a document saying the
government has no interest in prosecuting him, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces arrested Zilwa, a highly regarded South African
photojournalist, on Wednesday and accused him of the April 22
bombing of The Daily News, Zimbabwe's only independent daily
newspaper. Zilwa, who had photographed the damage caused by the
blast, repeatedly said he was innocent. International press
organizations demanded his immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest was widely seen as an attempt to intimidate the
foreign press, which has been covering political turmoil and
violent occupations of white-owned farms in this southeast African
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole thing was politically related,'' Zilwa said. ''There
were police officers who called me 'journalist bomber,' but after
that I was treated quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before his release, Zilwa was reunited for the first time
since his ordeal began with his pregnant wife, Leonora de
Sousa-Zilwa. Accompanied by a South African diplomat, Zilwa's
attorney and an AP reporter, the couple then got into the
diplomat's Land Rover and were dropped off at their hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa told colleagues that police informed him Friday they had
no case against him and sought higher authority to free him. The
duty officer in the attorney general's office ordered the police to
release Zilwa into his lawyer's custody.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa, who is based in Cape Town, said he was not mistreated
though he described uncomfortable conditions in the jail cell at
Harare's central police station.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not pushed around,'' Zilwa said. But he added that he
had been worried about his fate, especially after a 48-hour
deadline for him to have been charged or released passed with no
action taken.
</P>
<P>
   He described hygiene standards in police cells as ''not up to
standard.'' His shoes had been removed and he suffered from the
cold until colleagues sent in warm clothing and blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the bombing, police said they were
suspicious that foreign journalists arrived at the scene so
quickly. Many of the journalists were staying at the nearby Meikles
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa said he was driving back to his hotel on April 22 after
socializing with friends when he heard an explosion and stopped to
question two policemen on duty near government buildings two blocks
from the newspaper's offices in downtown Harare.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a journalist, I stopped to ask police in the area. I went
back to the hotel to get my gear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said eyewitness accounts implicating Zilwa had either
been disproved or were untraceable.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa's attorney, Jonathan Samkange, said police had
acknowledged the photographer's continued detention was illegal
under the 48-hour limit for charging or release.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa was arrested as he waited in the Harare airport for his
flight back to South Africa. He has been covering the political
violence in Zimbabwe for the past month.

<HEADLINE> FARC Launches New Political Party  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- In a quest for
legitimacy that could mark a new phase in peace efforts, Colombia's
most powerful rebel army massed more than 4,000 troops here
Saturday for the launch of a new political party.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, also
transported hundreds of civilians by bus and boat from its zones of
influence to a field outside this steamy ranching town in the
rebel-controlled southern demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
   The newly inaugurated Bolivarian Movement for a New Colombia
will, however, remain clandestine for now to prevent its leaders
from being slaughtered, said FARC commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colombia is gravely ill because its Liberal and Conservative
political leaders have used their posts to favor the rich ...
waging a dirty war to stay in power,'' the movement's four-page
manifesto said of the two parties that have traditionally
monopolized power in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event was an invitation by the FARC to Colombia's
impoverished masses to join it in seeking power, despite the
36-year-old movement's low popularity except in some rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   From a wooden stage built for the occasion, FARC leaders railed
in speeches to the gathered troops and civilians against the
political corruption most Colombians consider their country's main
problem, decried the lack of tolerance for an organized left and
demanded an equitable redistribution of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a new political, social and economic environment can be
created in Colombia that makes the use of arms unnecessary, surely
the outlook would be different,'' proclaimed Alfonso Cano, the new
party's chairman. ''But reality has been very stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's last leftist congressman was assassinated in 1994,
capping the systematic slaughter by right-wing death squads of more
than 3,000 activists of the Patriotic Union, a political party
formed a decade earlier by demobilized rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Despite overcast skies following days of rain, the guerrillas
tried to make the day festive.
</P>
<P>
   They festooned the meadow with helium-filled balloons with the
blue, red and yellow of the Colombian flag and hung banners
heralding the new movement with pictures of its namesake,
19th-century Latin American independence leader Simon Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts think the FARC is seeking to portray itself as a
''Robin Hood'' force, acting on behalf of the masses, though
opinion polls consistently show its support in the low single
digits.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the insurgency's No. 2 commander, Jorge Briceno,
sparked national outrage by announcing that the FARC's seven-member
ruling council was demanding ''peace taxes'' from any individuals
or companies worth more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes as the FARC weighs a government
cease-fire proposal and is inviting the international community --
including the United States -- to guerrilla territory on May 29-30
to discuss weaning peasants off drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Congress is considering a $1.7 billion anti-narcotics
package for Colombia, the bulk of which would go to the military
and thus, the FARC says, be used against rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Colombian military intelligence released what it
said was an intercepted radio transmission in which Briceno
allegedly says he wants the FARC to double its ranks to 32,000
fighters and step up attacks on the nation's energy infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of this region, which President Andres Pastrana
cleared of troops 17 months ago to initiate peace talks with the
FARC that have moved slowly, say they feel like pawns in the
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Few believe the rebels, their ranks swelling with illiterate
teen-agers, represent a force that can improve their lives -- and
end a nearly four-decade-old struggle that has claimed at least
35,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't understand why we've got two governments giving
orders. And I don't know whether they're fighting for the country
or for money,'' said Armando Lozada, a 40-year-old peasant who
traveled for 16 hours by bus and on foot for Saturday's event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope for a peaceful solution so we can finally be allowed
to work,'' Lozada said.

<HEADLINE> Mass Mock Same-sex Wedding at Rally  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Olivia Durant waited three years to profess
her love for her partner, Sabrina Beach. Since they are not able to
legally exchange marriage vows, they thought taking part in a giant
mock wedding ceremony would be the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from a victory that granted homosexuals marriage-like
rights in Vermont, Durant and Beach joined hundreds of other
couples Saturday on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in a bid to
press even wider acceptance for civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said about 1,000 same-sex couples exchanged rings and
vows in front of friends, family and about a dozen protesters, part
of a weekend-long rally for gay, lesbian and bisexual rights
culminating in Sunday's Millennium March on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're so happy right now,'' said Durant, of Rochester, N.Y.
''But I hope someday, same-sex marriages will be legal. We've joked
about moving to Vermont because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the fourth gathering on the Mall by gay and lesbian rights
groups in the last 21 years. It tops a busy period for activists,
who earlier this week had praise for the new law in Vermont and for
President Clinton's renewed call to Congress to pass the stagnant
Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and critics have also verbally clashed at the Supreme
Court, where on Wednesday the justices heard arguments over whether
the Boy Scouts can bar a homosexual from serving as a troop leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just like any other family. We get up, we go to work,''
said Pam Lessard, of Melbourne, Fla., who wore a white-laced veil
on her head as she waited for the ceremony to start. ''We are the
same as'' heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be an honor for members of the gay community and their
allies to stand before the Lincoln Memorial, this great American
symbol of freedom, and demand equal rights,'' said the Rev. Troy
Perry, moderator of the Universal Federation of Metropolitan
Community Churches, who performed the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Other events on Saturday included a concert featuring Garth
Brooks and Melissa Ethridge, and the unveiling of new panels to the
AIDS memorial quilt on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's event, particularly Sunday's march, have been
criticized by anti-gay groups, and gay and lesbian advocacy groups
who contend there was not enough outreach to grassroots
organizations and people of color.
</P>
<P>
   ''The march's purpose, insensitive elitism, is not our purpose.
Our purpose will not be advanced by the Millennium March on
Washington,'' said Ed Brown, co-chairman of the National
Association of Black and White Men Together.
</P>
<P>
   Six protesters carrying signs such as ''Repent or Perish'' and
''Got AIDS Yet'' taunted supporters and drew the attention of
police from across a roadway in front of the memorial. Some got
into face-to-face arguments with supporters before police separated
them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Park Police said there were no arrests in connection with
Saturday's events.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of protesters, led by Anthony Falzarano of Falls
Church, Va., tried to tell gays and lesbians of a network of
''ex-gay'' groups filled with people who realized ''they could
change.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here today to be compassionate to homosexuals,'' said
Falzarano who said he left a gay lifestyle in 1983. ''We know what
it's like to be misunderstood. So we're here to tell any homosexual
out there it's OK not to be gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope to draw 300,000 people for the march Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the same benefits that legally married couples have,''
John Catania, of New York said after exchanging vows with his
partner. ''You want the country to be better, and recognizing this
in law makes the country better.''

<P>
   The announcement comes as the FARC weighs a government
cease-fire proposal and is inviting the international community --
including the United States -- to guerrilla territory on May 29-30
to discuss weaning peasants off drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Congress is considering a $1.7 billion anti-narcotics
package for Colombia, the bulk of which would go to the military
and thus, the FARC says, be used against rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Colombian military intelligence released what it
said was an intercepted radio transmission in which Briceno
allegedly says he wants the FARC to double its ranks to 32,000
fighters and step up attacks on the nation's energy infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of this region, which President Andres Pastrana
cleared of troops 17 months ago to initiate peace talks with the
FARC that have moved slowly, say they feel like pawns in the
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Few believe the rebels, their ranks swelling with illiterate
teen-agers, represent a force that can improve their lives -- and
end a nearly four-decade-old struggle that has claimed at least
35,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't understand why we've got two governments giving
orders. And I don't know whether they're fighting for the country
or for money,'' said Armando Lozada, a 40-year-old peasant who
traveled for 16 hours by bus and on foot for Saturday's event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope for a peaceful solution so we can finally be allowed
to work,'' Lozada said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Receives Soviet-Seized Art  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTINA SHEVORY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- In an emotional ceremony, German
officials Saturday returned two pieces of looted art to a czarist
palace outside St. Petersburg, more than half a century after they
were seized by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the intricately inlaid chest and glistening
mosaic from Peter the Great's famed Amber Room, Russia has agreed
to turn over 101 artworks looted from Germany by Soviet troops
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first such swap of so-called ''trophy art'' taken by
their countries' armies during and after the war. But it marked
only a single step in settling a debate that has weighed on
otherwise warming relations between Russia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in Russia understand, value and treasure Russian-German
relations,'' a somber Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his
address at the ornate Yekaterinsky Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the most difficult questions, including exchanges of
cultural valuables, can be solved if they are approached calmly and
constructively.''
</P>
<P>
   German Culture Minister Michael Naumann called it a ''symbolic
event'' and said he hoped it would be the first of many such swaps.
</P>
<P>
   But talks have not resolved ownership disputes for most of more
than one million cultural valuables Germany claims Soviets troops
took -- paintings, rare books, coins and other items such as church
windows.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian law largely bans repatriating booty art, seen by
Russians as just compensation for an estimated several hundred
thousand items destroyed or lost during the Nazi occupation.
Complicating ownership claims, some of the items were looted twice,
first by the Nazis from occupied countries and then by the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   For Russians, the Amber Room is the most sensitive symbol of the
trophy art debate. The room was a gift to Russia's Peter the Great
from Frederick William I of Prussia in 1716. Its walls were plated
in 1,300 square feet of resplendent amber mosaics, placed near
mirrors and windows to glow a rich golden-brown color.
</P>
<P>
   Invading Nazi troops hastily stripped the chamber in 1941 and
shipped it west. It disappeared in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Only fragments have been found. The room is being restored with
financing from Germany's Ruhrgas.
</P>
<P>
   The mosaic handed over Saturday is called ''Sense of Smell and
Touch'' and depicts a scene of women frolicking by a pool. The
mosaic and chest were discovered in private collections in Germany
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Naumann received a license to return a total of 101
drawings and watercolors by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Francisco Goya
and dozens of German artists to a museum in Bremen.
</P>
<P>
   The German Embassy in Moscow has held the works since a Russian
World War II veteran anonymously turned over the art in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Long only rumored to exist, the Soviet Union's vast cache of
stolen masterpieces was confirmed by Russia only in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most controversial items is the Trojan gold excavated
in Turkey in 1873 by German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, who
believed that it once belonged to the king of the ancient city of
Troy. The items are on display at Moscow's Pushkin museum.

<HEADLINE> Survivors Mark Orphan Trains  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- It is one of the least-remembered of
America's migrations to the West: as many as 350,000 orphan
children shipped out of New York on ''Orphan Trains'' from the
1850s to 1929.
</P>
<P>
   The trains stopped in rural areas so that prospective parents
could look over the youngsters and decide whether to take in any of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The process wasn't always successful, recalled Dorothy Sharpley,
81, one of six Orphan Train ''riders'' who attended a reunion
Saturday in Colorado. Sharpley said she was rejected by her first
adoptive family, in Columbus, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sent back to New York only to ride the train again and
end up in St. Mary's, Neb., only 20 miles from Columbus.''
</P>
<P>
   The trains were the idea of Methodist minister Charles Loring
Brace, founder of the Children's Aid Society of New York, intended
as a means of moving children out of the alleys and squalor of a
city overrun by immigrants and the industrial revolution, out to
the West and wholesome farm family life.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a major event in migration to the West, where life
revolved around the railroad,'' said Tom Noel, a University of
Colorado historian.
</P>
<P>
   For Sharpley, life before the Orphan Train meant having to beg
for food in an orphanage with 600 children.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Liebl, author of ''Ties That Bind, the Orphan Train Story
in Minnesota,'' said her research indicates the number of orphans
who rode the trains is about the same as the number of slaves
brought into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't hear about these people because they were
assimilated,'' said Liebl.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1,000 of the ''riders'' are estimated to be still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The Orphan Train was a sweet second chance for many, a
Dickensian nightmare for others.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd stop in these little towns and get out of the trains and
they'd interview us. It was kind of like a cattle auction. If they
liked us they'd take us,'' said Stanley Cornell, who joined
Sharpley at Saturday's reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell, then 6, rode the train twice with his brother, Victor,
who was 5.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother died when their sister, Eloise, was born, and their
father, a victim of a German gas attack in World War I, was unable
to care for them. Another sister took Eloise, but didn't have room
for Stanley and Victor.
</P>
<P>
   On their first trip they were taken in by a family in
Coffeyville, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were kind and we liked them, but after a couple of months
they sent us back. I still don't know why. Maybe their other kids
didn't like us,'' said Cornell, now 80.
</P>
<P>
   On their second trip, they met a Wellington, Texas, man with two
daughters who had wanted a son.
</P>
<P>
   ''He only wanted one boy, but he took us both,'' Cornell
recalls. His only question ''was whether we liked farms and
animals,'' and when they passed that test, he gave them a bag of
jelly beans.
</P>
<P>
   Liebl said the nuns of New York's Foundling Hospital were
finding up to 1,000 abandoned babies on their doorstep every year
in the 1870s. The nuns and Brace's group were the main groups
sending orphans on the trains.
</P>
<P>
   Brace's faith in farmers didn't always pan out for the children.
In some cases orphans were treated as indentured workers, and were
sent away once the harvest was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother loved me but all my father cared about was how much
farm work I could do,'' said Sharpley.
</P>
<P>
   The orphans were told to never try to find out who their parents
were, and their adoptive parents signed an agreement not to divulge
the information.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still trying to find out who my real parents are. But the
Foundling Hospital tells me the records are all burned,'' said
Sharpley.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell got unexpected assistance finding his family. While
serving in the Army during World War II, he sent a telegram to J.
Edgar Hoover asking for help. The FBI director replied within 10
days, telling him where his father lived.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Start War Reparation Fund  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce will solicit
donations from U.S. corporations to compensate slave laborers and
others who were forced to work in German factories owned by
American companies or their subsidiaries during World War II,
authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber, which represents more than 3 million businesses
worldwide, decided to establish the fund after being approached by
the Clinton administration and a number of major U.S. corporations
that have been threatened with lawsuits by survivors and their
heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Several large American corporations, including Ford and General
Motors, have acknowledged having benefited from slave labor during
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat and chamber officials
plan to announce the project Monday at a conference on corporate
responsibility in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can assist member companies in resolving a humanitarian
situation, while at the same time preventing trial lawyers from
getting their hands on the money, we would like to help,'' Chamber
spokesman Frank Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund would allow companies to pool resources to respond to
many humanitarian challenges around the world, including disaster
relief. Attorneys are scheduled to meet later in the week to
determine how funds specifically for war reparations will be
structured within the foundation, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund would be led by Craig Johnstone, who is a senior vice
president of the chamber, a former ambassador to Algeria under
President Ronald Reagan and a former director of the State
Department's office of policy and plans under Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ''American companies are looking for a way to do the greatest
amount of good for real victims,'' Johnstone said.
</P>
<P>
   In December, U.S. and German negotiators, at the behest of
President Clinton and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
announced a deal to establish a $5.2 billion German fund to
compensate hundreds of thousands of people forced to work for the
Nazis and German companies during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Under that agreement, German companies would pay roughly half
the restitution and the German government would make up most of the
rest. American firms that had German subsidiaries during the war
have said they would contribute.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber's project would be a parallel American ''shadow
fund,'' but Coleman said it is too early to tell how much the
chamber could raise or whether the figure would approach that
offered by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has already made some $60 billion in payments for war
crimes, but has never compensated the estimated 12 million enslaved
and forced workers. Between 1.5 million and 2.3 million people
still alive would be eligible for compensation, mostly non-Jews
living in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials estimate about 240,000 former slave laborers
survive. About half that number are Jews who were held in
concentration camps. Others were mostly non-Jews brought from the
Soviet Union, Poland and other countries east of Germany and put to
work making war goods and other products for the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials estimate about 100,000 victims are Americans.
</P>
<P>
   New York attorney Melvyn Weiss, who represents some victims,
said Saturday that good-faith contributions to the fund might help
avert a class-action lawsuit against at least 50 and perhaps as
many as 200 U.S. companies, including Kodak and Exxon-Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no fund big enough that could satisfy survivors in the
absolute terms, but I think it's important to get a significantly
meaningful contribution so that they will have some financial
assistance in their later years, will feel better about getting the
truth out, and get a certain amount of recompense,'' Weiss said.

<HEADLINE> Sources: WPP Group Talks Break Off  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For a second time this year, talks have broken
down in WPP Group PLC's attempts to acquire Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.
and become the world's biggest advertising and marketing company,
two sources close to the discussions said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But New York-based Y&AMP;R, whose clients include AT&AMP;T, Ford Motor
Co., Colgate-Palmolive and Citibank, was continuing discussions
about a combination with another European ad company, Publicis SA
of France, according to one of the sources.
</P>
<P>
   Both sources spoke on condition that they not be identified.
Calls to the companies for comment were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising industry has been consolidating in recent years
as agencies seek the global reach and versatile marketing skills
demanded by the multinational companies who are their biggest
clients.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear exactly what led to the breakdown in talks
between Y&AMP;R and WPP Group, the British parent of the New York-based
ad agencies J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &AMP; Mather. Their talks
began several months ago and broke down in mid-March before
resuming again about 10 days ago, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The talks broke down last night and the negotiations have been
terminated,'' one of the sources said Saturday. He said there was
disagreement over provisions related to severance and autonomy but
declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The other source said there was no price agreement as well as
''serious contractual issues'' involving Y&AMP;R employees and
disagreement over how much autonomy Y&AMP;R would be allowed in serving
its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R is a 77-year-old ad company that went public for the first
time about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   WPP was a onetime wire-basket maker that was transformed into an
advertising powerhouse under its leader Martin Sorrell with the
hostile acquisitions of the venerable J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy
&AMP; Mather agencies in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   According to one source, WPP had offered stock worth about $65 a
share for Y&AMP;R in March, which would have valued Y&AMP;R at about $5.46
billion. Y&AMP;R shares rose $2.81\ to $55.68\ on Friday in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange after a $3 a share rise on Thursday
when WPP confirmed it was in talks with Y&AMP;R.
</P>
<P>
   WPP is the third-biggest ad organization in the world based on
1999 revenue of about $4.82 billion, according to the trade
publication Advertising Age.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R ranked seventh on that list with about $1.87 billion in
revenue while Publicis was 10th at $1.43 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of WPP and Y&AMP;R would have allowed WPP to vault
past the two bigger ad companies on the Ad Age list -- Omnicom Group
at $5.74 billion in revenue and Interpublic Group of Companies at
$5.08 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   A Y&AMP;R merger with Publicis would rank fourth behind WPP.

<HEADLINE> Cops Beat Back Azerbaijan Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By ELCHIN TEIMURKHANOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) -- Police with batons beat back more than
1,000 demonstrators seeking to stage an unsanctioned rally in
Azerbaijan's capital Baku on Saturday and detained three opposition
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people were clubbed, including 13 prominent opposition
figures, two Parliament members and five reporters who covered the
rally, according to the information center of the Musavat
opposition party. At least one person was hospitalized, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   As police in green helmets and riot shields advanced, pushing
back protesters, an Associated Press reporter saw three men left
lying on the road, their heads and faces smeared with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties wanted to hold a rally in central Fizuli
Square to demand that this fall's parliamentary elections be free
of fraud and government intimidation of opposition groups. City
authorities refused to allow the protest on Fizuli Square, but said
they could gather at a raceway on Baku's northern outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the refusal, a few hundred protesters broke through
police cordons around Fizuli Square on Saturday, and police beat
them back with batons. Some protesters threw rocks at the police,
and many were singing Azerbaijan's national anthem and chanting
''Freedom!''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition crowd grew to at least 1,000, and spread to the
nearby Palace of the Republic and the central bank headquarters.
Scattered clashes continued throughout the evening, and streets
downtown were closed for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 46 people were detained. Opposition leaders said
they included Arif Gadzhiyev, secretary of the Musavat party,
Panakh Guseinov, chair of the People's Party of Azerbaijan, and
another prominent opposition leader, Fazil Gazanfarogly.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan's authoritarian President Geidar Aliev has been
criticized by international human rights groups for cracking down
on dissent and independent media in his former Soviet republic. His
re-election in 1998 was boycotted by the opposition and called
undemocratic by foreign observers.

<HEADLINE> S. Koreans Seek Shorter Workweek  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Demonstrators and police clashed
Saturday after 15,000 workers took to Seoul's streets to demand a
shorter workweek and oppose the sale of South Korean car companies
to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   The protest turned violent when 200 workers and students,
hurling rocks and wielding sticks, clashed briefly with police. At
least three protesters were injured, witnesses said. One person was
bleeding from the head and was taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Police took away several protesters in sporadic clashes that
followed, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Five-day workweek,'' the protesters chanted, picking up the
slogan blared from loudspeakers mounted on vans. ''Let's crush
foreign sales and protect our right to survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller protests were held in about a dozen other cities,
organizers said. Those protests in the countryside ended
peacefully, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police stood guard along the eight-lane boulevards, and traffic
was backed up for miles.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations were organized by the Korean Confederation of
Trade Unions, a militant umbrella labor group that claims to have
500,000 members, many of them in the car and shipbuilding
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Workers demanded their workweek be cut from 44 hours to 40 hours
without a cut in pay, saying South Korea had the longest workweek
of all industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   They denounced plans to sell ailing Daewoo Motor Co. to a
foreign investor. A successful bidder will be chosen by September.
Workers fear mass layoffs under foreign ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, French carmaker Renault SA took over another ailing
South Korean auto company, Samsung Motors Inc., for $562 million,
becoming the first foreign car producer and operator in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Brandeis Student Heads to Court  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A former Brandeis University student who claims he
was unfairly punished by the school after he was accused of rape is
heading to Massachusetts' highest court in a case that will grapple
with how much control colleges have over their disciplinary
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges want to keep judges from meddling, while the student
and civil liberties activists say the courts need to be involved to
ensure fairness to students.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court is to hear arguments Monday in the
case of David Arlen Schaer, who was a 20-year-old junior when he
was accused of raping a fellow student in her dorm room February
1996. He claimed the sex was consensual, and was never criminally
charged.
</P>
<P>
   But Brandeis suspended him from campus between May and August
1996, preventing him from working on a biomedical research project
at a university lab.
</P>
<P>
   Schaer tried to sue the school for damages, saying the
disciplinary process was flawed, but a Middlesex Superior Court
judge initially dismissed the case. In a ruling last September, the
Massachusetts Appeals Court said Schaer should be allowed to sue
the school.
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis is challenging that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very important case. It potentially affects all
colleges and universities,'' Brandeis spokesman Dennis Nealon said.
''What the university is looking for in this case is for the court
to reassert the principle that has been in existence for decades
and centuries that essentially says the courts don't belong in the
business of internal judicial procedures at universities and
colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   Nealon said Boston College, Boston University, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Northeastern University, Babson, Bentley,
Smith, Stonehill and Williams colleges and Tufts University all
support Brandeis' position.
</P>
<P>
   But in briefs submitted to the court, Schaer's lawyers argued,
''Schaer is seeking judicial intervention and evaluation of the
process and substance of his discipline. ... While the bases for
intervention in the affairs of a private university are unsettled,
it is clear that courts have and exercise that power.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaer got additional support from the American Civil Liberties
Union and the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education Inc., a
nonprofit foundation set up to defend and sustain individual
liberties at colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that ''students who face serious sanctions in
college and university disciplinary proceedings should be entitled
to procedural safeguards that are commensurate with the possible
sanctions and that are sufficient to insure that the proceedings
are fundamentally fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaer eventually graduated from Brandeis in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Farmland Preservation program to save historic house along withfarm  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The Hackett-Strang house in Salem County
hasn't received so much attention since Joseph Hackett discovered
dinosaur bones on his land in 1869.
</P>
<P>
   But since the state's Farmland Preservation Program bought the
Strang family's farmstead last month, the survival of its
three-story house has become paramount to preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   They no longer have to worry.
</P>
<P>
   The farmland program will auction the 276-acre farm spread over
Alloway and Mannington townships on Tuesday with deed restrictions
that require the house to be preserved permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions are a first in the program's 17-year history,
said Hope Gruzlovic, a spokeswoman for the farmland program.
</P>
<P>
   Preservation New Jersey included the house on its Top 10 list of
endangered historic sites in the state for 2000; about a week
later, the farmland program purchased the property.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past there were never any assurances the sites would be
preserved'' under the farmland program, said Pat Pizzini Huizing,
executive director of the nonprofit group. ''It shows the power of
the list.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been looking for some time for ways to help protect
historic structures, which is another component of Governor
Whitman's open space program. So the timing was really ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the farmland program has worked with the Green
Acres program to build bird sanctuaries and construct of nature
trails. Now it is saving homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good thing,'' said Shirley Strang, whose in-laws bought
the farm 50 years ago. She lived in the house with her late
husband, Warren, and two children.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too good a house to be torn down,'' Strang said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Hackett built the Greek Revival-Italianate style brick
home in 1864, after the original log cabin farmstead -- built in
1684 -- burned down.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important to preserve this house as an evolution of a
farmstead,'' said Janet Sheridan, secretary of Preservation Salem.
''This is really what we've been working towards.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Jengo, executive director of the Garden State Preservation
Trust, also praised the farmland program's decision to save the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a wonderful thing,'' Jengo said. ''It's something we try
to do if all the ingredients are in place.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, New Jersey voters approved a 10-year, $98
million-a-year open space preservation program. Gov. Christie
Whitman has set a goal of preserving 1 million acres over that
time.
</P>
<P>
   The trust, created last fall, oversees the open space initiative
and makes spending recommendations to the Legislature based on
applications submitted by the farmland program, Green Acres and the
New Jersey Historic Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The State Agricultural Development Committee, which oversees the
Farmland Preservation Program, approved the easement last month.
Under the program, the state typically acquires the development
rights, restricting land use, but leaves the property in the
farmer's ownership to work, lease or sell.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the state bought the farm for $619,210. The
minimum bid allowed during Tuesday's auction will be $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has 830,000 acres of farmland. More than 62,000 of
those acres have been protected permanently under the farmland
program since its inception in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Vieques Island Protesters Camp Out  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Protesters camped out on a Navy
bombing range on Saturday girded for a possible confrontation with
U.S. authorities after two Navy ships headed toward Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters warned that some colleagues will scatter into the
brush if U.S. authorities try to dislodge them from the
bomb-littered range on Vieques island that they have occupied for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have weapons -- the danger for them is the bombs that
they themselves have put there,'' said Carlos Zenon, leader of a
protest camp in the heart of the bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian security guard David Sanes Rodriguez's death on the
range by two bombs dropped off target in April 1999 prompted the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. federal authorities reportedly were planning a raid this
week to arrest the activists and allow the Navy to reclaim its
prime live-fire Atlantic training ground.
</P>
<P>
   The amphibious warships USS Bataan and USS Nashville left their
home port of Norfolk, Va., on Thursday evening, officials said, and
could be in the vicinity of Vieques by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The removal operation is being planned by the Justice Department
in collaboration with the FBI and the Coast Guard. No military
forces were to be used to remove protesters, government officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters are blocking implementation of an agreement by
President Clinton and Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello to order the
Navy out of Vieques by May 2003 if island residents vote in a
referendum to expel them. Until the vote, expected next year, the
Navy can resume limited exercises without explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators say there are about 60 people on the bombing
range. If those activists are arrested, more will be sent in by
cutting through fences and using small, fast fishing boats to defy
an expected blockade of the island.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not worried so much about the numbers of protesters,''
said Vieques fisherman Ismael Guadalupe. ''The important thing is
continuity and always having someone there to prevent the
exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sanes' killing sparked the occupation, Vieques residents
say the roots of resentment toward the Navy -- which purchased
two-thirds of the island 60 years ago -- go much deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took my family's land away,'' said 73-year-old Pablo
Hernandez, whose home on the island's west end became part of a
munitions depot. ''Now I am fighting for justice to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents complain Navy bombing has polluted the island and
stunted economic development. Since the Navy took over, the
island's population has shrunk from 30,000 to 9,400.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says Vieques is irreplaceable: the only place where the
Atlantic Fleet can practice live shelling, bombing, amphibious
assaults, submarine warfare and ship-to-ship attacks at the same
time.

<HEADLINE> Chile Bus Collision Leaves 7 Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A pair of buses carrying tourists and
rural travelers collided head-on in central Chile Saturday, leaving
seven people dead and 33 injured, eight of them seriously, police
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the tourist bus was carrying several Argentine
nationals to the Argentine city of Mendoza, just across the Andes
from central Chile. All the fatalities were among Chileans riding
on the other vehicle, a rural transportation bus, according to
police.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred near Cetemu, a town 80 miles north of
here.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report said the accident occurred when the rural
bus attempted to pass a truck, a police officer told the Associated

<HEADLINE> Swedish City Readies for Arson Trial  </HEADLINE>
By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) -- Leo Papini felt pleased as his
16-year-old daughter went off to a dance. She had agreed to go on a
family excursion, and in exchange, he decided to let her stay out
late.
</P>
<P>
   He was to pick her up at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   But when Papini arrived at the dance hall in the southwestern
port city of Goteborg on Oct. 29, 1998, a horrific scene awaited
him: flames were shooting out of the building's broken windows and
acrid smoke filled the air.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to push past firefighters to reach his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it was too late,'' he said recently. Moa was one of 63
youths who died when fire raced through the second-floor disco that
was jammed beyond capacity. More than 200 people were injured, 50
seriously, in the worst fire in Swedish history. On Wednesday, four
people are to stand trial in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the youths attending the dance were immigrants or
children of immigrants -- like Moa, whose father came from Italy in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was becoming a real young lady,'' the 65-year-old
architect said, holding back tears.
</P>
<P>
   Shoresh Kaveh, 19, Housein Arsani, 19, Mohammad Mohammadamini,
21, and Meysam Mohammadyeh, 19, all born in Iran but now living in
Sweden, are charged with aggravated arson and face trial in
Goteborg, 300 miles southwest of Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   The four men denied the allegations. But defense attorneys
acknowledged at least three of the defendants were present at the
stairwell where the fire started.
</P>
<P>
   The four were arrested earlier this year but only formally
charged last week after investigators eliminated other leads
yielded by 1,800 interviews and an award of up to $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities suspected arson from the beginning because the fire
spread so fast. Fifteen investigators and two prosecutors worked
exclusively on the case.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction on an aggravated arson charge can carry a sentence
of six years to life in prison, but Swedish law would allow a
lesser sentence because the suspects were under age 20 at the time
of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The court proceedings had to be moved to an exhibition center
that will be divided into three rooms to accommodate 500 relatives
of the victims and survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said flammable liquid was poured over chairs stacked
in the emergency stairwell and set on fire after an argument broke
out with the party's organizers over the entrance fee.
</P>
<P>
   The dance was organized by four teen-agers who rented a room at
the cultural Macedonian Association during a holiday week. About
400 people were crammed into a space legally licensed for 150 when
the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   The fire spread so quickly that people had little time to escape
the searing flames and smoke. Panicked teen-agers were forced to
flee down a single, narrow staircase. Many people leapt from
second-story windows.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been thinking about this tragedy when we leave the
police (station), at home and on weekends,'' chief prosecutor Ulf
Noren said recently. ''We know that if we find the cause, the
survivors and relatives can finally know what happened and get on
with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Papini, who is chairman of an association of victims' relatives
and survivors, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''A victim wants the truth and wants satisfaction,'' said
Papini. ''Then you can go home and say now justice was done.''

<HEADLINE> Blast at Hamburg Disco Injures 9  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- A grenade hidden in a crowded Hamburg
discotheque went off early Saturday morning, sending nine people to
the hospital, two of them in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   When the grenade exploded shortly after 3 a.m., about 1,500
people were at the disco, located in a renovated wartime air raid
shelter in Germany's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Police said earlier that eight people were hurt in the blast,
but revised the number to nine after a man contacted them and said
he had left the club on his own after the explosion to seek
treatment for back injuries from his regular doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Six men and two women -- between the ages of 18 and 32 -- suffered
injuries to their arms, legs and bodies. One person was hit in the
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the attack was not clear, and police had no leads
on suspects, police spokesman Hans-Juergen Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmentation hand grenade that police said was
Yugoslav-built had been hidden in a room separated from the club's
dance floor when it detonated.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the explosive device was hidden between some seats,
but were not sure how it was set off.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: I won't run with Buchanan  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. (AP) -- Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton, while courting the support of the New York wing of the
reform party, told its members Saturday she wouldn't share a ticket
with Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot and will not, as the price for any endorsement,
embrace or excuse those who use hateful rhetoric to separate and
divide,'' the first lady told about 100 members of the Independence
Party gathered at a suburban Buffalo hotel for a forum with Senate
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate appearance at the forum, Clinton's cancer-stricken
Senate rival, Rudolph Giuliani, said he would announce before the
end of May whether he would stay in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I promise you that I'll make a decision long before you have
to make a decision ... and I hope that decision is that I can
run,'' the New York City mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party's state convention, at which it may
select a Senate nominee, is to be held in late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Clinton who stole the show as she criticized some of
the party membership for cozying up to conservative Buchanan's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a direct slap at Lenora Fulani, a former leader of
the left-leaning New Alliance Party, who has become a major force
in New York's Independence Party. Clinton said: ''If this party
allows itself to become defined by the anti-Semitism, extremism,
prejudice and intolerance of a few shrill voices of both the right
and the left, you will be doing yourselves and our state a great
disservice.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulani, a Buchanan backer, called Clinton's description of her
''slanderous.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulani also told reporters that the party didn't need advice
from Clinton about who to select as its presidential nominee and
said ''that's her problem,'' when asked about the first lady's
refusal to share a ticket with Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance at the Independence Party forum marked Giuliani's
second day of campaigning since he announced Thursday that he had
been diagnosed with prostate cancer and said his continuing in the
Senate race would depend on the treatment of his disease. He said
the cancer had been detected early and was treatable. He told about
1,000 cheering Republicans on Friday night in Saratoga Springs that
he wanted to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   That was his message again Saturday at a morning meeting with
Republican leaders at a Buffalo restaurant, at the forum and in a
later news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to run, I'm prepared to do it ... but there's
this other thing that I have to consider,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the New York City mayor has already begin cutting
back on his schedule to deal with his medical problems. He canceled
Law Day speeches in Syracuse and Rochester that had been scheduled
for Monday to accommodate medical appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Referring repeatedly to Sen. John McCain in his remarks to the
Independence Party members, many of whom admire the Arizona
Republican, said ''if you're looking for a candidate that can be
honestly described as an independent ... I think we're a natural
fit,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that he supported many of the party's government reform
goals, including term limits for elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, the reason I am here talking about running for the
Senate is because I'm term limited. I'm out of a job in a year and
a half,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan-Fulani coalition has been much on the minds of both
Clinton and Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''She definitely does not represent my philosophy, nor does Pat
Buchanan,'' the mayor told about 100 fellow Republicans at the
Buffalo restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   On top of it all, the Independence Party in New York appears
even more the victim of rival factions than the national Reform
Party. On Wednesday, a state judge reinstated Jack Essenberg as
party chairman, overturning his earlier ouster by Fulani and others
in the party. Essenberg said Friday that he would rather leave the
Independence Party presidential line blank than have Buchanan as
the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   While Essenberg's opponents had organized the Senate forum, he
said he was happy it was being held and showed up at the event that
was being run by the court-ousted chairman, Frank MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility that Independence Party convention
delegates could authorize a Sept. 12 primary that would feature
both Giuliani and Clinton. The mayor said he would welcome that and
predicted he would beat her in such a test. The first lady refused
to take a position on such a primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the Wild West,'' MacKay said Saturday of the feelings
within the party about who the Senate candidate should be. ''It's
completely up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of third-party nominations is strong in New York
when candidates expect a close race. Polls show the
Clinton-Giuliani race is just that. Unlike other states, New York
allows major party candidates to also run on third-party ballot
lines and combine their vote totals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Republican George Pataki beat Democratic incumbent
Mario Cuomo in the governor's race on the strength of the
Conservative Party vote.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Independence Party became New York's third
largest political party. As of March 1, it had more than 172,471
members. The Conservative Party fell into fourth place with 171,496
members. Both are dwarfed by the Democratic (4.96 million members)
and the Republican (3.09 million members) parties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the line brought more than 109,000 extra votes to
Democrat Charles Schumer as he beat Republican incumbent Alfonse
D'Amato in the U.S. Senate race.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania President To Run Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- President Benjamin Mkapa said
Saturday he would seek re-election to another five-year term in
Tanzania's Oct. 29 presidential and legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   Mkapa, a former journalist, ambassador to the United States and
Nigeria and foreign minister, first ran in October 1995 as the
candidate of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi party founded by the late
President Julius Nyerere. Tanzania's constitution limits presidents
to two terms.
</P>
<P>
   Mkapa, who is also CCM chairman, said he would go Sunday to
Dodoma, Tanzania's political capital, to pick up the filing forms.
But John Malecela, CCM vice-chairman, said the exercise was only a
formality, since Mkapa had the party's full backing to run for a
second term.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has stepped forward to challenge Mkapa in the
October race.

<HEADLINE> Report: 36 Journalists Killed in '99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The number of journalists killed in 1999 nearly
doubled to 36 from the year before, though slightly fewer reporters
were put behind bars, according to a Paris-based media advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters Without Borders' annual report, released this week,
shows that the struggle for press freedom around the world remains
an upward climb, with the Internet the latest target of
authoritarian governments.
</P>
<P>
   Press freedom does not exist in more than 20 nations that are
home to about 2 billion people, and ''truly (can) be said to
exist'' only in about 30 countries where less than 1 billion live,
the report said. Press freedom is ''random and unreliable''
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, there were 85 journalists in prison, ''slightly
fewer'' than in 1998 when there were 93.
</P>
<P>
   However, 36 journalists were killed worldwide, nearly double the
1998 toll of 19.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 446 were reported arrested, and 653 attacked and
threatened, the report said. Another 69 journalists disappeared in
1999. And about 400 media outfits were victims of bans,
suspensions, seizures or censorship.
</P>
<P>
   In March, another media advocacy group, International Press
Institute, reported that 87 journalists and media staff were killed
while working in 1999. Reporters Without Borders said it counted
only reporters among the 36 deaths and did not take into account
staff, such as drivers or interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   The number of journalists killed had been dropping until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, at least nine journalists were killed last
year, including Myles Tierney of Associated Press Television News.
More journalists were killed in sub-Saharan Africa in 1999 than in
the four previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Asia -- where six journalists were killed in 1999 and eight
others died in suspicious circumstances -- is the continent with the
most journalists in jail. Burma is the ''world's biggest prison for
the press,'' keeping 13 journalists behind bars, the group said.
The group's ''worst offenders'' in jailing journalists also
included Syria, with 10 jailings, and China and Ethiopia, each with
nine.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, four journalists have been arrested, and six put under
house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Violence waned slightly in the Americas, where six journalists
were murdered, compared to eight in 1998. All six killed in 1999
were in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia was the European focal point for journalistic
hardship in 1999, with six journalists killed, three foreign
correspondents held by the Yugoslav military under suspicion of
spying and more than 80 thrown out during the NATO bombing
campaign. Three of the journalists killed were from the official
Chinese media, their Belgrade Embassy hit by NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has become the latest target of authoritarian
governments. The organization said at least 20 countries could be
described as ''enemies of the Internet.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Guerrilla Agrees To Aid Victims  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A former Palestinian guerrilla who claims
he ordered the burial of three Israeli soldiers during the 1982
invasion of Lebanon said Saturday he was willing to help locate
their remains.
</P>
<P>
   Ghazi Atalla said, however, that he has little other information
that could be of use to the families of Israeli servicemen still
missing in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has put a high priority on finding its only MIAs in
Lebanon: Zachary Baumel, Zvi Feldman, Yehuda Katz, and air force
navigator Ron Arad. Some reports say they were captured and taken
to Damascus, while others say they were killed and buried in Syria
or Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am willing to give information and even if the families call
me or come to me I will give them what they need,'' Atalla told The
Associated Press in an interview at his Amman residence.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Arabic language newspaper Kol el Arab recently quoted
Atalla as saying that he had overseen the burial of three soldiers'
bodies after a battle in Lebanon and that he had offered to reveal
the location of the graves in exchange for Palestinian prisoners
held in Israeli jails. Israel's Hebrew-language daily Maariv
reported that Atalla had personally buried the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Atalla told the AP that the Arabic language newspaper had
''completely misquoted me and put words in my mouth,''
</P>
<P>
   Atalla said that in the early days of the June 6, 1982 invasion,
Israeli troops destroyed Syrian tanks and missiles and advanced to
the positions of Palestinian guerillas, known as Fidayeen,
scattering them.
</P>
<P>
   ''During heavy fighting, one of my soldiers said there were
bodies of three Israeli soldiers on the battlefield,'' Atalla said.
''I told him 'bury them.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not see the bodies, or know the exact burial location
and I don't recall the Palestinian soldier who had buried them,''
said Atalla then a colonel in charge of some 4,000 Palestinian
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Atalla said he did not know the dead soldiers' names or ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says the three soldiers went missing after a June 11,
1982 battle in southern Lebanon, about 5 miles west of the Syrian
border.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for obtaining information about Israeli MIA's who went
missing in Lebanon have faded amid pessimism over the chances of
resuming peace talks between Israel and Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon.

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Addressing each other informally
as ''Yoshi'' and ''Volodya,'' the new leaders of Japan and Russia
met Saturday and seemed to achieve their immediate goal --
establishing a friendly personal relationship -- but avoided all
thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori arrived in St. Petersburg on Friday
night on his first foreign trip as Japan's leader. He and Russian
President Vladimir Putin, who was elected last month, held private
talks in the Russian Museum and the Hermitage on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion covered economic ties and preparations for this
summer's summit in Okinawa of the Group of Eight -- the world's top
seven industrialized democracies plus Russia, Putin and Mori told
journalists after the talks.
</P>
<P>
   A smiling Mori also announced that the two had decided to
address each other as ''Yoshi'' and ''Volodya.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have begun forming a good personal relationship,''
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also thanked Mori for making Russia the site of his first
foreign trip, saying: ''This is a very good sign for our
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders avoided the main problem in Russian-Japanese
relations -- the bitter dispute over who owns the Kuril Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claim four small islands in the South Kuril chain
that Soviet troops seized after World War II. The dispute has
prevented the countries from signing a formal peace treaty to end
the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''During these talks, we confirmed intentions of signing the
peace agreement,'' Mori said. But the Kuril issue itself was not
mentioned, according to Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who
attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Mori said he hoped his friendly relationship with Putin would
serve as a foundation for tackling the more difficult issues later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like for the president and me to use the opportunities
of our friendship for further dialogue,'' Mori said.
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese government official said the two leaders agreed to
try to sign the peace treaty by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's trip was arranged when he was still second-in-command in
Japan's governing party; he became prime minister this month after
Keizo Obuchi became incapacitated by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ''When my predecessor was seriously ill, he asked me to continue
Russian-Japanese relations,'' Mori said Saturday. ''And these words
I took as guidance in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Mori and Russian officials have said that one of the key
purposes of Saturday's summit would be the establishment of a
personal relationship between the new leaders of Japan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's spokesman Alexei Gromov said later Saturday that Putin
would travel to Japan in late August, Russian news agencies
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Mori also exchanged diplomatic notes on an investment
protection agreement, which is to take effect in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Mori planned to leave Sunday for Western Europe to hold talks
with his Italian, French, German and British counterparts, before
heading to Canada. The premier's nine-day trip is to conclude with
talks with President Clinton on May 5.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mrs. America Charged With Fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A former Mrs. America was charged with fraud
for allegedly pretending to be single and failing to list $100,000
in jewelry as assets when she filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Scott Chance, 40, of Paradise Valley, Ariz., was indicted
Friday. Her 1996 bankruptcy filing resulted in the discharge of
nearly $330,000 in debt she had amassed in California.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said Chance filed using her maiden name but
was married to Phoenix auto glass tycoon C. Richard Chance. They
since divorced. Chance also didn't state she was a secretary in her
husband's firm, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also indicted Chance's San Diego attorney, Gary A.
Quackenbush, alleging he knew the bankruptcy petition was
fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   Chance was named Mrs. America in 1991, but the pageant sued her
for concealing that she was separated at the time. The pageant won
a $100,000 judgment.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Party Nominates Ghana's VP  </HEADLINE>
By KWASI KPODO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) -- Ghana's ruling party on Saturday endorsed
Vice President John Evans Atta Mills as its presidential candidate
for December elections.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination by the National Democratic Congress foreshadows
the end of the era of President Jerry Rawlings, who has dominated
Ghanaian politics since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Mills was the only candidate for the nomination, but a crowd of
supporters still roared in appreciation when it was announced he
had been given the nod during a party meeting held in Ho, about 110
miles north of Accra.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, a former law professor, said he would guarantee a nation
of equal opportunity for every Ghanaian in education, health care
and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I shall form a new government with a team of experienced and
skillful people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Rawlings, who saw the nation through years of
military rule before it emerged as one of Africa's most democratic
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings ruled during two repressive military juntas beginning
in 1979, but eventually oversaw a transition to civilian rule that
has made Ghana a bulwark of stability in troubled West Africa.

<HEADLINE> Cuban-Americans Protest Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tens of thousands of angry Cuban-Americans marched
through Miami's Little Havana on Saturday, protesting the raid in
which armed federal agents yanked 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from
the home of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Police stayed visibly distant from the chanting demonstrators,
many of whom carried signs denouncing President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno for taking Elian from his Miami
relatives and sending him to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the march, the exile community's biggest protest
yet, hoped it would to send a strong but peaceful message to the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Police blocked off 23 blocks of the main route along Calle Ocho,
or Eighth Street, and crowds of people, many dressed in black and
waving Cuban and American flags, marched in parade formation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to fight against communism, that's the bottom
line,'' said Little Havana resident Arnold Villar, 35.
</P>
<P>
   The procession included Cuban-American veterans groups and
marching bands, including one from Lincoln-Marti School, which
Elian attended while living here with his great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers Against Repression joined the march with a contingent of
about 40 women, all dressed in black, marching with about 300
supporters, men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we want is freedom,'' Villar said. ''Don't let the truth
get covered up by what a few people are doing or what people think
is happening in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Ferrieya, a Cuban-born accountant, distributed copies of
a letter urging demonstrators to write politicians in Washington
and demand an investigation into the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to listen. It's as simple as that,'' Ferrieya said.
</P>
<P>
   All week and into Saturday morning, Cuban exile leaders speaking
on Spanish radio stations had urged people to join the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a moment where the three generations of Cubans that
are here are coming together in favor of supporting the child Elian
and denouncing the aggressive way that they entered his home,''
said Andres Nazario Sargen, of Alpha 66, an anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Cuban-Americans protesters also took to the streets
hours after the boy was taken from Miami, setting more than 200
trash and tire fires and shouting in angry protests that lasted
into the next day. Police clad in riot gear arrested more than 300
people and cleared thousands of demonstrators from Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Fallout from the raid and the way police handled the protesters
sank the city government into chaos. By Friday, the mayor had fired
the city manager and the police chief had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, made a plea Friday for the
community to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian is gone for now and my heart is broken,'' he said in a
statement read by a family spokesman. ''But South Florida must stay
united. We cannot allow this tragedy to destroy our community. We
must continue to fight for Elian's rights to live in freedom in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old was found adrift on an inner tube Thanksgiving
Day after his mother and 10 other Cubans drowned in an attempt to
reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is now living with his father, stepmother and half
brother at the rural Wye River retreat in Maryland. He must remain
in the United States until a federal appeals court rules on the
Miami relatives' bid for him to have an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A young cousin, Elian's former first-grade teacher and four
playmates arrived during the week to keep him company.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Remirez, Cuba's diplomatic representative in
Washington, went to the State Department Friday afternoon to ask
for a continuing Cuban diplomatic presence at the Maryland retreat,
according a department official who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the request was under discussion, but added
that the department did not believe there was a compelling reason
to grant it.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Oil Exports To Surpass $8.5B  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq said Saturday it would export more
than $8.5 billion worth of oil in its current six-month phase, a
record for its earnings under the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
   In forecasting such high revenue for the phase ending late May,
Iraq also signaled it was implementing part of the U.N. Security
Council resolution it had rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made in a statement by Oil Minister Amer
Mohammed Rashid to the official Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. program used to limit Iraq to selling $5.2 billion in
oil every six months. Iraq was allowed to exceed the limit only
with special dispensation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the security council passed a resolution in December
offering Iraq certain incentives -- such as the abolishment of the
$5.2 billion cap -- to encourage it to allow a resumption of
disarmament inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions -- imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990 -- can be lifted only when experts report that Iraq is
free of has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq claims
to have done so, and has refused to let arms inspectors in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq condemned the council's resolution. Only last month, Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed it as ''an evil resolution
drafted by the United States and Britain to keep sanctions in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rashid said President Saddam Hussein had recently ordered
the Oil Ministry to do everything in its power to increase
production to the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry responded by drawing up a program to improve
services and increase both the quantity and the quality of oil
offered for export, Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the minister reiterated the Iraqi complaint that U.S.
and British representatives on the U.N. sanctions committee were
delaying contracts for spare parts required for the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain said they held up contracts
because they contained items that could have a dual military use.
But their governments have come under increasing pressure, driven
in part by media pictures and U.N. reports on the suffering of
Iraqi civilians after nearly 10 years of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to bypass the sanctions if
the oil proceeds are spent on food, medicine and humanitarian goods
for the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Bush optimistic about McCain meeting  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Texas Gov. George Bush said Saturday he hopes to
find common ground with defeated presidential rival John McCain in
a meeting McCain almost canceled because of disagreements over the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to discussing a wide range of issues with
John'' at the planned May 9 talk, Bush said during a brief visit to
a gathering of radio talk show hosts in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to remind him -- he knows this, I know it -- that
there's a lot we agree on, like Social Security reform,
governmental reform, education reform,'' Bush said. ''And I'm going
to talk to him about the general election, hopefully he'll campaign
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush would like to gain the support of his defeated but still
popular primary opponent, who has not endorsed the presumptive
Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's supporting me, and I appreciate that,'' Bush said. ''He's
a straightforward person. When he says he wants me to be the
president, I'm confident he does want me to be the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But relations between the men's camps have been strained since
McCain suspended his campaign last month.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his advisers were irritated by Bush's announcement
that he would ask the Arizona senator in their first face-to-face
meeting since the primaries whether he was willing to serve as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said repeatedly that he doesn't want the job, and
told aides to cancel the meeting unless they could be assured that
Bush wanted to hold substantial talks on a variety of topics.
</P>
<P>
   An agenda agreed upon by the two campaigns on Friday was said to
include McCain's signature issue of campaign finance overhaul along
with military reform, Social Security, education, health care,
making the GOP more inclusive and McCain's role in the fall
campaign and the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, to be held in Pittsburgh, will be important to the
political fortunes of both Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to unify the party and appeal to the
independent-minded voters galvanized by McCain's campaign. McCain,
who still has presidential ambitions, wants to show Republicans he
is a party man.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments came in an interview with WOR-AM radio, shortly
after the Texas governor spoke at the National Association of Radio
Talk Show Hosts convention on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   He joked with the hosts about seeking advice on his speech from
radio personalities Dr. Laura Schlessinger, G. Gordon Liddy and Don
Imus, and the raucous group greeted him warmly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to the conversation with America over the
radio airwaves,'' Bush said. ''You're talking to a lot of folks.
... It's a good way to communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hosts in the audience said that while Bush's 10-minute
speech had been entertaining, they didn't learn anything of
substance about his candidacy, and the address probably wouldn't
affect what radio jocks said about his campaign on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I go on the show Monday, I'll be able to say he's funny,
he's charming and he's well prepared,'' said Dan Yorke, of WPRO
radio in Providence, R.I.

<HEADLINE> Iran President Pushes Reform Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Defiant against a fierce hard-line crackdown
on Iran's pro-democracy movement, President Mohammad Khatami
insisted Saturday that the reforms he started three years ago could
not be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's statement was his strongest yet against hard-liners
who are trying to preserve their power and, it is feared, will seek
to prevent the gathering of Iran's newly elected pro-reform
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Iranian nation is revolutionary,'' Khatami told workers in
Tehran, ''and nothing can halt its achievements, that is to say,
reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
hard-liners have used their dominance of the judiciary to close 16
reformist newspapers and detain two leading journalists in the past
two weeks. Their actions are widely seen as an attempt to reverse
an easing of Islamic limitations on political and social life that
has occurred since Khatami took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the president signaled to supporters that he would
not back down, he and other top reformist leaders urged their
backers not to take to the streets in protest, for fear of giving
the hard-line Islamic clergy a pretext for a harsher crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are desires to foment tension in society and create a
violent atmosphere, but I kindly ask the people, especially
university students and workers who may be the target of
provocations, to keep calm,'' Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
   Students at two universities heeded the president's words and
staged quiet demonstrations on their campuses on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At Gilan University in northwest Iran more than 200 students
protested the closures of the newspapers but with their mouths
taped, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. ''Our
statement is our silence,'' several students told the agency.
</P>
<P>
   At Razi University in western Iran, students gathered to discuss
the newspaper bans and closed their meeting after reading out a
statement, Chancellor Morteza Mamouei told the agency.
</P>
<P>
   An umbrella organization of reform groups, the Second of Khordad
Movement, backed the president Saturday in calling for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners were ''trying to provoke a crisis and riots in order
to justify a harsh crackdown ... and then exploit the situation in
(their) favor,'' it said in a statement reported by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency on Saturday. The movement takes its
name from the day in the Iranian calendar, Khordad 2 -- or May 23 --
that Khatami was elected.
</P>
<P>
   The largest group of pro-reform students, the Office for
Fostering Unity, also appealed for calm, saying it would not
condone any violent reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's efforts to push through reforms got a boost in the
February legislative elections in which conservatives lost control
of parliament for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Pro-Khatami candidates won some 70 percent of the seats announced
for the 290-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A run-off election will be held on May 5 to decide 66 seats
where no candidate passed the required threshold. Campaigning for
the vote began last week.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers fear that the hard-liners are trying to instigate
violence to justify declaring a state of emergency that would delay
the opening of the new parliament on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral authority, which is controlled by hard-liners,
annulled the results in 12 seats won by reformers and said there
might be changes in Tehran, where reformers won 29 of the 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Saturday, the courts summoned two women activists who
had taken part in a Berlin conference on Iran earlier this month
and ordered their arrest, a relative told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Siamak Zand said his wife, Mehrangis Karr, called him this
afternoon to say she had been detained with another conference
participant, Shahla Lahiji. Lahiji and Karr are well-known
activists for women's and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The conference provoked an outcry in conservative circles after
state television screened clips showing female delegates dancing
and Iranian exiles criticizing the government. Women are not
allowed to dance in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-line newspaper, the weekly Jebhe, was closed down
Saturday for ''violations of the press law,'' state television
reported. It did not elaborate. The move appeared to be the
hard-liners' way of deflecting criticism that they were closing
only reformist publications.

<HEADLINE> Chiapas Gov. Admits Campaign Plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Chiapas state governor has admitted
taking part in a plot to influence local newspapers during Mexico's
presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico City newspaper Reforma obtained a tape of a
conversation in which Gov. Roberto Albores tells his press
secretary Edgar Arrocha that the head of the state's Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, would be in charge of having Chiapas
newspapers publish that PRI candidate Francisco Labastida Ochoa had
triumphed in Tuesday's presidential debate against five other
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls by major Mexico City newspapers after the
televised debate -- the second of its kind in Mexican history --
overwhelmingly declared opposition candidate Vicente Fox the
winner. Fox poses perhaps the biggest threat ever to the ruling
party's 71-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, no sitting official can use state resources
to influence an election.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of the southern Mexican state admitted to having
the conversation, the newspaper reported Saturday. But he denied
any wrongdoing, saying the local PRI sent the information, and the
media is free to publish what it wants. He said the taped
conversation was illegally obtained by the media and a violation of
his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't rest litigation that came from a crime,'' Albores
told a Mexican radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida sent Albores a message telling him that the best way
to help is ''by working hard, giving good results to the people,
and not doing anything more.''

<HEADLINE> Detained U.S. Journalist Heads Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tucker Carlson, a magazine reporter and
television commentator who was detained briefly in Vietnam, flew to
Singapore on Saturday and was expected back home Sunday, his wife
said.
</P>
<P>
   Susie Carlson said he was flying to Tokyo later Saturday and
then on to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She said she and her husband were able to talk by telephone at
will during his stay in Vietnam and that he was none-the-worse for
the wear of the experience. She added that she did not ask about
the circumstances that led to his release when she talked to him
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, 30, went to Vietnam with John McCain for the 25th
anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   He is a reporter for The Weekly Standard conservative magazine
and occasionally TV political commentator.
</P>
<P>
   After spending days touring Vietnam, and even seeing McCain's
old ''Hanoi Hilton'' prison cell, Carlson was trying to board a
plane Friday when he found he wasn't free to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their explanation was I didn't have a stamp on my passport,''
Carlson told associates from his hotel in Ho Chi Minh City.
''Therefore I was not officially in Vietnam. Therefore I couldn't
leave the country I wasn't in in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   When he first tried to leave, along with McCain and members of
the press, he learned that he hadn't received a passport stamp when
he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration authorities took his passport and refused to let him
board his departing plane. They first insisted that he travel to
Hanoi to get the entry stamp. Then they wanted him to sign a
statement admitting he wasn't supposed to be in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to get me to sign it and I wouldn't and they
freaked out and started yelling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department was enlisted to help secure his departure.

Cesar Lopez, the ninth driver to be killed so far this year.

   Felicia Fields, 18, Charles Rhodes, 17, and Tyriek Cross, 17,

   The number of livery drivers killed in the first four months of
the year has almost reached the total number of drivers killed last
year. Eleven drivers were killed in all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez did not have a bulletproof partition in his car, and
police say he had picked up two passengers who hailed him on the
street -- a widespread practice that violates rules for livery
drivers. Livery cabs are supposed to be summoned by a phone call to
the company, unlike regular yellow taxis that are hailed on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of
Taxi Drivers, said the law should be done away with and replaced
with one that makes it mandatory for livery cabs to have
bulletproof partitions
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unfair for a family that lives in the inner city to have
to stand out in the rain and the cold and not be able to hail a
taxi because yellow taxis won't go there,'' Mateo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is that people have little choice but to hail these
livery cabs, so let's make it legal to do so and also make it the
law for the cabs to have the partitions.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the arrests, there were also five robberies of
livery cab drivers around the city Friday night and Saturday
morning, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In one case a Brooklyn livery cab driver had a machete held to
his throat during an attempted robbery by two teen-age passengers
early Saturday morning, said police spokesman Alan Krawitz.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, who was not hurt, struggled with the robbers and
held one until authorities arrived. A description of the second
suspect led to his arrest by patrolling officers.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vargas, 17, and Luis Bello, 18 were charged with robbery
and criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In another robbery in the Kingsbridge Heights section of the
Bronx, early Saturday, a 35-year-old driver got into dispute with
his passenger, Jenny Delacruz, 24. Delacruz pulled out a black
object, which the driver thought was a gun, and then fled the car.
</P>
<P>
   After the driver radioed his dispatcher, his co-workers gave
chase and caught Delacruz, holding him till police arrived, Krawitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver was taken to the hospital with chest pains. Delacruz
was taken to North Central Bronx hospital with facial abrasions.
</P>
<P>
   Two other robberies occurred in Queens, and one in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   After this year's seventh killing, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
pledged $5 million to help equip the city's livery cars with
bulletproof partitions or digital security cameras. He also
announced the creation of a fund to help the families of slain
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., asked for $600,000 in
federal funds to purchase 2,000 partitions.
</P>
<P>
   The recent demand for partitions has apparently overwhelmed
shops that install them. The waiting list to have partitions
installed ranges from one week to two months.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, on Saturday, urged drivers to institute an industry
slowdown until partitions are installed.
</P>
<P>
   The police department has created a task force and assigned 300
officers to protect the city's 41,000 livery drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir on Friday pledged to assign
more officers to the task force. Also, police will set up more
checkpoints where they stop drivers to see if they're OK.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Fujimori Agrees to Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori, seeking an
unprecedented third term in office, has agreed to hold a public
debate with his rival in an upcoming runoff presidential vote, his
political party said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo's Possible Peru party said it is appointing
three delegates to negotiate details of the debate with
representatives for Fujimori's Peru 2000 movement. The two men have
not debated before.
</P>
<P>
   The National election Board said the date for the decisive
second round of balloting will be announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff was necessary after neither candidate received a
majority of the vote in the April 9 election, although Fujimori was
close with 49.8 percent. Toledo placed a close second, and five
other candidate lagged far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently worried over massive claims of fraud in the April
vote, the influential Roman Catholic Church on Saturday urged,
''for the sake of the well-being of the Peruvian people, a totally
clear electoral process, with respect to ethic demands, truth,
equality of rights for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has threatened to boycott the second round unless what he
called wide-ranging electoral abuses are eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has denied irregularities and has vowed a clean second
round.
</P>
<P>
   But the results have been questioned by international monitors
and last Tuesday President Clinton signed a congressional
resolution warning that Peru could face political and economic
sanctions if electoral irregularities persist.

<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- A woman who ordered a skateboarding magazine
as a gift for her 15-year-old son received an X-rated publication --
a mistake that angered both her and Larry Flynt, who owns both
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was horrified,'' Becky Barrington said. ''I don't want my
son seeing that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynt already has fired the employee whose mistake caused
Hustler Taboo magazine to be mailed to all subscribers of Big
Brother Skateboarding, a Flynt spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Awang, vice president of operations for Flynt's publishing
house, said his boss was ''livid'' over the switch.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say how many copies were mailed in error because
the company does not release circulation data.
</P>
<P>
   Barrington said the company apologized to her when she
complained, However, she plans to cancel the Big Brother
subscription for her son, Justin Noga, now that she knows who owns
the skateboarding magazine.

<HEADLINE> Arrests in NYC Livery Driver Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- Three teen-agers were arrested Saturday and
charged in the shooting death of a livery cab driver who was the
ninth driver to be killed in the city so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Fields, 18, Charles Rhodes, 17, and Tyriek Cross, 17,
were each charged with second-degree murder. Cesar Lopez, 43, was
shot in the back of his head while in his car Friday morning, said
Sgt. Victor Ramos.

   The number of livery drivers killed in the first four months of

<HEADLINE> Note Found in Pa. Suspect's Home  </HEADLINE>
By TODD SPANGLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT LEBANON, Pa. (AP) -- Authorities trying to explain what may
have motivated a 34-year-old immigration lawyer to allegedly go on
a shooting spree that left five people dead Friday say a two-page
note found in the man's home holds some clues.
</P>
<P>
   Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr. refused
to say what the note contained, but he said the words -- believed to
have been typed by suspect Richard Scott Baumhammers -- are relevant
to determining whether the shootings were hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Five people died in the attacks: a Jewish woman who lived next
door to Baumhammers, an Indian man at a grocery, two Asian men in a
Chinese restaurant and a black man at a karate school. Shots were
also fired through the doors of two synagogues, and a man of Indian
descent at the grocery was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody who wants to guess whether it would be a hate-related
crime, I guess these would be people who would look at the Empire
State Building to determine if it was a skyscraper,'' county
coroner Cyril Wecht said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He said there are so few Asians in Pittsburgh that the
likelihood of someone picking those victims by chance would be
''one in a trillion.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's attacks came two months after another deadly shooting
rampage in the Pittsburgh suburbs. On March 1, Ronald Taylor, who
is black, allegedly killed three white men and wounded two others
in working-class Wilkinsburg. Police said they found hate writings
in Taylor's apartment expressing harsh opinions of Jews, Asians,
Italians and the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been around a long time and it just amazes me,'' said
Officer Ray Kaskie, a 34-year veteran of the Scott Township Police,
where Baumhammers is accused of shooting at the Beth El
Congregation synagogue and painting swastikas on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's racial tension. I think it's just those who
have hate in them,'' Kaskie said.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe Friday afternoon's violence began in the quiet
suburb of Mount Lebanon, just south of Pittsburgh, where
Baumhammers lived with his parents, both Latvian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Baumhammers apparently walked next door and fatally
shot Anita Gordon, 63, who was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of reports of shootings came in minutes later:
</P>
<P>
   --Shots were fired at two synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   --Two men were shot at an Indian grocery store in Carnegie -- Anil
Thakur, 31, was killed, and Sandip Patel, 25, remained hospitalized
in critical condition Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   --Two employees at a Chinese restaurant -- Thao Pham, 30, a
deliveryman from Vietnam, and Ji-Ye Sun, 34, the Chinese manager --
were shot and killed in McKees Rocks.
</P>
<P>
   --A black man -- Garry Lee, 22 -- was shot and killed at a karate
school in a Monaca shopping plaza, about 20 miles from the first
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe Baumhammers drove calmly to each location,
stepped out of a dark sport utility vehicle, and fired.
</P>
<P>
   He surrendered Friday afternoon when police spotted his sport
utility vehicle and cornered him in Ambridge about 3{ hours after
Gordon's body was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Police said officers who arrested Baumhammers also found an
object in his vehicle that they plan to turn over to arson
investigators. They would not describe it.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers was arraigned on a charge of homicide and reckless
endangerment and remained jailed Saturday. The FBI has joined the
investigation to determine if federal hate crimes were committed.
</P>
<P>
   Allegheny County Police Detective Ken Fulton said Baumhammers
hasn't talked about the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Neal Scheindlin, at the Beth El Congregation where Gordon
had been a member, said even if the shootings Friday and those two
months ago in Wilkinsburg were racially motivated, he does not
believe racial tensions are particularly high in the Pittsburgh
area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take these as more or less random and put them down to the
individuals involved,'' Scheindlin said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't allow people who hate to win,'' said Sheila Schmeltz,
the synagogue president. ''Windows can be replaced. Swastikas can
be removed. But five people can't live again. That's senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   At Baumhammers' home, where the one-time immigration lawyer
lived with his parents, lawyer William Difenderfer answered the
door Saturday morning, saying he could not discuss the case, his
client or the family.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers' parents, both dentists, were described by Gordon's
husband, Sanford, as ''pillars of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're devastated as to what happened and they are extremely
sympathetic to the victims and their families,'' Difenderfer said.
''Right now, we're trying to piece things together.''

Cuban-Americans March for Elian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tens of thousands of angry Cuban-Americans marched through
Miami's Little Havana today, protesting the raid in which federal agents took
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from the home of his relatives. Organizers of the
march hoped it would to send a strong but peaceful message to the federal
government. Police stayed visibly distant from the chanting demonstrators. The
boy is now living with his father, stepmother and half brother at the rural Wye
River retreat in Maryland. He must remain in the United States until a federal
appeals court rules on the Miami relatives' bid for him to have an asylum

   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq said Saturday it would export more than $8.5
billion worth of oil in its current six-month phase, a record for its earnings
under the U.N. oil-for-food program. In forecasting such high revenue for the
phase ending late May, Iraq also signaled it was implementing part of the U.N.
Security Council resolution it had rejected The announcement was made in a
statement by Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid to the official Iraqi News
Agency. The U.N. program used to limit Iraq to selling $5.2 billion in oil every
six months. Iraq was allowed to exceed the limit only with special dispensation.

<HEADLINE> Bush Optimistic About McCain Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Texas Gov. George Bush said Saturday he hopes to
find common ground with defeated presidential rival John McCain in
a meeting McCain almost canceled because of disagreements over the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to discussing a wide range of issues with
John'' at the planned May 9 talk, Bush said during a brief visit to
a gathering of radio talk show hosts in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to remind him -- he knows this, I know it -- that
there's a lot we agree on, like Social Security reform,
governmental reform, education reform,'' Bush told WOR-AM radio.
''And I'm going to talk to him about the general election,
hopefully he'll campaign with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush would like to gain the support of his defeated but still
popular primary opponent, who has not endorsed the presumptive
Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's supporting me, and I appreciate that,'' Bush said. ''He's
a straightforward person. When he says he wants me to be the
president, I'm confident he does want me to be the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But relations between the men's camps have been strained since
McCain suspended his campaign last month.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his advisers were irritated by Bush's announcement
that he would ask the Arizona senator in their first face-to-face
meeting since the primaries whether he was willing to serve as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said repeatedly that he doesn't want the job, and
told aides to cancel the meeting unless they could be assured that
Bush wanted to hold substantial talks on a variety of topics.
</P>
<P>
   An agenda agreed upon by the two campaigns on Friday was said to
include McCain's signature issue of campaign finance overhaul along
with military reform, Social Security, education, health care,
making the GOP more inclusive and McCain's role in the fall
campaign and the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, to be held in Pittsburgh, will be important to the
political fortunes of both Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Resolution Renewal Urged  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Diplomats said Saturday they would
recommend that the U.N. Security Council renew a resolution
governing Kosovo when plans for the province's future come under
review in June.
</P>
<P>
   Anwarul Chowdhury of Bangladesh, the head of a mission of eight
diplomats who wrapped up a visit to Kosovo on Saturday, said the
U.N. mission was doing ''good work.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It needs our backing in the Security Council,'' he said. ''No
useful purpose will be served by adapting or changing'' the
resolution governing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Chowdhury's remarks came on the same day that French
peacekeepers clashed with rioting Serbs in the ethnically divided
city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council resolution governing Kosovo was adopted
last year after NATO launched a 78-day air attack to halt Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's oppression of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution established a peacekeeping operation, but said
only that the goal was to establish ''substantial autonomy and
self-government'' pending ''a final settlement'' of the province's
status.
</P>
<P>
   For Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's
people, the only acceptable ''final status'' is independence. Serbs
still see their future as part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The top U.N. representative in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, has
asked the Security Council to set clear goals.
</P>
<P>
   In another reminder of the fragile nature of peace in Kosovo,
French peacekeepers clashed with hundreds of Serbs on Saturday in a
suburb of Kosovska Mitrovica, touching off a melee that destroyed
one U.N. police car and damaged 17 other U.N. vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The riot began after peacekeepers brought about 80 ethnic
Albanians to the predominantly Serb, northern part of the town to
visit the homes they had fled last year. A standoff developed
between the two groups, after the Serbs claimed that some of the
Albanians were not former residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sent some soldiers to keep the situation quiet,'' said Lt.
Mathieu Mabin, a spokesman for French forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes started after the new troops moved in.
</P>
<P>
   By late evening Saturday, the French peacekeepers were seen
regrouping while much of the Serb crowd dispersed. Tensions
remained extremely high, however, with a potential for more
violence overnight.

<HEADLINE> NJ getting less federal research dollars, study finds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST WINDSOR, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey is slipping in the amount
of federal research dollars coming to the state's academic
institutions and businesses, according to a new study by Rutgers
University.
</P>
<P>
   While New Jersey is the ninth most populous state, the study
found it slipped from 15th to 16th in federal research and
development funding between 1995 and 1997, the period examined. New
Jersey's funding share dropped from $891 million to $877 million
over that time.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rush Holt, D-Pennington, who hosted a presentation on the
study at the Sarnoff Corp. here Wednesday with business, academic
and state officials, pledged to lobby for more funding to help New
Jersey keep its role as ''The Research State.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This report gives us marching orders to capture more federal
resources for research and development -- the engine of our stunning
economic growth of the past seven years,'' said Holt, the former
assistant director of the Princeton University Plasma Physics
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jersey is doing exceptionally well in some areas, but we
need a balanced portfolio. We are not getting our fair share of
federal dollars, and it's time that we did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The slumping federal investment was balanced by a 35 percent
increase in research spending in the private sector. New Jersey
companies spent $11.07 billion on research in 1997, up from $8.2
billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that was attributed to higher spending by New Jersey's
many pharmaceutical, biotechnology and telecommunications
businesses. But despite the health of the state's drug and biotech
sectors, New Jersey facilities got a mere 1.2 percent of the grants
distributed by the National Institutes of Health in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that NASA trimmed its funding to
businesses from almost $200 million in 1995 to $94.7 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The plasma physics laboratory, a federal Department of Energy
facility that is one of the state's premier research centers, saw
its funding fall $10 million during the period.
</P>
<P>
   The state's universities fared particularly poorly. Rutgers led
the pack, ranking 69th in federal funding with $69.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey came in
80th at $59.8 million, with Princeton University in between.
Princeton ranked 71st with $69 million -- not counting funding for
the plasma physics lab and other federally funded research centers
there.
</P>
<P>
   Holt and the other officials discussed strategies to bring New
Jersey more federal research funding, agreeing to meet regularly in
coming months to develop a specific plan.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, a member of the House Budget Committee, said he will again
push for passage of the pending Federal Research Investment Act,
which would double the federal government's rate of R&AMP;D funding
over a 10-year. That bill, which has passed the Senate, calls for
funding of almost $68 billion by fiscal year 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Holt also said the federal research and development tax credit,
recently extended for five years, should be made permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to stop stringing companies along and make this tax
credit permanent so companies can depend on it when they plan for
the long-term,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Abu-Jamal Delivers Peaceful Speech  </HEADLINE>
By ANDY RESNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio (AP) -- A death row inmate convicted of
killing a police officer spoke by audiotape to Antioch College's
graduating class Saturday as hundreds protested nearby, including
the murder victim's widow.
</P>
<P>
   Students last month invited Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted in 1981
of killing Philadelphia policeman Daniel Faulkner, to give the
commencement address at the small private college, about 15 miles
east of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't talk about his case, the death penalty or policemen in
his six-minute taped speech. Rather, he softly spoke of the impact
one person can have on the world, the topic students had requested,
using Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X, W.E.B. DuBois and Angela Davis as
examples.
</P>
<P>
   ''We admire these people because, at critical times of their
lives, they cast their lot with the poor, the oppressed,''
Abu-Jamal said. ''Their lives have extended what freedom means ...
You at Antioch are in similar positions... show your admiration for
them by becoming them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just yards away from the outdoor ceremony, blue, yellow and
orange police tape strung from trees marked off separate spaces for
widow Maureen Faulkner and her supporters, media members, and
Abu-Jamal's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am ashamed of the students of Antioch,'' Maureen Faulkner
said before the ceremony. ''It is wrong that they are having a
murderer as their commencement speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're young and they have not experienced anything in the
world. God forbid they ever lose a loved one for murder and they
stand in my shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner's group silently protested Abu-Jamal's speech, and
turned their backs and left as Abu-Jamal's tape began playing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 100 graduating seniors listened to the
speech with their heads bowed and hands folded in their laps. As it
ended, some students gave Abu-Jamal a standing ovation. Others
remained in their seats and refused to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal, 45, repeatedly has proclaimed his innocence. His
supporters believe he was targeted for political reasons and framed
because he was an outspoken radio journalist and former activist.
Groups nationwide have called for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   During an off-campus memorial for the slain officer, Michael
Lutz, president of the Pennsylvania State Lodge of the Fraternal
Order of Police, criticized the school's invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''They send a wrong message to society by inviting the bad
element instead of the good,'' Lutz said. ''If this college had any
real values, they would instead be directing their students to help
the victims of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal also spoke via audiotape at a graduation ceremony last
year at Washington's Evergreen State College. A student group at
Kent State University in northeast Ohio plans to have a 10-minute
taped speech by Abu-Jamal played at an event marking the 30th
anniversary of the Ohio National Guard shootings May 4, 1970, that
killed four students and injured nine.

<HEADLINE> Archbishop of Canterbury in Sudan  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey,
the spiritual leader of the Anglican Church, met Saturday with the
government on problems faced by the country's minority Christians,
who have waged a 17-year civil war for more rights.
</P>
<P>
   Carey, who arrived late Friday on a four-day visit, is carrying
a strong message of support and encouragement for the Christians, a
statement issued by Lambeth Palace, the archbishop's office, said.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese officials said he met with Social Planning Minister
Gotby el-Mahdi for more than 40 minutes. The meeting ''stressed the
importance of dialogue and coexistence between Muslims and
Christians,'' a ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It said the two reviewed ''peace issues in Sudan as well as the
negative aspects of the (civil) war and the exodus of citizens to
the north.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, Carey led prayers at camp on the outskirts of
the capital, Khartoum, for refugees displaced by the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million people have died in fighting and
accompanying famines since rebels from the predominantly Christian
and animist south took up arms in 1983 to press for autonomy from
the Muslim-dominated north. Christians form 16 percent of Sudan's
29 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Carey also met with Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail, but no details were available.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is Carey's third to Sudan since he became head of the
Anglican Church in 1991. On previous visits he has condemned
discrimination against Sudan's Christian communities.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 7, Cubs 4  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Erubiel Durazo drove in the
game-winner with a two-run single in the 10th inning Saturday as
the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Chicago Cubs 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 4, Durazo grounded a 2-2 pitch just past
first baseman Mark Grace's outstretched hand and into the outfield,
scoring Bernard Gilkey and Kelly Stinnett.
</P>
<P>
   And the Diamondbacks weren't done. Rick Aguilera walked Hanley
Frias and Jay Bell to force in another run.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks wouldn't have even needed Durazo's extra-inning
heroics, but Henry Rodriguez hit a pinch-hit, two-run homer in the
bottom of the ninth off Matt Mantei (1-0) to tie the game at 4. It
was Rodriguez's seventh homer of the season, and they've all come
in the last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan pitched the 10th for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Colbrunn had given the Diamondbacks almost all of the
offense they needed, hitting a solo homer and driving in another
run. He went 4-for-4 and came within a double of hitting for the
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn had a chance at the cycle in the eighth inning, but
Cubs reliever Brian Williams walked him on a 3-2 count. He got
another chance in the 10th, but fell short with another single. It
was the fifth four-hit game of Colbrunn's career.
</P>
<P>
   After Rodriguez tied the game, Colbrunn led off the 10th with a
single off Mark Guthrie (2-2) and was then replaced by the swifter
Travis Lee, who moved to second on Steve Finley's sacrifice bunt.
Mark Guthrie walked Bernard Gilkey intentionally, and then got in
trouble when he skipped his fifth pitch to Kelly Stinnett in the
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The ball hit the edge of the plate and took a wild bounce,
allowing Lee and Gilkey to advance. Guthrie then walked Stinnett
intentionally, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for Guthrie, who was replaced by Rick Aguilera. The
Cubs got Lee out at home on a fielder's choice, but Joe Girardi's
throw back to first wasn't in time and pinch-hitter Lenny Harris
reached to keep the bases loaded for Durazo.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Anderson and the Diamondbacks had kept the Cubs in check
all game, allowing just two extra-base hits in the first eight
innings. But trailing 4-2 with one out, Girardi reached when Luis
Gonzalez dropped what should have been a routine catch.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for Anderson, who gave up three runs -- two of them
earned -- and eight hits in 8 1-3 innings. Mantei came in to
relieve, and Rodriguez didn't waste much time taking him deep.
</P>
<P>
   He put a 2-1 pitch into the backdrop in center field, tying the
game at 4. It was only the second pinch-hit homer of his career,
and the Cubs' first pinch-hit home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Young stole his 300th base Saturday, stealing third in the
first inning. Young has five stolen bases so far this season. ...
Gutierrez, who leads the majors in sacrifice bunts, got his ninth
in the first inning. That's the most for a Cub position player
since Doug Glanville's nine sac bunts in all of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy 1, MetroStars 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Simon Elliott scored in first-half
injury time Saturday and the unbeaten Los Angeles Galaxy made it
stand up for a 1-0 victory over the New York-New Jersey MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   The victory boosted the Galaxy to 5-0-2, while the MetroStars
slipped to 2-5.
</P>
<P>
   Each team had its best scoring chance right before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's goal came 1:20 into injury time, when Ezra
Hendrickson ran onto a pass from Cobi Jones on the right and
crossed the ball. Both Joe Franchino and MetroStars defender Steve
Shak tried to get a head on the ball but it went to the foot of
Elliott, lurking wide of the far post.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott took the ball down and tucked his left-footed shot
between goalkeeper Mike Ammann and the near post.
</P>
<P>
   A minute earlier, the MetroStars' Mark Chung took a through pass
from Peter Villegas and saw his left-footed shot from 15 yards hit
off the inside of the right post and carom harmlessly across the
goal mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars pushed forward aggressively in the final 20
minutes, trying to tie the game. Brian Kelly sent a shot just wide
of the L.A. goal in the 72nd minute, while in the 74th, Villegas'
bicycle kick went just over the Galaxy crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Ammann kept the MetroStars in the match by saving a penalty kick
by Greg Vanney with seven minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Oft-injured MetroStars midfielder Tab Ramos played for the first
time since July 10. He entered at halftime, replacing Shak, who had
played every minute (589) of every game this season. Ramos' shot
with a minute remaining flew wide right of the goal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sweeps 'World' Penn Relays  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The United States conquered ''the world'' --
and a world record -- at the Penn Relays on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Competing against teams from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, the
American relay teams, with Marion Jones, Maurice Greene and Michael
Johnson running sizzling anchor legs, swept the men's and women's
400-, 800- and 1,600-meter events.
</P>
<P>
   Those relays were billed as ''USA vs. the World,'' and the
Americans, always powerful in the sprints, again showed their
prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Their most impressive performance came in the women's 800, where
the USA team raced to a world record of 1 minute, 27.46 seconds.
That shattered the previous mark of 1:28.15 set by an East German
team 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the 1999 world champion at 100 meters, also brought the
USA women's team to victory in the 400 relay in 42.33, breaking
Franklin Field and Penn Relays records.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the world record-holder and two-time world champion in
the 100, keyed the men's 400 relay team to stadium and meet records
of 38.22, while the 800 team ran 1:19.92.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the men's 800 team was overshadowed by TCU, which
won the collegiate relay at 1:19.67, breaking its NCAA mark of
1:20.20 set in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the world record-holder and Olympic gold medalist in
the 200 and 400, powered the USA team to victory in the 1,600 relay
at 2:56.60, the fastest in the world this year and the fastest ever
at Franklin Field. The USA women, with Jearl Miles Clark anchoring,
completed the sweep, winning the women's 1,600 relay at 3:25.96.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was awesome,'' Jones said of the oldest and best-attended
of the nation's relay carnivals. ''I was excited about running here
and today did not disappoint, to be with two relay teams and
finishing with a world record.''
</P>
<P>
   The 800 team of LaTasha Jenkins, LaTasha Colander-Richardson,
Nanceen Perry and Jones did not find out the team's composition
until shortly before the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as we found out who was running, we all whispered in
each other's ears and said, 'Let's get that record,''' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no doubt about it. After Jenkins, Colander-Richardson
and Perry gave the Americans a commanding lead, Jones got the baton
and blazed the final 200.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was exciting,'' Jones said. ''When I got the baton, with
the crowd oohing and aahing, I wanted to bring it home.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic crowd of 45,203, which chanted ''USA! USA!
USA!'' every time an American team came onto the track, was the
third-largest in the 106-year history of the event. The three-day
total of 102,193 was the largest ever and the first over 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The women's 800 team won by more than five seconds over another
USA team.
</P>
<P>
   The winning 400 relay team of Chryste Gaines, Torri Edwards,
200-meter world champion Inger Miller and Jones broke the field and
meet records of 42.51 set by an Adidas team in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the men's 400 relay, the USA team of Jon Drummond,
Tim Harden, Tim Montgomery and Greene smashed the field record of
38.61 set by a U.S. national team in 1980 and the meet record of
38.66 set by a Nike team in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The winning 800 team consisted of Ken Brokenburr, Bryan Howard,
Rohsaan Griffin and Greene.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 1,600 relay, Johnson was preceded by Angelo Taylor,
Antonio Pettigrew and Tyree Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today wasn't about getting a record,'' Johnson said, after the
USA team missed the world record by less than three seconds. ''This
was just an opportunity to entertain the crowd and have fun.
Mission accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 1,600 relay, Miles Clark, a two-time Olympic
medalist in the event, followed Suziann Reid, Michelle Collins and
Kim Graham.
</P>
<P>
   All six USA teams ran without having practiced together.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you saw today ... shows the depth of sprinting we have in
the U.S.,'' Drummond said. ''If we had had some exchanges together,
I think you might have seen a world record.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene said he did not feel much of the soreness throughout his
body which had forced him to skip the recent Texas Relays and Mount
SAC Relays.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming to the Penn Relays and running two races says he's
ready to go,'' Drummond said about Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The USA's opposition in the four relays included teams from
Jamaica, Sierra Leone, Thailand, Nigeria and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's record-setting 800 relay team consisted of Lindel Frater,
Ricardo Williams, Darvis Patton and Kim Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The same foursome won the 400 relay at 39.06, and TCU became the
first team since Arizona State in 1977 to win all three sprint
relays, capturing the 1,600 at 3:05.76.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to love this,'' Patton said. ''It's electrifying.
The crowd is great.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina women won their first two titles at the Penn
Relays, taking the 800 relay in 1:31.01, breaking stadium and meet
records, and the 1,600 relay in 3:30.04.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas' women also earned their first Penn Relays title,
winning the distance medley championship in 10:55.00, with a team
anchored by Tracy Roberston.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the Arkansas men, the most dominant team at
the relays during the 1980s and 1990s, won their 34th title and
second of the meet, taking the four-mile championship in 16:08.81,
the second-fastest in meet history, as James Karanu anchored.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Ellerbe set an American record of 231 feet in the women's
hammer throw, breaking her mark of 230-2.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Mark Boswell, the NCAA indoor and outdoor high jump
champion, set a meet record in winning at 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included Ohio State's Donica Merriman in the
women's 100 hurdles with a meet-record 12.70; South Carolina's
Terrence Trammell in the men's 110 hurdles in 13.34; Florida's
Bernard Williams in the men's 100 with a wind-aided 10.11; and
South Alabama's David Kimani in the Olympic Development men's mile
in 3:57.07.

Cuban-Americans March Peacefully for Elian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban-Americans still angry over last week's early morning
seizure of Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami relatives marched
peacefully through Miami's Little Havana today, hoping to send a strong message
to the federal government. Police stayed visibly distant from the chanting
demonstrators, many of whom carried signs denouncing President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno for taking Elian from his Miami relatives and
sending him to his Cuban father. The boy is now living with his father,
stepmother and half brother at the rural Wye River retreat in Maryland. He must
remain in the United States until a federal appeals court rules on the Miami
relatives' bid for him to have an asylum hearing.

Bush Optimistic About McCain Meeting
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Texas Gov. George Bush said today he hopes to find common
ground with defeated presidential rival John McCain in a meeting McCain almost
canceled because of disagreements over the agenda. Bush would like to gain the
support of his still popular primary opponent, who has not endorsed the

McCain has said repeatedly that he doesn't want the job.

Note Found in Pa. Suspect's Home

<P>
   MOUNT LEBANON, Pa. (AP) -- Authorities trying to explain what may have
motivated a 34-year-old immigration lawyer to allegedly go on a shooting spree
that left five people dead yesterday say a two-page note found in the man's home
holds some clues. Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr. refused
to say what the note contained, but he said the words -- believed to have been
typed by suspect Scott Baumhammers -- are relevant to determining whether the
shootings were hate crimes. Five people died in the attacks.

   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- From a garrison of sandbags and barbed
wire, a new Vietnam of high-rises and high-tech celebrates the 25th anniversary
of the end of the war in a festival of song, speeches, fashion shows and mass
weddings. Ho Chi Minh City's wide boulevards were bathed in a rainbow of the
bright colors of spring -- red, blue, yellow and purple. Trees, utility poles
and street corners were festooned with the flags of Vietnam and the Communist
Party, and with placards marked in large numbers ''30.4,'' April 30, the day
Saigon died.

Abu-Jamal Delivers Commencement Speech

   YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio (AP) -- A death row inmate convicted of killing a police
officer spoke by audiotape to Antioch College's graduating class today as
hundreds protested nearby, including the murder victim's widow. Students last
month invited Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted in 1981 of killing Philadelphia
policeman Daniel Faulkner, to give the commencement address at the small private
college, about 15 miles east of Dayton. He didn't talk about his case, the death
penalty or policemen in his six-minute taped speech. Rather, he softly spoke of
the impact one person can have on the world, the topic students had requested.

Foreigners Seek German Tech Jobs
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Foreigners are already jumping at a German proposal
to bring computer experts from abroad to fill high-tech jobs, even though the
plan has yet to be approved, a newspaper said Saturday. Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder last month proposed setting up a green card system similar to that in
the United States to allow up to 20,000 qualified foreigners work in Germany for
up to five years. Technology companies have begged for Schroeder's help to ease
what they say is a 75,000 worker shortfall.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in Workplace Poisoning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   POCATELLO, Idaho (AP) -- An industrialist who last year became
the only employer ever convicted on federal charges of knowingly
exposing a worker to hazardous waste received a 17-year prison term
for the crime that left the worker severely brain damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Elias, who owned Evergreen Resources Inc., was sentenced
late Friday by U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill. Elias also must
pay $5.9 million in restitution, the judge ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The prison sentence is apparently the harshest ever imposed for
an environmental crime in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sentence adequately reflects the danger Mr. Elias posed to
the community and one individual in particular,'' Winmill said
after the day-long hearing. ''I hope it will deter Elias and other
similarly situated individuals in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias, 61, was convicted in May 1999 of ordering Scott Dominguez
to wash down a 11-foot-high, 36-foot-long, 25,000-gallon tank
containing phosphoric acid and cyanide, a combination that produces
a gas the Nazis used in their World War II death camps.
</P>
<P>
   Elias was handcuffed and immediately led away by federal
marshals. He had been free on bond under electronic monitoring up
until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, 23, collapsed in the tank in August 1996 and could
not be rescued for an hour. He suffered severe brain damage and
requires extensive care. Elias had provided no safety training and
did not give Dominguez or other workers the required protective
clothing or breathing gear.
</P>
<P>
   ''No sentence can ever restore what Scott and his family have
lost,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Derden. ''But I hope
they'll take some comfort in knowing that Mr. Elias will pay dearly
for his crimes and that others may be protected from a similar fate
by the court's action.''
</P>
<P>
   After declining to testify during his 3{-week trial a year ago,
Elias spent over two hours on the stand Friday, repeatedly
maintaining that Dominguez was the victim of a tragic accident for
which he bore no responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Keeps Up Fight for Elian Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Pressing a national campaign to return Elian
Gonzalez to his communist homeland, thousands of government
supporters rallied Saturday in central Cuba to protest the boy's
continued stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Raul Castro, the chief of Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces
who is also President Fidel Castro's brother, stood in the front
row of protesters at a gathering in Ciego de Avila, about 250 miles
east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The rally came as tens of thousands of Cuban-Americans were
winding up a very different kind of march in Miami -- one protesting
the U.S. government raid a week before that seized Elian from his
Miami relatives and reunited him with his father in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Shown live on state television, the rally in Cuba was the latest
of scores -- perhaps hundreds -- of large gatherings held since early
December, when President Castro called for mass demonstrations to
be held until Elian returns to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The rallies have been effective in involving Cuban children and
young adults in national politics. They also have been used to
attack a variety of U.S. policies toward the island, including a
nearly four-decade trade embargo aimed at punishing the communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the large rallies were held in Havana, but now they
are held each weekend in a different province of the island.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, a live ''informative roundtable'' is now held almost
every weeknight and broadcast live on national television to update
Cubans on developments in the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's rally was more festive and less strident than others
in recent weeks, evidently reflecting the more relaxed attitude
most Cubans have toward the case since Elian was reunited with his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Especially large gatherings are planned across the island for
Monday's May Day celebrations, which will be dedicated this year to
the fight to return Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The father and son are to stay in the United States pending a
May 11 hearing by a federal appeals court in Atlanta on the Miami
relatives' request for a hearing on whether to grant political
asylum to the child.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEALDSBURG, Calif. (AP) -- Helen Eileen Beardsley, a mother of 20
whose story was made into a 1960s movie starring Lucille Ball, died
Wednesday after suffering from Parkinson's disease for 10 years.
She was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Beardsley wrote a book about her brood called ''Who Gets the
Drumsticks?'' It was later made into the movie ''Yours, Mine and
Ours,'' which also starred Henry Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Born Helen Eileen Brandmeir in Seattle, she married Lt. Richard
North in 1949 and the couple had eight children. North died in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   She married Navy Chief Warrant Officer Francis Beardsley, a
widower with 10 children, in 1961. In 1963, her husband adopted her
eight children, the largest adoption to date in California.
</P>
<P>
   The Beardsleys also had two children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the size of their household, the Navy listed the
Beardsleys as a restaurant, allowing them to buy food at wholesale
prices at the Fort Ord Army Base commissary. The family bought 50
loaves of bread at a time.
Antonio Buero Vallejo
</P>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spanish playwright Antonio Buero Vallejo,
known for his opposition to the country's fascist dictatorship,
died Saturday of complications from a stroke. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Buero, a left-wing militant in Spain's 1936-39 Civil War, was
best known for his 1949 play ''History of a Stairway.'' His latest
work, ''Mission to the Desert People,'' was performed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Buero was sentenced to death in 1939 for his involvement with
leftist forces in the Civil War won by Gen. Francisco Franco's
fascists, but his sentence was commuted in 1946. Franco ruled Spain
until his death in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Buero was the recipient of the Cervantes Award, Spain's most
prestigious literary award, and Spain's National Theater Award.
Gregory Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   BELCHERTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Gregory Gillespie, an artist known for
an obsessive attention to realistic detail, has died in an apparent
suicide. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   ''He lost a lifelong battle with mental illness,'' his widow,
the author Peggy Gillespie, said Friday. ''He was suffering from
post-retrospective depression.''
</P>
<P>
   She found her husband's body hanging in his studio late
Wednesday night, said Robert Fishko of the Forum Gallery, where the
artist often exhibited his work.
</P>
<P>
   The retrospective, a traveling show of three decades' worth of
Gillespie's work, appeared at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology List Visual Arts Center in Cambridge last fall.
</P>
<P>
   His works are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art and the Smithsonian Institution, as well as Boston's
Museum of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie, who was at the heart of the group of western
Massachusetts painters who became known as Valley Realists, studied
art at New York's Cooper Union in the 1950s, the apex of Abstract
Expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie painted landscapes, street scenes, portraits, and
sexual and religious allegories in a shifting range of styles.
Continuity was provided by a sense of unflinching scrutiny that
often gave his work a disturbing edge.
Charlie Park
</P>
<P>
   WARREN, Ark. (AP) -- Charlie Park, a veteran Arkansas
broadcaster, died Thursday of complications from diabetes and heart
disease. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Park was news director of Crossett radio station KAGH for 20
years until retiring in March because of his illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Born Nov. 3, 1933, in Flint, Mich., Park began his broadcasting
career working with his father in Detroit. His wife, Carol Park,
said her husband spent 48 years in the field, moving to Arkansas in
1979 to work for KAGH.
Harriet Rheingold
</P>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Harriet L. Rheingold, a professor
emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and one
of the nation's most prominent developmental psychologists, died
Saturday. She was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Rheingold received national recognition for her research on the
social and exploratory capacities of infants and young children.
</P>
<P>
   Rheingold, who did not begin her research career until she was
45 after two decades in patient care and undergraduate teaching, is
credited with helping change the way psychologists perceive normal
infant behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Her views helped shape widespread understanding that an infant
plays an active role in his environment from birth. Her studies
include ''The Infant Separates Himself from Her Mother,'' published
in 1970.

<HEADLINE> Mock Same-Sex Weddings Staged  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Olivia Durant waited three years to profess
her love for her partner, Sabrina Beach. Since they are not able to
legally exchange marriage vows, they thought taking part in a giant
mock wedding ceremony would be the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from a victory that granted homosexuals marriage-like
rights in Vermont, Durant and Beach joined hundreds of other
couples Saturday on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in a bid to
press even wider acceptance for civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said about 1,000 same-sex couples exchanged rings and
vows in front of friends, family and about a dozen protesters, part
of a weekend-long rally for gay, lesbian and bisexual rights
culminating in Sunday's Millennium March on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're so happy right now,'' said Durant, of Rochester, N.Y.
''But I hope someday, same-sex marriages will be legal. We've joked
about moving to Vermont because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the fourth gathering on the Mall by gay and lesbian rights
groups in the last 21 years. It tops a busy period for activists,
who earlier this week had praise for the new law in Vermont and for
President Clinton's renewed call to Congress to pass the stagnant
Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and critics have also verbally clashed at the Supreme
Court, where on Wednesday the justices heard arguments over whether
the Boy Scouts can bar a homosexual from serving as a troop leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just like any other family. We get up, we go to work,''
said Pam Lessard, of Melbourne, Fla., who wore a white-laced veil
on her head as she waited for the ceremony to start. ''We are the
same as'' heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be an honor for members of the gay community and their
allies to stand before the Lincoln Memorial, this great American
symbol of freedom, and demand equal rights,'' said the Rev. Troy
Perry, moderator of the Universal Federation of Metropolitan
Community Churches, who performed the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Other events on Saturday included a concert featuring Garth
Brooks and Melissa Etheridge, and the unveiling of new panels to
the AIDS memorial quilt on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's event, particularly Sunday's march, have been
criticized by anti-gay groups, and gay and lesbian advocacy groups
who contend there was not enough outreach to grassroots
organizations and people of color.
</P>
<P>
   ''The march's purpose, insensitive elitism, is not our purpose.
Our purpose will not be advanced by the Millennium March on
Washington,'' said Ed Brown, co-chairman of the National
Association of Black and White Men Together.
</P>
<P>
   Six protesters carrying signs such as ''Repent or Perish'' and
''Got AIDS Yet'' taunted supporters and drew the attention of
police from across a roadway in front of the memorial. Some got
into face-to-face arguments with supporters before police separated
them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Park Police said there were no arrests in connection with
Saturday's events.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of protesters, led by Anthony Falzarano of Falls
Church, Va., tried to tell gays and lesbians of a network of
''ex-gay'' groups filled with people who realized ''they could
change.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here today to be compassionate to homosexuals,'' said
Falzarano who said he left a gay lifestyle in 1983. ''We know what
it's like to be misunderstood. So we're here to tell any homosexual
out there it's OK not to be gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope to draw 300,000 people for the march Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the same benefits that legally married couples have,''
John Catania, of New York said after exchanging vows with his
partner. ''You want the country to be better, and recognizing this
in law makes the country better.''

<HEADLINE> Gustafson Leads At Chick-fil-A  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKBRIDGE, Ga. (AP) -- Sophie Gustafson is letting golf do her
talking at the Chick-fil-A Charity Championship, maintaining a
two-shot lead after the second round Saturday as she closes in on
her first LPGA Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson, a 26-year-old Swede who struggles with a severe
speech impediment, shot a 3-under-par 69 at Eagles Landing Country
Club south of Atlanta, pushing her total to 10-under 134.
</P>
<P>
   She is being chased by the biggest name in women's golf. Karrie
Webb, seeking her fifth victory in six tournaments this year,
finished with an eagle at No. 18 and moved within three shots of
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Gustafson wasn't intimidated by her pursuers, which include
Laura Davies and Michelle McGann, both two shots back.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good field,'' the leader said. ''If I can lead here
after two rounds, I know I can win tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the speech problem, it's difficult for Gustafson to
develop close relationships with her fellow golfers. But they know
she is capable of pulling off her first LPGA victory, having won in
Europe and Asia before joining the American tour last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has a tremendous amount of talent,'' Webb said. ''When
she's on, she hits the ball long and extremely straight. Now, I've
also seen her hit it off the planet as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies, who didn't even use a driver in the second round, said
Gustafson ''reminds me of me about 12 years ago. I didn't care
where I hit it as long as I hit it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson, who led by three shots after an opening-round 65,
started out Saturday like she was going to blow the field away. She
birdied three of the first seven holes, never needing to make a
putt longer than 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   But, after hitting a 3-wood within 15 feet for an eagle at the
par-5 13th, Gustafson scrambled to hold the lead as her ball
strayed all over the course.
</P>
<P>
   She made a nice up-and-down at the par-3 16th after hitting her
tee shot in a bunker, pumping her fist when the putt dropped. At
the next hole, her second shot flew past the flag into the back
fringe, where her downhill putt went past the hole again and left a
difficult 15-footer for par. Once again, Gustafson made the putt,
pumping her fist even harder as the ball disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   At 18, Gustafson's tee shot flew into a fairway bunker, then she
found the sand again with her second shot. But she managed to chip
out and two-putt for another par.
</P>
<P>
   ''She had a real gutsy finish,'' said Chuck Hoersch, Gustafson's
caddy. ''Those were a lot of good pars.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb found the creek at 3 for the second day in a row, took out
a chunk of a grass with her club after a poor shot at 6 and was
meandering through an unspectacular round by her standards -- two
bogeys and three birdies -- when she arrived at 18.
</P>
<P>
   But a 4-iron landed 15 feet from the hole, and she curled in the
eagle putt for a 69 and to let everyone know she was still around.
Not that anyone would overlook Webb, who has won four tournaments
this year and finished second in her other event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to get out of a day like this at three under,'' the
Australian said. ''I like my position. I still have to play well
tomorrow. I feel I have to shoot six under to have a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson gave her challengers a bit of hope when she scrambled
for par at the 465-yard final hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Sophie did us a favor when she didn't birdie or maybe
even eagle that hole and get off to a three- or four-shot lead over
everyone else,'' Webb said. ''I feel I need to make birdie at that
hole every time I play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies, who won the Los Angeles Women's Championship in
February, made the biggest charge of the day. The long hitter from
England strung together six birdies from holes 8-16 and finished
with a 6-under 66.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just trying to not make any mistakes,'' said Davies, who
hit all 18 greens in regulation and would have put up an
extraordinary score if she had not missed four putts from 12 feet
and closer. ''I'm not using the driver. I don't need it. I don't
want to put myself in position for bogeys.''
</P>
<P>
   McGann eagled 18 and finished with a 68. Amy Fruhwirth got in
contention by chipping in a 30-yard shot from the rough for an
eagle at 18, leaving her in a tie with Webb at 137.
</P>
<P>
Divots: Blame it on the extra duties: Nancy Lopez, serving as host
of the tournament for the first time, struggled to a 4-over 148.
... Defending champion Rachel Heatherington was 12 shots off the
lead. ... Lorrie Kane, the Chick-fil-A runner-up for two straight
years, was on the fringe of contention at three under.

<HEADLINE> Authenticity Of Ball Questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- No one is questioning that after the 1962
game in which Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points, a teen-ager named
Kerry Ryman ran on to the court and grabbed a basketball.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Ryman, now 52, sold that basketball through an
auction house to a collector for $551,844. No one questions that
either.
</P>
<P>
   What is being questioned is whether the ball Ryman took that
night is the one Chamberlain used to score 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''He may think he has the ball,'' said Harvey Pollack, now a
statistician for the Philadelphia 76ers, ''but myself and a lot of
other people are challenging the authenticity of that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack, who was working for the Philadelphia Warriors when that
game against the New York Knicks was played in Hershey, said
referee Willie Smith took the ball out of the game after
Chamberlain scored his 100th point. Another ball was taken from a
bag beneath Pollack's seat and used for the remainder of the game,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the one the kid took,'' Pollack said. ''The only
problem was that in the last 46 seconds, or however much time was
left, Wilt never touched that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack said the ball Chamberlain used was signed by
Chamberlain, his teammates and several others.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Ryman) said he played with that ball for a while,'' Pollack
said. ''He wouldn't have done that if the ball had signatures all
over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball was then displayed in the Warriors' office in downtown
Philadelphia until the team was sold to a group of San Francisco
investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is: All of the people who worked in that office
are dead,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Warriors memorabilia moved with the team. But a
spokesman for the Oakland, Calf.-based Golden State Warriors said
he had no idea what happened to the Philadelphia Warriors
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Evans, the president of Leland's, the auction house that
sold the ball for Ryman, said he remains convinced that the ball he
sold is the one Chamberlain used.

Former doctor indicted in wife's poisoning
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A former plastic surgeon has been indicted
in the attempted murder of his estranged wife by arsenic poisoning,
his chief attorney confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Joel L. Daniels told The Buffalo News that prosecutors
have advised him of the indictment in the 1999 poisoning of Deborah
Pignataro, 42, who is in a wheelchair with aftereffects of the
poisoning. He did not reveal the specific felony charges lodged by
a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Erie County District Attorney Frank J. Clark refused comment on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels confirmed that Anthony Pignataro, also 42, did not
testify before the grand jury about the arsenic poisoning that
hospitalized the West Seneca housewife for two months and injured
their adolescent son and daughter. Daniels said he expects a court
arraignment within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have consistently maintained that there is no case, and
we're going to fight this indictment and try to get it thrown out
because we believe there isn't any real proof, only imaginary
proof,'' the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week, Pignataro has been serving time in Elmira
Correctional Facility for drinking and using heroin in violation of
probation. He is being held in the reception area while state
prison officials determine where he will serve his current term.
</P>
<P>
   Pignataro lost his medical license over the death of a cosmetic
surgery patient three years ago during a procedure in his office.
</P>
<P>
   On March 13, State Supreme Court Justice Ronald H. Tills ordered
Pignataro to begin a 16-month to four-year prison term on probation
violation charges stemming from the four-month jail term he imposed
two years ago for the death of his patient.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted in the arsenic matter, Pignataro would face an
additional prison term of up to another 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Pignataro and his estranged wife of 15 years both still face a
joint child-neglect trial in Erie County Family Court in June for
allegedly exposing their children to arsenic last year.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe a bowl of soup that immediately sickened
Mrs. Pignataro and her young daughter during the summer of 1999 may
have been of many arsenic-laced meals Mr. Pignataro served.
</P>
<P>
   West Seneca is seven miles east of Buffalo.

<HEADLINE> CIA Said To Know of Bay of Pigs Leak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA was aware that the Soviet Union found
out the date of the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba
more than a week before it took place on April 17, 1961, but went
ahead with the operation anyway, newly declassified intelligence
documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Previously released Soviet documents indicated that Moscow had
learned some details of the operation ahead of time, but the report
from the Taylor Commission shows for the first time that the CIA
knew about the leak and proceeded with the invasion, said Peter
Kornbluh, a senior analyst with the nonprofit National Security
Archive.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the Taylor Commission report had been released in
1977 and 1986. The latest release, which shows newly declassified
information, was supposed to be made public in 1996, but was only
released recently following a bureaucratic mix-up.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was some indication that the Soviets somewhere around
the 9th (of April) had gotten the date of the 17th,'' Jacob
Esterline, the CIA operations official who headed the task force
responsible for coordinating the invasion, testified at a May 1961
commission meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''But there was no indication at any time that they had any idea
where the operation was going to take place,'' Esterline added.
</P>
<P>
   It is unknown exactly how the Soviets found out, but Esterline
said it was not from the Cuban exiles since the exiles were not
briefed on when the invasion would take place until April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Kornbluh said there also was no indication that the CIA informed
President Kennedy of the leak before the invasion took place.
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that CIA director Allen W. Dulles, three
weeks after the failed operation, questioned the agency's role in
future paramilitary operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the first to recognize that I don't think that the CIA
should run paramilitary operations of the type in Cuba,'' Dulles
told the commission. He added that ''the Cuban operation has had a
very serious effect on all our work'' and ''I think we should limit
ourselves more to secret intelligence collection and operations of
the nonmilitary category.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kornbluh, the report also shows that CIA official
Frank Egan, who was in charge of the training camps in Guatemala,
told the commission Cuban leader Fidel Castro had infiltrated four
double agents into the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Although CIA officials limited mail going into and out of the
camp in the weeks leading up the official, Egan said the double
agents apparently got information out to Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The Taylor Commission report is the second government report
made public on the Bay of Pigs. Kornbluh said he filed a Freedom of
Information Act request for the third document, by a CIA historian,
but it has yet to be released.

<HEADLINE> Stanford Wins Distance Medley  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Stanford got the victory it wanted at
the Drake Relays and Suzy Favor Hamilton got her record -- and a
world best to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed after second-place finishes in two relays on
Friday, Stanford came back with a vengeance to win the distance
medley Saturday behind a brilliant anchor from Gabe Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings covered the final 1,600 meters in 3 minutes, 56.5
seconds -- the equivalent of a 3:57.6 mile -- to blow away Tulsa,
Arizona and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came here thinking we were the bomb and we know that,''
Jennings said. ''But things didn't fall into our hands. But we know
who we are. I went to the other guys and was like 'Hey, you know
who you are, man. Remember that.'
</P>
<P>
   ''I think today was an example of remembering that, how good we
really are and can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's redemption came on a breezy, sunny day before a
sellout crowd of 18,000 that saw Favor Hamilton win the 1,500
meters with the fastest time in the world this year by a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Favor Hamilton, competing at that distance for the first time in
14 months, ran her race in 4:05.13, well under the old Drake record
of 4:10.89 by Cindy Bremser in 1985. She had surgery to repair a
torn Achilles' tendon on April 19, 1999, and had not run since
winning the 1,500 at the U.S. indoor championships in early March
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really wanted to get the record and I'm glad I got the
record by five seconds,'' Favor Hamilton said. ''This was a good
stepping stone for me before the Olympic trials. The race felt so
easy. I'm just anxious to see what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The meet's final day also produced a victory by local favorite
Joey Woody in the 400 hurdles and sub-4-minute miles by Clyde
Colenso and Paul McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, the NCAA indoor mile champion, was 15 meters off the
lead in the medley when he got the baton after Ryan Carroll's 800.
He made up the gap quickly and settled into third place behind
Tulsa's Dwight Davis and Arizona's Chris Schaefer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with 1{ laps to go, Jennings blew past Davis and Schaefer
on the backstretch and they had no answer as he built his lead.
Stanford finished in 9:32.86 to win easily, while Tulsa ran 9:40.17
and Arizona 9:42.53.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was like, 'You're feeling it Jennings, you're feeling it
Jennings.' And sure enough, I was feeling it,'' Jennings said.
''When you should be feeling it and you are, things are going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stember ran the opening 1,200 for Stanford and Mark
Hassell did the 400. Stember and Jennings ran on the Stanford
distance medley team that set a world indoor record at the NCAA
meet this year, and the Cardinal had expected to dominate the
distance relays in this meet.
</P>
<P>
   But they were upset by Northern Iowa in the 6,400 Friday and
Stember couldn't hold off Missouri's Derrick Peterson in the 3,200
relay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a lot of motivation from yesterday,'' Carroll said.
''We just wanted to put it away and have no questions we're one of
the best programs out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody, a former Northern Iowa runner who was sixth in the world
championships last year, beat a strong field that included 1996
Olympic gold medalist Derrick Adkins and defending NCAA champion
Bayano Kamani of Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   With a good start, Woody made up the stagger by the second turn,
took the lead on the backstretch and held it, finishing in 48.88.
Woody had lost to Adkins last year after winning in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to come back here and lose again, that's for
sure,'' he said. ''I was just happy to be able to come out and do
something for the fans, get a little revenge for myself, I guess.
Great field they put together, so I was happy about that. It made
me really work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Armstrong of Illinois was second in 49.20 and Adkins was
third in 49.99. Kamani ran 51.02 to finish fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Colenso, a former SMU runner, pulled away from McMullen in the
straightaway to win the mile in 3:59.71. McMullen, the 1998 winner,
was timed in 3:59.97.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's JaWarren Hooker won the 100 (10.28) and the 200
(20.63), and Baylor won the 1,600 relay for the ninth straight year
in 3:05.33. Brandon Counts brought the Bears from 7 meters down
against Oklahoma and anchored in 45.5 after running a 44.2-second
400 in the sprint medley relay.
</P>
<P>
   High jumper Hollis Conway, a two-time Olympic medalist for the
United States, announced his retirement from the sport after
finishing seventh at 6 feet, 9 inches. Conway, the American
collegiate record-holder, won a silver medal in the 1988 Olympics
and a bronze in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's Ashley Wysong outran Stanford freshman Lindsay Hyatt
in the final 100 meters to give the Tigers a victory in the women's
3,200 relay in 8:34.76, the fastest time this year by a college
team.
</P>
<P>
   Korene Hinds and Amy Mortimer, who finished 1-2 in the 3,000
meters at the NCAA indoor meet this year, gave Kansas State
consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
   Hinds passed Nebraska's Liz Biehl and Arizona's Cara Cline in
the final 20 meters for a victory in the sprint medley relay. She
ran her 800 leg in 2:05.6 as the Wildcats finished in 3:50.62.
</P>
<P>
   In the very next event, Mortimer won the 5,000 in 16:14.57 -- the
first time she had ever run the race -- after overcoming a spill
that resulted in a restart and left her with a nasty bruise and
scrape on her left shoulder.

Cuba Keeps Up Fight for Elian Return
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Pressing a national campaign to return Elian Gonzalez to his
communist homeland, thousands of government supporters rallied today in central
Cuba to protest the boy's continued stay in the United States. The rally came as
tens of thousands of Cuban-Americans were winding up a very different kind of
march in Miami -- one protesting the U.S. government raid a week before that
seized Elian from his Miami relatives and reunited him with his father in
Washington. Elian and his father Juan are to stay in the United States pending a
May 11 hearing by a federal appeals court in Atlanta on the Miami relatives'
request for a hearing on whether to grant political asylum to the child.

   MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) -- A man apparently distraught over his wife's
decision to leave him shot and killed her and two others and then killed
himself, authorities said. The woman, who had left her husband several days
earlier, returned to the couple's home outside Detroit with her sister and her
sister's boyfriend this afternoon. Believing they had a hostage situation,
police tried to negotiate with the gunman for several hours but got no response.
About five hours after the boyfriend was shot, SWAT team members saw the bodies
of the gunman and his wife through a back window of the home. The woman's sister
was found dead nearby.

<HEADLINE> Dana Quigley Leads Bruno's Golf  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ZENOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOOVER, Ala. (AP) -- Dana Quigley, whose final-round rally fell
one stroke short last year, made his move a day earlier at the
Bruno's Memorial Classic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley had eight birdies in a 6-under-par 66 and took a
one-stroke lead over Gil Morgan and George Archer. Last year, he
shot a final-round 66 before losing to Larry Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not used to being on top of the leaderboard going into
Sunday,'' said Quigley, who set a Senior PGA Tour record last year
with more than $1.3 million in earnings without a victory. ''This
is unsettled waters for me. I know I'll be nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   He is used to being in the hunt, with four second-place finishes
in 11 events this year.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley lost a stroke off his lead with a bogey on the 18th
hole. The ball sailed wide of the hole and struck a spectator. He
autographed a ball for the woman, then three-putted from the fringe
of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ''I deserved a 6 there, and I got what I deserved,'' Quigley
said. ''It doesn't even dent the good things I did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, who surged into the lead with birdies on the first
three holes, doesn't expect a big letdown in the final round unless
his putting slips up.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I get the putting going, I'll be tough to beat,'' said
Quigley, who had 18 top-10 finishes last year.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan birdied four holes on the back nine in his 67, while
Archer had five birdies and no bogeys in his.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Jenkins, Bob Murphy and first-round leader Larry Nelson were
at 135 after two rounds on the 6,967-yard Greystone Golf Club about
15 miles south of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins had Saturday's best round, a 65.
</P>
<P>
   He had seven birdies and no bogeys, and set the tone by making a
short putt for par on the first hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of those things, when you think back, if you miss
that little putt, it changes the whole day,'' said Jenkins, seeking
for his first win in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today just happened to be one of those days when all my putts
were in the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
Divots: Quigley is the iron man of the senior tour. He's played in
102 consecutive tournaments, and doesn't expect that string to end
anytime soon. ''The only thing that's going to stop it is some
crisis at home for my family,'' Quigley said. ... Two eagles on
back-nine par-5s have kept Nelson in the hunt. On Friday, he eagled
18 and on Saturday it was 15.

<HEADLINE> Injured Berard Attends Leafs Game  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto defenseman Bryan Berard, wearing
sunglasses over his injured right eye, attended the Maple Leafs'
home playoff game on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Berard received a minute-long standing ovation when he was shown
on the center-ice video screen during Game 2 of the Leafs' playoff
series with the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a private suite at the Air Canada Centre, Berard
waved three times to the cheering crowd when he was pictured early
in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   It was Berard's first time at a game since he was clipped in the
right eye March 11 by the stick blade of Ottawa forward Marian
Hossa.
</P>
<P>
   His retina was reattached last month, and the 23-year-old Berard
has been able to detect motion.
</P>

that Bryan was excited about making the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''He misses those guys. He can't wait to be with his teammates
again and help out in any way he can,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs can't wait either.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been on our minds even though he hasn't been here,''
captain Mats Sundin said. ''Every time we walk out of this room, we
see his equipment that is still in his locker.''
</P>
<P>
   One fan brought a sign which read: ''Welcome back Berard.''

<HEADLINE> Dana Quigley Leads Bruno's  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ZENOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOOVER, Ala. (AP) -- Dana Quigley, whose final-round rally fell
one stroke short last year, made his move a day earlier at the
Bruno's Memorial Classic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley had eight birdies in a 6-under-par 66 and took a
one-stroke lead over Gil Morgan and George Archer. Last year, he
shot a final-round 66 before losing to Larry Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not used to being on top of the leaderboard going into
Sunday,'' said Quigley, who set a Senior PGA Tour record last year
with more than $1.3 million in earnings without a victory. ''This
is unsettled waters for me. I know I'll be nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   He is used to being in the hunt, with four second-place finishes
in 11 events this year.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley lost a stroke off his lead with a bogey on the 18th
hole. The ball sailed wide of the hole and struck a spectator. He
autographed a ball for the woman, then three-putted from the fringe
of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ''I deserved a 6 there, and I got what I deserved,'' Quigley
said. ''It doesn't even dent the good things I did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, who surged into the lead with birdies on the first
three holes, doesn't expect a big letdown in the final round unless
his putting slips up.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I get the putting going, I'll be tough to beat,'' said
Quigley, who had 18 top-10 finishes last year.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan birdied four holes on the back nine in his 67, while
Archer had five birdies and no bogeys in his.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Jenkins, Bob Murphy and first-round leader Larry Nelson were
at 135 after two rounds on the 6,967-yard Greystone Golf Club about
15 miles south of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins had Saturday's best round, a 65.
</P>
<P>
   He had seven birdies and no bogeys, and set the tone by making a
short putt for par on the first hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of those things, when you think back, if you miss
that little putt, it changes the whole day,'' said Jenkins, seeking
for his first win in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today just happened to be one of those days when all my putts
were in the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
Divots: Quigley is the iron man of the senior tour. He's played in
102 consecutive tournaments, and doesn't expect that string to end
anytime soon. ''The only thing that's going to stop it is some
crisis at home for my family,'' Quigley said. ... Two eagles on
back-nine par-5s have kept Nelson in the hunt. On Friday, he eagled
18 and on Saturday it was 15.

<HEADLINE> Injured Berard Attends Toronto Game  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto defenseman Bryan Berard, wearing
sunglasses over his injured right eye, attended the Maple Leafs'
home playoff game on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Berard received a minute-long standing ovation when he was shown
on the center-ice video screen during Game 2 of the Leafs' playoff
series with the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a private suite at the Air Canada Centre, Berard
waved three times to the cheering crowd when he was pictured early
in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   It was Berard's first time at a game since he was clipped in the
right eye March 11 by the stick blade of Ottawa forward Marian
Hossa.
</P>
<P>
   His retina was reattached last month, and the 23-year-old Berard
has been able to detect motion.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his agent Tom Laidlaw, Berard flew to Toronto
from his parents' home in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Bethany Berard, Berard's sister, told The Toronto Sun on Friday
that Bryan was excited about making the trip.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 89, Jazz 78  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton insisted all week the Seattle
SuperSonics weren't dead. He and his teammates went out and proved
it Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 30-point performance from Karl Malone, the Sonics
stayed alive in the playoffs with an 89-78 victory over Utah that
cut the Jazz's lead in the best-of-five first-round series to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 will be in Seattle on Wednesday and Game 5, if necessary,
will be in Salt Lake City on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Payton scored nine of his 23 points in the fourth quarter, while
Vin Baker, the Sonics' $87 million power forward who was criticized
for his play in Games 1 and 2, added 15 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, embarrassed by its performances in Utah, outrebounded
the Jazz 46-38 as rookie Rashard Lewis had 14 points and 10
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who shot 8-for-24 from the field, added 10 assists and
seven rebounds in 48 minutes and Utah point guard John Stockton had
just four points.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' 3-pointer from the corner with 5:44 left put the Sonics
in front 76-61. Brent Barry's 3-pointer with 3:43 remaining put the
Sonics ahead 82-62 and he followed that up with another 3 to give
the Sonics an 85-64 lead with 3:06 left.
</P>
<P>
   Barry's lip was bloodied when he was hit by Malone's elbow with
8:14 left and Seattle ahead 68-59.
</P>
<P>
   After two free throws by Malone cut Seattle's lead to 66-59, the
Sonics outscored the Jazz 11-2 with Horace Grant getting the run
started with an 18-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Patterson, who had 13 points, ignited the Sonics in the
third quarter, when they expanded a six-point lead to 64-52.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson hit a 12-foot jumper on a fastbreak as time expired in
the quarter, but his most impressive play in the period came when
he scrambled on the floor to keep the ball alive before scoring on
a putback with 4:27 left. He then made a free throw after being
fouled by Greg Ostertag that gave Seattle a 54-46 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Malone picked up two fouls in 23 seconds
and then was called for a technical with 6:13 left in the period.
He sat out the remainder of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:31 left in the second quarter, Greg Foster of the Sonics
and Armen Gilliam of the Jazz had to be separated by the officials
after getting locked up while Patterson was shooting free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led 40-34 at halftime after scoring the the first
nine points of the second quarter, including a 3-pointer by
Shammond Williams.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Utah coach Jerry Sloan was whistled for a technical foul
with eight minutes gone in the opening period for protesting too
strongly after Stockton was tied up by the Sonics. ... Baker got
the start despite missing some practice time this week because of
the stomach flu.

<HEADLINE> Robert Allenby Leads Houston Open  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE WOODLANDS, Texas (AP) -- Robert Allenby made a move Saturday
to keep the Houston Open title in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby, who started the third round in a three-way tie for the
lead, shot a 4-under-par 68 that included a scare on No. 17 and
held a one-shot lead in the $2.8 million Houston Open.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby, trying to match countryman Stuart Appleby's Houston
Open victory last year, had a 54-hole total of 13-under 203 and the
slim lead over Craig Stadler, who shot a 69.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just like it here,'' Allenby said. ''The courses we play in
Australia are similar and there is great weather here. We just
enjoy playing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hoch played among the contenders all day but bogeyed the
final hole for a 70 and dropped into a tie for third with Fred
Funk, who shot a 69.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby started the day sharing the lead with Loren Roberts and
Stadler at nine under. Roberts shot a third-round 72 and dropped
into a group of six at 207.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby had birdies on Nos. 1 and 6 on the front and added two
more at 13 and 15 to take the lead at 13 under.
</P>
<P>
   He flirted with a bogey on No. 17 when he barely avoided the
water beside the green. His chip from the fringe lipped out and he
made a short putt for par.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a solid day, I didn't go for much,'' Allenby said.
''Obviously, 17 could have been trouble. I was very fortunate with
my second shot and then I nearly chipped it in. I was relaxed and
just went with the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Allenby enjoyed the challenge of the final two holes over the
7,018-yard TPC at The Woodlands course.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seventeen and 18 are very challenging but I like the
challenge,'' Allenby said. ''Tomorrow, someone is going to shoot a
good score. I hope it will be me. I'll stay patient. I can't do any
more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadler birdied his first hole of the day and played solid golf
the rest of the day. He bogeyed No. 9 but got himself in contention
with birdies at 15 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Tied at 206 were Joel Edwards, who shot a 67, Jonathan Kaye, 68,
and Brad Fabel, 69.
</P>
<P>
   ''I drove the ball well today,'' Stadler said. ''I didn't make a
lot of putts. I had a lot of chances, but I hit the ball consistent
throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch started the day one shot behind the leaders and missed a
chance to tie Stadler for second place on the final hole when his
tee shot sailed off the fairway and behind trees.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch's second shot made it through the trees but he ended up
with a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Funk bogeyed No. 17 but came right back with a birdie on 18 when
he came out of the rough and missed a water hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came out right at the pin, which is pretty much water,''
Funk said. ''Somehow, it had to be really close to the edge of the
water and kicked up on the green and ended up being a perfect spot.
I made that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton, the winner last week at Greensboro and the only top
10 money-winner in the field, shot a 71 and was at 4-under 212.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Face Uphill Challenge  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins are doing their best
to mess up Eric Lindros' comeback plans.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, the injured former captain, set the conference finals
as a target date. The Philadelphia Flyers might not advance that
far to make a return possible.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia lost its second straight home game to the Penguins
in the Eastern Conference semifinals and the Flyers head to
Pittsburgh down 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Penguins goalie Ron Tugnutt has a lot to do with Philadelphia's
precarious position.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers took nearly 105 minutes to score a goal against
Tugnutt, who followed a Game 1 shutout with a 43-save effort in
Pittsburgh's 4-1 victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before winning Game 1 on Thursday, the Penguins hadn't won in
Philadelphia since February 1994 and hadn't beaten the Flyers in
five tries this season.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, who hasn't played since March 12, is recovering from
his fourth concussion in two seasons. He was cleared to skate
earlier in the week and said he planned to return for the next
round.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way they're playing and the confidence this team has
heading into the Pittsburgh series, I look forward -- if everything
goes well -- to be able to compete sometime in that third round,''
Lindros said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros might be a series too late.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is one of the best players in the world; I would think that
you miss him a lot,'' Flyers interim coach Craig Ramsay said about
playing without the former captain. ''But that doesn't mean that
this team doesn't compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Top-seeded Philadelphia now must win at least two games in
Pittsburgh after losing the home-ice advantage. Game 3 is Tuesday
night in Pittsburgh, where the Flyers are 3-14-5 in their last 22
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't figure on going to Pittsburgh down 0-2,'' Flyers
center Keith Primeau said. ''Is that a bad thing? Did we get ahead
of ourselves? I don't think so. We need to give them the respect
their due.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh didn't clinch a playoff spot until the final week of
the season and entered as the No. 7 seed before upsetting the
second-seeded Washington Capitals in five games. Meanwhile, the
Flyers eliminated the Buffalo Sabres in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we were overconfident at all,'' Flyers captain
Eric Desjardins said. ''We all respect what kind of team this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie goalie Brian Boucher said, ''We knew going in if we
didn't play well this could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers' woes can be attributed to their inability to score
on the power play. After scoring nine special teams goals against
Buffalo, the Flyers have none against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia was 0-for-8 with the man-advantage Saturday and
Pittsburgh was 2-for-10. The Flyers are 0-for-10 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're doing a great job of creating traffic,'' Primeau said.
''They all collapse. They lay down on the puck, sacrifice their
body and do a great job. They're not allowing us a chance to set
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tugnutt, acquired by Pittsburgh from Ottawa on March 14, has
been superb, stopping 71 of 72 shots this series and a remarkable
224 of 233 shots in the postseason. He already has twice as many
playoff victories this season (6) as he did previously in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers didn't imagine Tugnutt, who had never won a
postseason series, would be this difficult to solve -- especially
after they handled Buffalo's Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who would've thought we'd have an easier time with Dominik
Hasek than with Ronnie,'' Primeau said.

<HEADLINE> Ladies Din Wins S.F. Breeders' Cup  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Calif. (AP) -- In a seemingly never-ending trip, Ladies
Din finally came home a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Running on a sixth different race course in six starts and just
a month removed from a grueling trip to the Middle East, Ladies Din
rallied through the stretch to beat Fighting Falcon by a head in
the $300,000 San Francisco Breeders' Cup Mile Handicap at Golden
Gate Fields on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a tremendous turn of foot. He's a big, tall,
beautiful horse. He was conditioned perfectly. He was just primed
for today and it showed,'' said Kent Desormeaux, who rode the
6-year-old gelding to its ninth career victory in 26 starts.
However, it was the horse's first win in 11 starts since the Oct.
22, 1998, Oak Tree Derby at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies Din covered the mile on the turf in 1:35.46 and earned a
first prize of $150,000, boosting the former claimer's career
earnings to $1,188,304. It was the first race for Ladies Din since
a fifth-place finish March 25 in the $2 million Dubai Duty Free, a
1 1-8 mile turf race in the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Schiappa of Las Vegas, who owns the horse in partnership
with J. Terrance Lanni, said he didn't have concerns about running
the Los Angeles-based Ladies Din so soon after the overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would never have run if he wasn't ready to run,'' Schiappa
said. ''He's an animal. He thrives on this. I'm just happy he won.
This guy is my pet.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiappa bought Ladies Din out of a $32,000 claiming race at Del
Mar on July 30, 1997. Ladies Din won that race as a 16-to-1 shot
and Schiappa came away with $35,000 in winnings from bets he placed
in addition to claiming the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ''You got him for free,'' Desormeaux joked.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Julio Canani, who won the San Francisco mile for the
fourth time, said Ladies Din let him know all along that his
travels -- the horse has run in Dubai, Kentucky and four different
California tracks in the last eight months -- wouldn't pose a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he got off the plane from Dubai, he acted just like a
3-year-old,'' Canani said. ''I told the owners you may think I'm
crazy, but I'm going to run him right back. I don't think it's a
rule all horses have to be affected by an overseas trip. Some may
take two, three or four months but others might bounce right back.
They're all different and I could tell this one was handling it
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux said Ladies Din has been running and coming up just
short against some of the top turf horses in the country but a
return to its favored mile distance coupled with some easier
competition made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was absolutely no difference from how he ran last time
and today. He was full of himself in Dubai,'' Desormeaux said. ''He
ran his guts out. It was just an eighth of a mile too far. A mile
was perfect for him. This guy will give anybody a race at a mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladies Din returned $6.20, $3.20 and $2.60 as the 2-to-1
favorite in the 10-horse field. Fighting Falcon paid $3.60 and
$3.20, and Self Feeder returned $4.40 to show.

Cuban Americans Protest Elian Raid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The streets of Miami's Little Havana today were flooded with
tens of thousands of Cuban Americans who were peacefully protesting the raid in
which armed federal agents yanked 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from the home of
relatives. Police blocked off 23 blocks of the main route along Calle Ocho, or
Eighth Street, and crowds of people, many dressed in black and waving Cuban and
American flags, marched in parade formation. The boy is now living with his
father, stepmother and half brother at the rural Wye River retreat in Maryland.
He must remain in the United States until a federal appeals court rules on the
Miami relatives' bid for him to have an asylum hearing.

   MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) -- A man apparently distraught over his wife's
decision to leave him shot and killed her and two others and then killed
himself, authorities said. Raeann Rice, who told family members that her
husband, Michael Rice, had pulled a gun on her several days earlier, returned to
her home about 1:30 p.m. today with her sister and her sister's boyfriend. About
6:15 p.m., members of a special weapons and tactics team looked in a back window
and saw the bodies of Rice and his wife at the bottom of the stairs. Rice, who
is in his early 30s, had two children with Raeann Rice. Rice also had two

of their income. For a $26 monthly premium, the plan would pay up to $1,000 in
drug costs a year. Republican congressional leaders say the drug coverage should

   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- In a quest for legitimacy that could
mark a new phase in peace efforts, 4,000 fighters and the entire leadership of
Colombia's most powerful rebel army massed here Saturday for the launch of a new
political party. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, also
transported hundreds of civilians by bus and boat from rebel-controlled areas to
a field outside this steamy ranching town in the southern demilitarized zone.
Many analysts think the FARC is seeking to portray itself as a ''Robin Hood''
force, acting on behalf of the masses, though opinion polls consistently show

reported dead in villages around the regional capital, Belet Huen, about 90

<HEADLINE> Diary Said To Oppose Crockett Lore  </HEADLINE>
By AMY STRAHAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) --A diary account claiming that Davy Crockett
was captured and executed at the Battle of the Alamo -- contrary to
Texas folklore -- seems to be authentic, one of the state's leading
archivists said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The diary was written by Lt. Col. Jose Enrique de la Pena, who
served in Santa Anna's army and fought at the Alamo during Texas'
war for independence.
</P>
<P>
   The diary's account of Crockett's death states that he and six
other defenders were captured and executed shortly after the battle
-- a claim that prompted an indignant response from patriotic Texans
after it was first translated in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has long held that the coonskin-capped Crockett fended
off Mexican soldiers with his long-rifle ''Betsy'' during a 13-day
siege before dying near the front doors of the Alamo's chapel on
March 6, 1836.
</P>
<P>
   The facts suggest that the diary is authentic, not a forgery, as
some detractors have claimed, said David Gracy, a University of
Texas archivist studying the book.
</P>
<P>
   Historians gathered Saturday for a panel discussion of the
controversial diary. Alumni purchased the diary and gave it to UT
more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''My colleagues and I were given permission to test the document
in any way we can,'' Gracy said, adding that he has had only three
weeks so far to evaluate it. But so far, the results seem positive,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gracy said the book's paper is consistent with the materials of
the period, and added that watermarks throughout the 680-page
document appear to be authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ''These facts suggest strongly that this person had access to
paper from the Mexican army,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other archivists said Saturday that Pena's account of Crockett's
death is consistent with that of other eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   And they emphasized that the hero's capture shouldn't detract
from his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''De la Pena doesn't say Crockett surrendered,'' said Tom
Kreneck, curator of Special Collections and Archives at Texas A&AMP;M
in Corpus Christi. ''It said he was captured and executed.''

<HEADLINE> Kings Ass't Coach Has Heart Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Basketball Hall of Famer Pete Carril,
an assistant coach with the Sacramento Kings the last four seasons,
had a minor heart attack Saturday, according to team physician Dr.
Jeff Tanji.
</P>
<P>
   Carril, 69, was taken to Sutter General Hospital around 10 a.m.
because he was not feeling well, and was later transferred to
Sutter Memorial Hospital. Both medical centers are in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Tanji said Carril had complained of chest pains and was
diagnosed as being in the early stages of a minor heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Carril, who was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in
1997, was expected to remain at the hospital until next week in
order to get rest and undergo more diagnostic tests, Tanji said.
Carril was listed in stable condition Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all greatly relieved that Pete received successful
treatment,'' said Geoff Petrie, Kings vice president of basketball
operations, who played under Carril at Princeton. ''Visiting with
Pete earlier today I can assure you his spirits are good. We're
looking forward to his speedy recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Carril retired from college coaching in 1996 after one season at
Lehigh and 24 at Princeton. He compiled a 525-273 collegiate record
that included 13 Ivy League championships, 10 seasons of 20 wins or
more, 11 NCAA tournament appearances, and a 1975 NIT championship.
In Carril's final college victory, Princeton upset defending
national champion UCLA 43-41 in the 1996 NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings trail the Los Angeles Lakers 2-0 in their best-of-five
opening-round NBA playoff series. Game 3 is Sunday at Sacramento.

<HEADLINE> NY Mayor To Decide on Senate Run  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. (AP) -- New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who announced last week he has prostate cancer, says he will decide
by the end of May whether to continue his Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's presence in the race has been the only major threat
to first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's first bid for public office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being hit with the news of his cancer Thursday, both
candidates spent Saturday courting the Independence Party, New
York's wing of the national Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Courting third parties is a political necessity in a state where
major party candidates can also run on third-party ballot lines,
but it's also risky business for both Clinton and Giuliani
considering the Reform Party's flirtation with Pat Buchanan as its
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flatly told party members on Saturday she wouldn't share
a ticket with the conservative commentator.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot and will not, as the price for any endorsement,
embrace or excuse those who use hateful rhetoric to separate and
divide,'' she told about 100 members of the Independence Party at a
forum for Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who waited until Friday before agreeing to appear at
Saturday's event, also has concerns about the strong influence of
Lenora Fulani, a leader of the left-wing New Alliance Party, on the
Independence Party. In a strange political marriage, the
left-leaning Fulani is backing Buchanan's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's completely up in the air,'' party official Frank MacKay
said Saturday of the feelings within the party about who the Senate
candidate should be. The Independence Party's state convention will
be held in late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was Giuliani's second day of campaigning since
announcing Thursday that medical tests showed he had prostate
cancer. The cancer was detected early and was treatable, he said,
but that treatment could mean giving up the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has already cut back on his schedule to fit in more
medical appointments, though he told Republicans in Saratoga
Springs and voters in Buffalo this week that he wants to stay in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to run, I'm prepared to do it ... but there's
this other thing that I have to consider,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party, with more than 172,471 members, is the
state's third largest party, followed by the Conservative Party,
with 171,496 members. Both are dwarfed by the Democratic, which has
4.96 million members, and the Republican party with 3.09 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new poll found Giuliani and Clinton in a
statistical dead heat in their race and that the mayor received no
''sympathy bounce'' from his announcement that he has cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post/Fox TV poll of 601 likely voters from around
the state was conducted by Zogby International Friday night and
Saturday. Asked who they would vote for in a race between Giuliani
and Clinton, 43 percent said the mayor and 43 percent picked
Clinton. Most polls conducted before the cancer announcement also
had the pair running even.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Report Admonishes Pakistan on Terror  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A State Department report on terrorist
activities worldwide urges Pakistan to curb armed groups fighting
India for control of the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The admonition is contained in the department's annual report on
terrorism, due to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven countries are on the department's list of nations that
sponsor terrorism: Libya, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Cuba, Sudan and North
Korea. Countries can be added or deleted from the list at any time.
</P>
<P>
   While Pakistan is not on the list, a State Department official
said the report notes that Pakistan is being watched. ''They need
to do better,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, saying it had obtained the full 107-page
report, reported in Sunday editions that in addition to Pakistan,
the latest report is especially critical of Afghanistan for
providing safe haven and support to international terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   The congressionally mandated report, issued each spring, largely
mirrors the comments on Pakistan made by President Clinton when he
visited that country on March 25.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pressed Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani leader, to
ease tensions with India and restrain Islamic militants from moving
across a cease-fire that divides Kashmir between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 10 years militant Muslims have waged a
secessionist insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir, demanding
either outright independence or union with Islamic Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Pakistan must ''create conditions that will allow
dialogue to succeed'' in resolving the Kashmir dispute, which
nearly sparked a war between the two South Asian rivals last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said the report cites Afghanistan as a ''major
terrorist threat'' by, among other things, continuing to shelter
the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, who is wanted in the 1998 bombings
of two U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes some improvements in security in the Middle
East, even though the region remains a source of concern, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it said, the report concludes that the threat of
terrorism now comes less from state-sponsored attacks than from
''loose networks'' of groups and individuals motivated more by
religion or ideology by politics and financed increasingly by drug
trafficking, crime and illegal trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said the report also notes that the weapons of choice
are moving away from car and truck bombs and other explosives and
more toward biological, nuclear, chemical and other ''weapons of
mass destruction,'' as well as ''cyber-terrorism.''

<HEADLINE> Ecumenical Patriarch Observes Easter  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The spiritual leader of the world's
Orthodox Christians celebrated Easter in a candlelit midnight
ceremony in Istanbul on Sunday in front of an unusually large crowd
of worshippers -- mostly Greeks attracted by the recent
rapprochement between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Bus loads of Greek faithful filled the patriarchate, on the
shore of Istanbul's Golden Horn, leaving many outside its gates
during the procession led by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I.
</P>
<P>
   ''Christ has risen,'' the patriarch told a crowd of 2,000 people
as the bells of the gold-encrusted Cathedral of St. George chimed.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hundred people attended the Easter ceremony at the
patriarchate last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was afraid to come here before,'' admitted Katerina Hoidou,
who came with her family from the Greek city of Salonika. ''Now
that the relations are better I decided to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between regional rivals Greece and Turkey have
steadily improved since deadly earthquakes struck Turkey and Greece
last year, leading both peoples to rush aid to each other. The
governments have since pledged to find solutions to their
long-standing disputes -- including territorial disputes in the
Aegean and the division of Cyprus -- which brought the countries to
the brink of war three times in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The rapprochement gave Hoidou the chance she had been dreaming
of, both as a Greek and as an Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy. First of all because this is the church of the
patriarch and because this city is a symbol of Greeks,'' said
Hoidou. Istanbul was the capital of the Greek Byzantine empire
until the Ottoman Turks stormed its gates in 1453. Many Greeks
still call the city by its Greek name, Constantinople.
</P>
<P>
   Easter, the anniversary of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, is
observed by the world's 200 million Orthodox on Sunday. Roman
Catholics and Protestants celebrate Easter a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Bartholomew is considered the first among equals of Orthodox
patriarchs. The Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church split in
the Great Schism of 1054.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgarian and Romanian Orthodox believers also came to Istanbul
to attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very special ceremony with very special feelings,''
said Nicola Gerginsky, a Bulgarian designer from Plovdiv.
</P>
<P>
   Even a bomb attack late Friday that damaged the Turkish Orthodox
Ayayani Church in Istanbul did not affect the crowd. Police defused
two other bombs, one thrown at the church and another in a school
run by the patriarchate, the Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police increased security around churches throughout the city
and policemen stood guard outside the patriarchate during the
celebrations.

raid in which armed federal agents yanked 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from the

marching bands, including one from Lincoln-Marti School, which Elian attended
while living here with his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez. The boy is now living

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) -- A man apparently distraught over his
wife's decision to leave him shot and killed her and two others and
then killed himself, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Raeann Rice, who told family members that her husband, Michael
Rice, had pulled a gun on her several days earlier, returned to her
home about 1:30 p.m. Saturday with her sister and her sister's
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rice's brother told police he was on a couch upstairs
and the four were down in the basement when he suddenly heard
screaming and six gunshots, Mount Clemens police Lt. Brian Krutell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sister's boyfriend, Dane Baetz, stumbled upstairs and threw
a cellular telephone to Rice's brother and said: ''Call 911,''
Krutell said.
</P>
<P>
   The brother ran out of the house. Baetz staggered out and fell
on the front lawn. As police dragged Baetz, two more shots rang
out.
</P>
<P>
   Baetz, 38, was taken to Mount Clemens General Hospital and died
during surgery, hospital spokeswoman Sara Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Police tried to reach the gunman by telephone but could not.
They threw several telephones into the house but got no answer.
Through an intercom on the telephones, all police could hear was
the television, Krutell said.
</P>
<P>
   About 6:15 p.m., members of a special weapons and tactics team
broke down the back door and saw the bodies of Rice and his wife at
the bottom of the stairs. The body of the woman's sister, Lisa
Balaze, 33, was found about 15 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Balaze and Raeann Rice, 31, each were shot in the head in the
same area of the basement, Krutell said. Rice then dragged his
wife's body over to the foot of the stairs, stood over her and shot
himself in the head, authorities. He was found slumped over her.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very bad scene,'' Krutell said. ''Compounding the
sadness of it all is that there's a lot of family members that have
been here the whole time just around the block.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who is in his early 30s, had two children with Raeann
Rice. Rice also had two children from a previous marriage, Krutell
said. None of the children were inside the home at the time of the
shootings.

<HEADLINE> Gore Masters Town Hall Meetings  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore explained his
views on any issue put to him as he wooed voters at a town hall
meeting Saturday, one questioner at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gore's second session with voters in two days. Many
questions were friendly, offering the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee the chance to agree with his inquisitors.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, the Senate ought to pass the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty. Yes, it's crucial to fight for Hispanic needs. No, he
said, putting drug addicts in jail isn't enough -- treatment is also
needed.
</P>
<P>
   But the meetings also gave several hundred voters the chance to
see Gore up close and at length.
</P>
<P>
   One man asked what it meant to be authentic, and Gore responded
with an analysis of why his campaign struggled last fall. The
problem, he said, was acting too much like a vice president and not
enough like a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a change,'' he said. ''I started answering questions
without waiting to analyze what the (administration's) agenda
was.''
</P>
<P>
   William Grimes told Gore that his credibility on campaign
fiannce reform was tainted by his raising money at a Buddist temple
and asked the vice president to give him one example showing
''political courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore reponded with a handful of examples, including his support
for the Persian Gulf War in the Senate when many fellow Democrats
did not and his role in helping fashion a compromise on the MX
missile years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   One girl wanted to know if his job was hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it's hard, but if you believe in what you're doing
then hard work is like fun,'' he said. He added: ''Sometimes the
hours are long.''
</P>
<P>
   The hours were certainly long a day earlier in Albuquerque,
N.M., where participants in a town meeting kept him answering
questions for four hours, a personal record. He didn't finish until
11:15 p.m. local time -- or 1:15 a.m. on his body clock.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to commend your stamina,'' said Roy T. Johnson Jr. as
Gore wrapped things up. ''I can't believe how well you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Town hall meetings, long a favorite of President Clinton, have
become a staple of politics, as candidates demonstrate their
ability to answer any question on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore seems to have mastered the art, displaying the
knowledge of some of the most obscure topics, bantering over who
has the smartest grandson, and steering clear of answers that could
come back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque, Gore agreed with one man that not enough gets
done in Washington but disagreed that eliminating political parties
was the answer.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that more money is needed for health research, but he
declined to endorse a request for a huge increase on diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   And when a man in black leather began explaining the benefits of
drug legalization, Gore shot back, ''I'm not for it,'' a response
that was met with applause from the audience and mock relief from
press aides.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't always win over his questioner.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica McKenzie, 17, asked him about abortion: ''Why is it
illegal to kill a baby five seconds after it's born and not illegal
five seconds before it's born?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore began on safe ground: ''Didn't she do a good job of
presenting her point of view?'' he asked the crowd, which agreed
that she had. He then briefly defended his position that women
should be allowed to choose abortion, but he spent more time
emphasizing that everyone wants to reduce the number of abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he avoided the question,'' Jessica said later.

<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- The Miami Fusion ended their scoreless
drought at 457 minutes but allowed the New England Revolution to
pull even with 21 minutes left as the Eastern Division co-leaders
tied 1-1 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (1-2-4) took the lead in the 52nd minute when midfielder
Henry Gutierrez one-touched an 18-yard shot over New England
goalkeeper Jeff Causey.
</P>
<P>
   New England, 1-0-2 at home and 0-2-2 on the road, tied it when
defender Brian Dunseth headed in a corner kick by John Harkes.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team had a good scoring chance in the two five-minute
overtime periods. It was the third straight overtime match for the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   New England had its best first-half opportunities off indirect
kicks, by Mauricio Ramos in the 13th minute and by Harkes 12
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts also nearly gained the lead a minute into the second
half, but William Sunsing's header off Harkes' corner kick was
knocked off the goal line by Miami defender Martin Machon.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is winless in three road games.

<HEADLINE> Devils 1, Maple Leafs 0  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Martin Brodeur stopped 20 Toronto shots as the
New Jersey Devils evened their second-round playoff series, which
has become a battle of goalies.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Joseph stopped every shot he saw, but was helplessly
screened when Colin White scored the lone goal Saturday night in
New Jersey's 1-0 victory in Game 2 of the best-of-seven Eastern
Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The series switches to New Jersey for games 3 and 4, Monday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, coming off a 32-save performance in Game 1, was the most
tested of the two goalies as Toronto was outshot 33-20. He kept the
Maple Leafs in the game but didn't get any help from a Toronto
offense that had trouble breaking the Devils' heavily-fortified
defensive system.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting their first-period lead, the Devils played with three
and four men stacked across the neutral zone for much of the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's best chance came four minutes into the game when
Wendel Clark broke in alone only to shoot the puck into Brodeur's
chest. The Leafs were unlucky when Tomas Kaberle's shot from the
blue line was deflected on the way to the net and bounced off the
post.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto also squandered a four-minute power-play in the third
period after Jason Arnott drew a double-minor for high-sticking.
The Leafs failed to get a shot on net and have managed just two
goals on 32 power-play chances in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils penalty killers have allowed only one goal in 23
short-handed situations this postseason. Brodeur recorded his
seventh career playoff shutout and first this year.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended Toronto's three-game playoff winning streak, and
was the first the Maple Leafs in five postseason home games.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs continue to have trouble starting sharply as
they have yet to score a first-period goal in their eight playoff
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils ended a six-game winless streak (0-5-1) against the
Maple Leafs, going back to the 1998-99 regular season.
</P>
<P>
   White, with his first career playoff goal, scored 6:41 in when
his rising point shot found the far right upper corner. Joseph had
no chance as he was screened by his own defenseman Danny Markov,
who was chasing a New Jersey forward through the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph came up big 12 minutes into the game when Patrik Elias --
set up by an Alexander Mogilny pass -- blasted a shot off Joseph's
mask. Elias got to the rebound only to have his second shot blocked
by diving defenseman Tomas Kaberle.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny then got to the loose puck and flipped it at the net,
only to have Joseph stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes into the third, Elias deflected a shot towards the
net but it hit Joseph's toe and off the post.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional point of the night came early in the first when
injured Maple Leafs defenseman Bryan Berard, wearing sunglasses
over his damaged right eye, received a minute-long standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a private booth at the game, Berard was shown on the
center-ice video screen, and waved three times to acknowledge the
cheering crowd at Air Canada Centre.
</P>
<P>
   It was Berard's first time at a game since being clipped in the
right eye March 11 by the stick blade of Ottawa forward Marian
Hossa.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tight end Freddie Jones, a restricted free
agent, agreed to a new five-year contract with the San Diego
Chargers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms weren't immediately available.
</P>

touchdowns. Jones was second on the Chargers in receptions last
season, one behind wide receiver Jeff Graham.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 6, Twins 2, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Ben Grieve hit his first career grand slam in
the 10th inning as the Oakland Athletics outlasted Eric Milton and
the Minnesota Twins 6-2 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve's fourth homer of the season, off Eddie Guardado, gave
him five RBIs as the A's won for the fourth time in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Milton allowed two hits in eight innings, retiring the A's in
order in every inning but the fifth. He struck out eight and didn't
allow a walk for the Twins, who lost their third straight.
</P>
<P>
   Guardado (1-1) walked Olmedo Saenz to lead off the 10th and
pinch-runner Rich Becker moved to second on Matt Stairs' single.
Rookie Adam Piatt bunted for a base hit to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve then hit a 2-0 pitch 405 feet to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Mathews (1-1) got four outs for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Milton struck out Oakland's first five batters and was perfect
until Saenz led off the fifth with a hard single.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Piatt hit an RBI triple, and Grieve added a
sacrifice fly to tie it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Cristian Guzman led off the first with a triple and
scored on Denny Hocking's groundout. Torii Hunter hit a sacrifice
fly in the fourth to give the Twins a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Matt Lawton hit a single in the first to extend his
career-best hitting streak to 15 games. Lawton has hit safely in 18
of 19 games and is batting .378 (37-for-98).
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota left 12 runners on base, with Guzman stranding seven
of them. He struck out with two outs and the bases loaded in the
fourth and sixth innings. In the eighth, he struck out with two
outs and a runner on second.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland rookie starter Mark Mulder allowed two runs and eight
hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Minnesota Timberwolves center Dean Garrett caught a foul
ball in the first inning. The Wolves, down 2-0 in their playoff
series with Portland, face the Trail Blazers on Sunday. ...
Lawton's 15-game hit streak ties the longest in the majors this
season. Carlos Febles did it for Kansas City. ... It was
Minnesota's first extra-inning game of the year, and Oakland's
second. ... Grieve also had five RBIs on Sept. 3, 1997. Two years
ago to the day, Grieve tied an Oakland record by going 5-for-5. ...
Piatt's triple was the first extra-base hit of his career.

<HEADLINE> Winds Drive Ariz. Forest Fire  </HEADLINE>
By JOLYN OKIMOTO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Firefighters returned to work Saturday on a
wind-driven forest fire after sitting out the night to rest and
avoid dangerous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, authorities said crews had the blaze 10 percent
contained. However, there was no estimate for full containment
because of high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Killebrew, a fire spokesman for the Tonto National Forest,
said, said 450 firefighters were assigned to the 5,370-acre blaze
along with four airtankers and four helicopters. There were no
reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Little relief from the weather was forecast, with lower
temperatures but continued wind through Sunday, the National
Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire didn't immediately threaten any structures and none had
been lost by Saturday, Killebrew said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started Wednesday in the Sierra Ancha Mountains about
30 miles north of Globe, and campers, workers at the Murphy Ranch
and a Forest Service fire lookout at Aztec Peak were evacuated
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials said they believed the fire was of
human origin.
</P>
<P>
   Years of fire suppression had helped build up large amounts of
undergrowth, leaves, pine needles, and twigs in the area, and
winter brought little moisture to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the vegetation has less than 10 percent moisture content
and some has less than 4 percent, Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you've got is kiln-dried,'' he said. ''It's just like a
tinderbox.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Air Incident Confirmed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- An armed Indonesian military plane
flew within 20 feet of five unarmed Australian air force aircraft,
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Downer said the Australian pilots were forced to use hand
signals to communicate with the Indonesian pilots during the
interception in international airspace on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred amid continuing allegations of Australian
invasions of Indonesian air space, which have all been denied by
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, four unarmed F/A-18s and one Boeing 707
tanker of the Royal Australian Air Force were en route to Singapore
from Darwin when they were intercepted by two armed Indonesian F-5
aircraft south of West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The RAAF believes the (Indonesian) aircraft were armed,''
Downer told Australian television's Nine Network. He said the
Australian planes had Indonesian clearance for their flight.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the F-5 aircraft flew by -- one of them apparently flew
within 20 feet of one of the Australian aircraft -- after this
incident the Australian aircraft continued on their journey across
Indonesia and through to Singapore.''
</P>
<P>
   Downer said he did not believe the Australian planes were
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I understand it, what happened was the two aircraft came up
to meet with the five Australian aircraft and flew alongside
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Downer said no more action would be taken by Australia over the
incident, which was reported Saturday by the Indonesian newspaper
Kompas.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is the latest irritant in relations between the two
neighbors, which collapsed after Australia led a multinational
peacekeeping force into East Timor last September.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to mend the strained relationship, President
Abdurrahman Wahid on Friday proposed a three-way meeting with Prime
Minister John Howard and East Timorese leader Jose Alexandre
Gusmao.

Vietnam Anniversary Marked With Celebrations

   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- Reunification Palace in Ho Chi Minh City
turned from a military parade into spring pageant of everything from floats to
stilt walkers, dragon dancers and child ballet performers Sunday, the
anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. An estimated 20,000 people watched
goose-stepping soldiers, barefooted minority groups, religious representatives,
including some in black Catholic hassocks, rifle-toting female soldiers in black
pajamas and khaki hats, and women in a rainbow of brightly colored clothes
parade through the palace grounds and past a reviewing stand for 90 minutes.

Thousands March For Elian in Little Havana
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Thousands of chanting demonstrators marched peacefully through
Miami's Little Havana today still seething over last week's raid that took Elian
Gonzalez out of the home of his Miami relatives. A counter rally in Cutler
Ridge, in south Miami-Dade County, attracted about 1,500 protesters who
supported the government's actions and criticized the city government shake-up.
They lined the streets and waved American flags as passing cars honked their
horns. No one was arrested. The boy is now living with his father, stepmother
and half brother at the rural Wye River retreat in Maryland. He must remain in
the United States until a federal appeals court rules on the Miami relatives'
bid for him to have an asylum hearing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Alex Rodriguez was 3-for-5 with a homer
and Mike Cameron hit a two-run shot Saturday night as Seattle beat
Kansas City 11-3 to snap the Royals' seven-game home winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit his eighth homer off Jeff Suppan (1-2) in the
first inning. The shortstop singled and scored in the third, and
doubled, stole third and scored in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud was 3-for-3 with two intentional walks, raising his
average to .405. Aaron Sele (2-1) went seven innings, giving up
three runs on eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dye had three hits for Kansas City, including his
AL-leading 11th double and an RBI single in the third. He has 27
RBIs to break the Royals' record for April. His major
league-leading slugging percentage went to .862.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan lasted three innings, giving up six runs on nine hits.
His ERA climbed from 5.28 to 6.47.
</P>
<P>
   After Mike Sweeney's two-run homer put the Royals ahead 2-1 in
the first, Cameron hit a two-run shot on an 0-2 pitch in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners added a run in the third on Edgar Martinez's RBI
groundout, and two more runs in the fourth on Mark McLemore's RBI
grounder and Stan Javier's RBI single. Mac Suzuki's wild pitch
allowed McLemore to score in the sixth, and Rodriguez scored on
Martinez's sacrifice fly to make it 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners added three runs in the ninth on Raul Ibanez's
two-run double and Carlos Guillen's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: At this pace, Rodriguez might soon challenge Cincinnati's
Barry Larkin for fifth place among shortstops on the home run list.
Rodriguez's first-inning shot off Suppan was No. 156, leaving the
Seattle star 12 short of Larkin's 168. Larkin is sidelined by a
finger injury. ... The Royals' record for consecutive wins at home
is 13 from July 17 to Aug. 5, 1994. ... The previous Royals' record
for April RBIs was 26 by Dean Palmer in 1998. ... Kansas City has
allowed a major league-leading 40 home runs. ... Royals starters
have just three victories.

as the Pacers beat the Milwaukee Bucks 109-96 Saturday night to
take a 2-1 lead in their best-of-five playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   With a sellout crowd at Bradley Center booing his every move and
his teammates mostly ineffective, Miller turned in yet another
amazing playoff performance. Almost singlehandedly, he staved off a
fired-up Milwaukee team aching for its first home playoff win in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, the Eastern Conference's top seed, can clinch the
series with another road victory in Game 4 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game was marred by the ejections of Milwaukee's Sam Cassell
and Indiana's Dale Davis with six minutes to play. The players
confronted each other and received double technical fouls for the
second time in another intensely physical game between bitter
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who was largely shut down by Ray Allen in the series'
first two games in Indianapolis, scored 16 points in the third
quarter as the Pacers turned a 12-point deficit into a three-point
lead in less than six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After Milwaukee pulled within 87-85 with eight minutes to play,
Miller and Jalen Rose keyed a 13-2 run that sealed the victory.
Rose finished with 27 points, hitting three straight long shots
during the deciding run.
</P>
<P>
   When Rose hit a deep 3-pointer with 2:45 left to put Indiana up
100-87, normally unemotional Indiana coach Larry Bird pumped his
first and screamed ''Yes!'' at the heckling Milwaukee crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's Travis Best scored 11 of his 18 points in the fourth
quarter, including a 3-pointer with 1:32 left that made it 105-91.
</P>
<P>
   Allen and Glenn Robinson each scored 26 points to lead
Milwaukee, but they had just five points apiece in the fourth
quarter as Indiana pulled away. Cassell had 13 points and 12
assists, but the Bucks floundered on offense when their point guard
was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   With the game in hand, Miller acknowledged a small band of
Pacers fans in the upper deck. When he left the game with just
seconds to play, he pointed to the ''Indiana'' on his jersey while
the fans booed.
</P>
<P>
   Center Rik Smits watched the game from the Pacers' hotel while
serving a one-game suspension for elbowing Ervin Johnson in Game 2.
Austin Croshere started in Smits' place, but only after Bird wrote
Zan Tabak's name on the lineup card and then crossed it out.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere, who had 10 points and 11 rebounds, and Johnson waged a
fierce battle under the boards in a game that had an old-fashioned
mean-spiritedness to it. The two ejections were only the capper of
a night filled with shoves, smacks and hard fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell and Davis were assessed technicals for a brief
confrontation in the third quarter in which harsh words were
exchanged but little else. Davis appeared to shove the ball into
Cassell's stomach when Cassell was trying to take the ball out of
bounds, and they were separated by Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The two briefly confronted each other again with six minutes
left in the game, and the resulting technicals meant both were
ejected. Someone in the crowd then threw a giveaway T-shirt on the
court, and someone else nearly hit referee Mark Wunderlich with a
pack of gum.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who was held to 11 points in each of the series' first
two games, hit five jumpers in the game's first eight minutes and
had 16 points by halftime. But Milwaukee blew a standout first-half
performance in which the Bucks shot 57 percent. The Bucks were up
58-51 at halftime and led 71-59 on Allen's jumper with 7:10 left in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   Miller then went to work, scoring 14 of Indiana's next 18 points
and reclaiming the lead for the Pacers in just six minutes of play.
Miller had 31 points by the time Indiana took an 81-78 lead into
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley Center, normally among the NBA's quietest arenas,
was nothing short of electric for the Bucks' most meaningful game
in a decade. Fans arrived downtown hours before tipoff, some
sporting purple-and-green body paint or full-body deer costumes
complete with horns.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks, who had the worst home record of the 16 playoff
teams, almost seemed taken aback by their sudden homecourt
advantage with a screaming, towel-waving sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Milwaukee's George Karl coached his 100th playoff game. ...
Milwaukee didn't shoot a free throw until 10:27 of the second
quarter. ... Darvin Ham, the Bucks' sparkplug forward, bricked two
critical free throws with 7:29 to play. Ham is frequently removed
from the Bucks' lineup at the end of games because of his inept
free-throw shooting. ... The Bucks are trying to become just the
third eighth-seeded team to beat a No. 1 seed. Denver beat Seattle
in 1994, and the Knicks knocked off Miami last season. ... After
Cassell and Davis were ejected, Robinson and Best yapped at each
other for nearly a minute while their teammates separated them. ...
Rose exchanged words with a heckler when he came back on the court
to do a postgame interview. ''The price of your ticket don't pay
for you to talk stupid to me!'' Rose yelled.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 7, Phillies 6, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals won on a long
flyball that didn't leave the park.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire hit a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning Saturday
night as the Cardinals beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-6 despite
blowing a four-run lead in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Paquette hit a two-run homer for the Cardinals, who have
homered in 22 of 24 games and have 53 homers this month, a major
league record for April. They need five homers Sunday to tie
Baltimore's 1987 record of 58 homers in any month.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vina led of the 10th inning with a single off Wayne
Gomes (1-1) and advanced to second on a groundout. After Jim
Edmonds hit an infield single, McGwire hit a drive to the warning
track in right field to score the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mohler (1-1) came on with runners on first and second and
one out in the ninth and got five outs for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies, who have lost 12 of their last 15 games, rallied
to tie the game at 6 with four runs in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Heathcliff Slocumb retired the first two batters before getting
Bobby Abreu to hit a slow roller to third base. Fernando Tatis
landed awkwardly when throwing to first base and Abreu reached on
an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis, who leads the Cardinals with 28 RBIs, left the game with
a strained left groin.
</P>
<P>
   After Scott Rolen walked, Dave Veres came in and allowed an RBI
single to Rico Brogna, a two-run double by Mike Lieberthal and a
RBI double for Mickey Morandini to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Paquette had an RBI double in the fifth inning and scored on Eli
Marrero's sacrifice fly to make it 2-1. After Paquette's third
homer made it 4-1, the Phillies drew within two on Morandini's RBI
double.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis went ahead 6-2 in the eighth on an RBI double by
McGwire and Tatis' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Benes gave up two runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings but
lost a chance for the win when Veres blew the game in the eighth.
Benes struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf allowed four hits and four runs in seven innings. He struck
out nine.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Olympic runner Marion Jones, in Philadelphia for the Penn
Relays, defeated the Phillie Phanatic in a dash between innings.
... Morandini's error in the eighth inning was just Philadelphia's
eighth this season. ... St. Louis' J.D. Drew, already being
mercilessly booed by Phillies fans for refusing to sign with the
team, after getting drafted in 1997, added to fans' anger after a
bat slipped out of his hands and hit a small girl in the stands.
The girl, who left the seating area, was slightly shaken up but
appeared unhurt.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Hits Southern Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A moderate earthquake struck southern
Taiwan on Sunday, seismologists said. No damage or injuries were
immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.5-magnitude quake was centered 18 miles north of the port
city of Kaohsiung, the Central Weather Bureau said. Kaohsiung is
about 120 miles south of the capital of Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   A 7.6-magnitude tremor hit central Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999,
killing more than 2,300 people. More than 12,000 aftershocks and
tremors have rattled the island since the big quake.
</P>
<P>
   Located along the earthquake-prone Pacific Rim and crisscrossed
by 51 fault lines, scores of earthquakes hit Taiwan each year.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebels Inaugurate Party  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- In a quest for
legitimacy that could mark a new phase in peace efforts, 4,000
fighters and the entire leadership of Colombia's most powerful
rebel army massed here Saturday for the launch of a new political
party.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, also
transported hundreds of civilians by bus and boat from
rebel-controlled areas to a field outside this steamy ranching town
in the southern demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
   The newly inaugurated Bolivarian Movement for a New Colombia
will, however, remain clandestine for now to prevent the slaughter
of its leaders, FARC commanders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colombia is gravely ill because its Liberal and Conservative
political leaders have used their posts to favor the rich ...
waging a dirty war to stay in power,'' the movement's four-page
manifesto said of the two parties that have traditionally
monopolized power in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's rally was FARC's invitation to Colombia's
impoverished masses to join, despite the 36-year-old movement's
lack of support outside some rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   From a wooden stage built for the occasion, FARC leaders railed
against the political corruption most Colombians consider their
country's main problem. They told the more than 5,000 civilians
that Colombia needed an organized left and demanded an equitable
redistribution of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's last leftist congressman was assassinated in 1994,
capping the systematic slaughter by right-wing death squads of more
than 3,000 activists belonging to the Patriotic Union, a political
party formed 10 years earlier by demobilized rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Despite overcast skies following days of rain, the guerrillas
tried to make the day festive.
</P>
<P>
   Women in combat fatigues passed out sandwiches and soft drinks.
Assembled rebels danced with their assault rifles to a song called
''Ambush Rap'' and sang an homage to the FARC's 71-year-old
patriarch, Manuel Marulanda, who has been fighting successive
governments for a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Cano, the new party's chairman, called for ''a new
political, social and economic environment ... that makes the use
of arms unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts think the FARC is seeking to portray itself as a
''Robin Hood'' force, acting on behalf of the masses, though
opinion polls consistently show its support in the low single
digits.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the insurgency's No. 2 commander, Jorge Briceno,
sparked national outrage by announcing that the FARC's seven-member
ruling council was demanding ''peace taxes'' from any individuals
or companies worth more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes as the FARC weighs a government
cease-fire proposal and is inviting the international community --
including the United States -- to guerrilla territory on May 29-30
to discuss weaning peasants off drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Congress is considering a $1.7 billion anti-narcotics
package for Colombia, the bulk of which would go to the military
and thus, the FARC says, be used against rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Colombian military intelligence released what it
said was an intercepted radio transmission in which Briceno
allegedly says he wants the FARC to double its ranks to 32,000
fighters and step up attacks on the nation's energy infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of this region, which President Andres Pastrana
cleared of troops 17 months ago to initiate peace talks with the
FARC, say they feel like pawns in the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't understand why we've got two governments giving
orders. And I don't know whether they're fighting for the country
or for money,'' said Armando Lozada, a 40-year-old peasant who
traveled for 16 hours by bus and on foot for Saturday's event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope for a peaceful solution so we can finally be allowed
to work,'' Lozada said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban-Americans March in Miami  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tens of thousands of angry Cuban-Americans marched
peacefully through Miami's Little Havana on Saturday, protesting
the raid in which armed federal agents yanked 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez from the home of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Police stayed visibly distant from the chanting demonstrators,
many of whom carried signs denouncing President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno for taking Elian from his Miami
relatives and sending him to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests were made during the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was peaceful and everything went very smoothly,'' said Lt.
Bill Schwartz, Miami police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At a separate gathering in Pembroke Pines, about 15 miles north
of Miami, federal agents had a picnic to celebrate the success of
the operation that reunited Elian with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a reason to celebrate, we did something that everyone
said could not be done,'' INS district director Bob Wallis told
Miami television station WFOR. Wallis held a T-shirt emblazoned
with ''Operation Reunion,'' showing Elian and his father smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Little Havana march, the exile community's
biggest protest yet, hoped it would to send a strong but peaceful
message to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Police blocked off 23 blocks of the main route along Calle Ocho,
or Eighth Street, and crowds of people, many dressed in black and
waving Cuban and American flags, marched in parade formation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to fight against communism, that's the bottom
line,'' said Little Havana resident Arnold Villar, 35.
</P>
<P>
   The procession included Cuban-American veterans groups and
marching bands, including one from Lincoln-Marti School, which
Elian attended while living here with his great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 of Elian's former teachers, classmates and parents also
marched, some holding up a 6-foot banner of Elian in his school
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers Against Repression joined the march with a contingent of
about 40 women, all dressed in black, marching with about 300
supporters, men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Ferrieya, a Cuban-born accountant, distributed copies of
a letter urging demonstrators to write politicians in Washington
and demand an investigation into the raid.
</P>
<P>
   All week and into Saturday morning, Cuban exile leaders speaking
on Spanish radio stations had urged people to join the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a moment where the three generations of Cubans that
are here are coming together in favor of supporting the child Elian
and denouncing the aggressive way that they entered his home,''
said Andres Nazario Sargen, of Alpha 66, an anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Cuban-Americans protesters also took to the streets
hours after the boy was taken from Miami, setting more than 200
trash and tire fires and shouting in angry protests that lasted
into the next day. Police clad in riot gear arrested more than 300
people and cleared thousands of demonstrators from Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, protesters heeded the call for calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, we will project a better image than what the Cubans
have been getting lately,'' said Ed Blanco, a 49-year-old Vietnam
veteran watching the procession.
</P>
<P>
   Fallout from the raid and the way police handled the protesters
sank the city government into chaos. By Friday, the mayor had fired
the city manager and the police chief had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally Saturday, Mayor Joe Carollo said he was pleased
with the community's peaceful and unified expression.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time this exile community is together as one
voice,'' he said during an interview on Spanish television.
</P>
<P>
   He also commented on the shake-up at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need to finish what I have started, because here they have
lied to this community a lot ... and they have abused our community
a lot and they both have to go,'' Carollo said of the city manager
and police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief William O'Brien has called Carollo ''divisive and
destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, made a plea Friday for the
community to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian is gone for now and my heart is broken,'' he said in a
statement read by a family spokesman. ''But South Florida must stay
united.''
</P>
<P>
   The community's split was evident when the crowd booed planes
flying over demonstrators with banners that read: ''Don't fight
your battles here, go home and fight your war,'' ''America loves
Janet Reno,'' and ''America -- love it or leave it, comprende?''
</P>
<P>
   A counter rally in Cutler Ridge, in south Miami-Dade County,
attracted about 1,500 protesters who supported the government's
actions and criticized the city government shake-up. They lined the
streets and waved American flags as passing cars honked their
horns. Police said two people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans feel disenfranchised, we don't feel like we have
representation anymore in Miami,'' said Kevin Devine, 42, a social
worker who lives in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old was found adrift on an inner tube Thanksgiving
Day after his mother and 10 other Cubans drowned in an attempt to
reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is now living with his father, stepmother and half
brother at the rural Wye River retreat in Maryland. He must remain
in the United States until a federal appeals court rules on the
Miami relatives' bid for him to have an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Remirez, Cuba's diplomatic representative in
Washington, went to the State Department Friday afternoon to ask
for a continuing Cuban diplomatic presence at the Maryland retreat,
according a department official who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the request was under discussion, but added
that the department did not believe there was a compelling reason
to grant it.
