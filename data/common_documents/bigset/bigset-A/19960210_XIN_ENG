<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Stresses Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh has defended the economic reform policy which is being
carried out apace in his country, according to local press reports
today.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni president Thursday toured Taiz Province where he met
with local officials and public figures and spoke highly of the
economic reform policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yemen had no choice but the economic reform
program which the country had taken to set economic conditions
right.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni President revealed that Yemen's annual oil revenue
is about 560 million U.S. dollars, of which 500 million dollars is
used for the purchase of wheat and flour alone.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the gravity of the overpopulation in Yemen,
President Saleh pointed out that the population of Yemen has
increased from 8 million to more than 16 million in 10 years,
which devours all the national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Yemen started the first stage of its economic and financial
reform program in March last year.
</P>
<P>
As the Yemeni government started executing the second stage of
the economic and financial reform program recently, it decided to
raise the prices of oil derivatives and public services, as well
as those of subsidized wheat and flour.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Yemeni government decided to increase
the salaries of all civil servants and the personnel of both the
armed forces and the security services.
</P>
<P>
The new measures have met with dissatisfaction of the citizens,
particularly the low-income people, and several Yemeni cities have
witnessed protests because of the decline of the the living
standards.

<HEADLINE> US To Continue Aid To Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
decided to continue 13 million dollars in aid to Haiti in order to
avoid any delay in the withdrawal of U.S. troops from that
country, the State Department said here today.
</P>
<P>
Haiti was scheduled to receive the assistance this fiscal year,
mostly for humanitarian programs and the training of the country's
new police force.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Congress has set restrictions on aid to Haiti, under
which Haiti was required to make progress in investigating the
murders of political opponents of former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide.
</P>
<P>
"To avoid disruption in crucial programs relating to the
development of the police and the conduct of the investigation
into political murders themselves, we have used a provision in the
statute allowing the restriction on aid to be waived in order to
assure the safe and timely withdrawal of American forces from
Haiti," Department spokeswoman Phyllis Young said.
</P>
<P>
Haiti has made some progress in the investigation of political
killings, but wasn't able to document enough to satisfy the
requirements of the law, Young noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that the new government will make additional
progress to meet the criteria established," she said.
</P>
<P>
Newly elected President Rene Preval took power on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 American troops were sent to Haiti in September
1994 to restore Aristide to power, and most of them are scheduled
to leave Haiti by April 15.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's External Reserve Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's external reserve
which recorded a marginal drop in October 1995, has further
slided to 34.7 billion Naira (about 400 million US dollars) last
November, the Central Bank of Nigeria said today.
</P>
<P>
The reserve dropped by 256.9 million dollars from September to
stand at 48.537 billion Naira (about 571 million dollars) in
October, the bank said in a latest document obtained here.
</P>
<P>
No official explanation was given to the continuous reduction
in the reserve, but the drop could be due to the depletion of the
reserve by the monetary authorities to meet the demand of the
foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The document also showed that the Nigerian currency in
circulation as stood at 103.5 billion Naira (1.22 billion
dollars) last November against 97.6 billion naira (1.15 billion
dollars) in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Government to Meet Rebels in Cote d'Ivoire on February 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The military government and
the Revolutionary United Front (ruf) are to hold their first
contact in Cote d'Ivoire on February 28, state radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
This was agreed upon by Sierra Leone's Head of State Brigadier
General Julius Maada Bio and ruf leader Foday Sankoh at a radio
contact this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But the ruf leader rejected any ceasefire "for the time being
because of the military condition prevailing."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to have a ceasefire after February but not now,"
Sankoh told Bio in their second radio contact since the ruf began
a rebel war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to Sankoh, Sierra Leone "will have everlasting peace
after February.'
</P>
<P>
Correspondents here pointed out that the ruf have vowed to
"disrupt the February 26 elections if held" and they say this may
probably be the reason why the ruf has put off any extension of
the ceasefire until after February.
</P>
<P>
Both sides earlier agreed for the talks to be held at
Mongereh, a dusty township in southern Sierra Leone but later
opted for Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh had earlier named Yele in the north of the country as
another likely place for talks but stressed that the "area must
be free of all military activities as well as air and ground
forces."
</P>
<P>
Both men however settled for Cote d'Ivoire "for security
reasons particularly with a ceasefire not in existence."
</P>
<P>
West African diplomats here say if the talks in Cote d'Ivoire
takes place on February 28, the most likely venue will be at
Yamousoukro, capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to work out the level of representation of
their delegations although the ruf leader suggested his
organization will send its field, battalion, platoon and squad
commanders and one ordinary fighter.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh repeated that the ruf "is totally opposed to the
election" and gave this as a reason why the ceasefire cannot be
extended.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh used the occasion to attack the country's politicians,
saying, "they are causing a lot of trouble. The obstacle to the
ceasefire remains the politicians. We want peace before elections
and nothing less."
</P>
<P>
"We have to forget the politicians, otherwise the country will
go into a mess. But the army remains our brothers," Sankoh noted.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Bio said he was "appreciative" of the contact and
that he would do his best for the dialogue to be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has issued a statement expressing
"dismay" over the grenade attack early today on the residences of
the Chairman of the Elections Office, Dr James Jonah, and the
leader of one of the 15 political parties, Alhaji Ahmed Tejan
Kabba of the Sierra Leone People's Party (slpp).
</P>
<P>
The statement also condemned a similar attack on the office of
the Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that the "dastardly act" was
"perpetrated by ill motivated members of the community with the
aim of disrupting the peace and security of the state."
</P>
<P>
A special security task force set up by the government,
consisting of the army and police, is reportedly carrying out
"immediate investigation," the statement disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Camps in Zaire to Be Closed: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Zaire will close all 40 camps
for over a million Rwandan refugees successively, but "we're not
in a hurry," Zaire's Interior Minister Gustave Malunba Mbangula
said in Goma today.
</P>
<P>
A report from the west Zairean town quoted Malunba as saying
Zaire will first close the camp at Kibumba, and "when the camp is
closed, we will proceed to close another camp."
</P>
<P>
Malunba, who doubles as deputy prime minister, told a press
conference at the town of Goma bordering Rwanda that "the
operation will continue until all refugees go home."
</P>
<P>
These refugees are from the Hutu majority in Rwanda and fled
in 1994 during civil war and the genocide of half a million
Tutsis and Hutu moderates killed by Hutu troops, militiamen and
radicals.
</P>
<P>
Kigali says it will screen all male returnees to discover
whether anyone killed in the genocide. Some refugees say they
fear they will be killed in reprisal if they return.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not say when Zaire will close the Kibumba
camp, which at present accommodates 190,000 refugees, but U.N.
officials predict the closure will begin within days.
</P>
<P>
"Zairean authorities have decided to implement a program of
targeted repatriation. This aims at the progressive closure of
refugee camps... and their repatriation to Rwanda," Malumba said.
</P>
<P>
Malumba said the move to speed up a U.N. voluntary
repatriation plan would be carried out by a 1,500-strong Zairean
force formed last year to keep law and order in the camps, and
another Zairean army force to protect refugees on the way home.
</P>
<P>
Groups of Hutu refugees were seen leaving Kibumba camp for the
nearby Kahindo camp, only hours after Malumba's speech.
</P>
<P>
Some aid officials said the movement from Kibumba might make
Zaire bring forward the operation, which they feared might turn
violent because Zairean soldiers were poorly disciplined and had
not been paid for three months.
</P>
<P>
Last August Zaire expelled 15,000 refugees and threated to
deport all the refugees by the end of last year. It agreed to put
off the repatriation of all refugees till March this year after a
summit meeting in Cairo last December which grouped presidents of
Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
After talks with U.N. officials, Malunba said refugees would
walk back in an orderly way protected by troops.
</P>
<P>
He said the Zairean army was essential to control refugee
movements, to assure the security of refugees walking home and to
neutralize and take away intimidators stopping them leaving.
</P>
<P>
Security in Rwanda has improved enough to allow mass
repatriation and the Zairean government is delighted Rwandan Vice
President Paul Kagame said on Friday he welcomed returnees,
Malumba pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas Launch Attacks on Israeli Forces in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas today launched a
series of attacks on Israeli forces and the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army (SLA) militia in the so-called "security zone" in
south Lebanon, wounding at least one SLA militiaman.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Pary of God, announced that one group of its
guerrillas carried out today a bomb attack at a SLA patrol on a
road between the villages of Barashit and Kaunin in Bint Jbail
area deeply inside the buffer enclave.
</P>
<P>
The militant group said in a statement that the guerrillas
detonated an explosive device on the Barashit-Kaunin road at 1:50
p.m. (11:30 GMT), destroying a vehicle of the SLA patrol, killing
or wounding the militiamen inside.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-backed militia confirmed the bomb attack at its
patrol, and claimed that one militiaman was "seriously" wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pro-Syrian Amal movement announced that two
groups of its guerrillas launched this morning attacks at the
Israeli positions at Humaid and Shaf, causing heavy casualties to
the enemy and serious damage to the positions.
</P>
<P>
"Fatah Movement-Black September 13," a breakaway small
Palestinian group of the pro-Arafat Palestinian Fatah faction in
Lebanon, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine announced that
their commandos carried out this morning a joint operation against
an Israeli motor patrol in the western sector of the buffer strip
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They said in a statement that a joint group of their
guerrillas launched the attack at 8:30 a.m. (6:30 GMT) at the
Israeli motor patrol on the Deir Harfa-Shehin road. The statement
did not specify whether there were casualties in the Israeli
patrol.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Israeli occupation forces has resumed
since the noon today bombardments at suspected guerrilla targets
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources reported that the Israeli forces, from their
positions at Shaf and Humaid, fired some 20 artillery shells at
the midday at the areas around the south Lebanese villages of
Haris, Sirbin and Yatir.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, the areas around the villages of Barashit,
Shaqra and Aita Al-Jabel were hit by about 30 shells fired by the
Israeli troops from their position in Bint Jbail.
</P>
<P>
But no civil casualties were caused in today's bombardments,
the security sources stressed.
</P>
<P>
South Lebanon remains the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, where a trade of fires between Lebanese
and Palestinian guerrillas on one side, and the Israeli forces
and their surrogate militia on the other constitutes a daily
scene.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,000-square-kilometer buffer strip in
south Lebanon in 1985 in a bid to prevent more border-crossing
attacks at northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs US Defense Authorization Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today signed the 265 billion U.S. dollars defense authorization
bill into law despite strong objections to several of the
provisions, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton described as "blatantly discriminatory" a provision's
requirement that U.S. service members living with the AIDS virus
be discharged.
</P>
<P>
"This provision is blatantly discriminatory and highly punitive
to service members and their families," Clinton said in a
statement issued by the White House.
</P>
<P>
"People living with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) can and do
lead full and productive lives, provide for their families, and
contribute to the well being of our nation," the U.S. president
added.
</P>
<P>
White House counsel Jack Quinn told reporters Friday that the
AIDS provision, placed in the bill by Republican House member Bob
Dornan, "in the president's judgment, is mean-spirited and serves
no purpose other than to punish people who deserve the
government's help, not its hatred."
</P>
<P>
However, White House officials said that if the provision is
not repealed by the Republican-led Congress or thrown out by the
Supreme Court by the time it takes effect in six months, the
Pentagon will have no choice but to enforce it.

<HEADLINE> Swedish FM Visits Orient House in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Foreign Minister
Lena Hjelm Wallen, ignoring Israel's protest, today visited the
Orient House, the Palestinian headquarters in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Wallen met with Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
official Faisel Husseini and Palestinian Council member Hanan
Ashrawi at the Orient House and held talks with them for an hour.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Husseini told reporters that they discussed
the peace process in the Middle East, the Palestinian track in
particular, and the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Wallen's visit to the Orient House had caused protests from
the Israeli government and the Jerusalem Major Ehud Olmert, even
before the visit was actually taken place.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, after Wallen's meeting with Israeli Foreign
Minister Ehud Barak, his office issued a statement protesting
Wallen's planned private visit to the Orient House.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the net effect of such moves by Sweden and
other European countries will be to sharpen the differences over
Jerusalem before final-status talks begin.
</P>
<P>
During the two foreign ministers' meeting, Barak also
reiterated Israel's resolve to retain a united Jerusalem under
Israeli sovereignty, saying that "Israel expects European
countries to be more sensitive so such problematic issues."
</P>
<P>
In an appeal to the Israeli government to prevent the visit,
Olmert said Tuesday that Wallen's planned visit is a diplomatic
"slap in the face" to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem mayor said the visit would violate the
prohibition on Palestinian National Authority (PNA) diplomatic
activity outside of areas under the PNA's control, and that Wallen
was informed of that but had still insisted on going ahead with
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Israeli government has until now done
nothing to stop such visits, including those in recent months by
Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Irish and French foreign ministers to the
Orient House.
</P>
<P>
Israel has claimed that Jerusalem would be its eternal and
united capital, including east Jerusalem captured by the Israeli
army during the 1967 Middle East War, saying that Jerusalem is not
negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians would like to see east Jerusalem
becoming the capital of a future independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are scheduled to start negotiations on the final
status of the West Bank and Jerusalem in May, in accordance with
the Oslo accords between them.

LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Social Democratic and

<P>
ATHENS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A large number of new shipping
companies have been set up in the past three years in Greece, a
country well-known for shipping activities, according to a recent
report by the country's Merchant Marine Ministry.
</P>
<P>
More than 900 shipping companies were established in 1993 with
the figure rising to 1,011 in 1994 and exceeding 1,100 by December
1995, with an employment of 9,000 people today.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the ministry said the Greek merchant fleet,
the third largest in the world, is being restructured with ships
with an average age of 11 years in contrast to the previous decade
when the average age of Greek merchant ships was 23 years.
</P>
<P>
The ships are equipped with modern communications and safety
systems and have better hygiene and living conditions for seamen,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Bank of Greece last week,
inflows of shipping exchange totaled at 1.62 billion U.S. dollars
between January and September 1995, 18.7 percent more than the

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Calls on IRA to Stop Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton appealed to the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which plotted
a big bomb explosion in east London on Friday night, to put an end
to violence, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Bruton made this statement as a response to the request made by
Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, who had earlier indicated that he
wanted urgent talks with British and Irish governments.
</P>
<P>
The Irish prime minister said that the explosion was totally
self-defeating, and not in any sense consistent with democracy.
</P>
<P>
He told the leader of the IRA's political wing that the Irish
Republic was founded as a democracy and "a democracy is not a
place where violence can be used for political purposes."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Irish government has canceled the planned
release of nine IRA prisoners who were due to be freed today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken by the Irish cabinet at a meeting on
Friday night as an instant response to the London explosion
plotted by the IRA.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Afghan
four-party opposition alliance started crucial talks here this
evening on the future of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was being attended by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, former
Prime Minister and Chief of Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group),
Rashid Dostum, leader of Junbush-i-Melli, Sibghatollah Mojadeddi,
chairman of Nejat-i-Melli, and Ustad Muhaqqiq, Deputy Chief of
Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili Group).
</P>
<P>
The leaders would devise a joint strategy in the wake of fresh
initiatives launched by the United Nations and some Afghan
neighbors to settle the lingering crisis in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to hammer out a joint position with regard to the
different proposals given by (Afghani President Burhanuddin)
Rabbani to different groups," an Afghan opposition leader said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was taking place just after the visit paid by
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Alauddin Broujerdi to Afghanistan
and Pakistan where he met Afghan government and opposition leaders
and also briefed Pakistani officials about his efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Broujerdi's initiative will also come up for discussion," the
Afghan leader faction said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders are also to discuss the U.N. peace
initiative launched by its special envoy Mehmud Mestiri.
</P>
<P>
Mestiri had earlier held a meeting with Dostum on ways of
avoiding further hostilities in Afghanistan and seeking a
negotiated settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the leaders are also expected to deliberate on the
military situation in their country against the backdrop of
reports that Rabbani's troops and the Taliban militia are
preparing for another showdown after the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said today over
14,000 Ethiopians who fled to Sudan have returned home via
Humera, a border town in the northwest, during the past two
months.
</P>
<P>
The returnees were repatriated under the tripartite agreement
reached among Ehiopia and Sudan and the U. N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (unhcr). According to the agreement, about 60,000
Ethiopian refugees will be repatriated from December 1995 to June
1996.
</P>
<P>
Official in charge of refugees affairs mulushoa metekia told
the Ethiopian News Agency that 6,146 of the returnees are being
transported to Tigray region while the remaining 7,913 are
leaving Humera for Gondar and Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The Relief Society of Tigray, the Ethiopian Relief
Organization and the Oromo Self-Help Association have expressed
readiness to transport the repatriates to their places of origin,
Metekia said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that thousands of other Ethiopians who
sought refuge in different parts of Sudan were unable to return
home as registration of returnees had been suspended since
January 1996.

<HEADLINE> North Mogadishu Denies Renegades To Aideed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Somali Congress
of North Mogadishu (USC/NM) today denied the alleged renegades to
the south Mogadishu government led by General Mohamed Farah
Aideed.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after a report broadcast on Friday night by
the radio controlled by Aideed that his government had admitted
six opposition members.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Abdurahman Gabow Mohamud, the man whom General Aideed
offered the post of fifth deputy president, said today that his
nomination was a purely fabricated lie.
</P>
<P>
In a formal statement issued at his north Mogadishu residence,
the Abgal clan leader of the USC declared that his organization
would support neither General Aideed nor Ali Mahdi, who claims
control of most of north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
"We're not planning to align ourselves with either of them,"
Mr. Mohamud said.
</P>
<P>
Both Aideed and Ali Mahdi have claimed the presidency of the
war-shattered horn of Africa nation since it plunged into civil
war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Hassan Abdulle Goley, another Abgal clan leading member,
also denied having any knowledge about his nomination today.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed the "governor of Mogadishu" by Aideed,
according to Friday's radio broadcast.
</P>
<P>
"I can as well appoint them as governors of any region,
since we're equal," he said bluntly.
</P>
<P>
Aideed's radio has repetitively broadcast speeches made by the
appointed Abgal clan members in the south Mogadishu government.
The radio even broadcast a special program about the oath
ceremony on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts in Mogadishu considered the denials by the
Abgal clan leaders a retreat from the government of General
Aideed in fear of their security in North Mogadishu, where they
are still staying.
</P>
<P>
North Mogadishu is calm but tense today, after the Islamic
court in north Mogadishu has detained two senior members from the
USC/NM, including the organization's deputy chairman Haji Mohamed
Osman Dhegaburo.
</P>
<P>
The detainees are accused of joining an authorized party and
sabotaging the unity of the north Mogadishu community.
</P>
<P>
Heavily armed militiamen with technicals are circulating
around the main streets of north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The event is seen as a setback to Ali Mahdi, who has enjoyed
full support of his Abgal clansmen before.

LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said today he wanted urgent peace talks with the British and Irish
governments in the wake of the London bomb explosion plotted by
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), according to reports from
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
He once again accused the British government of delaying the
peace process by insisting on its precondition, namely that the
IRA must hand in at least some arms before its political wing Sinn
Fein can be admitted to all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said that he
would be prepared to meet Adams.
</P>
<P>
But he asked Adams to condemn the London explosion if he was
"not associated with it".
</P>
<P>
Mayhew said the explosion was a very serious setback for the
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
However he insisted that his government still viewed elections
for the troubled province as a way through the current political
crisis.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Measures announced by the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) three days ago have had a decisive
impact on the foreign exchange, shares and bullion markets, the
newspaper Patriot said today.
</P>
<P>
The Sensex, a main indicator on the stock market in Mumbai
(Bombay), moved from 3,020.49 on Wednesday to 3,470.53 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gold depreciated from 5,800 rupees on the same day to 5,660
rupees and the US dollar cooled off at 37.00 rupees in the
interbank deals even without any intervention from the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
The revival of the markets followed the announcement of some
measures by the RBI on Wednesday that were designed to strengthen
the rupee and contain the free slide in value of the Indian
currency.
</P>
<P>
It is certainly a positive sign but it is still too early to
say whether the trend will continue, Patriot quoted a senior
economist as saying.

<HEADLINE> Privatization Festival Opens in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A privatization festival
opened here today, in a bid to launch a nationwide education and
information program about privatization.
</P>
<P>
The one-day festival combined music and dance with an
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The exhibitors included Nile Breweries, Crown Bottlers and the
Uganda Metal Products and Enamelling Company Ltd whose stands
demonstrated their success since they became privatized and the
benefits that success has brought to Uganda. Their products were
on sale at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Hosted by Minister of State for Finance and Economic Planning
Mathew Rukikaire, the festival marks the launch of a major drive
to increase awareness, knowledge and understanding of Uganda's
privatization policy, process and progress.
</P>
<P>
The campaign explained to the participants what privatization
was all about in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda started the public enterprises reform and divestiture
program in 1987.
</P>
<P>
All public enterprises to be privatized would be sold off by
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The major aim of the privatization is to enhance and improve
the management of enterprises in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the privatized enterprises were bought by
Ugandans in past eight years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987 to early last year, the country had received 5.55
million US dollars from sale of public enterprises.

ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The UN special envoy to
Afghanistan, Mehmud Mestiri, held talks here today with Rashid
Dostum, leader of Junbush-i-Melli who controls northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda was the establishment of peace and a
broad-based interim government in Afghanistan and the transfer of
power from Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Dostum praised international and regional
efforts to put an end to the war in his country.
</P>
<P>
He also called for demilitarization of Kabul to bring peace to
the country.
</P>
<P>
The UN special envoy said they were still optimistic about
peace efforts in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the top priority now was to avoid fighting in Kabul as
tension was mounting in and around the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that all warring factions would sit together to
discuss the interim government and the transfer of power in
efforts to end the four-year long civil war.
</P>
<P>
Dostum arrived here on Tuesday on a goodwill visit.
</P>
<P>
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, chief of his own faction of the Afghan
main opposition Hezb-i-Islami, also arrived here.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Afghan faction leaders will hold direct
talks here to discuss peace efforts in their country.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Allauddin Broujerdi visited
Islamabad a few days ago for consultations with Pakistani leaders
on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
Mestiri told local reporters today that all neighboring
countries wanted peace in Afghanistan and came up with many peace
proposals.
</P>
<P>
However, it is difficult to find consensus among these
countries and warring factions, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Returns from Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides returned this afternoon from Greece, where he held talks
with new Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and other Greek
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time Clerides and Simitis had met since the
latter was elected recently as Prime Minister of Greece to replace
Andreas Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Athens talks focused on the new
strategy to be followed by Cyprus and Greece to reach a solution
to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Another issue, which was high on the Simitis-Clerides agenda
was the joint defense pact agreed upon by the governments of
Cyprus and Greece in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
After talks, both Clerides and Simitis said there was identity
of views on the matters discussed. They agreed to coordinate
future action on the Cyprus problem, the joint defense policy and
Cyprus' bid to become a full member of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his arrival at Larnaca Airport, President Clerides
said he will brief the National Council Monday about his talks in
the Greek Capital.
</P>
<P>
The National Council, presided over by Clerides and made up of
the leaders of the parliamentary parties, is the top advisory
body to the President on the handling of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides told the press that the two governments
agreed to the framework in which future initiatives on the Cyprus
problem should move.
</P>
<P>
He noted that following the Aegean Sea crisis, changes would
be made on timetables that had been put forward for the
implementation of specific plans within the framework of the
joint defense policy.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the crisis in the Aegean Sea has not yet
passed.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Greece and Turkey both sent their navies to the
uninhabited islets in the eastern Aegean in a tense stand off
over ownership of Imia.
</P>
<P>
The crisis ended after intervention by the U.S. which put
pressure on the two NATO members to withdraw their forces and
flags.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey are also at odds over Cyprus for many
years. Turkey has still maintained about 30,000 troops on the
northern part of the island since its invasion in 1974, which has
divided Cyprus into Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any Turkish troops' advance
toward the government-controlled southern part of the island
would mean war between Greece and Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is planning a fast
electric train service between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, Capital
of Malaysia, as part of an ambitious plan for linking major Asian
cities by fast rail, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the Singapore Government's plan to expand the
country's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) subway system, Goh said that in
six to seven years' time, Singaporeans can travel from any part of
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur in under three hours by MRT and the
Malayan Railway.
</P>
<P>
"This is because Malaysia is planning a fast electric train
service between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir had
sought Singapore's cooperation in building the high-speed
inter-city electric train service.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir explained to Goh his vision of linking the main Asian
cities by fast rail -- Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur to
Bangkok, Bangkok to Vientiane and to Kunming of China. There would
also be lines to Ho Chi Minh City and Yangon, Goh said,
commenting, "this is an exciting vision."
</P>
<P>
"I am excited by Dr Mahathir's electric-train proposal. So are
other Asian leaders," he said, adding that he had discussed
Mahathir's proposal with Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese leaders, and
they supported the idea.
</P>
<P>
"By linking our cities, we will promote more inter-city travel,
greater understanding between our peoples and more avenues and
opportunities to work together to create a more prosperous Asia,"
the Singapore Prime Minister said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if the Asian governments work at it, Dr
Mahathir's vision of an Asian fast-train network can be realized
in 30 to 40 years' time," he said.

HELSINKI -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and new

here today in trying to reach U.S.-Russian consensus on major
issues. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the two foreign
ministers agreed that they had made a "good start" despite some
existing differences.
</P>
<P>
"I would say we are off to a very good start," Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
And, Primakov echoed: "We have differences and there will be
differences, but all this must be done without confrontation."
</P>
<P>
He said that he did not think "there is any basis to consider
that U.S.-Russian relations are in crisis."

SEOUL -- South Korean President Kim Young-sam today cancelled a
meeting with Japanese lawmakers as part of an escalating row
between the two countries over a disputed island.
</P>
<P>
The President dismissed Japan's claim to Tokto Island in the
Sea of Japan as "intolerable," presidential spokesman Yoon
Yeo-joon said.
</P>
<P>
He cancelled a meeting with a delegation from the Japanese
ruling coalition on February 12, due to include discussions over
sovereignty of the Tokto island which lies half way between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said in Tokyo Friday
that the tiny Tokto island -- called Takeshima in Japanese -- was
part of Japanese territory, following South Korea announcement of
plans to build a wharf on the rocky islet.
</P>
<P>
Japan has claimed the islands since 1905 when it signed an
agreement with Korea that paved the way for Tokyo's 35 year
colonial rule of the Korean Peninsular which ended in 1945.
</P>
<P>
South Korea claims Tokto was part of Korea before Japan's rule.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Fails to March to PM's Residence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's mainstream
opposition parties today failed to stage a march towards the
prime minister's residence as part of their campaign to boycott
the coming parliamentary elections because of police interruption.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said the opposition tried to carry on their
plan for the march after holding rallies, but they were dispersed
by the police and other law-enforcing agencies.
</P>
<P>
Police used teargas, water cannon and rubber bullets to
disperse the demonstrators who fought back by setting off bombs
and throwing stones at the police, the sources said, adding that
several people were injured during the clash.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the government imposed a ban on rallies in many
areas of the capital in a bid to foil the opposition's planned
march.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have announced plans for the march and
other agitation activities including a 48-hour nationwide strike
on February 14-15 to press their demand for cancellation of the
ruling party's "farcical elections" scheduled for February 15.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Herbal Medicine Cures Intractable Skin Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A private clinic named after
dermatologist Chen Lisen has cured over 7,000 patients since it
was opened one year and half ago in Hangzhou, capital city of east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The ointment, carefully compounded by Chen to treat intractable
skin diseases, has a cure rate of over 80 percent. Though 20
percent of the cured patients may have relapse, they usually can
have a sustained health after the second-time treatment.
</P>
<P>
Chen began his study in this field in 1963, when he was a
doctor at a small hospital in another town and found that a lot of
people there were suffering from such skin diseases as psoriasis,
eczema and dermatitis.
</P>
<P>
He made a careful study of some Chinese medical classics,
including the Compendium of Materia Medica, a great pharmacopoeia
of Chinese herbal medicine, written by Li Shizhen (1518-1593) and
decided to use Chinese herbal medicine to treat those diseases.
</P>
<P>
By consulting famous pharmacopoeia and prescriptions, and using
the modern medical experience, Chen successfully made three kinds
of ointment, named "6801", "7302" and "7501" respectively to meet
the needs of different types of skin diseases.
</P>
<P>
The medicine was awarded the prize for development and
inventions in science by the Technological Information Promotion
System of the United Nations and several gold medals in the
national exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
Many patients, including some foreigners have come to Chen's
clinic and recieved his treatment.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he plans to open a herbal medicine workshop to
help more people out of trouble.

<HEADLINE> Christopher, Primakov Hold First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and new Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov held their first meeting here today in trying to reach
U.S.-Russian consensus on major issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the two foreign
ministers agreed that they had made a "good start" despite some
existing differences.
</P>
<P>
"I would say we are off to a very good start," Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
And, Primakov echoed: "We have differences and there will be
differences, but all this must be done without confrontation."
</P>
<P>
He said that he did not think "there is any basis to consider
that U.S.-Russian relations are in crisis."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first formal talks between the two men
since Primakov succeeded Andrei Kozyrev as Russian foreign last
month.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two foreign ministers discussed a wide
range of issues, including NATO's eastward expansion, the Bosnia
situation, the Middle East Peace Process, arms control and,
particularly, U.S.-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
According to Primakov, the two sides still hold different views
on NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
"It is desirable that NATO would not enlarge. We must find the
right solution that will satisfy both sides and also eastern and
central Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Russia is willing to further develop
relations and cooperation with the U.S. on an equal footing.

<HEADLINE> Indian Minister Stresses Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister
Manmohan Singh today cautioned against neglecting the protection
of the environment in efforts to pursue high-profile economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
"We must aim at high economic growth primarily to combat
poverty, but simultaneously we should not neglect environment,"
Singh said at a meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that India cannot afford to freeze its developmental
projects, the minister pointed out that the country should pursue
substantial economic development without causing damage to
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"We need higher economic growth to improve the integrated
socio-economic development of the country, but what is the use of
such economic growth if it destroys environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Calling for concerted efforts to maintain ecological balance,
Singh said it was the collective responsibility of all including
the government as well as the industry to take steps in protecting
the environment while seeking higher economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He urged Indian industry to make it a standard practice to go
for environment audit while assessing economic performance.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes UN Human Rights Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran has criticized the
double-standard by the international human rights organizations
and asserted that the Iranian people are no longer optimistic
about the U.N. Human Rights Commission due to various factors.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Vice-Speaker Hassan Rowhani said here today while
meeting with Maurice Danby Capithorne, U.N. special representative
on the situation of human rights in Iran, that the adoption of
double-standard by the international human rights organizations
was quite visible toward certain countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. as the main human rights violator,
Rowhani said despite numerous instances of overt American
interference in the internal affairs of other countries, Iran in
particular, the international bodies have shown no reaction.
</P>
<P>
One of the clear examples of the U.S. interference in internal
affairs of others is the recent approval of the Congress to
allocate a fund for subversive actions against Iran, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Rowhani stressed, despite taking such measures, the
United States has not been blamed by any international forum so
far.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani said a "comparison between the human rights issue in
Iran before and after the Islamic Revolution" showed that the
international forums would not show any practical reaction.
</P>
<P>
Whereas, he stressed, after the victory of the Islamic
Revolution, Iran has been subjected to international pressure
merely because the Iranian nation wants to determine its own fate
while relying on its own belief and views.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani urged the U.N. special envoy to present a reality of
the human rights situation in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Capithorne arrived here Friday to make study of the human
rights situation in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Rail Sell-Off Will Go On, Says Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Allegations of ticket fraud
which forced the British government to abandon awarding the LTS
(London, Tilbury and Southend) passenger train franchise had not
thrown rail privatization off course, British Prime Minister John
Major said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Major, speaking near his Huntingdon constituency, conceded it
was "tiresome" that the 15-year contract to run services between
London, Tilbury and Southend would have to be reawarded.
</P>
<P>
The financial irregularities uncovered at LTS Rail could easily
have occurred in the public sector, he said, seeking to bolster
Tory morale over an increasingly accident-prone privatization.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that commuters using the lone would realize
that privatization promised better services in the longer term.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the timetable for privatization would continue
as planned.
</P>
<P>
"It (privatization) is not off the tracks," he said," It has
not thrown the timetable into chaos. It is tiresome that we will
have to refranchise the LTS line, but that's all."
</P>
<P>
The management buy-out of LTS Rail services was scrapped on
Thursday night after Christopher Kinchin-Smith and Roger Turner,
the managing director and finance director respectively of LTS
Rail, were removed from their posts.
</P>
<P>
The removal followed an internal British Rail (BR) inquiry into
an alleged fraud, although no evidence was found linking either
director with the allegations.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry followed an audit by BR accountants which found
evidence that LTS Rail was depriving London Underground of its due
share of revenue from Travelcards amounting to 30,000 pounds
(45,900 U.S. dollars) a month.

<HEADLINE> Plan Launched In Beijing to Improve People's Weekend Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A plan was launched today in
the Chinese capital to encourage local residents to spend their two
days-off each week visiting cultural and sports facilities or
taking a trip to suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The plan, sponsored by a dozen of the city's cultural,
educational and travel organizations, includes opening museums and
gymnasiums to the public, free or at lower prices, providing the
citizens with access to computer centers, and organizing tours of
the suburbs during the two days-off each week.
</P>
<P>
Since China adopted a five-day work week system last may,
how to spend the two-day weekend more enjoyably has posed a
problem to many ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 museums have been open to primary and middle
school students free of charge since the winter holiday started
about ten days ago.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 20 gymnasiums open to the public, and the
new plan demands that all the 87 gymnasiums in the city open at
weekends.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Aims at Stable Transition of Macao: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Foreign Minister
Jaime Gama said today that his government will make efforts to
ensure a stable transition of Macao so that bilateral relations
between Portugal and China will be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister arrived here tonight en route to Beijing
for an official visit beginning February 12.
</P>
<P>
In a brief speech upon arrival, Gama said his government will,
in accordance with the joint declaration on the question of Macao
signed by the two governments in 1987, create favorable conditions
for a stable transition of Macao before it reverts to China's
exercise of sovereignty in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Gama said the Portuguese government attaches great importance
to relations between Portugal and China, and has been enjoying
good cooperation with China in many fields.
</P>
<P>
"The Portuguese government encourages contacts with China
during the transitional period of Macao," he said, "so that our
friendly relationship will be strengthened."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said his visit to Beijing will help
pave the way for the upcoming Europe-Asia summit meeting to be
held soon in Bangkok. One purpose of his visit is to help promote
dialog between the European Union and Asian nations including
China.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay here, the foreign minister will meet
with the Macao Governor, officials of the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Liaison Group and the head of the Macao Legislative Assembly.

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises Macroeconomic Policies of Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The prospects of economic
growth in Pakistan appeared "very favorable" with inflation
gradually declining and international reserves recovered, the head
of an international Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen about his current mission here, Mohamed A.
El-Erian said the Pakistan economy's response to the
implementation of structural reform and management policies had
been very encouraging.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan's economic growth was favorable, with
inflation dropping from 15 percent in December 1994 to 10 percent
a year later and international reserves of the State Bank of
Pakistan in a strong position.
</P>
<P>
The favorable developments, he said, reflected the authorities'
actions to tighten fiscal and monetary policy, the intensification
of structural reforms, and the availability of timely financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said the continued macroeconomic policies would have further
favorable effects on the process of economic growth, the balance
of payment position and reserves, and economic diversification.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the IMF would continue to support
Pakistan's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
On releasing the second part of the 600-million-US dollar
stand-by loan approved by the IMF Executive Board on December 13
last year, he said the delegation recommended releasing the second
instalment of around 80 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the Pakistani rupee's devaluation, he said the IMF did not
recommend to Pakistan to further devalue the currency. The
current policy followed by the government in this regard was quite
appropriate, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of the devaluation of the Indian rupee on the
Pakistani rupee and exports, Erian said that according to
analysis, the combined shares of Pakistan's and India's exports in
the international market were very small.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was competing with many other countries including
India regarding exports, therefore it was not necessary to devalue
the Pakistani rupee if India devalues its own currency.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani currency should be readjusted in accordance with
the fundamentals of its economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the privatization process in Pakistan, Erian said the team
studied the process in various sectors including finance, industry
and power, and he described the process as going very well.

<HEADLINE> Two Suspects Arrested for Causing Blackout in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Two suspects have been
arrested for causing an hour-long blackout in western Beijing on
January 19.
</P>
<P>
The two are Tan Guangkai, 34, a crane driver with a local
transport company, and his colleague Wang Lizhen, a 43-year-old
worker.
</P>
<P>
On January 19, they were on the same shift at a construction
site in western Beijing, responsible for the operation a
50-tonnage truck-crane. Tan is the crane driver and Wang's work is
to monitor the operation of the crane.
</P>
<P>
At 5 pm, the crane caused a traffic jam and was thus asked to
be removed. However, Tan, violated the security regulation and
left his work only to play cards in a resting room. Wang, who
had no crane driving pass, illegally drove the crane with no one
monitoring the crane operation.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the crane arm struck a 220-Kv high-pressure
electricity-transmitting line, causing an hour-long blackout in
western Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The case is under further investigation.

one can promise there will be no flash in international
competition."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier, German Chancellor Discuss Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUNICH, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier
Zhu Rongji held talks in Bonn Friday with German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl on bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who began his visit to Bavaria today, said no fundamental
conflicts of interest and no historical disputes exist between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
China and Germany, who respect each other and enjoy very good
relations, have economies which complement each other very well,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the two countries share identical or similar views on
many major international issues, and it is the common wish of the
two peoples to further bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Germany in July last
year and Kohl's visit to China last November have greatly promoted
the development of Sino-German relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier said his current visit is aimed at
consolidating those achievements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Chancellor Kohl said that
Germany, with an eye not only on its economy but also on the 21st
century, attaches importance to its relations with China, which
play a key role in Germany's relations with Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We will work for the development of stable friendly
German-Chinese relations and the deepening of mutual cooperation
in all fields," said Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Germany will strive to provide an impetus to developing the
European Union's ties with China, he said. His country sticks to
its one-China policy and recognizes the People's Republic of China
as the sole legitimate government of China with Taiwan its
inalienable part.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed willingness to expand economic, trade,
science and technology cooperation and agreed to promote contact
between businesses in the two countries and strengthen cooperation
in professional training.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who began his seven-day visit to Germany Tuesday, also met
with Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt in Bonn on Friday, and
with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel late Thursday, for talks on
wide-ranging bilateral cooperation, particularly in economy.

<P>
VIENNA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Michael Von Gruenigen of
Switzerland won his fifth World Cup giant slalom of the season and
the World Cup title on Saturday after leading home a Swiss one-two
in Hinterstoder, Austria on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Von Gruenigen, second after the first leg just 0.06 of a
second slower than Austria's Mario Reiter, clocked a combined
time of two minutes 40.61 seconds in front of an exuberant crowd
of 12,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
Compatriot Urs Kaelin, winner of a giant slalom in Flachau
last month, was second for the second consecutive race in a time
of 2:40.96. Reiter was third in 2:41.55.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Alberto Tomba moved up from eighth to fourth place
after a storming second run. He had clocked the fastest
intermediate time in the first run before making several crucial
mistakes on the lower part of the piste.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a racer had won five giant slaloms in
the same season since the great Ingemar Stenmark.
</P>
<P>
The Swede won 15 giant slaloms, including an Olympic gold
medal at Lake Placid, in a row over two winters from March 1978
to February 1980.
</P>
<P>
Von Gruenigen's win on one of the most demanding slopes on the
circuit left him on an unbeatable 720 points, ahead of Kaelin on
501, with just one giant slalom remaining at the World Cup finals
in Lillehammer in March.
</P>

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Cancels Japan Meeting Over Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam today cancelled a meeting with Japanese lawmakers as
part of an escalating row between the two countries over a
disputed island.
</P>
<P>
The President dismissed Japan's claim to Tokto Island in the
Sea of Japan as "intolerable," presidential spokesman Yoon
Yeo-joon said.
</P>
<P>
He cancelled a meeting with a delegation from the Japanese
ruling coalition on February 12, due to include discussions over
sovereignty of the Tokto island which lies half way between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said in Tokyo Friday
that the tiny Tokto island -- called Takeshima in Japanese -- was
part of Japanese territory, following South Korea announcement of
plans to build a wharf on the rocky islet.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has rejected Japanese demands to stop work on the
island. South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Suh Dae-won said
Friday Seoul was exercising its sovereign rule over the island and
that Japan's claim is "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"The construction of the wharf is the legitimate exercise of
our sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Japan has claimed the islands since 1905 when it signed an
agreement with Korea that paved the way for Tokyo's 35 year
colonial rule of the Korean Peninsular which ended in 1945.
</P>
<P>
South Korea claims Tokto was part of Korea before Japan's rule.
</P>
<P>
In an unusually tough-worded statement, presidential spokesman
Yoon said, "whenever Japan has had the opportunity, it has
repeatedly made absurd remarks, beautifying its past colonial rule
and acts of aggression on the Korean Peninsula, instead of
reflecting on such acts."
</P>
<P>
"We will never accept such absurd remarks and will take a tough
stance against them from now on," he said.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute could worsen the already sensitive
relations between the two countries. The latest row ignited as
Japan prepared to declare an exclusive 200- mile (320-kilometer)
economic zone around its shores. Seoul's plan for a wharf is
apparently an attempt to block the Japanese move.
</P>
<P>
Japanese coast guard ships routinely appear near the islet in
an apparent show of ownership.

NEW DELHI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian Parliament
Affairs Minister V.C. Shukla has become the first person accused
in the multi-million dollar bribery Hawala case to call for the
removal of charges against him, the Hindustan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a charge sheet
against Shukla on January 23 for allegedly receiving a huge sum of
money from illegal foreign exchange dealers (Hawala dealers).
</P>
<P>
Shukla, together with two other cabinet ministers, resigned
from the cabinet on January 17 for alleged involvement in the
multi-crore rupee bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, two days before the next hearing of the
Hawala case in a special court, Shukla filed a petition on Friday
saying that the charge sheet against him had been filed with "mala
fide intention" for the purpose of gravely prejudicing him in the
forthcoming (general) elections.
</P>
<P>
The petition went on that there is no "admissible material"
which has been disclosed in the charge sheet against the
applicant.
</P>
<P>
However, a related report said that the CBI Friday filed
additional documents in the special court to support its charges
against the three resigned ministers.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Talks at ACFROC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the
reunification of the motherland is in the basic interests of the
Chinese nation and the common aspiration of all the Chinese people
including compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and overseas
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks at a meeting held by the All-China
Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (ACFROC) to greet the
lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government and people are confident,
determined and capable of fulfilling the smooth transfer of power
and the stable transition of Hong Kong and Macao and maintaining
the long-term stability and prosperity in the two places.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he noted, President Jiang Zemin put forward eight
propositions on the Taiwan issue, which won support from all the
Chinese people including compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan
Straits, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
On the commemoration of the first anniversary of Jiang's
speech, Premier Li Peng profoundly elaborated the eight
propositions, he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the reunification of the motherland, Qian
said, "we will promote the exchange and cooperation between the
two sides of the Straits in accordance with the principles of
'peaceful reunification' and 'one country, two systems', while
opposing forces advocating Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the returned overseas Chinese,
relatives of overseas Chinese remaining in the homeland and
overseas Chinese will be united more closely and make more
contributions for China's rejuvenation and the reunification of
the motherland.

<HEADLINE> China to Curb Price Rise of Chemical Fertilizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China will take tough measures
to rein in excessive price rise of chemical fertilizers this year,
Vice Premier Jiang Chunyun said here today.
</P>
<P>
The distribution order of major farm-use materials, chemical
fertilizers in particular, must be firmly rectified to maintain
price stability for the interests of farmers, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after soliciting reports by the inspection
teams dispatched by the State Council, China's highest governing
body, to 14 provinces and regions to check market supply of
chemical fertilizers in the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of problems in production, distribution and
supply of chemical fertilizers across the country at present,
resulting in continuous price rise that has been strongly
complained about by farmers, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The issue has a major bearing on agricultural development and
stability in rural areas, and should be seriously addressed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier urged local governments and concerned
departments to strengthen management on production and supply of
chemical fertilizers. Efforts should also be made by fertilizer
producers to increase output and improve quality of their
products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is necessary to strictly control the prices of
both imported and domestically-made chemical fertilizers, he said,
adding that random or excessive collection of various fees should
also be stopped in all links of the supply chain.

CANBERRA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan whipped Australia 4-1
in the first of two football friendly matches played in
Wollongong, south of Sydney, late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the top Asian soccer nation, met no further trouble to
hammer the second-string Australian squad and dominated throughout
the game with its speedy and skillful attackes.
</P>
<P>
Japan led 1-0 at halftime after a 35th minute free kick from
Motohiro Yamaguchi.

<P>
Australia were reduced to 10 men soon after halftime when
midfielder Milan Blagojevic was sent off for his second bookable
offence for a tackle from behind.
</P>
<P>
Takuya Takagi added the second goal for Japan in the 62nd
minute when he took a pass from Kitazawa.
</P>
<P>
Takagi put Japan 3-1 up in the 86th minute when he scored from
an acute angle after getting in behind the scrambling defence.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hrawi's Proposal on Elections Arouses Mixed Reactions (by Shao Jie) (part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shiite House Speaker Nabih Berri, who has been campaigning
for larger electoral constituencies and for holding the
elections on the national or governorate level, refrained from
making a direct comment on Hrawi's proposal until today.
</P>
<P>
A violent attack at the proposal was launched Friday by
Maronite Christian member of the parliament and former minister
Suleiman Franjieh who repeated his position calling for a
division of the state into five electoral constituencies based
on the governorates.
</P>
<P>
"We think that the governorates are the base for a
project of the national fusion...and I believe that the most
important way for the national fusion today is the five
governorates," said the former minister, who was sacked by
Prime Minister Hariri from the government in a cabinet
reshuffle last May.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that defining the district into a single
constituency would not lead to the national fusion but only
"contribute to the sectarianism."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Christian opposition National Bloc Party
reiterated its stance calling for the boycott of elections "as
long as public liberties and free decision-making are
confiscated" in view of Israel's occupation of the southern
Lebanon and Syria's military presence in the rest parts of
this country.
</P>
<P>
After a regular meeting of the Party's Executive Committee
Tuesday, a statement was issued, expressing astonishment at
President Hrawi's proposal to hold the polls on the district
level then on the national level when the national
reconciliation pact, known as the Taif peace accord, provided
for adopting the governorates as an electoral constituency.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently the electoral proposal concealed a government
scheme aimed at containing all winners at the district level,
whom the authorities do not favor, and excluding them from
the second phase of the polls," the statement charged.
</P>
<P>
It also asserted that the party, whose president Raymond
Edde has been living in self-exile in Paris for almost two
decades, is determined to boycott the elections as long as
foreign forces remained in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The National Bloc Party was among the Christian groups who
boycotted the last elections in 1992, which they charged were
not neutral and honest in view of Syria's failure to
redeploy its estimated 35,000 troops in Lebanon to the
country's eastern Bekaa Valley as the Taif Accord demanded.
</P>
<P>
Another prominent Christian opposition leader, President of the
rightwing National Liberal Party Dory Chamoun denounced President
Hrawi's election proposal as "unrealistic, undemocratic and
lacking seriousness."
</P>
<P>
"I consider the proposal is impractical and aims at
distracting people from important matters...We have seen how
long it took to count only 4,000 votes at bi-elections when
Deputy Nasri Maalouf was elected...It would take ages to do
the same on a national level," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chamoun urged the government to hold elections on the
district level in order to have a largely-representative
parliament.

<P>
HARBIN, China, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China's world champion
Chen Lu held off a challenge from Tatyana Malinina of Uzbekistan
to win the women's figure skating title at the Asian Winter Games
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen received a factored 1.5 points after the free skate.
</P>
<P>
Skating to a Russian music, Chen started with a solid triple
axel leading to a double jump.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Chen nailed four triple jumps, attracting
cheers from a packed house of 4,000 in the Heilongjiang Skating
Rink.
</P>
<P>
Malinina, second after Chen in the short program on Friday,
received 3.0 points to take the silver medal, the third medal for
Uzbekistan which is making a debut to the games.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to Japanese Fumie Suguri.
</P>
<P>
Hiromi Sano, the winner at the 1995 Asian championships which
Chen skipped because of injury, finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who topped the short program with a facorted 0.5 score,
received 1.0 in the free skate which is worth two-thirds of the
total score.
</P>
<P>
Four out of the seven judges gave Chen 5.6 points for the
technical merit and three gave her 5.8 for the artistic
presentation.
</P>
<P>
"I did not skate my best," said Chen, who was so nervous that
she fell in practice just minutes before the competition.
</P>
<P>
"I could not concentrate myself because of camera flashes from
spectator stands," she added.
</P>
<P>
Malinina, third-place finisher at the Asian championships,
skated to a European-style music and nailed four difficult jumps.
</P>
<P>
Four judges gave her 5.4 points for the technical merit
and two marked 5.6 and three 5.4 for the presentation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hrawi's Proposal on Elections Arouses Mixed Reactions (by Shao Jie) (part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Mixed reactions have been
expressed on a proposal leaked to the press by Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi to hold the general elections later this year in two
phases, one on the district level and another on a national
level.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe that the proposal aims at
preventing a boycott of the elections by Christians similar to
that happening in the last elections in 1992, and giving
opposition forces the opportunity to vote and elect their
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr has
declared that the polls will be held in the summer between
mid-August and before October 5.
</P>
<P>
"The elections should start sometime after August 15 and
finish before October 5...That is why the month of September is
the best time to hold them," Murr announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi disclosed the proposal earlier this month to his
visitors, who, in turn, released it to the media which they have
continuously given prominence in their political reports and
editorials.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the top winners of the first round,
which is to be held on the district level, will run for national
elections in the second phase.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri called last night for more
discussions and studies on Hrawi's proposal in order to dispel
fears.
</P>
<P>
"We have not taken an decisive idea in this regard until now,"
the multi-billionaire prime minister told his guests at an
Al-Iftar (dinner in the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan) at his
Beirut residence, "and we are listening to all the people,
discussing and trying to collecting the ideas."
</P>
<P>
"My stand from this proposal is the long consideration, more
study and a removal of fears," he said, "there should not be an
election law which is regarded by part of the Lebanese as against
them."
</P>
<P>
He promised that his government will work out an election law
which will obtain an "approval by a majority of the Lebanese
people."
</P>
<P>
Druze chieftain and Minister of the Displaced Walid Jumblat
welcomed Hrawi's proposal. "Of course this project needs a
profound discussion and study," the minister told reporters in
his residence in the Shouf mountainy village of Mokhtara Friday,
"but I believe that this project is the fittest for the
representation of the districts and the representation on the
national level in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the London-based international Arabic
newspaper Al-Hayat earlier this week, Jumblat said President
Hrawi's election proposal resolved the dilemma over the election
law by adopting both the smaller and larger electoral
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Hrawi's project corresponds to the Syrian
leadership's aspirations, if we may say so, to have its allies in
Lebanon united and avert any conflict between them," Jumblat
said.
</P>
<P>
Jumblat strongly opposes holding the elections on the basis of
the governorate or "mohafazat," fearing that his Druze supporters
might be overwhelmed by a hostile Christian majority in the Mount
Lebanon governorate.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Outbreak of cerebro-spinal
meningitis (CSM) has killed 464 people in northern Nigerian Kano
and Katsina states, the Guardian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
About 273 have died in Kano and 191 in Katsina, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Kano State Commissioner for Health, Hajiy Nafisat Kabir,

</P>
<P>
She said over 1,000 people in the state were infected with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak, she said, was first reported in Gwarzo council.
The villagers attributed the outbreak to the lack of potable
water. They said that they had to trek about 20 kilometres to a
neighbouring council to fetch bore-hole water.
</P>
<P>
The CSM was characterised by high fever, severe headache,
vomitting, and stiffness of neck and unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner appealed to all local governments to make
efforts to contain this dreaded epidemic and called on the public
to avoid over-crowding.
</P>
<P>
While in Katsina State, 826 cases were reported between
December last year and this month.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Commissioner of Health, Alhaji Sani
Saulawa Baba, some vaccines have been supplied to contain CSM
spread.

<HEADLINE> SFA Set to Discipline Former Barings Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Futures
Authority (SFA), which regulates the City of London brokers, said
Friday it is preparing to take disciplinary action against some
former executives of the collapsed merchant bank Barings.
</P>
<P>
The authority's lawyers have finished studying its own
investigation into 12 executives including Andrew Tuckey, the
former deputy chairman of Barings, and Peter Norris, the former
chief executive of the investment banking arm.
</P>
<P>
The SFA is expected to "downgrade" executives, for example, to
forbid them from taking certain executive positions for several
years, but not necessarily ban them from working in the City.
</P>
<P>
The SFA has followed in the tracks of the Board of Banking
Supervision's report into the collapse, which blamed the
disastrous 830 million pounds (1.2 billion US dollars) trading
loss on weak controls and incompetent management.
</P>
<P>
Of the dozen, 11 had their SFA licenses suspended soon after
the collapse and were either dismissed from Barings or asked to
resign.
</P>
<P>
Tuckey was given a temporary permit which allows him to
continue working as a consultant on corporate finance for
Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch bank which acquired
Barings.

<P>
HOHHOT, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The civil aviation industry of
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in North China has enjoyed a
rapid growth over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
During the country's Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995),
the region invested 310 million yuan in airport expansion projects
in Xilin Hot, Ulan Hot and Tongliao cities.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the region has seven airports with 17 air routes
linking the region with 30 cities at home and abroad. A new route
between the region's capital with Ulan Bator in Mongolia has just
been opened, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
To meet the needs of the growing passenger volume, the region's
airline has also imported four Boeing 737 aircraft in the past few
years, bringing the total number of its airplanes to 12.
</P>
<P>
The region's airline carried 183,000 passengers last year, 1.3
times the figure in 1990.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 100,000 of the
500,000 Rwandese refugees in Ngara District, Kagera Region,
Northwestern Tanzania, have shown wilingness to return home.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today from Ngara, their
desire was sounded to Rwandese Prime Minister Pierre Selestin
Rwigema during his visit to the refugee camps in Ngara District
mid this week.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the refugees there that they were
needed at home to rehabilitate their country torn by civil war.
</P>
<P>
Rwigema assured the Rwandese refugees, believed to be 700,000,
of their safety.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would ensure that any one who
invaded areas belonging to those returning home would be removed
and land at Kagera National Park would be allocated to them.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda prime minister condemned those who propagated that
the Rwandese government wanted the refugees back home to work on
farms which were abandoned long time ago.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Mother, Son Held In Tanzania Over 5.4-Million-Dollar Drug Haul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Police in Moshi Town,
Northern Tanzania, have held a mother and her son allegedly for
unlawful possession of five tons of drugs worth about 5.4 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Police sources named the suspects as Mrs. Salome Kisaka, 41
and Mr. Wilbold Kisaka, 18, all residents of Kanji village in
Kilimanjaro Region, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested last Wednesday by the anti-drug squad after
trailing them for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Other two suspects connected to the contraband were at large,
police sources said, adding that they were now in a neighbouring
country and the INTERPOL had launched a big manhunt to bring them
back to the country.
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects is said to be Focus Kisaka, who is
believed to be the husband of Salome.
</P>
<P>
A police statement said this was the second big haul of the
drugs found in the country.
</P>
<P>
More than five tons of the same drug from India were
intercepted by police at Dar es Salaam in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The drugs packed in 200 gunny bags are also suspected to
originate from India en route to a European country.
Investigations by police shows that the haul was part of a
consignment intercepted at Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Moshi police sources said the drugs were processed and packed
in a form of chocolate packets and then to pocket in the gunny
bags.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Moshi resident magistrate's court have
confirmed that the duo would appear in court soon.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Japan Aims to Regain Asia's No. 1 in Winter Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan will try all out
to regain the status as Asia's top winter sports country in the
Nagano Winter Olympic Games in 1998, a top Japanese sports
official said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiya Yamazaki, chief of the Japanese delegation to the Asian
Winter Games which ends on Sunday, said that Japan should do "a
thorough self-examination" on its loss of the Asia's top spot.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the overall winner in the previous two games, both held
in Sapporo of Japan, has collected eight golds here and will vie
for the third place with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Two-time overall runner-up China has won 13 golds to assure the
top spot at the medal tally while Kazakhstan, a debutant to the
games, has sealed a second place with only one day to go.
</P>
<P>
"Japan will have to win the recognition (as Asia's No.1) in the
Nagano Olympics," said Yamazaki. "For this goal, we must work very
hard."
</P>
<P>
Japan sent here a team mainly comprised of second-string
athletes while its top skaters and skiers were competing in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"What we have achieved here did not live up to our
expectation," the Japanese delegation chief said.
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki noted that the young Japanese athletes were catching
up with their more famous countrymen.
</P>
<P>
"There is no big gap between the top-notched athletes and these
youngmen and women here," he said. "They will get more mature in
the 1998 Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki said he was surpised with Asia's rapid improvement
in the winter sports.
</P>
<P>
"The progress by China and South Korea has raised this games
one or two notches, the appearance of Kazakhstan has made it even
better," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Asia has come into a new era, in which no country can be
runner-away leader any longer," he added.

<HEADLINE> ILO Africa Chief Hails Tanzanian Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The International
Labour Organisation (ILO) Africa Regional Director, E. G. Mabere
has described the Tanzanian leaders as being able to tackle
the economic problems facing the workers and peasants.
</P>
<P>
Mabere told reporters here on Friday that the Tanzanian
government recognised self-reliance as the only alternative to
relieve the country from poverty.
</P>
<P>
"The country should not depend on external assistance," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mabere said Tanzania was endowed with potential natural
resources which, if utilised properly, would boost the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
On the status of the Tanzanian workers in the ILO standards,
Mabere said that rural workers had relatively better living conditions
than those in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that the urban workers faced serious economic problems
caused by retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the ILO was giving the informal sector much
attention, especially where the formal sector was
mal-functioning.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit in the country, the ILO director met
with Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye and Minister for Labour and
Youth Development Sebastian Kinyondo.
</P>
<P>
He also met with the leaders of the Tanzania Federation of
Trade Unions, Organisation of Tanzania Trade Unions and the
Association of Tanzania Employers.
</P>
<P>
Mabere will leave for Kenya today.  enditem

<HEADLINE> 2,600 Foreigners Barred From Entering Indonesia in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,606 foreigners
were barred from entering Indonesia in 1995 and 680 Indonesians
were on the immigration's list of people banned from leaving the
country, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Immigration Pranowo told a recent hearing
with the House of Representatives that the immigration's blacklist
expanded last year compared to 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, there were 665 Indonesians and 1,622 foreigners on the
list.
</P>
<P>
Pranowo said that while some of the travel bans were imposed by
his office because the people violated some immigration rules,
there were also bans that were requested either by the Attorney
General, the Minister of Finance or the chief of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
By law, the Attorney General can impose a travel ban on people
wanted by the police or those facing court trials while orders
from the Minister of Finance are usually connected with tax
matters. Travel bans ordered by the armed forces chief are
usually for political reasons.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Supports Ending of Iraqis' Suffering without Touching on Iraq's Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan supports all efforts
aimed at alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people in a
framework that would respect the unity, territorial integrity and
sovereignty of Iraq, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Today's local daily Jordan Times quoted Information Minister
Marwan Muasher as saying Friday that the kingdom is contacting
with all countries concerned, particularly Arab countries, to help
such endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Marwan Muasher spoke in response to a recent remark of
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry in the Washington Institute
for Foreign Policy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of defense said last Tuesday that "I think
there are things which we and Jordan and other nations in the
region can do to accelerate the demise of the present regime of
Iraq. We are already cooperating in some actions."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give details of the purported actions.
</P>
<P>
When pressed for a direct comment on Perry's assertions,
Muasher only said that "Jordan's policy vis-a-vis Iraq has not
changed" and that the kingdom fully repected the unity,
territorial integrity and sovereignty of its eastern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The minister, the kingdom's first ambassador to Israel before
he assumed the post of information minister in the new government
formed last week, also denied reports that the government had
placed a ban against Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Sahaf
entering Jordan in retaliation for his verbal attacks against
Jordanian policy.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Welcomes Talks With Cambodia on Border Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam said today that it
welcomes talks with Cambodia to seek a peaceful settlement of
their border dispute.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that to end the dispute
peacefully was also a consistent stand of the Vietnamese
government, the Vietnam News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks after the Cambodian government
issued a bulletin Wednesday to urge local governments on both
sides of the shared borders to find a peaceful solution to their
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian-Vietnamese border dispute began last December
when Vietnamese villagers reportedly entered Cambodian territory
to farm in the eastern Kompong Cham, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng and
Takeo provinces.
</P>
<P>
On January 17, Cambodian Minister of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation Vag Huot summoned Vietnamese Ambassador
to Cambodia Tran Huy Choung for talks, but Choung denied that
Vietnamese villagers had entered Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Eleven Die After Drinking Toxic Water in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Eleven residents of a local
village in central Jaya, Indonesia, have died in the past month,
after reportedly drinking toxic water from a well, the Antara news
agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The head of the local health office, Dr. Subroto, was quoted by
Antara as saying that the victims drank water drawn from a well in
the village, Bodeh district.
</P>
<P>
Four of those who died were among the 23 people who had been
treated at the village's clinic. The other seven died even before
they were able to seek medical help.
</P>
<P>
The well, suspected to have been contaminated by some kind of
toxic substance, has been closed.
</P>
<P>
For years, the well, located near a dump site for cows' dung,
was the main source of water for residents who did not own one
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The deaths, which occurred in a row and in a relatively short
time, stirred up great anxiety among the locals.
</P>
<P>
The local government has ordered that the other wells in the
village be chlorinated.

<HEADLINE> Number of Foreign Enterprises in Lebanon Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 42 foreign
enterprises belonging to 15 nationalities have entered Lebanon
over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The figure includes 19 enterprises that were registered in 1995
and 33 others that were registered in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The statistics of the Lebanese Ministry of Economy and Trade
indicate that the French companies took the lead as they account
for nine companies, followed by the seven German companies, five
British ones, three Swiss, three Japanese, three American, two
Chinese, two Italian, and two Cypriot.
</P>
<P>
The rest belongs to six other nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The three U.S. enterprises have entered Lebanon during the past
two years despite the embargo which the United States imposed on
Lebanon 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Economic sources here asserted that these companies play an
active role in reviving the Lebanese economy particularly in the
fields of constructing, engineering studies and banks.
</P>
<P>
The figure of foreign banks and financial enterprises working
in Lebanon stands at 20, the sources said, indicating that these
firms draw more revenues than the local ones.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the foreign investments, the sources said the volume
of these investments during 1995 stood, according to the UNCTAD
(The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development), at 25
million U.S. dollars which is a meager figure in view of the
expectations of the Lebanese government in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Aiming at attracting more foreign investments, the Lebanese
government set up several free trade and industrial zones.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanon was not able to attract major international
industrial enterprises as is the case in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt
and Pakistan for those countries managed to make use of the
technology transfer and provide jobs to its labour force.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan, China Split Cross-country Golds in Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YABULI, China, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan and China
split the cross-country relay titles on the sixth day of the Asian
Winter Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan took the men's 4x10-kilometer relay by clocking one
hour, 56 minutes and 08.1 seconds. It was followed by Japan in
1:57:25.1 and China in 1:57:36.9.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 4x5-km relay, China clocked one hour, four
minutes and 43.6 seconds for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan finished second in 1:06:54.5 and Japan came third in
1:06:54.7.
</P>
<P>
Up to Saturday, Kazakhstan has snatched eight out of the 16
golds and China won four golds, Japan three and South Korea one.
</P>
<P>
The last two ski events, men's 10-kilometer and women's
5-kilometer cross-country races, will be held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Chengyi, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation, hailed
Kazakhstan, a debutant to the games, as one of the Asian ski
powers.
</P>
<P>
"Kazakhstan has displayed supremacy in the skiing, especially
in the biathlon and cross country events," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted China was trailing Kazakhstan and Japan in the sport.
</P>
<P>
"Although China has made a breakthrough in the aerials
freestyle, women's biathlon relay and cross-country relay, Japan
and Kazakhstan are much stronger than China on the snow," Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
"But as a whole, the Asian skiing level is still a far cry from
that of the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China would try to improve itself in the biathlon
and aerials freestyle events.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese aerials skiers will have a shot at a medal at the 1998
Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army Employee in South Korea Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Prosecutor's
Office today formally indicted Henry Mckinley, a civilian employee
for the United States Forces Korea (USFK), on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the South Korean investigative
authorities have brought a USFK person to court while keeping the
accused in custody since the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) was
signed between Seoul and Washington in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Mckinley, 36, was arrested here on January 20 on charges of
killing his South Korean girl-friend.
</P>
<P>
The American beat Kang Woo-kyung, 39, at an apartment in
southern Seoul, where they lived together, on January 18, causing
her to bump into a radiator. Kang died instantly of the shock.
</P>
<P>
Mckinley was quoted as telling police that he hit Kang on her
face and chest because he was angry over the woman making him feel
pain by touching the wounded arm.
</P>
<P>
Kang, who had been separated from her husband for six years,
had lived with Mckinley since last year after they got acquainted
at a U.S. club.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, some 40 murders have been linked to the
U.S. military presence in South Korea, where about 37,000 American
troops are stationed.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Seek Vatican's Role in Ending Israeli Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri has announced that his visit to the Vatican next
Saturday is aimed at seeking an "axis role" of the Vatican and
Pope John Paul II in helping Lebanon to free from the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Al-Nahar reported today that at an Al-Iftar (dinner
in the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan) held in Hariri's Beirut
residence Friday night in honor of some friends from his hometown
of Saida and south Lebanon, he expressed hope that the Vatican and
the Pope John Paul II will "play an axis role" in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that in the past few years, the
Lebanese officials had visited all the friendly countries and
discussed with them the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon and
the implementation of the U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been urging Israel to implement the U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
Hariri expressed his belief that Israel will implement the
resolution 425 and withdraw from the south.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported earlier that Hariri's scheduled meeting
with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican on February 17 is aimed at
pressing for a moderate Vatican stance on Lebanon following a
controversial message issued by a special Vatican-sponsored synod
on Lebanon last December.
</P>
<P>
The pope convened the synod to bolster peace between Lebanese
Christians and Moslems who had fought each other during the
1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
The most controversial points in the synod's message included a
call for the withdrawal of Israeli forces occupying a border strip
in south Lebanon and Syrian troops who control much of the rest of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The message evoked hostile reactions from Moslem leaders and
pro-Syrian political leaders in the country.
</P>
<P>
The pope is expected to issue a final statement on the synod
later this year.
</P>
<P>
Hariri will try to persuade the Pope John Paul II to come out
with a moderate statement that would be acceptable to all Lebanese
and help the government in its efforts to rebuild the country and
achieve national reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> New American Ambassador to be in Beirut Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Before his departure from
Washington to his post in Beirut, the new U.S. ambassador vowed
that he would work to consolidate the American-Lebanese
relations, saying "that, however, is my goal."
</P>
<P>
New American Ambassador, Richard Jones, is due to leave
Washington for his post to take the place of his predecessor Mark
Hambley, who was recalled back to Washington one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old U.S. diplomat was quoted this morning by the
Beirut largest-circulated An-Nahar daily as saying that his
mission is to secure conditions for the lift of a travel ban on
American citizens to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that he was not sure whether he would make that
achievement in a short period of several months.
</P>
<P>
Washington imposed the ban on American citizens' travel to
Lebanon in the middle of 1980s amid a wave of terrorist attacks
against American interests in Lebanon and in the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has repeated announced that it will
not lift the ban until the Beirut government disarms the
so-called terrorist organizations in this country, including the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
At a reception party held in Johns' honor by Lebanese
Ambassador to Washington Riad Tabbara in the latter's residence,
the Lebanese envoy reiterated his country's call for a lift of the
travel ban,
</P>
<P>
Describing the postponement of the lift as unjustified,
Tabbara pointed out, "Lebanon has been waiting for an American
traveler since a long time."
</P>
<P>
Richard Johns was quoted as saying that he would work with all
means in his capacity in activating the Lebanese-American
relations in order "not to disappoint the hopes."
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the difficult days Lebanon had passed, the
U.S. ambassador noted that Lebanon is recovering at the present.
</P>
<P>
"There is no mission nobler than that I help in this process of
recovery and building a stronger American-Lebanon relationship,"
the American diplomat underlined.
</P>
<P>
He saw that his government, in maintaining the travel ban,
felt a reason justifying the ban.
</P>
<P>
"But my mission is to secure the conditions for a lift of the
ban," he said, noting that he was not certain whether he could do
that in months.
</P>
<P>
"I can't make a promise on the results, but I can promise to
exert the efforts to return the Lebanese-American relationship to
the heat as it used to be," the new U.S. envoy declared.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Optimizes Structure of Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment has stepped
into a mature period of structural optimization in Wuhan, capital
of central China's Hubei province, said Yang Dezhen, deputy
director of the municipal foreign investment office.
</P>
<P>
The optimized structure is characterized by an increase of
average foreign investment scale, flow of foreign fund into areas
oriented by China's industrial policy, and a rise of investment
from such developed economies as the United States, Japan and
European countries, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Yang said, the average contractual investment of a
foreign-funded project was 1.36 million US dollars, over 40
percent higher than the figure of 1994. There were 70 projects
that had an average investment of over five million dollars and
their total investment amounted to about 1.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan municipal government approved 321 key production and
infrastructural projects in 1995, involving an investment of 870
million US dollars, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Among approved foreign-funded firms, 121 came from Europe,
North America and Japan, with a total investment of over 500
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Also, investment in real estate dropped 20 by percent from the
1994 figure, along with a slowdown in the construction of
entertainment and catering projects.
</P>
<P>
Operating foreign-funded enterprises earned 6.2 billion yuan in
1995, up 3.9 billion yuan over the 1994 figure. Spurred by a
number of giant foreign-funded firms, sectors of automobiles,
telecommunications, electronics, food processing and clothing have
entered into a stage of fast growth.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Air Cargo Route to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Express
Corporation (FedEx), one of the world's big-wings of air cargo
business, will open an all-cargo route between China and the
United States this March.
</P>
<P>
That will be the only US-based all-cargo carrier permitted to
fly in China by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC),
the country's top body of aviation business.
</P>
<P>
The FedEx flights will originate in New York on a route that
includes Chicago, Anchorage, Beijing, Shanghai, and a return to
New York via Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
As the first western exploiter on the Chinese air cargo market,
FedEx now is confident of its development.
</P>
<P>
"These three critical ingredients for providing with consistent
express freight are rapid customs clearance ability, reliable
pick-up and delivery capability within China. Actually, all these
ingredients stand for our fortes," said Brook Harwood, FedEx's
managing director and general manager of China operations.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that another important link will be added to
FedEx's extensive network when the new Sino-US route opens next
month.
</P>
<P>
"China is a crucial market for us, particularly with its
economy forecast to see robust growth well into the 21st century,
and with its air cargo industry expanding annually at over 20 per
cent, versus an estimated 6.6 per cent annual growth for the air
cargo business worldwide," he said.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to further expand its service network in
China, to cover as many as 59 cities by this June, according to
Harwood.
</P>
<P>
FedEx serves 210 countries and regions, providing fast package
delivery for nearly 2.4 million items each working day. The
company has some 500 aircrafts and 35,000 vehicles, and reported
revenues of 9.4 billion US dollars for its 1995 fiscal year.

The campaign has brought 23,000 hectares of new farmland and
4,000 hectares of additional freshwater fishing ponds to Xiaoshan,
accounting for 40 percent and 61 of the city's total, respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the polder area, five towns, nine farms have been set up,
and 79,000 people removed from urban areas have settled there, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The polder area has also become an important agricultural base
for grain, cotton, oil cereals, vegetables and fruits and an
industrial base of processing, light textiles, building industry,
chemical, food, machinery and metals.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, agricultural and industrial output value there
comprised 26 percent and 38 percent of the city's total,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Reclaiming land from the sea has not only boosted Xiaoshan's
economic development, but also strengthened the Xiaoshan Plain's
ability to prevent tides of the East China Sea and floods from the
Qiantang River nearby, it said.
</P>
<P>
As a sign of economic take-off, an international airport, will
be built in the city.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's crude palm oil
(CPO), tin and rubber markets ended the week mixed, with the CPO
ending higher while tin and rubber closing lower.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) finished the week easier as
prices eased 14 sen to 15.72 Malaysian ringgit (about 6.28 US
dollars) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Tin price opened lower on the first day of trading before
rebounding Wednesday. It fell on Thursday and Friday for lack of
domestic and foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume dropped to 440 tons from 464 tons last week with
interest mainly from local, European and Japanese buyers.
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM and London Metal Exchange was
reduced to 50 dollars per ton Friday compared with 70 dollars
previously.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market closed the week on a weaker note in
the absence of interest ahead of the long traditional festivals.
</P>
<P>
March RSS1 dropped 0.5 sen to 384.5 sen (about 1.53 dollars)
per kilogram from 385 sen (about 1.54 dollars) last Friday, while
the SMR20 shed 7.5 sen to 375 sen (about 1.5 dollars) per kilogram
against 382.5 sen (about 1.53 dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
Prices dropped for three consecutive days but rebounded
slightly on Thursday and Friday following stronger regional
markets.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that players were not active this week as they
were sidelined ahead of the long festive breaks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysia's CPO physicals ended the week higher on
better buying support coupled with a fear for disruption of
supplies ahead of the festive season.
</P>
<P>
The market opened on a quiet note but prices rebounded Tuesday
and held on until the weekend.
</P>
<P>
February South closed the week 40 ringgit better to 1,250
ringgit (about 500 dollars) per ton on Friday compared with 1,210
ringgit (about 484 dollars) last week.

</P>
<P>
Inna Chechkil, runner-up at the 1992 world championship and

"In addition, I also like to play football, basketball and
tennis," she added.

<P>
BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Medical Council has
proposed to amend the country's abortion law to prevent people
infected with HIV/AIDS virus from giving birth, the local press
said today.
</P>
<P>
The council wants a new clause stating that "if it is
scientifically proven that the child to be born would become
disabled or a carrier of a dangerous disease, the child can be
aborted, with the consent of two doctors."
</P>
<P>
The amendment would give women carrying HIV/AIDS the choice to
keep or abort the child, said Supachai Khunaratanapruk,
secretary-general of the council.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that the approval of the amendment was likely to
take a long time, as it would have to be submitted to the Public
Health Ministry, the cabinet and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Abortions are now allowed in Thailand only if the pregnancy is
dangerous for the mother or if it is an unwanted pregnancy in the
case of a rape.

<HEADLINE> Adams Called White House Before London Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA)'s political wing Sinn Fein, informed
the White House by telephone of "disturbing news" shortly before a
huge bomb explosion in London today, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
reporters that Adams called the White House "roughly an hour"
before the blast, saying that "he was hearing some very disturbing
news" and he would call the White House back later.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Sinn Fein leader did not explicitly
say he knew that a bomb would go off in London.
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the blast, Ireland's semi-official RTE radio
said that it had received a statement from the IRA declaring its
17-month cease-fire was over and blaming the British government
for squandering the chance for peace.
</P>
<P>
Although no one has claimed responsibility for the bombing,
which wounded more than 100 people, the U.S. official said that
there was "an obvious suspicion" linking the explosion with the
IRA's announcement.
</P>
<P>
Adams said that he was saddened by the explosion, but he argued
that it was caused by the British government which had refused to
enter into dialogue and substantive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, which brokered the ceasefire in
Northern Ireland in 1994, was shocked by the serious turn of
events, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been trying to persuade parties involved in the
Northern Ireland peace process to settle disputes over all-party
talks on the future of the region.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged all parties to continue the search for peace in
Northern Ireland and vowed to help promote the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton and British Prime Minister
John Major have jointly condemned the bombing.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto later
this month in Santa Monica, California, the White House announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, on February 23, is to discuss a series of issues
in advance of Clinton's state visit to Japan in April, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was apparently arranged when Clinton's National
Security Adviser Tony Lake met with Hashimoto in Tokyo during his
recent trip to Asia.
</P>
<P>
There was agreement that it would be useful for the two leaders
to meet informally so that they could get to know each other
personally and also review issues to be dealt with in greater
detail during the president's visit to Japan, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"We have such a range of interests in common that are important
to both governments, whether it's the cooperation on global
issues, the work we do together on everything from the Middle East

<HEADLINE> EDS-(Updated) hke -- Passenger Train Collision Kills Three in Eastern U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Two commuter trains
traveling in opposite directions collided in eastern U.S. this
morning, killing at least three people and injuring more than 160
others, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
One train carrying 650 rush-hour commuters and the other with
about 100 people aboard collided in a switching yard in Secaucus,
a New Jersey town about eight kilometers from New York City.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen of the injured suffered severe injuries such as
fractures and cuts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue crews treated some of the injured on site and rushed the
rest to nearby hospitals by a helicopter and ambulances. But some
of the injured had to walk to the nearest paved road because the
site is in a marshland and only accessible by dirt road.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Transit officials said the eastbound train, pushed
from behind by a locomotive, ran a stop signal and slammed into
the westbound train.
</P>
<P>
"The train that was moving east went three and a half car
lengths past the signal and then sideswiped the other passenger
train moving west," said Robert Randall, general manager of rail
operations.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the cause of accident was not immediately known.
It could be human error or mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
"There was a loud bang and sudden jerk," passenger Richard
Hirtler was quoted by the Associated Press as saying. "I could see
the Main Line (train) as it went by the other way, and I could see
the engine as it was torn up."
</P>
<P>
The crash disrupted service on two New Jersey Transit lines.
The uninjured commuters at the crash site were sent to their
destinations by buses and another train.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) finished the week weaker after prices succumbed to
selling pressure ahead of the long Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index fell 13.63 points to 1,059.55 this week,
the all share Emas Index shed 3.67 points to 300.80 while the
Industrial Index dropped 24.27 points to 1,916.99.
</P>
<P>
The market was riding high Monday when foreign funds showed
renewed interest in the region by taking advantage of the interest
rates differential following the short-term US rates cut.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index reached its highest level of 1,083.5 points
on February 6, and then was hovering at the 1,080 level.
</P>
<P>
However, selling pressure mounted towards the middle of the
week as players were hoping to get their cash in time before the
long festive break.
</P>
<P>
Despite the shortfall, dealers here said the market would stage
a rebound before it closes for the holidays and could possibly
touch the 1,100-level.
</P>
<P>
The main board trade volume this week was 1.131 billion shares
valued at 6.012 billion Malaysian Ringgit (about 2.4 billion US
dollars) from 1.021 billion shares valued at 5.418 billion Ringgit
(about 2.167 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover stood at 227.283 million shares
valued at 2.337 billion Ringgit (about 934 million dollars)
against 232.951 million shares valued at 1.876 billion Ringgit
(about 750 million dollars) previously.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Concerned About Malaysia's Armed Patrol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Thai
Fishery Department has expressed concerns that Malaysia's new
tough security measure could harm the bilateral relations, the
local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Four patrol boats from Malaysia's Pahang state close to the
Thai border have reportedly been armed with automatic rifles and
machine guns in line with the government's security order aimed at
safeguarding Malaysia's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Plodprasop Suraswadi, director-general of the Thai Fishery
Department, said Friday that he would ask the Foreign Ministry to
negotiate with the Malaysian government on possible ways to relax
the security measure where Thai fishermen are concerned.
</P>
<P>
He said that his department would try to use all peaceful means
to cope with the disputes over fishery between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Foreign Ministry, the Malaysian
government instructed its fishery officials late last month to
equip their patrol boats with war weapons to prevent armed foreign
fishermen from encroaching into its waters.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been strained since
last year when two Thai crewmen were shot dead by Malaysian naval
officials for allegedly fishing in Malaysian waters.
</P>
<P>
The two governments promised to solve the prolonged fishery
problems resulting from their overlapping claims on regional
waters, but no progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
Plodprasop said that Thai fishery officials stationed along the
Thai-Malaysian border have been ordered to disarm their patrol
boats.
</P>
<P>
With Thailand's disarmament of its patrol vessels, he expressed
the hope for a better attitude of Malaysia towards Thai fishermen.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- More pigeons will be flying
over the skies of this largest metropolis of China this year to
cater to the local residents' increasing enthusiasm for the bird.
</P>
<P>
The total number of pigeons on the People's Square in downtown
city will rise to 10,000 in a few months from 3,000 in last
October when pigeons first appeared there, according to Wang
Jizhuang, secretary general of the local pigeon association.
</P>
<P>
"By that time, the square will be a sea of pigeons which will
be found in the skies, on the ground or on the shoulders of
visitors," Wang said, adding that flocks of pigeons will be
released at a number of other downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
Today, more local residents have become pigeon-lovers and these
birds are well-protected in the square.
</P>
<P>
On sunny days, thousands of local residents would gather in the
square to buy special food for pigeons instead of bread chips, ham
and some other oily food as they used to do.
</P>
<P>
Releasing pigeons has also become popular on such occasions as
the opening of a business or wedding ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
"This new way of celebration is becoming more popular than the
traditional firecrackings," said Sun Yi, manager of a local agency
providing pigeon service. Sun's business has been flourishing
with soaring demand.

<HEADLINE> Haitian President Holds Consultations for PM Appointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT-AU-PRINCE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Haitian President Rene
Preval today continued consultations with the ruling Lavalas
Movement Party and other social sectors on the appointment of a
new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Baptiste Chavannes, considered one of the most likely
candidates for the premiership, told Xinhua that "on Wednesday,
President Preval asked me to form a government as prime minister."
</P>
<P>
He added that he had not accepted the offer but that
negotiations were continuing.
</P>
<P>
Chavannes, former coordinator of the commission overseeing the
transition from the Aristide to the Preval administration, said
that Haiti must start modernizing its economy, which Preval had
called for in his inaugural address.
</P>
<P>
This included the modernization of public enterprises and
agricultural and livestock production, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Haiti, one of the world's poorest countries, 85 percent of
the population is illiterate and 80 percent have no drinking water
and no health care.
</P>
<P>
Although 73 percent of Haitians live in the countryside, 71
percent of them own less than an hectare of land which is hardly
enough to scratch a living from.
</P>
<P>
Chavannes said that the Haitian government must start
negotiations with organizations who have promised to help the
country, including the Interamerican Development Bank, the
European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of Preval's first acts as president would be
to invite some 500 Haitians residing abroad to help by
contributing their professional expertise and capital to their
country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Determined to Ensure Bosnian Peace Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
pledged to do all that was necessary to prevent the worsening of
tensions in Bosnia which have increased rapidly in the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
Visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has
instructed chief negotiator Richard Holbrooke to make an urgent
trip to former Yugoslavia to seek compliance with the Dayton
accords, said U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
Burns told reporters that Holbrooke will warn the parties
involved that there will be "consequences" if they violate the
U.S.-brokered peace deal.
</P>
<P>
He said that Christopher had instructed Holbrooke, who mediated
the peace treaty last November in Dayton, Ohio, to travel to
Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The tensions arose after the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation
detained two Bosnian Serb officers earlier this month for alleged
war crimes. The Serb army has cut all contact with the U.S.-led
NATO peace implementation force (IFOR) to protest against the
detention.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that the Bosnian Serbs "should understand one thing
and that is there will be penalties for noncompliance with the
Dayton Accords". He said Holbrooke "has very explicit instructions
on what to say to the Bosnian Serbs."
</P>
<P>
Christopher himself will stay in Finland where he will have his
first meeting with newly-appointed Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeni Primakov on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to discuss the Bosnian situation, Middle East
peace process, arms control, NATO's eastward expansion and
preparations for U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Russia in
April.
</P>
<P>
Primakov arrived here today for the meeting.

BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Thaksin Shinawatra said that corrupt officials facilitated illegal
and dangerous modifications of buildings in the country, the
Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Safety standards of a number of buildings in Bangkok are being
questioned after fires hit eight shopping centers in the capital
city and nearby provinces since October last year.
</P>

The fires completely destroyed a few department stores, causing
enormous damages.
</P>

According to the report, Thaksin accused corrupt officials in

<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Panama received a record
tax revenue of 47.5 million U.S. dollars from the country's
merchant fleet last year, Abraham Sofer, chief of the Consular
Service and Shipping Department, said today.
</P>
<P>
The merchant navy also increased its ships to a record number
-- 950 ships of 9.3 million gross tons, thanks to a favorable law
which came into effect last July, Sofer said.
</P>
<P>
The law, called Law 36, gives groups with three or more ships
of 5,000-10,000 tons a discount of up to 20 percent in
registration fees.
</P>
<P>
Those groups which have ships of more than 100,000 gross tons
can be granted up to 50 percent discounts in both registration
fees and annual taxes under the law.
</P>
<P>
The Consular Service and Shipping Department also has helped
boost the business by managing to provide credit for big shipping
groups, Sofer added.

<HEADLINE> Spain Protests Belgium's Refusal to Deport Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish government today
decided to hold off on two extraditions requested by Brussels in a
tit-for-tat move after Belgian courts refused to deport two
suspected Basque ETA rebels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government said that, as far as Belgium was concerned, it
would no longer enforce two articles on cooperative crime fighting
in the Schengen Agreement, a pact which provides free movement
across European Union borders.
</P>
<P>
Today's decision was made soon after the Spanish government
recalled its ambassador to Belgium. The move is seen as a stronger
protest from Madrid against what it considers Brussels'
uncooperative attitude.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Carlos Westendorp said on
Wednesday that he was sorry about Brussels' decision and insisted
that the deportation of terrorists should not be hampered by
whether they had committed political crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Schengen Agreement, which took effect in March 1995, has
seven full members -- Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
Portugal, Germany and France.

<HEADLINE> Dominican Republic Denies Fishermen Robbed Air Crash Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Dominican Republic
today dismissed charges by the U.S. Defence Department that
Dominican fishermen had robbed the victims of Tuesday's air crash
off the country's coast.
</P>
<P>
The charges "are false, misleading, and malicious," Eugenio
Cabral, the Dominican Republic's director of Civil Defence, was
quoted as saying by reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Mike Doubleday said Thursday that the crew
of the USS Jefferson Island had claimed that many corpses found by
rescuers were robbed of money and identification documents by
Dominican fishermen in the area.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operations were suspended Thursday after 129 bodies had
been recovered and there seemed little possibility of finding
survivors from the plane, which was carrying 189 people, most of
them German tourists.
</P>
<P>
Cabral said the plane's black box, a device that records flight
operations, may have been located, but he did not reveal details.

<HEADLINE> Oil Workers Continue Strike in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Workers at a state-owned oil
company in Peru today continued their strike, which entered its
ninth day in the northern city of Talara.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the wives of 50 workers started a hunger
strike in the city.
</P>
<P>
Seven men joined the hunger strike in protest against the
government plan to privatize the oil enterprise, Petroperu, union
spokesmen said today.
</P>
<P>
Other labor leaders and activists have not joined the strike in
Talara because they are coordinating an imminent civic strike to
be held in the whole Grau region, the spokesmen added.
</P>
<P>
The strikers oppose the privatization because they believe that
it would result in mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Information received from Talara said the strike will peak
in the next five days with "more radical" measures.
</P>
<P>
The walkout, which had been planned to last for eight days,
began on February 1 and has been backed by five Opposition
legislators who have been in Talara since February 6.
</P>
<P>
National police in Talara was reinforced by officers from
Sullana and Piura to prevent "eventual disorders."
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 former Petroperu workers who accepted voluntary
retirement in 1991 are demanding the government pay their
benefits, which they have not received so far.

<HEADLINE> Holding Firm for Financing Takes Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A holding company was launched
Thursday to finance construction of a Sino-Singapore Industrial
Park in Suzhou City of east China's Jiangsu Province, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou Industrial Park Co. Ltd. has received 72 million
U.S. dollars of investment from 11 Chinese companies, including
Beijing-based China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import
and Export Corp and China Ocean Shipping Companies Group, and
local Suzhou Industrial Park Economic Development Co. Ltd. and
Jiangsu Province Investment Co.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou Industrial Park, close to Shanghai and with contruction
started in 1994, is regarded as an industrial community of
Singapore companies which have so far contributed the majority of
investment.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine overseas investors have signed contracts to start
business in the park and 20 pledged more than 30 million
U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The newly established company doubled the registered capital of
the Chinese side of the Suzhou Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
However, the increased funding does not change the shares of
China and Singapore in the park, Yang Xiaotong, municipal
communist party chief of Suzhou city, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore side will still hold 65 percent and China, 35
percent, of equity in the cooperative project.
</P>
<P>
The increase from both sides will raise the registered capital
for the park from 50 million U.S. dollars to 100 million
U.S. dollars.

BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has agreed to enter

the Bangkok Post said today.

</P>
<P>
According to the official, it was unfortunate that trade
between Thailand and Myanmar was lower than that between Myanmar
and Singapore, especially as Myanmar is much closer to Thailand
than to Singapore geographically.

Goods from foreign countries, including Thailand, are first
shipped to Singapore before transported to the Myanmar market.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Injects Funds to Keep Pegging Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) has recently injected about 300 million HK
dollars (38.46 million US dollars) into the interbank market to
stabilize the exchange rate between the HK dollar and greenback,
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
HKMA injected 293 million HK dollars into the interbank market
with the local dollar trading at 7.7305 to the US currency early
Friday.
</P>
<P>
After the injection, the Hong Kong dollar was steady, bid at
about 7.7310 HK dollar to the US dollar after the injection.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, banks in Hong Kong placed funds back
with the authority through the liquidity adjustment facility,
indicating there was no shortage of funds in the system.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA's move helped to counter the effects of the flood of
money that had come into the stock market from overseas since the
beginning of the year. The Hang Seng Index increased more than 12
percent in the past 40 days.
</P>
<P>
Demand for Hong Kong dollars from overseas investors had
strengthened the local currency in recent weeks, promoting the
liquidity injection, traders said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, local companies and individuals usually
stepped up cash withdrawals ahead of the Lunar New Year to meet
bonus payments and pass out cash gifts.
</P>
<P>
The authority's injection and withdrawal of funds from the
interbank system also successfully defended the Hong Kong dollar
from speculators' attack.

<HEADLINE> German Institute Calls for Lowering Criteria for EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- It would be "wise" to lower now
the strict criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty for the European
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), a German economic institute
said.
</P>
<P>
The lowering will benefit European integration while preventing
national economies from being weakened by the single currency plan
and averting social unrest, the Berlin-based institute said in its
latest weekly.
</P>
<P>
Without vigorous economic growth and improved employment, there
would be no sustained social stability, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the European Union nations, striving for meeting the
EMU criteria, must cut down their expenditure, and this will
probably lead to a worsening of the economic situation and
unemployment and thus trigger social instability.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty, signed in 1991, stipulates that all EU
members must meet the economic standards on inflation, budgetary
deficits, public-sector debts and interest and exchange rates
before 1997 for their EMU membership.

<HEADLINE> Former Top Bulgarian Leaders Acquitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Bulgaria
acquitted today former leaders of the country Todor Zhivkov and
Milko Balev, Bulgarian state television reported.
</P>
<P>
The court emphasized that the verdict is final and no appeal
should be made.
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov, former chairman of the Council of Ministers and of the
Socialist Party, was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment in
1992 for power abuse and was later placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
He, 84, was accused of spending public funds on luxury
apartments, cars and entertainment for his family and close aides.
</P>
<P>
However, the restrictions on his freedom became less and less
severe after the Socialist Party returned to power at the end of
1994. Zhivkov was released last July from house arrest and was even
allowed to attend parliament sessions.
</P>
<P>
Balev, a former Politburo member and Zhivkov's closest aide,
was sentenced to two years in prison in 1992 on charges of
unauthorized use of foreign exchange.

WUHAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Over the past ten years, central
China's Hubei has used nearly 1.3 billion US dollars in loans
provided by foreign governments to help improve infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Those loans have mainly benefited projects in the fields of
energy, communications and raw materials," said Bao Zhemin, a
provincial official responsible for distributing the loans.
</P>
<P>
Two power plants, built with loans from the Japanese and
Canadian governments, have been put into operation, and an
international airport and ring road in this provincial capital,
and two bridges over the Yangtze River have been built with
foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Loans extended by the Spanish, German, British and French
governments have enabled Hubei to install hundreds of thousands of
program-controlled telephone lines, improving telecommunications
here.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next five years, Hubei has plans to channel 2.5
billion US dollars in foreign loans into communications,
telecommunications, energy, and technical innovation in large and
medium-sized enterprises," Bao said.
</P>
<P>
"In those projects, we have a high degree of assurance that the

<HEADLINE> U.S Not to Tolerate Threats to Bosnia Peace: Holbrooke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Richard Holbrooke said today that he would travel to
Sarajevo, Belgrade and Zagreb this weekend to curb mounting
"serious challenges" to the Bosnian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, the chief mediator of the peace pact reached in
Dayton, Ohio, last November, said tensions in Bosnia had increased
sharply in the past few days and the United States would not
tolerate any threats to the implementation of the accord.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. will not tolerate the kind of threats that some of
the Bosnian Serbs have been making," Holbrooke told reporters
here after meeting Hungarian Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb army has suspended all contacts with the
U.S.-led NATO peace implementation forces after the Bosnian Muslim
authority detained two Serb military officers for alleged war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we are encountering some serious challenges to
Dayton," Holbrooke said, adding that Bosnian Serbs who signed the
Dayton pact must implement it.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipated all this and we will deal with it, but that's
the reason I am making an unplanned trip back to Sarajevo,
Belgrade and Zagreb this weekend," he said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said he would consult with Admiral Leighton Smith,
the commander of the NATO Implementation Force (IFOR), for his
assessment of whether the mission is in danger.

HAVANA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Rear Admiral Eugene
Carroll today called on the U.S. government to return the
Guantanamo military base to Cuba as a concrete step to normalize
relations.
</P>
<P>
The return of the base would not weaken U.S. security in any
way, Carroll added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military base in Guantanamo, 910 kilometers from
Havana, is neither used for military purposes nor has it any
strategic relevance, said the former navy officer.
</P>
<P>
Carroll led a delegation of former U.S. generals visiting the
Caribbean island for five days. They left here on Friday for
Florida, where they will hold a press conference on the visit.
</P>
<P>
Carroll said he would report to the U.S. Department of Defense
that the island is not a threat to U.S. security and would tell
the American public and government about the real situation in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
During the U.S. delegation's visit, General Ulises Rosales,
chief of staff of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba, said the
Cuban military was willing to open talks with high-ranking
U.S. military officers on an equal basis at any time.

ZAGREB, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs-of-Staff, General John Shalikashvili, today called on all
Bosnian rival parties to continue fulfilling their duties set by
the Dayton peace agreement and resolve problems through talks.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and the
Bosnian Army's Chief-of-Staff, General Rasim Delic, in Sarajevo on
the recent Muslim arrest of Serb military men and the NATO's
peacekeeping effort in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili told reporters after the meeting that he was
mostly satisfied with the process of implementing the military
part of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that the American side was worried about the
situation following the arrest of two senior Serb officers and six
soldiers on charges of war crime.
</P>
<P>
"This could make the implementing of the agreement more
difficult," Shalikashvili said.
</P>
<P>
He said the matter should be solved as soon as possible and
urged the Bosnian government to release those Serb detainees
against whom there is no evidence of war crime and allow the
International Committee of the Red Cross access to the others.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili said he was concerned over the Serb suspension of
all contacts with the Bosnian government and the NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
He described dialogue as essential for solving issues such as
the seizure.

TIANJIN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, North China's largest

environmental protection that started in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The city now has partners in 12 countries and regions for

agreements signed on cooperation in environmental protection, and
has gotten some 20 million US dollars' worth of low-interest loans
from the World Bank and 20 million yuan worth of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The city has completed a number of key environmental protection
projects with foreign cooperation. Using Australian and American
technology, the city built a wet-land waste water treatment
project which cost much less and is more efficient than a sewage
treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
Overseas management methods have also been introduced into the
city, which is trying to edge into the international market. Since
1993 it has made sewage treatment plans for 65 hospitals in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The majority of cooperative partners consider the cooperation
fruitful, according to local officials. World Bank officials say

<P>
BELGRADE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister
General Pavel Grachev said here today that his country greatly
regretted the arrest of Serb officers and soldiers in Bosnia by
the Muslim government.
</P>
<P>
"Even without this, the peace process is unfolding in a
complicated way and we think that none of us should take any
actions to further torpedo the process," Grachev told a press
conference after meeting with Yugoslav Defense Minister Pavle
Bulatovic.
</P>
<P>
Grachev said that Russia had already taken some practical steps
and would raise the issue at the forthcoming meeting between U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister said he had already discussed the issue
with the IFOR command during his visit to Bosnia Thursday. He also
visited the Russian troops stationed in northeastern Bosnia to
ensure the peace agreement with other IFOR soldiers.
</P>
<P>
A solution to the new crisis would also be sought through the
International Red Cross, he said.
</P>
<P>
Grachev said he believed these steps would be sufficient to
resolve the thorny issue. The Serb authorities have suspended all
contacts with the Muslim-Croat federation and with the IFOR to
protest against the arrests.
</P>
<P>
"Russia believes that Bosnian Serbs are duly implementing the
Dayton agreement provisions, as the IFOR command has also
confirmed," Grachev told reporters before winding up a two-day
official visit to Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Continue Climbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Stocks at the New York Stock
Exchange ended barely higher Friday, but enough to push several
market indexes to record levels.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 2.17 points at a new
high of 5,541.62. It was the fifth straight record for Wall
Street's closely watched indicator, its 10th in the last 11
sessions and its 12th high in the past 15 trading days.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues led decliners by a slim margin. Volume was
heavy at 476.63 million shares, ahead of Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
The broad market finished mostly higher. The NYSE's composite
index rose 0.29 to 349.44, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
rose 0.31 to 656.38, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.42 to
1,094.59. All three indexes broke through Thursday's record highs.
It was the sixth straight record for the Nasdaq composite and the
fifth consecutive high for the other two indicators.
</P>
<P>
But the American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 0.65
to 564.01, failing to top Thursday's all-time high of 564.66.
</P>
<P>
Some traders and analysts said the current strength in the
stock market is in large part the result of record investments of
cash into stock mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter earnings have been surprisingly robust, adds Ron
Hill, a market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co., who
cited earnings gains as a reason why his firm raised its 1996
target for the S&AMP;P 500 Friday to 700 from 675.
</P>
<P>
Some cyclical stocks, issues that perform well when the economy
is growing, outperformed the rest of the market, in a reversal of
Thursday's dominant strategy. Investors bought cyclicals on the
hope that those stocks would benefit the most from any further
interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
Stocks in the transportation sector edged high on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The early strength in Chrysler boosted other auto stocks. Both
Ford and General Motors climbed in active trading.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, another cyclical stock, also rose to more than 82 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
But other cyclical sectors were lower, including aluminum,
steel and airlines.
</P>
<P>
Consumer stocks, which had performed well on Thursday as
investors sought recession-proof names, sank on Friday. Losers
among the Dow industrials included consumer names Disney,
McDonalds and Coca-Cola.

<HEADLINE> Smith: Serbs Gain More by Taking Part in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) commander Admiral Leighton Smith said today he
believed that Serbs gained more by participating in than staying
out of the peace operation.
</P>
<P>
Smith was reacting to Thursday's decision by the Bosnian Serb
Army to suspend contacts with the IFOR until the release of
Bosnian serb officers who were arrested by Muslim authorities on
January 30. The Serb government has also severed all contacts with
the Muslim-Croat federation to protest against the arrests.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim government arrested two senior Serb officers and six
other soldiers in an IFOR-controlled area in Sarajevo on
allegations that they are suspected war criminals or witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that the IFOR still suggested that Serbs return to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that he had intervened with Bosnian Muslim leader
Alija Izetbegovic on behalf of the eight imprisoned Serb soldiers
and officers, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs have blamed the IFOR for not protecting the Serb
soldiers and officers in the IFOR-controlled area and have urged
the Smith to pressure the release of the detained Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that the Hague-based war crimes tribunal had called
on him to remain neutral and not to interfere in the process,
because it had become a judicial affair.

LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein president Gerry

<P>
But the leader of the IRA's political wing also said
that "an unprecedented opportunity for peace has foundered
on the refusal of the British government and the Protestant

He said Sinn Fein's peace strategy remained as the main
function of his party as well as his personal priority.
</P>
<P>
"All those who made genuine efforts to build the peace
process must keep their nerve in the face of predictable and
hypocritical reaction from political representatives who have
done nothing to encourage the risky search for a peaceful
settlement. That search must be redoubled," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Arrest of Serb Officers Blow to IFOR: Karadzic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- By arresting Bosnian Serb
officers in Sarajevo, the Muslims have dealt a heavy blow at the
Bosnia peace Implementation Force (IFOR) and architects of the
Dayton agreement, Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a session of the Municipal Council of the Serbian
Democratic Party in the northwestern Serb city of Banja Luka,
Karadzic said that Muslims had clearly shown that they did not
observe either the IFOR or the agreement, since they had
flagrantly violated its key provision on the freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
General Djordje Djukic, Colonel Aleksa Mrsmanovic and their
driver were arrested on January 30 in a NATO-controlled area in
Sarajevo by the Bosnian government on their way to talks with IFOR
officials. At least eight Serb officers and soldiers have been
arrested in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The government has accused the two officers of murder and of
organizing the killing of civilians during the three and half year
civil war. But the two Serb officers are not on the list of the
Hague war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR, which has to protect this right, has accepted the
position of impotence and humiliation, the Serb leader added.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, who is on the list of 52 war criminals indicted by
the Hague international tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, said
that one of the arrested, Gen. Djukic, had never participated in
combat operations as he was in charge of logistics issues in the
Serb Army.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authorities have responded the arrests with great
anger and have urged the IFOR commanders to pressure the Bosnian
government to release the detained Serbs. Meanwhile, the Serb side
has suspended all contacts and meetings with the Muslim-Croat
federation and the IFOR to protest the arrests.

<HEADLINE> Boeing to Hire More Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Seattle-based Boeing
Company is expected to hire at least 7,000 new and laid-off
workers by early 1997 to deal with increased work load created by
fresh orders, the "Wall Street Journal" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, another 3,000 job openings at the Boeing division
will be created to fill in the positions left over by retirees
during the same period, it said. That would bring the total number
of new hires to as many as 10,000, or 15 percent of the world
leading jetmaker's current work force.
</P>
<P>
The demand for new hands came after a long-awaited resurgence
in orders for new planes. But according to the report, Boeing,
which currently employs about 66,600, is unlikely to return to the
sky-high employment levels that accompanied the last peak in its
production cycle in 1991, when the commercial-aircraft unit had
96,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, Malaysia Airlines said it would order 25
wide-bodied aircraft worth 4 billion U.S. dollars from Boeing
Commercial Airplane Group over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Also in last month, the company signed a contract worth more
than 4 billion U.S. dollars to provide General Electric Co.'s
aviation services unit with as many as 259 passenger airplanes.

WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistani Foreign
Minister Assef Ahmad Ali today reiterated Pakistan's denial to the
rumor that it had purchased from China equipment that could be
used to make nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Ali described as "entirely speculative" the reports which
claimed that China sold Pakistan ring magnets used to refine
bomb-grade uranium.
</P>
<P>
"There is no truth in them. We have flatly denied that any such
thing has happened," Ali told reporters after meeting with Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
Ali also said Pakistan had very good relations with China. But
"there is nothing that should be of concern to the government of
the U.S.A.," he added.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Glen Davies refused to confirm the
issue of the ring magnets, but saying that "we are concerned about
reports of transfers from China to Pakistan."

regional security, trade and investment issues and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
They discussed "the current situation in Afghanistan at some
length, Both of them expressing concern over the humanitarian
situation in Kabul," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"They agreed that foreign interference in Afghanistan was
prolonging the conflict and expressed strong support for U.N.
special mission efforts," Davies noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has complained the
international community has not done enough to support the west
african peacekeeping force in Liberia known as ecomog currently
striving to restore peace in the war-torn west African state.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian chief of army staff, Maj.-Gen. Alwali Kazir, was
quoted today by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying that "no
tangible support" had been received from the international
community in furtherance of the Liberian peace process "despite
assurances" of financial and logistics support from them.
</P>
<P>
The army chief was speaking at the opening of a Nigerian army
ordinance corps and school training program on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Abuja peace agreement signed by all parties to the
Liberian conflict last August, Liberia is now faced with
disarmament of some 60,000 fighters of the armed factions in that
country by the Nigerian-led ecomog, a crucial stage of Liberian
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kazir, however, assured that Nigeria remained committed to the
task of restoring peace in Liberia, saying that the nation's
"commitment to restoring peace in Liberia is unshakable."
</P>
<P>
"The government's resolve," he noted, "cannot be deterred by
our detractors, no matter how hard they try."

WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Ukraine will exchange visits of top level officials to strengthen
bilateral relations, U.S. State Department officials confirmed
today.
</P>
<P>
The officials, who asked not to be identified, told reporters
that Ukrainian President leonid Kuchma will make a working visit
to Washington on February 21 that will include a meeting with U.S.
President Bill Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Next week, two of Kuchma's top ministers, Deputy Prime Minister
Roman Shpek and Foreign Minister Anton Buteyko, will visit the
United States to seek approval of a 350 million U.S. dollar
installment of a 1.5 billion dollar International Monetary Fund
support package.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will pay his second
visit to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, on March 18-22.
</P>
<P>
The dates were fixed during a 35-minute meeting between Kuchma
and Christopher in Helsinki Thursday. Both were visiting Finland's
capital.
</P>
<P>
"We want to be of help to them (the Ukrainians) in any way we
can as they stay on the path of economic reform," Christopher told
reporters before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a senior White House official said that the
Clinton administration had wanted to invite Kuchma for some time
to acknowledge the "courageous moves" he has made in promoting
economic reforms in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of 1944, Ukraine has been the fourth largest
recipient of U.S. aid, the State Department said in an
announcement Thursday. It is also the largest recipient of U.S.
economic aid among the former Soviet states, including Russia.

<HEADLINE> Doses of Meningitis Vaccine Distributed in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- nigeria's Health Ministry has
distributed more than two million doses of cerebro-spinal
meningitis (csm) vaccine to states affected by the outbreak of
the disease in the last month.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ministry here today said officials
from the epidemiological unit of the ministry have also been sent
to the affected states to assist in controlling the spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Affected states are mostly in the northern part of the
country, such as Sokoto, Kebbi, Bauchi, Kano, Katsina, and Jigawa,
apart from the southern state of Cross River.
</P>
<P>
The situation is under control and measures have been taken to
check its spread, said the statement.

campaign on preventive measures as the disease, a bacterial
infection, usually manifests itself during this dry season.

The ministry, having investigated suspected cases in Soloto
and Kebbi states, has rendered assistance by distributing to the
two states more than 200,000 sachets of oral rehydration liquid

<HEADLINE> Syria, Iraq Discuss Water Resources in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- the Syrian-Iraqi Technical
Committee on Water Resources opened here today a five-day session
to discuss the impact of Turkey's projects on the flow of the
Euphrates River water to the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It was learned from sources close to the session that the
committee meetings will examine ways of unifying the positions of
Syria and Iraq on the Turkish projects along the river.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will exchange technical data on water
resources, as well as ways of consolidating cooperation between
the two countries within international law and international
conventions on water.
</P>
<P>
The current meetings of the Syrian-Iraqi Technical Committee on
Water Resources impresses political observers in the syrian
capital, as relations between the two countries were severed in
1980 at the start of the Iraq-Iran war, during which Syria adopted
a pro-Iranian attitude, in addition to the fact that Syria joined
the anti-Iraq international coalition following the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The observers believe the session of the Syrian-Iraqi Technical
Committee is a wide stride made by Baghdad to improve ties with
Arab states and end its isolation.
