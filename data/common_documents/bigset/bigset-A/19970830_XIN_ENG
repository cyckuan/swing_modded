<HEADLINE> Ericsson Denies Mobile Phone-Cancer Connection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Ericsson, Sweden's
telecommunications giant, today ruled out the possibility of link
between mobile phones and cancer.
</P>
<P>
An Ericsson-published brochure said, "there is no scientific
proof of a connection between mobile phones and cancer."
</P>
<P>
Some researchers have raised the question that low-level
radiation from cellular phones can cause brain tumors or damage to
genetic material.
</P>
<P>
There also exists concern that the radio waves from the phone's
antenna can have a warming effect, which can cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
The brochure said that low-energy Ericsson cell-phones have a
maximum effect comparable to a small flashlight.
</P>
<P>
"Scientific tests have shown that a long telephone conversation
can't increase body temperature by more than 0.1 degree
Celsius. This effect is insignificant compared to normal
variations of body temperature," it concluded.
</P>
<P>
However, Lars Ramqvist, chief executive of the company, said,
"Ericsson will continue to conduct independent research in this
field because it is of great importance to the industry and the
public."

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Strongly Condemns Bosnian Serbs for Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Javier Solana, secretary
general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, today condemned
the Bosnian Serbs for their violence directed against the NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR) troops and the international community.
</P>
<P>
He fully supports the steps taken by SFOR troops in cooperation
with other international organizations to ensure appropriate
control of the special police, to support the International Police
Task Force and to prevent the outbreak of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
"The SFOR will not hesitate to take the necessary measures
including the use of force against media networks or programs
inciting attacks on the SFOR or other organizations," said the
NATO chief.
</P>
<P>
Solana reaffirmed that the SFOR will continue to carry out its
mission firmly but fairly and will not tolerate the use of force
or intimidation as a means of resolving political issues.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, hundreds of Bosnian Serbs pelted SFOR troops with
rocks, forcing them to pull out from a police station in Brcko.
</P>
<P>
Brcko townspeople, roused from their sleep by air raid sirens
that wailed for hours, reportedly attacked dozens of American
peacekeeping soldiers, accusing the latter of conducting like the
Nazi occupying force.
</P>
<P>
In another development, local Serb residents at Bijeljina
reportedly blocked the town center to SFOR troops from taking over
the police station and a television transmitter.
</P>
<P>
Tensions rose sharply over the past few days in Bosnian Serb
areas between SFOR troops and local residents loyal to their
wartime leader Radovan Karadzic as his power struggle was fueled
up with Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
Those backing Plavsic and Karadzic loyalists have been vying
for local television transmitters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the European Union also blamed riots in the
Bosnian Serb towns of Brcko and Bijeljina as an insurrection
against the presence of the international community.
</P>
<P>
It said that violent acts against the SFOR and the
International Police Task Force are intolerable.
</P>
<P>
The union said that it would not accept such a provocation and
it urged Bosnian Serbs to refrain from further provocative acts
and to stop propaganda that is of the nature of inciting
insecurity and instability.

<HEADLINE> UAE Considers Linking Dirham to Other Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
is considering linking its U.S. dollar-pegged currency dirham to a
basket of currencies, a senior UAE official said today.
</P>
<P>
"There will be serious thought about linking the dirham to a
basket of currencies," UAE's Minister of State for Financial and
Industry Affairs Hohammed Khalfan bin Kharbash said at a meeting
held in Dubai, one of the seven emirates of the country.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has blamed a 13-billion-dollar trade loss between 1986
and 1994 on its currency's linkage to the dollar. The exchange
rate stands at one dollar against 3.65 dirhams and this has
remained unchanged for years.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said that the change of currency links
needs coordination at the level of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) member states, which also include Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar,
Bahrain and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The GCC has debated over the past decade the move to hook their
currency units to a basket of currencies but failed to reach a
consensus.
</P>
<P>
Except Kuwait, which pegged its dinar to a basket of
currencies, the GCC members denominated their oil prices only in
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich states' economies are heavily reliant on the
prices of crude oil, which brings them billions of dollars in
revenue each year.

<HEADLINE> No Re-introduction of Death Penalty in S. Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela reiterated today that his government will not
re-introduce capital punishment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court held that the death penalty is
unconstitutional, Mandela told a meeting of the National Council
of Province.
</P>
<P>
"It is not easy for the government to ignore the considered
view of such a tribunal," he added.
</P>
<P>
South Africa abolished capital punishment on the eve of the
first non-racial general elections in 1994. The maximum of the
punishment for offenders has degraded to life imprisonment since
then.
</P>
<P>
However, as violent activities and vicious crimes are
increasing in South Africa, about half of blacks and more than 60
percent of whites have demanded for re-introduction of death
penalty in hope to curb the crimes.
</P>
<P>
In response to the viewpoint, Mandela pointed out that death
penalty was the most cruel and ruthless way of persecution
against the black people in apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Punishments short of death penalty still can make offenders
repent, he said.

<HEADLINE> 1,210 Cases of Meningitis Reported in DP of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) said here today that 1,210 cases of meningitis have been
reported in several districts of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Of these cases, at least 191 have resulted in death, giving a
case fatality rate of over 16 percent. Most of the cases have
occurred in June, July and August in the east of the country, WHO
said. Sero-group A meningococcus has been identified as the cause
of the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
So far, only one area, Kasenga, in the province of Katanga, has
had a weekly attack rate high enough, 67 cases reported since the
beginning of July 1997, to have the recent incidence classified as
an outbreak. Twenty-five deaths have occurred in Kasenga since
early July. The situation appears to be under control, according
to WHO, thanks to the intervention of its partners using the
vaccines, medicines and equipment which had been prepositioned by
WHO in the country.
</P>
<P>
Cases have also been reported in the city of Lubumbashi (14
cases with zero death) and in the provinces of North Kivu (504
cases with at least 32 deaths), South Kivu (282 cases with at
least three deaths), Oriental (158 cases with 28 deaths), Maniema
(21 cases with 10 deaths) and Bandundu. An unspecified number of
cases and deaths have also occurred in various military camps.
</P>
<P>
North and South Kivu continue to register cases but the number
has not yet reached epidemic level, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring countries of Burundi, Rwanda, the United
Republic of Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia have been informed by WHO
of the situation. Kasenga is near the Zambian border and 69 cases
with 16 deaths have been reported in Zambia since the beginning of
the year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's SADC/COMESA Membership Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will continue with its
dual membership of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) until the SADC trade protocol is ratified by all
members, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Beatrice Mtetwa, Deputy Secretary of the Industry and Commerce
Ministry, said while COMESA had made significant strides in
reducing trade barriers, Zimbabwe could not afford to relinquish
its membership of SADC which was strongly moving toward a free
trade zone.
</P>
<P>
''While it might take time to see benefits from the SADC trade
protocol, we will continue to belong to both organisations
because the SADC agreement considers other areas that are not
considered under COMESA,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that among other issues, the SADC trade protocol,
signed in Lesotho last year, also sought to foster cross-border
investment and institutional development.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, intra-COMESA trade is attracting 20 percent
duty while the qualitative and quantitative barriers vary
depending on a number of bilateral agreements that exist within
the region.
</P>
<P>
She challenged the local business community to capitalise on
the opportunities ushered in by the opening up of regional
markets by strengthening their competitive advantages through
investment in skills development.
</P>
<P>
These comments followed the reservations by some
industrialists who questioned the benefits of the country's dual
membership of COMESA and SADC, which groups 12 countries in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Under the SADC trade protocol, yet to be ratified by 10 of the
member states, the region seeks to create a free trade area by
the year 2003.

<HEADLINE> WTO Report Sees World Beef Market Recovery in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The world beef market looks
likely for a recovery this year with global meat consumption
projected to rise from a sudden decrease last year caused by "mad
cow disease" fears, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said in its
annual report on the International Markets for Meat published here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the WTO secretariat in accordance with
the International Bovine Meat Agreement, presents a summary of the
international situation and outlook for bovine meat and specific
elements fo the world beef economy on a country-by-country basis
as well as summaries of the situation and outlook for pigmeat,
poultry meat and sheepmeat.
</P>
<P>
Last year, "mad cow disease" and other meat safety concerns
threw the European Community's (EC) market off balance. The report
said that world beef consumption is expected to increase this
year. While the EC has already addressed the crisis with a number
of measures, further reforms of the beef sector have been
announced for this year. Beef consumption in the EC is expected to
rise by 2 percent to 7.07 million tons this year in contrast to a
decrease of 7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the cattle liquidation in the United
States is approaching its end and that prices will recover as from
late 1997, promising higher imports and better returns for
Oceanian, South American and other suppliers to the US market. The
United States is projected to increase its beef imports by 10
percent this year to 1.03 million tons, and overtake Japan as the
world's biggest importer of beef.
</P>
<P>
A number of WTO members have concluded, or are in the process
of negotiating, veterinary trade agreements based on the concepts
of equivalence and regionalization contained in the WTO Agreement
on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS
Agreement). These agreements facilitate trade by reducing the cost
of compliance with various national standards. The EC reached
agreement with New Zealand at the beginning of the year, and more
recently with the United States, which will take effect on October
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries in 1997 were certified by the
International Office of Epizootics as free from foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD), thus enabling them to expand beef export
opportunities. Argentina and Paraguay were recognized as FMD-free
with vaccination in May 1997, while FMD-free zones without
vaccination were recognized in Colombia, Namibia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Chinese Taipei, which
supplied 40 percent or 380,000 tons of Japan's pork imports in
1996, has left a big gap in the Japanese market. While large
stocks have so far prevented a shortage of pork in Japan, prices
in the major supplying countries, the EC (Denmark) and the United
States, have risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, at the end of June 1997, phased out quantitative
restrictions on imports of frozen pork and poultry meat and
replaced the quotas by tariffs. This measure is likely to weaken
the competitiveness of beef, although domestic demand is growing
for all types of meat. Beef imports will remain subject to quotas
until the year 2001 as specified in South Korea's Uruguay Round
schedule.

<HEADLINE> Police in Nepali Town Asked to Control Stray Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The municipality of Nepalgunj
in mid-western Nepal had to ask the police to help control stray
bulls that butt people causing one death, obstruct traffic and
damage crops, the official RSS news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Traffic policemen in the town have been rounding up stray cows
but turned a blind eye to the bulls, which are considered sacred
in Hindu Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The religious belief has it that bulls left at large under the
invocation of the Trisul or Trident, a symbol of sea god or
supremacy, should continue to be left at large.
</P>
<P>
Recently a stray bull butted a man and he later died.
</P>
<P>
And every year some 20 people are injured by such bulls, the
RSS said.
</P>
<P>
In Nepali cities and towns, stray bulls are left to roam at
will. Anyone who kills or injures them has to pay fines and serve
terms in jail.

<HEADLINE> SBC Fined Record Amount for Secret Share Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Bank Corporation's (SBC)
London office has been fined a record amount for two separate
breaches of City rules.
</P>
<P>
The bank was severely reprimanded by the Securities and Futures
Authority (SFA) and fined 300,000 pounds (480,000 US dollars), the
largest fine ever imposed by the regulator, for failing to observe
the correct procedures during share transactions.
</P>
<P>
The decision follows an inquiry by the Stock Exchange and
pressure from disgruntled investors who claimed they may have lost
profits as a result of selling shares in regional electricity
companies to SBC.
</P>
<P>
In a separate ruling, the City regulator slapped a further
180,000 pound (288,000 US dollar) fine on the bank for failing to
supervise its traders when the 500 million pound (800 million US
dollar) Kleinwort European Privatization Investment Trust was
liquidated last year.
</P>
<P>
The SFA found that SBC failed to fully follow proper procedures
to prevent such information passing between different parts of the
bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank was severely reprimanded over both incidents and
ordered to pay 176,000 pounds (281,600 US dollars) towards the
costs of the disciplinary hearings.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that no criminal proceedings have been
instigated because SBC employees acted in good faith during the
Yorkshire affair.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive of the SFA, Richard Farrant, said,
"Managing and controlling the different parts of an integrated
investment house in order to ensure fair treatment of clients and
other market participants is challenging. SBC failed the test."

<HEADLINE> Southern African Trade Unions Urged to Combat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Participants at the seminar on
child labor today urged trade unions in southern African countries
to take a leading role in combating child labor.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop which opens here today is attended by
more than 50 delegates from African countries.
</P>
<P>
The participants said since most workers are poorly paid, they
encourage their children to take up jobs at early ages and
supplement family income.
</P>
<P>
It is, therefore, the duty of trade unions to fight for better
remuneration for their members and reverse the situation.
</P>
<P>
"Most workers in the lower income brackets encourage their
children to seek employment at tender ages because their income
is not adequate to provide education, food and clothing for the
children," the participants said.
</P>
<P>
Geir Myrstad, International Labor Organization chief technical
advisor on child labor, urged trade unions to use collective
bargaining as a tool to fight child labor.
</P>
<P>
"Through collective bargaining, trade unions promote social
justice and a living wage, thereby weakening the dependence of
poor families on the income of their children," he said.
</P>
<P>
Myrstad called on trade unions to set up permanent structures
to deal with child labor.
</P>
<P>
The participants urged governments of south African countries
to help set up income generating projects and increase the
number of adults who earn an income in the family.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Signs More Contracts with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has signed new trade
contracts with Syria worth 30 million U.S. dollars, according to a
press release here today.
</P>
<P>
The deal on the import of big quantities of legumes and soap
from Syria via the Natf border checkpoint brought the total value
of Iraqi contracts with Syria signed under the U.N.-Iraqi
oil-for-food deal to 50 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
On June 8, Iraq inked deals with Syria on the import of 20,000
tonnes of wheat and 10,000 tonnes of lentil at a value of 20
million dollars
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Trade Ministry revealed today at the press release
that it signed contracts on the purchase of 650,000 tonnes of
wheat from the United States, Australia and France in addition to
quantities of rice from Thailand, Vietnam, China and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
It had brought from four U.S. firms 100,000 tonnes of wheat,
50,000 tonnes of sugar and 18,000 tonnes of white beans with a
total value of 70 million dollars during the first phase of the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export 2
billion dollars worth of oil over a renewed six month period to
buy food and other humanitarian goods for its people who have
been suffering under U.N.-imposed sanctions following Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.

<HEADLINE> More US Workers Feel Less Secure About Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- More than two-thirds of U.S.
workers say their sense of job security is lower and job stress
higher than it used to be, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
This is despite the best economic conditions in a generation
and a 4.8 percent jobless rate, the tightest job market in 25
years, according to Friday's USA TODAY, which carried the survey.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of workers surveyed by Princeton Survey
Research Associates said they have less job security than 20 or 30
years ago. And 73 percent say there's more on-the-job stress. The
survey also shows that 59 percent of workers say they have to work
harder to earn a decent living.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the nationwide poll was conducted for State of
the Union, a four-part series produced by PBS with the
participation of USA TODAY.
</P>
<P>
The powerful economic turnaround has done little to erase
insecurity among the nation's 130 million workers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Corporate downsizing and restructuring that was common earlier
this decade left workers feeling less secure, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Corporate mergers and downsizings were blamed by 61 percent
of workers for holding wages down. Other findings include: 33
percent work more than 45 hours a week, up from 27 percent six
years ago. Those who work 60 hours a week or more held at 12
percent. Part-timers, who work less than 35 hours a week, were
steady at 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
A big part of the insecurity is caused by the vast
technological changes in the workplace, according to Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Delegation Promotes Peace Talks in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 29 (Xinhua)-- A four-member Egyptian
delegation led by Marwan Badri, Assistant Foreign Secretary for
African Affairs, today met the North Mogadishu authorities
in the divided Somali capital, Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The delegation crossed the green line dividing the capital
following their extensive talks with Hussein Mohamed Aidid and
his senior officials in South Mogadishu yesterday.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official statement released by Hussein
Aidid's faction over the Egyptian delegation's visit nor talks
between them.
</P>
<P>
However, sources close to the headquarters of Hussein Aidid
revealed that the Egyptian diplomats are on a mission
to persuade the South Mogadishu authorities to attend a national
reconciliation conference to be held in Cairo as agreed by
Hussein Aidid himself and his arch rival, Ali Mahdi Mohamed about
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Egyptian efforts are not concurrent with
the anticipated Bossaso conference in November for the factions
which established the National Salvation Council in Sodere,
Ethiopia early this year.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian initiative is suggesting another reconciliation
conference for the Somali factions which would preferably be held
in Cairo, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The delegation landed in Somalia two days ago is expected to
fly tomorrow on their way to visit Somaliland for similar
purposes, they added.
</P>
<P>
But they noted that Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, self-styled
president of the break away Republic of Somaliland, is less
likely to accept any conference with the participation of the
rest of the Somali faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
Both Egypt and Italy seem to be campaigning for the convening
of a new national reconciliation conference with different venues
than Bossaso which would be eligible for all the concerned
parties including Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hussein Aidid and Italy are preferring regional
level reconciliations to any national level conference, an idea
strongly opposed by the Sodere factions in Ethiopia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
This political stalemate will further prolong the anarchy and
civil war that ravaged Somalia for the past seven years,
observers here say.

<HEADLINE> Mauritian President Appeals for Africa's Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) --Visiting Mauritian President
Cassim Uteem today called on the international community to help
boost Africa's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
" There is more need now for the international community to
help boost africa's economic and social development," President
Cassim Uteem said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Zimbabwe agricultural show, he said although the
continent was blessed with an array of natural resources, some of
the countries are still grappling with a lot of problems such as
low per capita incomes.
</P>
<P>
''The pace of development has not yet reached the right
momentum,'' said Uteem, adding, ''It is an undeniable fact that
the paths taken by these economies have been shaped to a great
extent by policies and strategies chalked out by colonial rulers
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
Africans should not allow themselves to fall into the trap of
believing that Africa is only the images of savage and
wanton killings and images of conflict, death, disease and
disaster, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said most African countries are now reaping the fruits of
democratisation, political pluralism and stability, economic
reform and tranquility.
</P>
<P>
The major problem facing this third world continent is
the lack of resources to exploit its untapped wealth and
potential, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also emphasised the need for
regional integration to enable Africa to compete strongly in
the world market.
</P>
<P>
Uteem arrived here on Monday for six-day official visit to
Zimbabwe.

LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
continued their downward trend and ended lower again today, still
depressed by heavy falls in New York and Asia.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index finished 0.6 percent lower, its weakest
close for five weeks, but trimmed losses as the Dow regained its
footing following an early tumble.
</P>
<P>
Turmoil in the Far East hit sentiment in London after the Hang

exposed to Asia led the market lower, with the FTSE 100 index
falling 27.9 points at 4,817.5 by the close of the session, 83.6
points down on the week.

Stocks on the Paris bourse failed to retake the key 2,800 level

<HEADLINE> Kenya, IMF Agree on Conditions for Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said today it has reached mutual understanding with the
Kenyan government on a series of conditions under which
negotiations on a lapsed IMF key loan can re-start.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, Goodall Gondwe, Deputy Director of
IMF African Department, said that the IMF-Kenyan talks were
fruitful and "constructive".
</P>
<P>
He said IMF-Kenyan negotiations would be held provided that
Kenya improve management of the energy sector, safeguard the
independence of the revenue authority, set up an independent and
powerful anti-graft body and ensure accountability and
transparency in public finance.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Kenyan government said in a statement it
had reiterated to the IMF its commitment to making concrete
measures to solve these problems as soon as possible to pave the
way for resuming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The reaction of the domestic financial markets to the lapse
of the first-year ESAF (Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility)
arrangement demonstrates clearly the need for the underlying
concerns to be addressed," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Gondwe said his team "will convey the program of measures to
the Fund's management for determination of whether they would be
sufficient to initiate a second annual ESAF arrangement."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed the suspension of the three-year
215-million-U.S.-Dollar IMF aid package should not be seen as "a
punishment" but just a guarantee for all resources to be properly
used in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kenya "has undertaken a lot of reforms" and made significant
economic progress in the past four years, he said, noting that
the IMF-Kenyan relations "are very close and will continue" and
not be broken down over the loan cut.
</P>
<P>
Gondwe and his team came to this east African country last
Saturday at the invitation of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
The team held talks with Moi and other senior Kenyan officials
in the Indian Ocean port city Mombasa and capital Nairobi from
last Saturday to today.
</P>
<P>
IMF halted the loan package on July 31, citing high-level
corruption and bad governance. The move caused panics on Kenyan
stock and foreign exchange markets during the past month.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Mining Industry Threatened by Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Mines, Environment
and Tourism Secretary Charles Chipato said today the viability of
the mining industry is being threatened by fluctuating mineral
prices.
</P>
<P>
Gold mines in Zimbabwe were the worst affected as the price of
the mineral sank to the lowest in 12 years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The fall in gold price has resulted in the closing of a number
of marginal mines, while bigger ones have drastically cut their
production levels.
</P>
<P>
According to Chipato, it is important that the mining industry
remains viable for Zimbabwe to achieve its goal of improving the
living standards of the people.
</P>
<P>
He added rising injuries and fatalities in mines were
seriously affecting the socio-economic fabric of mining
communities in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the mining industry needs to re-look at
restructuring their organization and management style in order to
come up with cost effective programs to ameliorate these issues,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Favors Talks in Solving S. Leone Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's new President Charles
Taylor, whose country just emerged from a seven-year civil war,
has joined the growing number of countries which are in favor of
a dialogue for the resolution of the Sierra Leone crisis.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the experiences of his country, where the
factional fightings were ended with the help of a sub-regional
peace-keeping force, Taylor said, "the problem in Liberia was not
resolved by the threat or the use of force."
</P>
<P>
"Rather, its mitigation emerged from trust, personal
commitment, and the understanding and neutrality of our host
sister state," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Taylor was speaking at the opening Friday of the 20th summit
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which
is scheduled to close today.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the basis for the sub-region to evolve a
common approach to the crisis should be the Harare declaration of
the Organization of African Unity against the May 25 coup in
Sierra Leone and the final communique of the Conakry
extraordinary meeting of the ECOWAS ministers on June 26.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged the sub-regional leaders, who had agreed on
a three-pronged approach to resolve the crisis -- dialogue,
sanctions and force, to be judicious and "weigh with objective
scrutiny the inescapable practical realities on the ground".
</P>
<P>
Taylor, whose reservation for military option is shared by
Ghana, Togo and Senegal, said however, "We should be seen as
acting with a firm resolution, showing tolerance for our
differences of opinion, while respecting the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of each member state."
</P>
<P>
With regard to the peace-keeping force in his country, known
as ECOMOG, Taylor called for the revision of its mandate from
peace-keeping to providing security and capacity building for
national security.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the re-conceptualization of the force as a
regional peace-keeping force for future conflicts so that its
role would reflect the peculiarity of each conflict.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, whose country is faced with post-war reconstruction
and rehabilitation, urged the sub-regional leaders to lead the
crusade for the lifting of the international embargo against
Liberia which was imposed during the seven years of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Alerts People Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian government today
alerted its people against terrorist attacks following the
bloodiest massacre overnight committed by Islamic extremists in
the five years of violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 villagers in the town of Sidi Moussa, some 20
kilometers south of the capital Algiers, were cut throats,
decapitated or burned by hooded and armed attackers Thursday
night, according to the security service.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were women and children, the security
service quoted eyewitnesses as saying. Local residents put the
death toll as high as more than 300, citing that many bodies were
burned during the five-hour-long massacre.
</P>
<P>
However, the government gave an official count this afternoon
of 98 killed and 120 wounded in the terrorist attack near the
capital.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued this afternoon, the government vowed to
take strict measures to protect the rural areas nationwide. It
also vowed to continue its fight against terrorists unswervingly
till they are wiped out.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people were killed over the last week in a new
escalation of the terrorist acts all over Algeria. About 60,000
people have so far reportedly been slaughtered since violence
erupted in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Rebellions began five years ago after the military-backed
government canceled a parliamentary election in which the Islamic
Salvation Front was poised to win.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Egyptians, First Human to Master Weaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented archaeological
find has confirmed that ancient Egyptians mastered weaving 7,000
years ago, local Arabic newspaper Al Akhbar reported today.
</P>
<P>
This would put the ancient Egyptians undisputedly the first
human beings to use textile, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
An excavation carried out recently by Egypt's Supreme
Archaeological Council (SAC) discovered three unique clay boats
and a linen scroll dating back to the pre-dynasty age, i.e. more
than 5,000 years B.C., in the Awlad Dawood Hill, East Delta
governorate, about 150 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Some remains of human bones were also found with linen shrouds
and covered with a mat of the same period, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
These excavations indicated that the ancient Egyptians had known
weaving for at least seven millennia, even before the invention of
writing, the paper quoted SAC Secretary General Ali Hassan as
saying.
</P>
<P>
More exciting about the recent discovery is that the unearthed
boats have no equivalent in the history of the Egyptian
civilization, he added.
</P>
<P>
The bow and the stern of a first boat resemble the shape of a
hedgehog, the symbol of Atom, the God of Sun. The second boat has
decorations in the form of ostriches while the third has a common
shape.
</P>
<P>
Along with a string of potteries painted in red that date back
to the early dynasty period, the excavation also discovered
mummies of a 0.75-meter-high child and a 1.20-meter-high man, as
well as seven copper needles that are thought to be used in
mummification.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the discovery will shed light on the

<HEADLINE> US Steps Up Deporting Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
deporting illegal aliens at a record pace this year, partly
because of a get-tough immigration law passed last year, the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures show that 75,743 had been formally deported
during the nine-month period that ended June 30, already exceeding
the 68,871 deported in the 12-month period that ended September
30, 1996, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
More than 32,200 people were deported from April through June,
the agency said, including about 40 percent with criminal records.
</P>
<P>
The numbers don't include the more than 57,000 aliens who left
the country without being formally deported. Most chose to leave
voluntarily after they were caught.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of criminal aliens deported had committed
offenses that were classified as aggravated felonies under
immigration law. Drug convictions accounted for more than 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 immigration law helped drive up the number of
noncriminal removals 64 percent, INS officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, aliens arriving at U.S. airports and other ports
of entry without proper documents are refused entry into the
country "unless there is a credible asylum claim or a claim to
permanent resident status," the INS said.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 law that took effect on April 1 raised the standard
aliens have to meet in order to apply for asylum and has led to
about 10,000 removals, the INS said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Islamists Protest Educational Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A large crowd of conservative
Islamists staged a rally today in Turkey's largest city of
Istanbul to protest the lately approved eight-year compulsory
education law.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, mostly bearded young men showing defiance,
gathered around the Beyazit Mosque to demonstrate following the
regular Friday prayer service, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcement had to be dispatched to the scene to assist
security police already there, reports said, adding that the
protesters finally dispersed without clash with police.
</P>
<P>
Today's demonstration was the continuation of a series of
protests lodged by conservative Islamists every Friday to protest
the recently passed education law.
</P>
<P>
The law initiated by the government led by Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz demands that students finish eight years of compulsory
education before they are permitted to start religious studies,
leading to the closure of many religious schools.
</P>
<P>
Police on Thursday detained 18 people accused of organizing
Friday protests around the mosques in major cities, especially in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The secular government's education reform program is aimed at
stemming the rapidly growing fundamentalism in the country, which
was unleashed by the pro-Islamic policies adopted by former Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, who was forced to resign in June under the pressure
from the military and pro-secularists, vowed to appeal to the
Constitutional Court to have the new education annulled.

<HEADLINE> Bonn to Allow Bugging of Apartments to Combat Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The German government today said
that it is planning to allow police to bug apartments of suspected
criminals as a measure to help crack down the country's rising
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts representing the German government and the main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) had agreed on a planned
constitutional change to allow police to use bugging devices to
gather information from homes of people suspected of being
involved in violent or organized crimes, Bonn officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under current laws, German police have been barred from bugging
activities, except in rare cases to prevent a crime or to save the
lives of hostages.
</P>
<P>
The new constitutional change must be approved with a
two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament. With the support
of most of Germany's 16 federal states and the SPD, which controls
the upper house of parliament, observers said the new law was
likely to be approved swiftly and take effect within this year.
</P>
<P>
According to government figures quoted by the German news
agency DPA, the number of registered violent crimes in Germany
rose by 5.5 percent in 1996. The number of organized crimes was
also on the rise.

<P>
ABUJA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The on-going summit of the
Economic Community of West African States held here has delayed
its closing session for more than eight hours due to a late
agreement on major issues on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
An official announced today that the final communique will be

<P>
It is understood that ECOWAS leaders have disagreed on the

Ghana, Liberia, Togo and Senegal have reservation about the
use of force to compel the military junta in Sierra Leone to give
up power and return the rule to a legitimate government it
toppled on May 25.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS foreign ministers agreed late Thursday to recommend to
the summit that sanctions be imposed on Sierra Leone and that a

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Asked to Block Anti-Affirmative Action Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Supreme Court justice
was asked today to block enforcement of California's Proposition
209 -- the law banning race or gender preference in state hiring
or school admissions.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of civil rights groups said the measure, which took
effect Thursday, "strips all local and state governmental entities
of their pre-existing authority to redress discrimination through
even indisputably constitutionally permissible race- or
sex-conscious affirmative action measures."
</P>
<P>
City officials from San Francisco also filed an emergency
request.
</P>
<P>
Both were submitted to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who handles
emergency matters from California for the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
She could either act on the requests herself, or refer them to
the full court. No action is likely until a response from state
officials is received.
</P>
<P>
Even if the emergency requests are denied, the Supreme Court
still would have before it formal challenges to Proposition 209,
and is not expected to act on those until its 1997-98 term begins
in October.
</P>
<P>
The anti-affirmative action initiative took effect after a
federal appeals court refused to block its enforcement while
opponents pursue Supreme Court appeals.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said Proposition 209 is a neutral measure
that promotes equality.
</P>
<P>
But the emergency requests filed today said some Californians
will suffer irreparable harm if Proposition 209 is left in effect
-- being denied the right "to seek aid from the government on
equal terms with other citizens."
</P>
<P>
Government officials also will be required to end programs that
conflict with Proposition 209. "State and local bodies will be
required to end even those measures which courts have already
found narrowly tailored to serve compelling interests, such as
remedying past discrimination or desegregating public schools,"
civil rights lawyers contended.
</P>
<P>
They said, "In the area of public employment, 209 would
eliminate even unquestionably permissible affirmative action
programs aimed at redressing discrimination in the hiring and
promotion of women and minorities."
</P>
<P>
The law will also require police and fire departments to
develop new hiring and promotion policies.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Egyptians, First Human to Master Weaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented archaeological
find has confirmed that ancient Egyptians mastered weaving 7,000
years ago, local Arabic newspaper Al Akhbar reported today.
</P>
<P>
This would put the ancient Egyptians undisputedly the first
human beings to use textile, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
An excavation carried out recently by Egypt's Supreme
Archaeological Council (SAC) discovered three unique clay boats
and a linen scroll dating back to the pre-dynasty age, i.e. more
than 5,000 years B.C., in the Awlad Dawood Hill, East Delta
governorate, about 150 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Some remains of human bones were also found with linen shrouds
and covered with a mat of the same period, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
These excavations indicated that the ancient Egyptians had known
weaving for at least seven millennia, even before the invention of
writing, the paper quoted SAC Secretary General Ali Hassan as
saying.
</P>
<P>
More exciting about the recent discovery is that the unearthed
boats have no equivalent in the history of the Egyptian
civilization, he added.
</P>
<P>
The bow and the stern of a first boat resemble the shape of a
hedgehog, the symbol of Atom, the God of Sun. The second boat has
decorations in the form of ostriches while the third has a common
shape.
</P>
<P>
Along with a string of potteries painted in red that date back
to the early dynasty period, the excavation also discovered
mummies of a 0.75-meter-high child and a 1.65-meter-high man, as
well as seven copper needles that are thought to be used in
mummification.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the discovery will shed light on the
intricate skills used by ancient Egyptian in preserving human
bodies.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Women's Platform Diving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MESSINA, Sicily, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China won the gold and
bronze medals in the women's platform diving through Chi Meilan and
Wang Xuan respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chi Meilan, who finished only 14th in China's national champions
cup this year, beat all her opponents and the windy weather to total
494.37 points for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Chi was the winner of the preliminaries and semi-finals earlier on
Friday and she hit the highest score of 71.34 points in her second
dive in the final, a backward two and a half somersaults at tuck
position with a 2.9 digree of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The second dive gave Chi a lead of more than 20 points than her
closest rival. After the that the competitions were mainly between
another Chinese Wang Xuan and Julie Danaux of France.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Wang, ranked 17th in the national champions cup,
was runner-up in the morning's preliminaries and afternoon's
semi-finals. But in the finals, she was a bit nervous and faulted
with two of his five dives.
</P>
<P>
Julie Danaux took the chance to overtake Wang with a backward two
and a half somersaults at tuck position which gave her 64.80 points.
</P>
<P>
She went on to take 59.64 points from her last dive to win the
silver medal with a total of 461.40 points. Wang Xuan finished third
at 449.13 points.
</P>
<P>
It was the third gold medal for Chinese female divers. Lu Haisong
won the 1-meter springboard while Zhu Jinhong took the title of the
3-meter springboard on Monday and Wednesday respectively.

<HEADLINE> New Home Sales in U.S. Up 0.9 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- New home sales in the U.S.
rose by 0.9 percent in July, the third straight monthly advance,
U.S. commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that sales of single-family homes in July
totaled a seasonally adjusted 817,000 annual rate, up from a
revised 810,000 in June.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales of new homes shot up 11 percent in the West.
But they fell by 5.1 percent in the Midwest, 4.3 percent in the
Northeast and 2.5 percent in the South.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the seasonally adjusted estimate of new
homes for sale at the end of July was 287,000, unchanged from June
and representing a supply of 4.3 months at the current sales pace.
</P>
<P>
The inventory level is considered low and analysts said that it
could provide incentives to builders to continue laying
foundations.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home in the U.S was 146,700 dollars
in July, up from 143,800 dollars in June and 144,200 dollar a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months of the year, sales of new homes in
the U.S. were 7.4 percent above those of the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are expecting housing activity to level off during the
remainder of the year but say job and income growth and relatively
low mortgage rates will keep housing starts and sales near their
current levels.

ABUJA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- West African leaders, who are
busy exploring ways to settle the Sierra Leone crisis after
normalcy returned to Liberia, have been called on to help restore

With the escalating tension, he warned, the situation could
deteriorate into a crisis of "immense magnitude".

JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Leader of member states of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) will meet in
Malawi early next month to review five new protocols in a bid to
strengthen cooperation, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende was quoted as telling a
press conference in Gaborone, Botswana today that the five new
protocols on education, gender, industry, mining and water are
expected to be signed at the summit.
</P>
<P>
He said the existing protocols will be reviewed and that the
summit would also assess the regional political and security
situation.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende also said a document on the free movement of people in
the region will also be presented to the SADC council of
ministers and the summit.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of 12 SADC member states will decide on whether or not
to admit the Democratic Republic of Congo and Seychelles into the
regional body.

<P>
The two countries have applied to joint the regional group,
which aims to set up a free trade zone in the sub-region by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said Madagascar has also shown interest to join, but
no formal letter has been handed in.
</P>
<P>
SADC treaty provides for admission of new members with close
consideration to the laid-down procedures, he added.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Spending Increases Quickly in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Consumer spending in the U.S.
shot up by 0.8 percent in July, the biggest jump in six months,
U.S. commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that consumer spending totaled 5.49
trillion dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in July, up
from 5.44 trillion dollars in June. The increase was the biggest
since a 1.1 percent gain in last January.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of durable goods, items expected to last more than
three years, jumped 1.9 percent, faster than June's 0.4 percent
gain. Motor vehicles accounted for most of the July advance.
</P>
<P>
Spending on nondurable goods such as food and fuel and on
services such as health care both rose 0.6 percent after
increasing 0.2 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report was closely examined by economists and the financial
markets because consumer spending represents two-thirds of the
nation's economic activity. Analyst have seen signs that the U.S.
economy may be growing too fast to avoid a fresh bout of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department also reported that personal income rose
just 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since last October.
</P>
<P>
It said that incomes totaled 6.87 trillion dollars at an annual
rate in July, up from 6.86 trillion in June.
</P>
<P>
Private wages and salaries, the most closely watched component
of income, fell 3 billion dollars in the month after rising 30.3
billion in June. Average weekly hours also declined, more than
offsetting an increase in jobs.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- edged up 0.1
percent, the smallest increase since a similar gain in April.
</P>
<P>
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans'
savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income --
was 3.7 percent in July compared with 4.3 percent a month earlier,
lowest since a similar rate in February.
</P>
<P>
The income and spending percentages were not adjusted for
inflation. When adjusted, disposable incomes were down 0.1 percent
after rising 0.4 percent in June and spending was up 0.6 percent,
far outpacing the 0.1 percent increase a month earlier.

<HEADLINE> Angola Hails UN Sanctions on Former Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Prime Minister Franca
Van-Dunem, who was on his way back from Britain, said in Lisbon,
Portugal today that sanctions by U.N. Security Council on UNITA
would not threaten the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to him, U.N. sanctions on the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) will make the former rebel
movement retrospect and carry out the Lusaka Peace Accord signed
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said he also believed that the sanctions would not endanger
the national unity and reconciliation government which was
founded in April this year.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council members Thursday agreed informally to
impose air and travel ban on UNITA and to close down its offices
abroad for failure to live up to the 1994 peace pact.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were endorsed by a unanimous 15-0 vote amid
fears of renewed fighting. The resolution to be adopted today
will go into force on September 30 unless U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan certifies that UNITA has taken "concrete and
irreversible steps" to fulfill its peace obligations.
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing the news of sanctions Thursday, Angolan Foreign
Minister Venancio De Moura who was visiting Cape Verde said in
Praia that the U.N. decision has reflected the wish of the
Angolan people and the international community to take on a firm
action on UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that UNITA will not mobilize its armed forces or
attempt to occupy more territories before the resolution takes
into effect on September 30.

"We welcome the decision, which gives an opportunity for all
parties in Northern Ireland to be part of inclusive talks leading
to a negotiated settlement," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on the island of Martha's Vineyard in
Massachussetts where President Bill Clinton is on vacation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Rubin said today
that the U.S. strongly the positions of the British and Irish
governments.
</P>
<P>
"The British and Irish governments have long held that Sinn
Fein may join in the all-party talks in Belfast only when the IRA
has ceased all violent operations," Rubin told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has strongly supported this position and
welcomes both the cease-fire itself and the inclusion of Sinn Fein
in the talks, which we consider to be the best means of achieving
a lasting overall settlement in Northern Ireland."
</P>
<P>
The British government decided to invite Sinn Fein to join the
talks in light of the IRA's cease-fire, declared on July 20.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would closely follow the negotiations, partly through
former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, who is chairing the talks,
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the ultimate success would depend on "whether the
parties themselves have come to a conclusion that peace through
the negotiating table is better than conflict through the
streets."
</P>
<P>
"That's their decision. And all we can do in this kind of a
case is try to make ourselves available to assist in the process,"
Rubin said.

WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today
launched into orbit a satellite that carried experimental
technology designed to monitor nuclear weapons tests.
</P>
<P>
The 468-pound Fast On-Orbit Recording of Transient Events
satellite rode aboard a Pegasus XL rocket, which was launched from
an L-1011 airplane over the Pacific off California.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was designed and built for the U.S. Department of
Energy by the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National
Laboratories in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
It will test ways to monitor compliance with arms control
treaties by detecting, recording and analyzing bursts of energy
near the Earth's surface. It is designed to distinguish them from
bursts of lightning.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is the first spacecraft made entirely of a
composite material, which is lightweight. Unlike aluminum, it
doesn't expand and contract when temperatures change.

<HEADLINE> Gambia Warns ECOWAS Leaders Against Divisive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Gambian President Col. Yahaya
Jammeh has urged leaders of the member states of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to guard against
divisive policies at national, sub-regional and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 20th ECOWAS summit here
Thursday, Jammeh said the greatest threat to ECOWAS now is the
competition between the Francophone and Anglophone member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jammeh added that there were also instances of some member
states moving in different directions after attempts to strike a
common position on issues of regional concern.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate also to note that some ECOWAS member states
are more vociferous in creating, nurturing and encouraging this
divisive element of competition by trying to form organizations
that are a duplication of ECOWAS' multi-faceted roles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jammeh said this division, when fully fledged, would bring "a
deadly blow" to the noble endeavors to achieve African
integration in general and west African integration in
particular.
</P>
<P>
As a sub-regional organization, ECOWAS is adequate to meet the
genuine aspirations of west Africans "economically, culturally
and spiritually," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We must all endeavor to be very sincere to ourselves first as
leaders and to the peoples of west Africa we lead. We must all
lead our respective people to one common destination and to the
ultimate common objective of all genuine Africans," Jammeh said.
</P>
<P>
The Gambian head of state urged leaders of member states to
take steps to ratify, respect and implement protocols,
conventions and decisions of the organization to ensure the
attainment of the professed goal of sub-regional integration.

<HEADLINE> NationsBank to Buy Barnett Banks for 15.5 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. fourth largest bank,
NationsBank, said on Friday it would acquire Florida's Barnett
Banks for 15.5 billion U.S. dollars in stock, creating the
country's third biggest bank.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Florida's largest bank helps NationsBank
become an even stronger powerhouse in the Southeast. Combined with
Barnett, its Florida operations alone would rank as the country's
10th-biggest.
</P>
<P>
After the deal which is the biggest ever in the U.S. banking
industry, NationsBank would rank only behind Chase Manhattan and
Citicorp, replacing BankAmerica as the No. 3 banking company in
the country. The previous biggest banking deal was Wells Fargo &AMP;
Co.'s 14.2 billion dollars buy of First Interstate Bancorp.
</P>
<P>
The new merger, which needs federal government review, is
expected to be completed early next year, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
Barnett Banks, with 44 billion dollars in assets, has more than
600 branches in Florida and south Georgia and about 22,000
employees. The company offers consumer lending in 41 states,
concentrating its business in Florida.
</P>
<P>
It controls about 20 percent of deposits in Florida followed by
First Union Corporation of Charlotte, North Carolina, with 17
percent, NationsBank with 12 percent and SunTrust Banks of Atlanta
with 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
NationsBank operates 2,600 branches in 16 states -- mostly in
the Southeast and Midwest -- and the District of Columbia and has
assets of 240 billion dollars. It has 80,000 employees, including
8,000 in Florida.
</P>
<P>
NationsBank announced its acquisition of Montgomery Securities
in June. The purchase of Montgomery, which is based in San
Francisco, would help the bank to join with other lenders and
enter the securities business, which is benefiting from the bull
market on the Wall Street.

theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and
accelerate the industrialization of agriculture by taking
advantage of the advanced science and technology.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Chen Junsheng made a speech at the meeting. He
noted that 50 years of development has enabled the Heilongjiang
Reclamation Area to produce a total of 200 billion kg of grain and
accumulate taxes and profits approaching six billion yuan. This,
he continued, has in turn enabled the area to vigorously supported
the country's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The Great Northern Wilderness was developed some 50 years ago
by a group of demobilized soldiers under the direction of late
Chairman Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
More than 800,000 educated young people who have joined the
reclamation effort over the past five decades have reclaimed in
total over two million ha. of wastelands and established 103
state-owned farms and increased total assets to 23.87 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Italy Condemns Bosnian Serb Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Foreign Ministry today
condemned the riots in two Bosnian towns against the NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR), describing them as "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Bosnian Serbs attacked SFOR troops with stones on
Thursday, forcing them to pull out from a police station in
Brcko. Local residents at Bijeljina also blocked SFOR troops from
taking over the police station and a television transmitter.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said the crisis in Bosnia "must be put
down institutionally by way of elections" and elections are "a
natural way out of the crisis, a fundamental stage along the road
towards the establishment of democracy."
</P>
<P>
Tensions rose sharply over the past few days in Bosnian Serb
areas between the 3,500-strong SFOR troops and local residents
loyal to their wartime leader Radovan Karadzic as his power
struggle with Western-backed Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic was fueled up.
</P>
<P>
Those backing Plavsic and the Karadzic loyalists have been
vying for local television transmitters.
</P>
<P>
Brcko townspeople, roused from sleep by air raid sirens,
reportedly attacked dozens of American peacekeeping soldiers,
accusing the latter as behaving like the Nazi occupation force.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said 15 vehicles were destroyed and one American
soldier was injured. The American troops used tear gas and fired
warning shots to keep crowds away.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia Serb news media reported that at least six civilians
were injured, including five wounded by bullets that ricocheted
when an American soldier's rifle misfired.
</P>
<P>
In another development, residents in Bijeljina spent the night
on a square in front of the police station to prevent SFOR troops
from taking over the police station and a television transmitter.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 people remained there on Friday morning and planned to
stay until SFOR withdrew, reports said.

<P>
PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- France today evacuated its
personnel from the French embassy in Brazzaville to another
district of the capital of Congo Republic, announced the French
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The confrontations in Brazzaville and the risks which result
from it, the deterioration of the working conditions of our
personnel, have brought France to decide to withdraw provisionally
the activities of the diplomatic chancellery to the residence of
the ambassador situated in the district of Bocongo," said a
French Foreign Ministry communique.
</P>
<P>
It said that the French ambassador to the Congo Republic
Raymond Cesaire, who is one of the few foreign envoys who have not
withdrawn from there, and his colleagues are continuing their
task.
</P>
<P>
The French embassy is located at the division line between the
warring factions, along which troops loyal to President Pascal
Lissouba and militiamen supporting General Denis Sassou N'guesso
have been shooting at each other with heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
The residence of the French ambassador, "Case de Gaulle," is
so far saved from the shooting range.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Georgia became the 41st U.S.
state to sue the tobacco industry, seeking at least 8.3 billion
U.S. dollars for covering medical costs in treating
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed Friday in Fulton County Superior Court,
accusing cigarette companies of planning and executing a public
health crisis. The state said it has incurred 2.78 billion dollars
in Medicaid costs since 1968 for treating indigent smokers.
</P>
<P>
Defendants include Philip Morris Inc., the R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp., the American
Tobacco Co., the American Tobacco Council, the Council for Tobacco
Research and others.
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris executive Geoffrey Bible earlier admitted that
smoking might have caused as many as 100,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
Forty other states have filed similar suits. Florida signed an
11.3 billion dollars settlement with the companies onday and
Mississippi settled earlier this summer for nearly 3.6 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reconnaissance Flights Surge Over DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
conducted about 160 air reconnaissance missions over the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) this month, the
Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) quoted military sources as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency said that on Thursday morning, an E-3
early-warning plane flew over the Korean Peninsula in coordination
with the on-going joint military exercises code-named "Ulji Focus
Lens" between the U.S. and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a Japan-based U.S. RC-135 strategic spy plane flew
over the north-south demarcation line on Friday, taking pictures
and eavesdropping strategic facilities in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Among all the reconnaissance flights this month, about 20
sorties were carried out by U.S. strategic planes and
early-warning planes based in American overseas military bases,
KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
Such reconnaissance activities pose a serious challenge to the
peaceful reunification of the DPRK and South Koreas and should be
stopped unconditionally and immediately, it said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets With Swiss Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference CPPCC), met with here today a Swiss delegation which
just concluded a visit to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that the delegation will give an
objective and just evaluation on Tibet and report appropriately
about the region based on their own experiences there.
</P>
<P>
To acquire a correct understanding about Tibet, it is necessary
to look at Tibet from two perspectives: the present situation and
the historical development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to certain natural and historical reasons, at present,
Tibet still lags behind the inland areas in economic and social
development, and faces many difficulties and problems which need
to be solved, Li said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, since the founding of the People's Republic
of China, Tibet has scored considerable achievements in various
fields, and drastic changes have taken place there through efforts
of the Tibetan people and the support from the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Ambassador Urs Ziswiler of the Swiss
foreign ministry, told Li about their deep impression on Tibet's
progress in economy, education, health, population and other
sectors, and also put forward some suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the discussion about Tibet involves a basic stand,
that is, Tibet is an inalienable part of China. Starting from this
stand, it will be easy for us to achieve common understanding either
speaking of the progress there or criticizing what you deem
necessary; starting from this stand, more shortcomings you pointed
out in our work, more helpful to us.
</P>
<P>
China has 56 nationalities, and every nationality is a member
of the Chinese nation, and there is no reason whatsoever to
discriminate against or suppress any of them, he stressed, adding
that it is an aspiration of the Tibetans as well as the central
government to speed up the development of this region. "I believe
that it is also the aspiration of the foreign friends who hope to
see that the Chinese people are leading a happy life," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of religion, Li said that China upholds
the freedom of religious belief, and considers it a personal
issue, and we sincerely hope for mutual respect on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"To our mind," Li said, "religion involves broad masses of
people and nationalities and an international nature as well."
"Therefore, it is a long-term and complicated issue, and should be
handled with great prudence."
</P>
<P>
"We are atheists and there are differences between we atheists
and theists, but such differences should not mean antagonism
between people.
</P>
<P>
Under the common task of building a prosperous, democratic and
civilized modern China, differences in religious belief are the
secondary, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Sino-Swiss relations are very good, Li said,
adding that the delegation's visit to China would help further
the friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ziswiler said that the delegation hoped very much to learn
about Tibet. He cited a Chinese saying that "seeing is believing"
and a Swiss one that "no man is perfect", saying both sides
should therefore learn from each other and exchange their views so
as to avoid misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has learned much about Tibet through the visit
and has seen that Tibet has made rapid progress in many areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland and China have enjoyed important and good relations
and we hope that such relations would continue.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss visitors are here as guests of the CPPCC.

<HEADLINE> Modern Pentathlon likely to be Relegated from Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The modern pentathlon is to be
counted out of the Olympic Games, IOC president Juan was quoted as
saying in Lausanne, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine
newspaper, Samaranch surprised International Olympic Committee
members here with unusually blunt comments about the future of a
sport which does not have a high number of participants around
the world.
</P>
<P>
"Modern pentathlon is going to disappear from the (Olympic)
programme," Samaranch said in the interview. Asked if he was
sure, the IOC chief added: "Very sure."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch, who was beginning a three-day meeting of the
IOC's executive board here, was not immediately available to
comment on the interview.
</P>
<P>
Modern pentathlon, which comprises swimming, shooting,
equestrian, cross-country running and fencing, has been included
in the Games since 1912 and was promoted by arguably the most
important figure in the history of the Olympics -- Baron Pierre
de Coubertin.
</P>
<P>
But it is not a popular participant sport worldwide because
of the costs involving in taking part. In recent years
organisers of the sport have tried to boost its attraction for
television by staging it over one day rather than the
traditional five.
</P>
<P>
The sport is due to be part of the next Summer Games in
Sydney in the year 2000 but its future afterwards now appears in
serious doubt.

<P>
PRAGUE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Australian Michael Doohan took
pole position on Saturday at Brno for the 500cc Czech Grand Prix,
which made him on the way to equal Italian Giacomo Agostini's 11
wins in one season.
</P>
<P>
Doohan has won 10 of the 11 races this year, which means that
he has already won his fourth consecutive world champion.
</P>
<P>
He trailed Italy's Luca Cadalora and Spaniard Sete Gibernau
with only 10 minutes remaining of the hour-long qualifying session
on a wet and blustery day. But he emerged from the pits to post
three consecutive fastest laps to earn pole position.
</P>
<P>
Doohan flew around the Masaryk circuit on his Honda in a best
time of two minutes 14.105 seconds, 1.090 seconds ahead of
Cadalora on a Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
France's Jean Michel Bayle finished third 1.233 seconds off
the pace on a Modenas KR3. And Gibernau dropped to fifth on his
Yamaha behind the Suzuke of Australian Daryl Beattie.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese City To Become Economic and Trade Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, Augest 30 (Xinhua) -- The city of Yueyang in Hunan
province, central China, which has more than 2,500-year history,
is expected to become the second largest economic and trade center
on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, after Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the oldest cities in central China and was known
all over Asia. In recent years, following the opening-up and
reform, its economy has been good.
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Huang Jiaxi, Yueyang has grown into the
nation's largest concentrated feed and auto air conditioner
producer and, "We have the largest petro-chemical industrial base
and the largest paper-making mill in southern China."
</P>
<P>
Yueyang has Asia's largest ramie textile printing and dyeing
mill and boasts Southeast Asia's largest pesticides producer,
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Yueyang is one of the eight best ports along the Yangtze, and
the second most important port, after Chongqing on the middle and
upper reaches of the river, for overseas ships to call at, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Though it was hit by series of flood last year, its GDP was
14.1 percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As of this July, there were 553 overseas-funded projects
approved by the municipal government, using 974 million US dollars
of overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
"In the next several years, more than 30 billion yuan (about
3.7 billion US dollars) of state funds will be spent on Yueyang,"
said Huang, adding that "at the end of the century, Yueyang will
hopefully be built into the second largest economic power, next
only to Wuhan on the meddle reaches of the Yangtze River."

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament Convenes Amid Price Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Parliament opened
its sixth session this afternoon amid renewed street protests by
main opposition parties against a recent price hike of fuel
products.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury in his opening speech called
for cooperation of all parliament members.
</P>
<P>
"I believe amity and mutual tolerance between the treasury and
the opposition is inevitable to make this session really
meaningful and successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
Parliament sources said the session that will last for nearly a
week will have a general discussion on foreign policy and law and
order situation, and is likely to pass two new bills on local
elections.
</P>
<P>
The fuel price hike was not on the agenda of the session, but
it was apparent that the largest opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) would make it a point for attacking the ruling Awami
(people's) League in the parliament, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier this month lifted the prices of all fuel
products, stirring a strong protest from the transport circle and
different political parties.
</P>
<P>
The BNP are also likely to raise issues like the
"deteriorating" economic situation, law and order, "repression" on
its activists and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's criticism-drawing
three-week stay in America with her daughter from late July to
early this month, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BNP and its allies are scheduled to stage a
march tomorrow towards the parliament to press for reversal of the
fuel price hike.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, bans processions, demonstrations and
carrying of weapons in a large area around the parliament building
during the session as it does before.

him. No one was badly injured, but the accident shattered the

<HEADLINE> A Belgian Who Truly Sees Changes in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- If the maxim "seeing is
believing" is not convincing enough to a sceptic, then someone who
saw and is still seeing has to be different.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Lerge Pairoux is a seer who, for three decades and a
half or more than half of his life, has witnessed from both inside
and outside the changes that have been taking place in China.
</P>
<P>
"The reforms and the policy of opening to the outside world has
bettered the country by leaps and bounds," said Pairoux who now
chairs the Belgium-China Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the changes China went through, what Pairoux
likes most is to compare the China he saw in 1962 when he first
set foot on the oriental land with the China he saw in 1997 when
he paid one of his frequent re-visits.
</P>
<P>
Venturing into China in 1960s as a French language teacher and
then as a language polisher at a Chinese press service, Pairoux
saw that the Chinese lacked material supplies needed for even
daily life and most of them were living just from hand to mouth.
</P>
<P>
He had come to know some of the whys as he spent the ensuing
six years in China until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
What made him different from other foreign visitors is the fact
that he always tried to mingle with the ordinary Chinese and get
to know their daily life.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are best known for their hospitality. And from what
on family dining tables in the 1960s and 1990s, Pairoux has found
that life in China has really improved.
</P>
<P>
The living standards of some Chinese can even be compared with
westerners as far as luxuries are concerned, said the secretary-
general of the Belgium-China Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
Unlike most who tend to do so, Pairoux attributed the
flourishing economy in China not simply to the reforms and opening
policy.
</P>
<P>
His insight led him to conclude that the key to China's success
started with the household contracts in the countryside and the
growth of small and medium-sized enterprises in both rural and
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
China is a large agricultural country with farmers accounting
for most of the populace, Pairoux said.
</P>
<P>
Only when life in the countryside has improved can the life in
the entire country improve for real and for good, he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
As economic development radiates to the interior from coastal
regions, the special economic zones will serve as a catalyst of
sustainable growth, said Pairoux who has witnessed as much, if not
more, development in China as that in his own homeland.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian believes that as the establishment of
high-technology industries in China churn out more jobs, the
economy will develop further. And when the economy grows, such
social problems as inadequate educational facilities and the gap
between haves and have-nots will be eventually solved.
</P>
<P>
A well-developed economy will render China its due
international prestige and confer it with its due role in the
global arena, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it in that I saw and is still seeing it," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan President to Visit Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 30 (Xinhua) -- President of Kazakhstan
Nursultan Nazarbayev will start a two-day official visit to
Kuwait Sunday during which several economic agreements are
expected to be signed, Kuwait News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This will be Nazarbayev's first visit to the Gulf country
since he assumed power in December 1991. He will also pay visits
to Bahrain and Oman following his visit to Kuwait, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president is to hold talks with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh
Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and other Kuwaiti leaders on boosting
bilateral relations in the field of politics, economy, trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
The agreements to be signed will cover economy, trade,
investment and avoiding double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev, who will be accompanied by a high-powered
political and economic delegation, is also expected to call on
Kuwaiti businessmen to invest in Kazakhstan by taking the
advantage of preferential policies offered by Kazakhstan to
foreign investors, including a five-year total tax exemption
period and a 10-year profit taxes exemption period.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Kazakhstan have been developing
steadily since the former Soviet Union republic became independent
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Kuwait Minister of Finance Nasser Abdullah Al-Rudhan
visited Kazakhstan and signed a memorandum of understanding under
which Kuwait would support Kazakhstan with expertise in the field
of oil exploration while Kazakhstan would supply Kuwait with mine
sweeping experts.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev visited Kuwait in
May 1997 during which he delivered a message from Nazarbayev to
the Kuwaiti Amir on bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Deputy PM Meets Iraqi Minister of Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Deputy Prime Minister
for the Economic Affairs Salim Yassin met here today with
visiting Iraqi Minister of Commerce Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, the
Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The two officials discussed bilateral trade ties within the
context of the oil-for-food deal and potentials of expanding the
ties during the second six-month phase of the U.N.-Iraqi deal
starting as from June 9.
</P>
<P>
Saleh arrived here last Monday to take part in the 44th
Damascus International Fair which opened here Thursday. Iraq
returned to the fair after a gap of 17 years, or since the start
of an eight-year Iran-Iraq war (1980-88).
</P>
<P>
This was the first visit to Syria by a top Iraqi official
since the diplomatic ties of the two countries were severed in
1980 due to Damascus's support to Iran in the war.
</P>
<P>
The two countries began to resume economic ties in May as Iraq,
suffering a six-year-old U.N. sanctions for its invasion of
Kuwait, is seeking rapprochement with neighbors including Syria.
</P>
<P>
So far, Syria and Iraq have signed contracts worth 50 million
U.S. dollars under the oil-for-food deal which allows Iraq to
sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil under a renewed six month
period to buy food and humanitarian goods for its people.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese City To Become Economic Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, Augest 30 (Xinhua) -- The city of Yueyang in Hunan
province, central China, which has more than 2,500-year history,
is expected to become the second largest economic and trade center
on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, after Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the oldest cities in central China and was known
all over Asia. In recent years, following the opening-up and
reform, its economy has been good.
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Huang Jiaxi, Yueyang has grown into the
nation's largest concentrated feed and auto air conditioner
producer and, "We have the largest petro-chemical industrial base
and the largest paper-making mill in southern China."
</P>
<P>
Yueyang has Asia's largest ramie textile printing and dyeing
mill and boasts Southeast Asia's largest pesticides producer,
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Yueyang is one of the eight best ports along the Yangtze, and
the second most important port, after Chongqing on the middle and
upper reaches of the river, for overseas ships to call at, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Though it was hit by series of flood last year, its GDP was
14.1 percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As of this July, there were 553 overseas-funded projects
approved by the municipal government, using 974 million US dollars
of overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
"In the next several years, more than 30 billion yuan (about
3.7 billion US dollars) of state funds will be spent on Yueyang,"
said Huang, adding that "at the end of the century, Yueyang will
hopefully be built into the second largest economic power, next
only to Wuhan on the meddle reaches of the Yangtze River."

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Warns of Elements Discrediting Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today urged Malaysians to safeguard the country's
independence which he said was under the threat of being thrown
back into colonial control.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the remarks in a national address broadcast live
on radio and television this evening ahead of celebrations of the
country's 40th National Day tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The signs of such a likelihood were already there as could be
seen how easily foreigners could cause the collapse of the economy
by deliberately triggering a fall in the value of the Malaysian
currency and the stock market, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we are unwilling to face this challenge with a more
patriotic attitude and hard work, we'll certainly be colonized
once more," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Don't think that once we are independent, we will be
independent forever. If we do not strive to preserve and safeguard
our independence, colonialists will return to control us directly
or indirectly," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir dwelt at length on the foreign speculative attacks and
manipulation of the currency and stock markets which he said had
chipped off 10 percent of the value of the ringgit against the
U.S. dollar in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to be vigilant and alert to elements in the
country that threaten to destroy what Malaysia had built and
achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
He said all the achievements could come to naught if the people
became influenced by the various claims and baseless allegations
being made and if they adopted an extreme attitude over any issue.
</P>
<P>
He said he could understand why foreigners were bent on
discrediting the country but was very disappointed when certain
Malaysians, who had benefited from the country's economic growth
made possible by the government, seemed eager to see foreigners
"blasting our economy".
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader said it was not easy to raise the living
standards of the people or ensuring equitable distribution of
wealth or achieving an eight percent annual economic growth since
1988 in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Equitable distribution of wealth was not done by taking from
the rich and giving it to the poor. This was done through economic
expansion and growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past four decades, he said, Malaysia has attained
successes which were never thought of when the country became
independent 40 years ago. These included building Malaysia's own
car, having its own satellite in orbit, scaling Mount Everest,
hosting the Commonwealth Games next year or having its own son
becoming president of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
But Mahathir admitted that Malaysia was unlikely to attain
around eight percent growth this year as projected due to the
current economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's trade deficit was expected to increase as
more ringgit would have to be paid to finance imports due to the
fall in the currency's value while Malaysia's exports become
cheaper to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon Malaysians to equip themselves with all
kinds of knowledge and the latest skills.
</P>
<P>
He said the 21st century would be more challenging due to the
dawn of the globalization era and sophisticated information
technology and if people stick to their present methods, Malaysia
would be left behind.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for Better Performance by Township Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
today urged the country's township coal mines to carry out
structural readjustments and promote healthy development in
accordance with the Law on Coal.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the ongoing national coal conference, Wu said
the establishment of key coal-producing counties presents an
effective method for transforming township coal enterprises and
introducing mass production.
</P>
<P>
Wu called for various localities to fully implement State
Council policies on supporting, transforming, reorganizing and
enhancing township coal mines in order to promote their sound
development.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the government designated 112 key coal-producing
counties out of 1,257 related counties nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The key coal-producing counties, which have recorded notable
achievements over the past 10 years, produced 274 million tons of
coal in 1996, or 20 percent of the nation's total coal production.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, these counties recorded a total output value of 18.42
billion yuan, with taxes and profits of 1.17 billion yuan and 1.4
billion yuan respectively.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Peace, Security Keynote ECOWAS Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
ABUJA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Peace and Security still remain
the number one task ahead for west African countries to cope with
after heated discussions at a sub-regional summit which ended
here in the early hours today.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) should
have concluded its 20th summit of heads of state and government
Friday afternoon as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
However, the leaders did not return to the conference hall
until about 4:00 (3:00 GMT) this morning to make public a final
communique which contains a package of decisions on the future of
the sub-region, a product of compromise after extra hours of
heated discussions.
</P>
<P>
Like the previous ECOWAS summits since 1990 after the outbreak
of the civil war in Liberia, the authority of ECOWAS, a 16-member
economic bloc in the region, has to focus on conflict in a member
state.
</P>
<P>
This time it is the crisis in Sierra Leone, where the May 25
military coup overthrowing the legitimate government, has posed
threat on peace and security in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
It is far early to know the effect of the measures adopted by
leaders at the just-concluded summit, but the decision on Sierra
Leone has indicated that the resolution of the crisis there is
something to be accomplished at an unknown date in the future.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS leaders at the summit agreed to impose a package of
sanctions and blockade on Sierra Leone to force the military
junta in power to step down, abandoning the much asked-for
military action.
</P>
<P>
While endorsing the objective of early reinstatement of the
ousted government led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, the
leaders mandated the ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG to
monitor the ceasefire, enforce sanctions and embargo and secure
the peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Despite the preference by some member countries to the use of
force, the decision echoed the demand for peaceful means with the
assistance of the United Nations, the Organization of African
Unity and the entire international community which unanimously
condemned the coup and urged immediate return of democracy in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Obviously to add weight to peaceful means dealing with the
Sierra Leonean crisis, the leaders introduced Liberia, where a
new government has just emerged from a seven-year bloody civil
war, into the Committee of Four on the issue comprising Nigeria,
Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The status of the committee has been upgraded from the level
of foreign ministers to that of heads of state.
</P>
<P>
The summit did not forget to call the international community
to assist the national reconstruction and resettlement of the
hundreds of thousands of refugees in Liberia to safeguard the
country's hard-earned but fragile peace, which is crucial to the
security of the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The organization announced the lift of all sanctions imposed
on Liberia during its fractional war and requested the
international community to do so. (More )

<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Yongkang, Chang Yong )
</P>
<P>
ABUJA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- On the economic side, the
fundamental cause that drew the 16 countries into the
sub-regional body 22 years ago, the leaders came up at the end of
the summit without much new ideas to boost economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Collective efforts of member countries has brought about a
four percent economic growth in the sub-region over the past few
years, which is higher than that of population. Some member
countries even recorded an average 6.5-percent economic growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
But as ECOWAS Chairman, Nigeria's Head of State Sani Abacha
said at the summit that much has not been done and has to be done
particularly when the ultimate objectives, such as the creation
of a common Customs Union by the year 2000 and that of an
economic and monetary union 2005, are concerned.
</P>
<P>
The most eye-catching move the leaders decided to adopt is the
establishment of a committee made up of Cape Verde, Cote
d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali and Togo to coordinate and monitor
sub-regional monetary integration, with an aim to adopt a single
west African currency by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ambition of sub-regional economic integration, however, is
arduous to realize as there seems to be lack of act in unison
among member states which are yet to ratify many protocols they
signed at previous summits.
</P>
<P>
Some even refused to pay their membership dues for dozen of
years, leaving the executive secretary with a bill of arrears
exceeding 40 U.S. dollars, which, as a result, almost halted the
activity of the institution in monitoring the implementation of
the programs.
</P>
<P>
The divisive policies and other forms of alignment alleged by
Gambian Head of State Col. Yahya Jammeh, particularly the
unnecessary competition between English-speaking and
French-speaking members, also challenge the unity of ECOWAS
leaders as far as national interest is concerned.
</P>
<P>
The leaders have decided to turn the yearly summit into a
biannual event so as to provide a forum for them to give
timely touches to steer the integration process along the right
course.
</P>
<P>
It is the genuine hope of people throughout the world, and
west Africa in particular, leaders of ECOWAS states will endeavor
to strengthen unity and create an environment favorable for the
sub-region to enter the next century.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Defense Minister on Realization of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Defense Minister
General Mustafa Talas has said his country gave top priority to
the realization of fair and comprehensive peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Local press today quoted Talas as saying at the ceremony of
the naval force day Friday in the coastal city of Latakia that
fair and comprehensive peace can never be established unless the
Israeli expansionist policy is ended and the occupied Arab
territories are returned to their owners.
</P>
<P>
He said Syria deems the realization of peace its strategic
option because peace is the only thing that can get the region
out of the violence circle.
</P>
<P>
Since it came to power last year, the Israeli government led
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to undermine the
peace process and keep the region in the whirlwind of struggle,
Talas said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. administration to pressure the Netanyahu
government and force it to comply with the will of the
international community and implement U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian defense minister reiterated that his country would
never give up a grain of its sand and would never be intimidated
by threats.
</P>
<P>
Syria will keep faithful to its principles in defense of the
dignity of the Arab nation till its all usurped rights are
regained, he concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Extensive efforts to build an
army with Chinese characteristics over the the past five years
have yielded remarkable results in modernizing and standardizing
the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
9,936 training classes held over the past five years have
benefitted a total of 464,000 officers at or above the regimental
commander level.
</P>
<P>
The seven theoretical study and discussion sessions the PLA has
sponsored to improve the theoretical level of military personnel
have produced 93 theses, which were later selected to be presented
at national seminars, with five winning various types of awards.
</P>
<P>
Study sessions sponsored by the PLA has yielded over 70 types
of theoretical study and audio-visual materials.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has recorded great progress in efforts to improve the
leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the army.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of secretaries of the CPC committees at or
above the division commander level and over 54,000 secretaries of
basic units in PLA participated in training classes during the
1992-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has acted in accordance with instructions made by
Chairman Jiang Zemin of the Central Military Commission, at the
end of 1994 and has launched an education campaign designed to
enhance the sense of patriotism and devotion, strengthen the
revolutionary outlook, stress the respect for officers and the
love for soldiers, and uphold the spirit of hard work.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 officers at or above the army commander level and over
6,000 lower-ranking officers have undertaken fact-finding missions
to PLA grass-roots units on an annual basis.

A number of officers and soldiers have been cited as the models
to emulate and over 10,000 model grass-roots units and individuals
have been named following Jiang Zemin's call for the army to take
the lead in promoting ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
A large number of qualified young officers have been promoted
to higher ranks. The average age of the military commanders has
dropped by two years compared to 1992, registering a 17.8 percent
increase of officers with college or higher educations.
</P>
<P>
The increasingly widely-spread use of high-tech items such as
computer simulation has led to significant improvements in
military training. In addition, constant improvements in military
equipment, and the overall structure and combat readiness of land,
air and naval forces have been made.
</P>
<P>
Improvements in military legislation has led to the
promulgation of a group of military laws, rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Improved logistics and relevant technology resulted in the
formation of a strong logistical support system for supplies,
salvage, transportation and maintenance, and has greatly improved
the life of soldiers stationed in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, new highways, railways and airports have produced
a three-dimensional transportation network for national defense.
</P>
<P>
Major breakthroughs have recorded in scientific research
related to national defense, with the most representative
achievements including successful launches of the Dongfanghong-3
and the Fengyun-2 satellites and the introduction of advanced
mainframe computers.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable results have also been made in the realm of military
diplomacy, with PLA sending delegations to over 80 countries since
1992. The PLA has also hosted visits by several hundred foreign
military delegations.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram said today that India's economy could grow at 7-8
percent annually in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"We shall grow at 7 to 8 percent and there should also be a
mechanism to ensure that benefits of growth are shared equitably,"
the finance minister said while delivering a speech on India's
economy at the South Indian Education Society in Mumbai (Bombay).
</P>
<P>
The Indian economy must follow a road where all the 90 million
people in the country could walk with dignity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister classified the Indian population into three groups
of 300 million each, saying that the first group has access to
fairly large income, the second group has some kind of jobs and
the third is without any kind of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
India in the past three years enjoyed an average growth in
gross domestic product of about 7 percent, as compared to a mere
3.5 percent in the first three decades after the country's
independence in 1947, he said.

<HEADLINE> Algerian PM Condemns Largest Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed
Ouyahya has condemned the massacre by terrorists in Sedi Moussa
town, south of the capital Algiers, Thursday night as "barbaric
and coward act of reprisal," the Algerian radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified armed group perpetrated a horrible massacre
Thursday night in the small town that lies at about 20 kilometers
south of Algiers, killing 98 local people and wounding 120
others, according to the government figures.
</P>
<P>
However, eyewitnesses put the number of deaths in this
mass-murder incident at more than 200. The massacre is the
largest terrorist act witnessed by Algeria at the hands of armed
groups over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian radio quoted Ouyahya as saying that the
government would carry on its fight against the criminal
terrorists till they are eradicated completely.
</P>
<P>
This massacre is, like the previous terrorist acts, a mere
barbaric and coward reprisal targeting the sons of Algeria that
stood firm against the ugly face of terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian prime minister noted that his government
was taking strict measures to boost security around the remote
rural areas nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants have been waging a war against the
government since 1992 when the government canceled elections that
the Islamic Salvation Front was believed to win. More than 60,000
people have been killed in the five years of insurgency.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for End of US Presence in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian new defense minister
today called for a Gulf countries' coordinated strategy in order
to achieve lasting security and bring an end to the presence of
the U.S. naval forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Minister of
Defense and Armed Forces Logistics Ali Shamkhani made the
statement in an IRNA interview here today.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani highlighted the need to step up sincere and honest
consultations with the neighboring states, the Persian Gulf
Sheikhdoms in particular, to establish new security arrangements
to stop the presence of foreign forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Determining the real sources of threat in the strategic
Persian Gulf region, and whether or not the presence of foreign
forces, particularly the U.S., is itself a threat, will be among
major topics to be raised with the Persian Gulf littoral states,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani further called for an end to the unwarranted presence
of foreign military forces in the region, U.S. forces in
particular. "Measures of this sort (ending the presence of foreign
forces) will certainly reduce regional tension," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fifth Fleet has turned the Persian Gulf into a test
ground for its weaponry, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This, besides being a threat to the whole region, is also a
source of pollution in the Persian Gulf waters, posing a serious
threat to health, environment and economy of the entire region,"
Shamkhani noted.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's defense industries' policy, he said it focuses on
achieving self-sufficiency in conventional weapons intended for
defense of the country.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani received the vote of confidence on August 20 from the
Parliament as the defense minister in the cabinet proposed by
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.

<HEADLINE> Khan, Power Enter Hong Kong Squash Open Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Top seed and world number one
Jansher Khan of Pakistan was just one step away from winning an
eighth Hong Kong Open title after beating off a tough challenge
from Australian Brett Martin in the semi-finals of the Cathay
Pacific Squash Open here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jansher won the semi-final match 15-11, 15-12, 9-15, 15-9 at
the 74,000 U.S. dollars event here today.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Canadian Jonathon Power took the other berth of the
title clash after his 15-11, 15-10, 15-6 win over second seed
Peter Nicol form Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Seven-time winner Jansher Khan from Peshwar had to resort every
ounce of his energy today to beat the 10th-ranked Australian in
the 41 minutes' match in the Hong Kong Park Indoor Games Hall.
</P>
<P>
The Peshawar prince took the number one spot for the first time
in 1987 and the top ranking has been to his credit ever since
1993.
</P>
<P>
After having two games lost to the Pakistani, Martin managed to
win one back at the third largely through the mercy of the many
errors by Jansher.
</P>
<P>
But the Pakistani did not give him more chances as he led
throughout to take the fourth and final game and the match.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Australian, the winner here in 1993, blamed the
refereeing today, saying that it was hard for him to play well
when something concerning the referees came up to his mind. "They
are not experienced enough for such games. They just couldn't see
what was happening on the court," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But this happens everywhere, you know. I'm not just blaming
the refereeing here in Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Power, ranked fourth in the world, spent 42
minutes to win over Nicol in the other semi-final clash.
</P>
<P>
Nicol, 24, who beat Australian qualifier Byron Davis to qualify
for the semi-finals, said on Friday that the world number one spot
was in his sight.
</P>
<P>
"The number one spot is within my reach, possibly in the next
two or three months. The difference could be one tournament. If
Jansher loses in the early and I win." he said.
</P>
<P>
"I get the feeling that I can beat Jansher everytime I play
him. He's vulnerable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nicol lost to Jansher 17-15, 9-15, 15-12, 8-15, 15-8 after two-
hour-and-six-minute battle in the final of the British Open this
April.
</P>
<P>
And Nicol avenged his April defeat by beating Jansher 3-1 at
the Al-Ahram International held in Egypt this June.
</P>
<P>
But the 22-year-old Scot might have to think twice after
today's defeat, since Jansher was not as vulnerable as he had
thought and he might have some others to beat before taking on the
king of squash from Pakistan.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Diego Maradona was
suspended by the Argentine Football Association (AFA) on Friday
night after testing positive for drugs.
</P>
<P>
The AFA said that the provisional ban will remain in force
until a second test on the urine sample is conducted next week.
</P>
<P>
If it proves positive, Maradona is expected to be suspended
from the game for up to five years.

Maradona, the former Argentine captain, has tested positive for
drugs twice before -- in 1991 when he was playing for Napoli and
during the 1994 World Cup in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The latest failed test came after Maradona helped his club Boca

<HEADLINE> Average Family Size Reduced in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's average family size
has been reduced to four from seven in 1982 as a result of
increased access to information on family planning, the daily
''The herald'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the size of the family has also been attributed to
growing economic hardships being faced by the country,
according
to the Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC).
</P>
<P>
Shdrick Muzondo, ZNFPC information, education and
communications officer, said Friday that there had been increased
acceptance of family planning methods countrywide.
</P>
<P>
''The average family size has been going down since 1982. More
people including those in rural areas now opt for modern methods
of family planning,'' said Muzondo at an ongoing Harare
agricultural show.
</P>
<P>
ZNFPC launched a massive campaign a few years ago with the aim
to reduce the size of families. The use of condom continued to be
one of the most common methods in family planning.
</P>
<P>
A youth peer education program meant to educate the youth on
the dangers of indulging in sex is under way in rural areas.

</P>
<P>
Shen said that the establishment of diplomatic ties between

August 29 that his country decided to sever the so-called
"diplomatic ties" with Taiwan and forge diplomatic ties with the

links with the PRC, and in the view of the international law,
there cannot be two governments in one country.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) raided a trading center in west Uganda, killing 10
and abducting other 70, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The attack in early morning Friday on Kihondo trading center
in Kabarole district was confirmed by Charles Agina,
the operation commander in the district, and Davis Mudaali, the
regional police commander.
</P>
<P>
"My officers and men have joined the army to pursue the
rebels," Mudaali said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels ransacked the trading center at least one and a half
hours, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
"Various shops were broken into and looted," said Bagwa
whose shop was among the robbed.
</P>
<P>
One rebel was killed in the exchange of fire, and one soldier was
killed by a landmine when the army pursued the rebels.
</P>
<P>
This was the first serious harassment of the ADF rebels to
Kabarole district.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Opinion Poll: Moi to Retain Kenyan Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 30 (Xinhua) --A recent public poll shows that
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi will retain his presidency in
the forthcoming General Election with 37.5 percent of the vote
for him.
</P>
<P>
Results of the opinion poll published by today's "Daily
Nation" indicate that Raila Odinga of the opposition National
Development Party of Kenya (NDPK) will garner 15 percent while
Mwai Kibaki of Democratic Party of Kenya (DP) and Kenneth Matiba
of Ford Asili will win 11.6 percent and 11 percent of the vote
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The poll, undertaken by a Kenyan company Strategic Public
Relations during August 9 to 15 throughout the country, shows that
the ruling Kenya African National Union will capture 67 seats in
Kenya's parliament, NDPK 22 and DP 20 of the 144 constituencies
covered by the poll.
</P>
<P>
The polling company set up last year predicts a massive
turnout with 98 percent of those polled intending to vote in the
General Elections to be held later this year.
</P>
<P>
The poll results indicate that some 62.5 percent of the voters
interviewed will vote for opposition parties which are seriously
divided.
</P>
<P>
Most of 20,000 people interviewed in the poll want a leader
who can unite Kenyans with 16.1 percent preferring a nationalist,
15.1 percent an accountable individual and 13.6 percent a
courageous and religious leader, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
A mere 1.9 percent prefer a candidate from their own ethnic
group while only a few people would like an authoritative and
militant leader, the results show.
</P>
<P>
But officials from the polling company told a press conference
Friday that considering the majority of those interviewed
had secondary level education, the margin of error could be
higher.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Foreign Debts Increase 10 Percent: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today that his country's foreign debts have
increased by 10 percent or more following local currency and stock
market manipulation by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
"Their manipulation caused some 450 billion ringgit (about 160
billion U.S. dollars) to be wiped out from our capital market and
reduce our assets by 10 percent," he said when opening the 44th
general assembly of the Malaysian Chinese Association, a partner
in the ruling National Front led by the prime minister. Some 1,500
delegates attended the meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said Malaysia's per capita income, which had once
reached 4,600 dollars, was reduced to 4,200 dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said it was unfortunate that some foreign investors who
never set up any industries in the country but are only interested
in speculating on the stock market have turned out to be
"ungrateful".
</P>
<P>
"After reaping profits for such a long time from the country's
progress, they now try to ruin our country's economy by attacking
our currency and our stock market," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on all parties in the country to be united and join
forces in tiding over the current currency and stock market
crises.
</P>
<P>
"Let us not join in speculation activities during this
situation faced by the country. Instead, we should all help in
restoring our economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
While admitting the country's problems, the prime minister said
people should not face the problems with gloom but should regard
them as challenges and lessons to learn.
</P>
<P>
He said what had happened in the country showed that a
borderless world could prove to be a jungle full of wild beasts
and Malaysia, as a small country, could not close up its borders.
</P>
<P>
"We will develop the skills to live in this jungle and will
develop the skills to handle the wild beasts which roam inside
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that in efforts to overcome the country's
economic problems, we should continue to have political
stability," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the National Front component parties to ensure that
they are strong and stable and continue to support the coalition's
concept of consultation and consensus.

overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
Tin was traded on the Kuala Lumpur tin Market (KLTM)
substantially higher above the 15.00 ringgit (about 5.3 U.S.
dollars) per kg level this week.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit's relative weakness boosted demand for local tin
throughout the week, anaylsts said, adding that however, the
performance of ringgit against the U.S dollar would continue to
dictate the movements of KLTM.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit dropped to its lowest level of 2.9640/90 on Friday
morning before settling at 2.8949/95 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM's accumulated turnover broadened to 796 tons against

</P>
<P>
In comparison with three-month tin on the London Metal
Exchange, the local tin recorded a discount between 10 U.S.
dollars per ton and 95 U.S. dollars per ton except on Monday
which saw a premium of 20 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Over the trading week, the Malaysian rubber market was steadier
with prices quoted at a very supportive levels.
</P>
<P>
Against last week's close, September RSS-One jumped nine sen to
259.00 sen (92.5 U.S. cents) per kg while SMR 20 was 7.50 sen
higher to 256.00 sen (about 91.4 U.S. cents) per kg.

<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization's (INRO) daily
market indicator price for August 28 was at 195.57
Malaysia/Singapore cents per kg against 191.03 cents on August 21.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average stood at 193.93 cents per kg
compared with 191.76 cents last week.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market is seen continuing its pick up next
week with the RSS grade poised to hit the 265.00 sen mark, taking
advantage of the weaker ringgit, analysts said.

<P>
PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The civil war in Algeria, or rather the martyrdom which has
lived the population of the country over the past five years, has
reached its limit of horror and taken a new turning point. From 100
to 300 civilians -- according to different accounts -- were burned
alive, had their throats cut or mutilated by axes in Reis, 20
kilometers from the center of Algiers, in an unprecedented barbarity
which lasted for four hours at dawn on Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time in Japanese history, the Supreme Court of
Japan ruled on Friday by declaring as illegal the suppression of the
chapter in primary school history textbooks telling the atrocity
committed by the 731 biological unit of the Japanese army in China
and Singapor during World War II, including biological experiments
conducted on Chinese civilians.
</P>
<P>
The verdict brought to an end of a three-decade legal fight
between the Japanese government and Japanese historian Saburo
Ienaga, who wrote the history of 731 unit into the textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- One after another, the stock exchange markets in Asia are
having free falling. The stock exchange index in Hong Kong fell by 5
percent on Friday, and that of Bangkok by 4.1 percent, while those
in Manilla, Jakarta, and Kuala Lumpur fell Thursday by 9.3 percent,
4.5 percent and 4.2 percent. This is not only a fall, but a krach.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the stock indexes in Europe were also oriented toward
a lowering mainly because of expections of a rise of interest rates
in Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
-- Day after day, carnages or attacks come one after another in
Algeria. From 100 to 200 people were slaughtered at the door of
Algiers early Friday. Three months after the legislative elections
which are supposed to ensure the triumph of democracy, Algeria has
come to the deepest of a bloody impasse.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian King Has Role to Restore Peace: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today that ASEAN is confident that
Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk can play a role in restoring peace
and stability in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
King Sihanouk still has influence and is respected in that
country, he said, hoping that the situation in Cambodia would
normalize with his (King's) return to Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN feels that King Sihanouk still has that role to play to
enable the country to reach national reconciliation," he was
quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying
today in the northern state of Pulau Pinang.
</P>
<P>
"There are still clashes in the northern part of the country
near the Thai border," Abdullah told reporters there, adding if
clashes and military actions cease to occur, there is a
possibility that peace and stability could be fully restored in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
He said that ASEAN, of which Malaysia is a prominent member,
only envisaged that King Sihanouk may make an initiative towards
this.
</P>
<P>
He said that the return of King Sihanouk who was met by Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen, Foreign Minister Ung Hout and acting head
of state in his absence, Chea Sim, at the airport, is a good sign.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is giving full attention to its mission led by Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas to achieve its objective.
</P>
<P>
On Cambodia's entry into ASEAN, Abdullah said that it all
depended on the situation in that country. It is ASEAN's hope
that Cambodia could join the regional grouping as soon as
possible, he added.

<HEADLINE> Minimum Wage Rises in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's monthly minimum wage
will increase to 760 Zimbabwe Dollars (66 U.S. Dollars), up from
400 Zimbabwe Dollars per month, according to the announcement
made here Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the government Gazette, the new wage comes into
effect from July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The minimum wage is earned by the workers whose remuneration
is not fixed by any agreement or regulation under the Labor
Rrelations Act.
</P>
<P>
However, the new minimum wage falls far below the demands of
trade unions who say a salary below 1,000 Zimbabwe Dollars (86
U.S. Dollars) per month can no longer sustain anyone.
</P>
<P>
The government also gazetted new wages for other workers with
a 31.22 percent increase.

JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Sudanese

The Sudanese rebels have been fighting to get greater autonomy

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Welcome Albright's Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Both Israel and Palestinians
have expressed welcome to the announcement that U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright will begin a week-long Middle East trip
from September 9, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the trip in Washington, U.S. State Department
spokesman James Ruben said that the peace process in Middle East
is in trouble and the secretary plans to remain in the region for
at least a week.
</P>
<P>
Albright Friday telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to inform them
of her upcoming visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak said the prime minister has
expressed welcome to the secretary's planned visit. He said
Israel and the United States shared the view that the Palestinian
National Authority (PAN) is not doing enough to crack down on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu told Albright that the security situation
had improved sufficiently for Israel to ease its closure on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the Palestinian side, Saeb Erakat, the PNA's
senior negotiator, also welcomed Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting of the Palestinian cabinet in
Bethlehem, West Bank, he stressed that Albright should
concentrate on persuading Israel to stop construction of
settlements in the West Bank, confiscation of land and
demolition of homes.
</P>
<P>
It will be Albright's first visit to the region after her
seven months in office, which will take her to Israel, Egypt,
Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia. She will also meet with Arafat in
the Palestinian controlled areas and may go to Lebanon as well.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Israeli opposition Labor party leader Ehud Barak
said that the secretary's visit should be used to renew an
initiative to withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Israel Television Friday night, Barak proposed
that Albright go to Damascus with a new plan for a staged,
supervised and slow withdrawal from Lebanon that will include
Syrian guarantees and the entry of the Lebanese army and
international force. Barak said the whole process could be
accomplished in a matter of month.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu said that the Israeli government's policy on
Lebanon has not changed. He said that "if we depart from
Lebanon, Lebanese will come to us and reach the Galilee
border." He added that it is far from finding a stable solution
in Lebanon that will enable Israel to leave.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied an area of 1,000 square kilometers of the
Lebanon territories, which it self-styled as "security zone."

<HEADLINE> Commerce Contributes More to GDP Growth in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- With an adequate supply and
stable price, the commerce sector is contributing more to the GDP
growth in Shanghai, China's largest commercial center.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the commerce sector generated 20.5 billion
yuan (2.498 billion US dollars) to Shanghai's GDP in the first
seven months, a year-on-year increase of 14.5 percent. The figure
represented 11.28 percent of the city's GDP, and 25.11 percent of
the gross output value of the tertiary or service industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, GDP in the commercial sector amounted to 31.584
billion yuan, making up 10.98 percent of the city's GDP and 26.03
percent of the output value of the tertiary industry.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth has been reported in Shanghai's commercial sector
over recent years. By 1996, the sector had boasted more than
196,000 retail and wholesale outlets that have employed some 1.45
million people.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the chain-store business, which generated 4.5 billion
yuan in turnover in 1996, is also accountable substantially to the
growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also suggest that the sales income of foodstuffs has
been on the decline while that of garments and other daily-use
items has been on the rise, indicating the rising standards of
people's livelihood.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Approves Plan for Faster Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The 20th summit of the heads of
states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
has approved a packages of measures to accelerate sub-regional
economic integration and development.
</P>
<P>
A final communique, issued by the summit ended here this
morning, noted that in the past few years, most ECOWAS countries
have made significant advance in the development of political
institutions and economic structures.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, it said, the sub-region has recorded an
appreciable economic growth rate of about four percent, higher
than the rate of population growth.
</P>
<P>
The communique emphasized the need for the member countries to
implement sound macro-economic policies so as to consolidate
their success in inflation control, monetary discipline and
improved adjustment policies.
</P>
<P>
It commended the move by the international community to
resolve the debt problems of heavily indebted poor countries, but
regretted that only two ECOWAS countries has been qualified to
benefit from the program.
</P>
<P>
Noting that significant development can only be achieved
through good long-term development strategies, the summit urged
member countries to develop their long-term development plans,
such as the African Elephant Program of Cote d'Ivoire and the
Vision 2010 of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS leaders also re-affirmed their full commitment to
regional monetary integration and the eventual adoption of a
single West African currency.
</P>
<P>
To realize this goal by the year 2000, the summit approved a
committee comprising the heads of state of Cape Verde, Cote
d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali and Togo to co-ordinate and monitor the
program.
</P>
<P>
The summit decided that an ECOWAS travel cheque will be
launched by the end of the year to make trade within the
community easier.
</P>
<P>
To solve the serious financial difficulties facing ECOWAS
institutions, the summit passed a resolution urging all member
countries to immediately ratify the protocol for the application
of a community level fees that will replace the current member
contributions.
</P>
<P>
In view of the success of the first phase of the ECOWAS
sub-regional telecommunications network, the summit approved the
second phase of program to be known as INTELCOM II.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the program will lead to the
modernization and expansion of telecommunications in the
sub-region through full digitalization and the use of other
modern facilities.

overseas-funded enterprises since April last year, according to a
provincial official.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that unreasonable fees in the past undermined
Liaoning's investment environment, and added that the province
improved its soft investment environment in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The investment environment has improved remarkably owing to the
concerted efforts of the related departments, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Liaoning had actually put to use
2.1 billion US dollars in overseas investment last year, up 10
percent on 1995, with direct foreign investments rising by 18.7
percent to 1.7 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, overseas-funded enterprises in
Liaoning reported a sales volume of 26 billion yuan (3.1 billion
US dollars) for the first half of this year, an increase of 21.5
percent over the same period of last year.

<P>
LISBON August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Moroccan government and the
Popular Front of the Liberation of West Sahara reached a
compromise agreement here today on deployment of troops in West
Sahara, repatriation of refugees and release of political
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
During the fourth round of direct talks between representatives
of both sides which ended a day earlier, one issue that remains to
be resolved is to reach agreement on the detailed code of a
referendum on West Sahara's future.
</P>
<P>
The talks were chaired by U.N. special envoy for West Sahara
James Baker, former U.S. Secretary of State, who described the
talks as "fruitful".
</P>
<P>
Baker said that the next round of talks are expected to take
place in the United States on September 12-14, which will focus on
the behavior of both sides in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks are of great significance which would be the
last effort made by the U.N. special mission for the referendum in
West Sahara before its term expires on September 30, hoping that
the two sides would close their differences and find a final
solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
The original plan for a referendum on the future of West Sahara
in January 1992 has been postponed because Morocco and the Popular
Front could not reach an agreement on the list of voters.

<HEADLINE> Huge Loan Provided for Expressway Construction in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Loans worth 900 million yuan (108
million US dollars) have been provided for building part of an
expressway network that encircles south China's Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
The loans offered by the Hainan Branch of the Agricultural Bank
of China (ABC) are expected to be used for construction of the
section linking Yangpu Development Area with Basuo in the western
part of the island province.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has accelerated highway building over recent
years. Besides the completion of the eastern part of a
round-the-island expressway, the section linking Haikou city, the
provincial capital, and Yangpu Development Area of the western
part of the network has open to traffic.
</P>
<P>
The Yangpu-Basuo section, whose construction now under way, is
regarded as a key part of the western link and, upon completion,
it will become a trunk line in the less-developed central and
western Hainan, connecting the four economic areas of Haikou,
Yangpu, Basuo, and Sanya and the coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
The western link is vital to the development of this tropical
island province since the surrounding areas, abundant in mineral
and aquatic resources, is an important base for producing iron and
steel, building materials, cement and plate glass, refined oil and
related petroleum products and other heavy industrial goods.

SHANGHAI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of China's
largest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),
will transform its 15,000 employees into contract workers in three
months in a bid to boost efficiency.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,000 employees in three sub-branches of ICBC
Shanghai have already signed labor contracts, signifying an
official start of personnel reform in the banking sector, which
has long been renowned for the availability of a "golden rice
bowl" -- permanent employment.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jianqing, president of ICBC Shanghai, said that the
personnel system under a planned regime has greatly discounted the
enthusiasm and creativity of both the executives and employees and
therefore impeded the growth of banking business.
</P>
<P>
The contract system, first piloted on a trial basis in the
Pudong branch in 1993, will spread to nearly 30 subsidiaries and
over 600 business operations in several phases, covering more than
15,000 employees in aggregate, he said.
</P>
<P>
The reform plan has met with an enthusiastic response from the
employees, Jiang noted.

UNITED NATIONS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Prime Minister of
Saint Lucia, Kenny Anthony, announced tonight that his Labour
Party government has decided to establish full diplomatic
relations with the People's Republic of China and sever so-called
diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide-televised and broadcast address, Anthony
stressed that his government's decision "is in keeping with
international developments on the non-recognition of Taiwan as a
legitimate state."
</P>
<P>
"The majority of countries in the world today have full
diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China," he
said, adding that "from the point of view of international law,
the recognition of the administration on Taiwan as the government
of all China, is not tenable," he added.
</P>
<P>
"By concluding diplomatic relations with the People's Republic
of China, Saint Lucia will only be modernising its foreign policy,
and proceeding in a direction which the majority of the world's
states have already trod," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Ministry of Foreign and International
Trade of Saint Lucia announced in a press release that it "has
informed" Taiwan that the government of Saint Lucia "will be
establishing full diplomatic relations with the People"s Republic
of China as of Monday 1st September 1997."

ABUJA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The 20th summit of the heads of
states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
has approved a packages of sanctions and blockade on Sierra Leone
to force its military government to step down.
</P>
<P>
This decision was taken at the closing session of the summit
which ended here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The final communique issued by the summit said the ECOWAS
leaders endorsed the objectives of early reinstatement of the
legitimate government of President Tejan Kabbah, the return of
peace and security and the resolution of the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
The leaders expressed their determination to deploy all
efforts towards the peaceful resolution of the Sierra Leone
crisis and called for the co-operation and understanding of all
parties concerned.

<P>
The communique said the leaders are deeply concerned about
the breakdown of negotiations in Abidjan on July 30th between the
ECOWAS Committee of Four on Sierra Leone and the military junta
in that country and decided to approve the sanctions and blockade
in view of the intransigence of the illegal government.
</P>
<P>
The summit mandated the ECOWAS peace-keeping force known as
ECOMOG to monitor the ceasefire, enforce sanctions and embargo
and secure the peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It decided to enlarge the Committee of Four into the committee
of five by including Liberia, and raise the status of the
committee to the level of heads of state and government.

<HEADLINE> India to Impose New Excise on Soft Drinks Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- India will levy new excise
duty on the country's soft drinks from September 1 this year, a
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The new excise duty on soft drinks and soda water will be
levied on the basis of the maximum retail price (MRP) declared on
aerated water bottles and containers.
</P>
<P>
The new excise duty comes on the heels of the government's move
to extend the MRP provisions to cosmetics, toilet preparations,
paints and varnishes and footwear. The government has now covered
almost all the consumer goods on which it has reportedly been
losing revenue because of high mark-ups by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
A series of raids on soft drink manufacturers revealed that
many companies were resorting to under-valuation. Accordingly, the
government has introduced tariff values, an estimate the
government makes for commodities which are difficult to assess.

southwest China's Sichuan province tired of this summer's extended
period of stifling heat in the Sichuan Basin have been fleeing to
the countryside on weekends to beat the heat.

<HEADLINE> Ricupero: UNCTAD, China Enjoy Close Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens
Ricupero said he is satisfied with the close cooperative
relationship between UNCTAD and China, hoping that the latter can
do more for the development of other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"China has been a strong supporter of UNCTAD and contributed
significantly to its work," Ricupero, the head of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, said. "It has
participated actively in UNCTAD inter-governmental
deliberations. It is one of the few developing countries that have
made financial contributions to UNCTAD on an annual basis."
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD has also made useful contributions, through its policy
analysis and technical cooperation, in the process of China's
policy formulation and implementation, particularly in the area of
trade and investment, Ricupero said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD Trade and Development Reports have been translated
into Chinese. They have been used as training material for senior
officials and as the important source of reference on investment
in many official documents.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero hopes that China can play a more active role in
</P>
<P>
-- Developing a positive agenda for the developing countries in
the multilateral negotiations;
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening further South-South cooperation, promoting
trade and investment to and from other developing countries;
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting the development of the least-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Ricupero shares the argument that China
needs WTO and WTO needs China. Ricupero has been chairman of
General Council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), WTO's predecessor, chairman of the Contracting Parties,
and chairman of the developing countries in the GATT.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that China has made some impressive progress,"
Ricupero said. "I hope that in the coming months some important
political events that are going to take place, like the summit
between China and the United States, could add an important
political element to China's accession to WTO."

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong residents are allowed
to set up overseas-funded firms or individually-owned, private
businesses in east China's Fujian Province, according to new
government policy.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy of the Fujian provincial government, the
private businesses to be run in Fujian by residents of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will enjoy the same
preferential treatment as local residents in term of trade
operation and way of management.
</P>
<P>
While the duration of operation is decided by the relevant
government stipulations, the duration of the business license for
the Hong Kong firms will be determined by the period of validity
of the proprietors' "temporary residence cards" and, in case of
need, applications can be raised for extension of their residence
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
To allow Hongkong residents to run private business in Fujian
is a new move initiated by the provincial government to expand
Fujian-Hong Kong economic and trade cooperation, which went into
trial operation on July 1.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah Crashes to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah Friday
plummeted to an all-time low of 3,070 against the U.S. dollar from
the 2,970 close Thursday after the central bank reportedly tried
to inject liquidity and cut interest rates, dealers said today.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah, which opened at 3,020/3,040, touched an historic
low of 3,070 in early trading but bounced back in the afternoon to
close at 2,890/2,910.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the drop in the rupiah value was caused by
reports that the government will soon remove the tight monetary
policy which set a high interest rate and the central bank had
injected liquidity in some small and medium banks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jakarta Stock Exchange suffered another large
intraday loss Friday amid uncertainty over the rupiah's direction
and regional market slump.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers said share prices fell 6.9 percent, pushing the
composite index down to a 21-month low or its worst one-day loss
in eight years.
</P>
<P>
The composite index lost 36.404 points to close at 493.962,
with turnover totaling 425.85 million shares worth 260.9 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts and brokers said Friday's steep fall in the
stock market was not expected by most investors.
</P>
<P>
"The market has already collapsed, no one can save it now but
the government," said an analyst.
</P>
<P>
A senior stockbroker with a joint venture securities firm said
Friday's breaking of 500-point psychological index level would
further dampen the market.
</P>
<P>
Bankers warned on Friday that a prolonged tight monetary policy
could lead to bank defaults and corporate bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Some cabinet ministers have also expressed similar concerns,
saying that a tight monetary policy was dampening the investment
climate in the country. It should not be maintained too long as it
would kill small and medium businesses, they added.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the government will soon hold a meeting
to be attended by all cabinet ministers to discuss the rupiah
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Elderly Population Growing Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's population is going
through an accelerated "aging" process, with people 60 years of
age or more making up six percent of the country's population, the
National Population Council (NPC) announced today.
</P>
<P>
That segment of the population, which is called the Third Age
people, will grow to 76 percent in the next 15 years and account
for 22 percent of the country's total population, said NPC.
</P>
<P>
The source attributed the change in the age group to the
increase in life expectancy. The change also presents challenges
to government in order to ensure the Third Age people with a
comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
The main challenges include the improvement of health services,
pensions, entertainment, recreation and retirement funds, said
NPC.
</P>
<P>
The sustained reduction in the mortality rate since the 1930s
has given rise to a significant increase in the average life
expectancy of Mexicans, according to NPC.
</P>
<P>
The World Day of the Elderly was commemorated here Thursday. It
is a celebration initiated by the United Nations in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan-India Talks Likely to Be Delayed: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The third round of foreign
secretary-level talks between Pakistan and India, scheduled to
take place in New Delhi next month, is likely to be postponed
until the end of October, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We are almost certain that India is creating hurdles in so
many ways to put off the talks, the dates of which were not
decided," the News quoted a senior Pakistani official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said that an important reason was that India wants
to see the outcome of visits by the prime ministers of Pakistan
and India to New York.
</P>
<P>
Both prime ministers are supposed to meet U.S. President Bill
Clinton, separately, as they go to New York for the U.N. General
Assembly meetings on September 22, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their foreign secretary-level talks
in March after a hiatus of three years, amid signs of improved
relations between the two arch rivals in South Asia. The talks
broke down in January 1994 due to their differences over the issue
of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local newspapers today reported that the Clinton
administration had conceded Indian demand to restrict the talks
between Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral
mainly to bilateral ties and to keep hands off India-Pakistan
dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Scientists Claim Cancer Control with Scorpion Toxin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's medical scientists have
made initial success in using scorpion toxin to control cancer,
the weekly magazine "Negocios in Cuba" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 persons with several forms of cancer were treated
recently with a compound obtained from the toxin of a scorpion
species living in Baracoa, in the easternmost part of the island.
</P>
<P>
The results have been satisfactory, with the malignant cells of
most patients clearly brought under control and in some cases
destroyed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier tests made on dogs and white mice also showed that the
toxin can eliminate or diminish the size of natural tumors without
noticeable side effects.
</P>
<P>
Researchers stressed that only the toxin from the blue scorpion
living in Baracoa, and not any another species of scorpion, is
found to have the cancer-controlling effect.

<HEADLINE> Ricupero: China to Play Big Role in Shaping 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens
Ricupero said he believes what is happening now in China is the
most significant, historical change in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"The changes in China are the events that will have more impact
in shaping the next century," Ricupero, head of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), told Xinhua in an
exclusive interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the importance of those achievements is the
successful, cautious and gradual way in which the Chinese
leadership and the Chinese people have made during the transition
to a market economy. I believe the success of the Chinese
experiment is one of the brightest hopes for the next century."
</P>
<P>
In contrast to many others' experiences of the so-called "shock
therapy," the UNCTAD chief said, China has chosen a very secure
road, trying step by step, and the results have confirmed the
wisdom of this choice.
</P>
<P>
China registered an annual GDP growth of about 12 percent for
the last five consecutive years. The economy was handled
cautiously, and a "soft-landing" was achieved. Inflation has also
been brought down to 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"What is impressive is that it was achieved at the same time
China opened its economy, its door to foreign trade, foreign
competition, and foreign investment," Ricupero stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero, who visited China last December, said he was
impressed by China's success in eliminating poverty, while making
great achievements in economic development.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the fact that the number of rural poor in China
fell from 94 million to 65 million between 1991 and 1995, Ricupero
said: "This is amazing because it is unique to have a country with
1.2 billion people who are now practically, with all the basic
needs satisfied in terms of the levels of subsistence of food,
clothes, education, health, etc. "
</P>
<P>
he said China's most important achievement is the success in
eliminating poverty because that should be the goal of any country.

<HEADLINE> Ricupero: China to Play Big Role in Shaping 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ricupero underlined that there are two major achievements in
the external aspects of China's economic development. The first is
the big success of China as the largest recipient of foreign
direct investment (FDI) among developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Now China is receiving almost 50 percent of the FDI among
developing countries. In terms of countries in general, for the
last four consecutive years, China has been the second largest,
immediately after the United States, attracting 42 billion U.S.
dollars in 1996. In terms of portfolio equity funds, China is also
the largest recipient among developing countries. The total net
assets of China investment funds alone reached 6.68 billion
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The second, Ricupero said, is the enormous change in the growth
of China's foreign trade. During the 1991-1995 period, China's
annual average trade growth was 19.5 percent, as compared to 7
percent of the world average.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the ranking of China in the world trade went from
15th place in 1992 to 11th in 1996. That was an enormous rise and
the rise was not only in exports, but also in imports. While the
economy of the industrialized countries was in recession or in
slow growth in recent years, China was one of the main sources of
import demand for industrialized economies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said he was optimistic about China's future. "The
world in general, the developing countries in particular, need a
rich and prosperous China. It is not only because China represents
a large share of mankind, but also because of the rich cultural
heritage, and the potential that China may represent in terms of
import demand," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We see the success of the Chinese experiment as a success of
developing countries in general because we are sure that we will
always find in China the right attitude to development. China has
faced the same problems as most of the poor countries and China
remains committed to the course of development," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero does not agree with the Western press's claim that
China's growth in economy is a menace or a threat. He said people
who are afraid of imports from China should be aware that Chinese
growth is two-way: it adds to the world and as Chinese become more
and more able to consume goods, china will become more and more
the largest market in the world.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD secretary-general said the reform of state-owned
enterprises is a major challenge that policy-makers in China are
facing. He does not think that radical initiatives should be
considered a good policy option. A number of Chinese state-owned
enterprises have proved to be able to compete effectively in
domestic and international markets, Ricupero noted.
</P>
<P>
He hoped China would continue efforts to minimize the imbalance
between coastal regions and interior.

YANGON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Myanmar leader has urged
the country's police force to become the most disciplined and
powerful national defense force, the official New Light of Myanmar

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Committee for Reformation of

stressed the need to enhance morale, discipline, moral conducts
and police and military skills of Myanmar Police Force (MPF).
</P>
<P>
He said the MPF should become the second largest, most
disciplined and the reserve force for national defense after the
Tatmadaw (Myanma Defense Services Force).
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by Khin Nyunt, was formed in 1994 to
assess and reform existing rules and regulations of the MPF.

<HEADLINE> Prison Administration Official on Truth about Tibetan Prisons (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A prison administration official
in Tibet refuted US Representative Frank Wolf today, citing Wolf's
report on the prison situation in Tibet as a "fabrication."
</P>
<P>
Wolf sneaked into Tibet using false ID in flagrant violation of
Chinese law and smeared the prison administration in Tibet with
his hearsay, according to Tsering Puncog, director of the Bureau
of Prison Administration of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tibet will open its prisons to those who really
want to know the situation there. In the past six months, the
bureau has made arrangements for officials from four countries to
visit prisons.
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion they've drawn from what they've witnessed is
contrary to what Wolf described in his report, which is based on
rumors," Tsering Puncog said.
</P>
<P>
Tibet now has three prisons, and the number of prisoners is
only 0.075 percent of the autonomous region's population, he said,
adding that prisoners charged with endangering state security
account for nine percent of that number, the rest have committed
criminal offences.
</P>
<P>
"If Wolf had seen the prisons with his own eyes, and if he were
not prejudiced and honest, he would have found that our jails
treat and reform prisoners with a spirit of socialist
humanitarianism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prison authorities treat every convict equally and respect
their rights. On no account will the convicts be discriminated
against or mistreated, no matter what they were charged with.

Prisoners have days off on weekends, national holidays, and
Tibetan festivals. And their ethnic lifestyle and customs are well

them.
</P>
<P>
The cells are warm and tidy, and equipped with good ventilation

Each prisoners has a monthly allocation of 20 kg of food grain,
2.5 kg of meat, and 15 kg of vegetables, plus some tea and
non-staple foodstuff like butter.

"With part of the money from their labor, prisoners here
actually have yearly living expenses averaging 2,500 yuan (some
300 US dollars) per person, 300 yuan more than the state
standards," said Puncog, and a food management committee formed by
prisoners ensures that they get hot, clean food with adequate
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
There is a clinic in each jail providing adequate medical
treatment and regular check-ups. In case of serious illness that
the clinic can not handle, the patient is sent to a nearby local
hospital and the medical bill would is paid by the prison.
</P>
<P>
If the patient needs long-term medical care, he can get
assistance from family members or financial aid from the prison if
he runs into financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Tsering Puncog expressed his indignation at Wolf's accusations
about inmates being beaten up in prison.
</P>
<P>
To protect prisoners' dignity, the prison administration
prohibits the use of abusive language or the beating up of
prisoners. And they are not allowed to use manual labor to punish
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
This is all under the local people's procuratorate, people's
congress, and the people's political consultative conference
supervision, Puncog noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the prisoners have the right to report, accuse, or
even bring a lawsuit against prison guards if they are ill-treated
and their accusations should not be suppressed, he said. And the
local procuratorate has placed a special box in each jail for
prisoners' report or accusation letters, he added.

<HEADLINE> Prison Administration Official on Truth about tibetan Prisons (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since prisoners usually do not have much education, prison
authorities provide education programs to teach them how to read
and write in the Tibetan language. Each prisoner can choose
classes that suit their educational background.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 people have obtained certificates by taking part in
examinations by various schools.
</P>
<P>
Tsering Puncog noted that prisoners can get books and
newspapers, listen to radio, and watch TV. They are encouraged to
take part in sports activities and give performances with ethnic
features.
</P>
<P>
"However, we organize those who can to do some manual
labor. This will help some of them get rid of bad habits and
others to learn a certain skill so that they can find employment
after their prison term is up," Puncog said.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan prisons have left a good impression on many foreign
visitors, he said. He recalled a prison official from Finland
telling him that he was impressed by prisons in Beijing and Tibet
because prisoners there have very spacious rooms for living,
working, and receiving an education.
</P>
<P>
"He also told me that conditions in prisons in Lhasa are even
better than in some European jails," said Puncog. "Seeing is
believing, and any visitors to Tibetan prisons will not believe
Wolf's sheer nonsense."

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Ethylene Project Begins Trial Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The 150,000-ton Guangzhou
Ethylene Project, one of the major projects in South China's
Guangdong Province, today is expected to go into trial production
today.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of raw materials is scheduled to be poured into
the ethylene splitting furnace, China Daily reported. It is
expected to produce the first Guangzhou-made ethylene about a week
later and be made into the final products a month later.
</P>
<P>
"The operation is a significant breakthrough for local
industry," said Miao Xinwen, an official from Guangzhou Ethylene
Co Ltd.
</P>
<P>
With construction having begun in 1993, the 7.9-billion-yuan
(957 million US dollars) project has been co-developed by China
Petro-chemical International Corp and Guangzhou city government.
</P>
<P>
Armed with nine complete sets of production equipment, it is
expected to produce more than 220,000 tons of polyethylene,
polypropylene, polystyrene and other plastic solid products a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will produce 140,000 tons of high-demand liquid
products, such as styrenes, methylbenzene and liquid gas.
</P>
<P>
"Local processing companies are bound to benefit greatly by
taking this billion of yuan's worth of business in petrochemical
processing industrial production," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Annual sales volume is expected to reach 2.4 billion yuan (289
million US dollars) to 2.5 billion yuan (301 million US dollars)
after the plants are put into formal production.
</P>
<P>
The ethylene project, located in Huangpu District, covers one
million square metres.
</P>
<P>
It includes an ethylene plant with an annual capacity of
115,000 tons, a polyethylene plant with an annual capacity of
100,000 tons, a polypropylene plant with an annual capacity of
70,000 tons, a styrene plant with an annual capacity of 80,000
tons and a polystyrene plant with an annual capacity of 50,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
The city government has been responsible for collecting 90
percent of all the investments regardless of their source.
</P>
<P>
More than 330 million US dollars worth of equipment and
technology has been imported from the United States, Japan and
France to guarantee that the project reaches an advanced world
production standard.
</P>
<P>
One of China's leading ethylene projects in the eighth
five-year plan period (1991-1995), the Guangzhou Ethylene Project
is part of raw materials in South China caused by fast economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The other big ethylene project is the 300,000-ton one in
Maoming, southern Guangdong province, which can produce more than
890,000 tons of synthetic rubber, synthetic resin, chemical fibre
and organic chemical materials a year.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Repatriate Albanian Refugees Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy will soon start a staggered
repatriation of 10,000 Albanian refugees who fled to Italy from
civil strife in their own country earlier this year, sources from
the Italian government said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a cabinet meeting today, which was
called to make new plans after a government decision to extend the
August 31 deadline for two months met with strong protests from
the opposition and the public.
</P>
<P>
The meeting set broad guidelines for a plan of imminent
repatriation of refugees; the plan will also receive further
discussion in the parliament later today.
</P>
<P>
The plan states that illegal Albanian immigrants will be sent
back gradually, with the first group leaving as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Some 17,000 Albanians fled to neighboring Italy since spring,
when a financial scandal triggered nationwide anarchy and plunged
the Balkan nation into a political and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
A reported 7,000 have already returned to their own country,
but many say they want to stay on indefinitely. The Italian
government agreed Wednesday to an Albanian government's request to
extend the repatriation deadline, but the opposition strongly
opposed the decision and urged firmer action against the illegal
immigrants.

<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese entrepreneurs are
calling for more effective grassroots programs to help the poor of
the country, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
To reach this end, the entrepreneurs attending a seminar which
concluded yesterday in Beijing published a written proposal.
</P>
<P>
"To help the country's 58 million poverty-stricken population
is an obligation of the whole society, including the private
entrepreneurs," said vice-chairman of Chinese People\s Political
Consultative Conference, at the seminar. Yang is also chairman of
the Foundation for Undeveloped Regions in China.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by nine business people, an organization with the aim
of drawing investment to China's underdeveloped regions was set up
in 1994. It has established branches in all provinces and
implemented a capital investment of three billion yuan (361
million US dollars) to the country's poor areas.

<P>
Xiangjiang Group is one of the companies Putian County in east
China's Fujian Province to sign contracts with Xiji County in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to set up five
potato-processing plants by the end of 1998, according to the
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The plan expects to increase the county's annual per-capita
income by 300 yuan. By the end of the year 2000, Xiji is expected
to become China's biggest potato producing and processing base.

<HEADLINE> Honduras to Create Strategic Coffee Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran government will
create a 40,000-quintal coffee reserve, which may require a 4.5
million U.S. dollar investment, to prevent an announced shortage
of the beans, said the Economy and Commerce Ministry sources today.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the money for the reserve will come from
the National Coffee Funds and the Honduran Coffee Institute.
</P>
<P>
The measure is being taken because most of the coffee harvest
is exported, which has caused a domestic supply deficit.
</P>
<P>
The reserve will also help control coffee smuggling to
neighboring Central American countries, especially El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
Last year, only 7 percent of total production remained at home,
which caused an increase in local prices.
</P>
<P>
Coffee exports for this year have been estimated at 450 million
dollars, which is higher than that of 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Panama has registered 1,469
cases of AIDS with 869 deaths since 1984, said a Health Ministry
official.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,469 cases of AIDS, 1,163 are men and 306 are women, or
average of about four infected men to one woman. About 696 men and
173 women have died, said Gladys Alicia Guerrero, director of the
Health Ministry's epidemiology division.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five percent of the cases were infected as a result of
sexual contact, said the specialist, who added that there is
little available information locally about exercising preventive
measures.
</P>
<P>
Guerrero said the most often and easily-affected age group is
between the ages of 20-44. About 72.5 percent of the cases also
come from among the economically active and productive population.
</P>
<P>
Among the total number of individuals affected by AIDS, 300 are
over 45 years old, while 76 are under 15 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Carelessness in sexual activities also increases the risk of
transmitting the HIV virus that causes AIDS to the fetus in a
pregnant woman, Guerrero said.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Syndicate to Cover Satellite Launches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Nine Chinese property insurers
agreed on Friday to set up a syndicate that will specialize in
underwriting insurance policies for China's satellite launchings.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the China Aerospace Insurance Syndicate
will help strengthen the country's position in the global
commercial satellite launching market, today's China Daily quoted
Zhang Xinxia, president of China Great Wall Industry Corp (CGWIC)
as saying.
</P>
<P>
China has been using domestically-made rockets to launch
overseas satellites for 10 years and had a seven to nine percent
market share in the international launching market from 1990
through 1996. However, after a couple of failures during a two-year
period, the CGWIC lost several contracts, and international
insurers became very cautious about underwriting policies, the
Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The successful sending of a Philippine telecommunications
satellite into orbit earlier this month and domestic launches in
May and June have helped boost confidence and restore China's image
in the international market.
</P>
<P>
China's market share is expected to increase since CGWIC
expects to clinch two to four contracts for geosynchronous
transfer orbit launches each year after 1997.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of the syndicate reflects the financial sector's
strong confidence in the country's aerospace industry, Liu
Changbin, assistant to the president of China Aerospace Corp. said.
</P>
<P>
The syndicate includes the People's Insurance (Property) Company
of China Ltd (PICC Property), Pacific Insurance Co, Ping An
Insurance Co, Tian'an Insurance Co, Dazhong Insurance Co, Huatai
Insurance Co, Yong'an Insurance Co, Hua'an Insurance Co and
Xinjiang Corps Insurance Co.

<HEADLINE> Woodforde Topples Kafelnikov out of U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian doubles specialist
Mark Woodforde toppled third seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia in
straight sets at the second round of the U.S. Open tennis
championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Woodforde, who was ranked 43rd in the singles, upended the 1996
French Open champion 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, who won the tournaments in Halle in June and at New
Haven, Connecticut this month, broke first to take the initial
lead but made a stream of errors to ruin his hope of sailing
further in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Woodforde's changeups and angle shots kept the Russian on the
run, with the latter failing to show any evidence of his class as
one of the best players in the world.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov became the fifth men's seed ousted before the third
round. Earlier this week, fourth-seeded Croatian Goran Ivanisevic
and fifth-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria were toppled in the
first and second rounds respectively.
</P>
<P>
Woodforde's third-round rival will be Andre Agassi, former
world number one, who beat Romanian Adrian Voinea 6-0, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The American, who ranked 63rd in the world, lost the last two
clashes between them, including a match this month when the
Australian trounced him out of the quarter-finals in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Women's second seed Monica Seles of the United States edged
Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands 6-1, 6-1 to advance into the
fourth round easily.
</P>
<P>
Ninth seed Mary Pierce of France beat Natasha Zvereva 7-6
(7-2), 6-1 to go for the next round where she will meet Seles.
</P>
<P>
Frenchwoman Sandrine Testud made her straight win over German
Elena Wagner 6-1, 6-1 after she upset fourth-seeded French Open
champion Iva Majoli in the second round.

<HEADLINE> Eight Stranded Miners Rescued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- After being stranded underground
in the dark mine for 10 days, eight miners were finally rescued at
Rujigou Mine in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to China Daily today, the eight miners were trapped
in the mine when a great flow of mud and rocks blocked its
entrance on August 13 after a 40-minute heavy rain hit the region.
</P>
<P>
Despite big floods, rescue work continued by a team of more
than 500 people round the clock.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities rushed to the scene to direct the rescue work.
</P>
<P>
The eight men survived on water and fresh air available in the
lane to which they had retreated. And they lay on the ground,
avoiding an excessive drain of their strength.
</P>
<P>
To guide the rescuers, the eight kept one miner's lamp burning
at a time.
</P>
<P>
At last, the rescuers spotted the light in the early morning
hours of August 23. The eight miners were fully conscious when
rescued.
</P>
<P>
And all have made satisfactory recoveries so far.

that the government of Saint Lucia "will be establishing full
diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China as of
Monday, 1st September 1997."
</P>

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
make her first trip to the Middle East on September 9 to restore
trust between the Palestinians and Israelis so as to pull the
peace process back on track, the State Department announced on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin, in announcing her
maiden official visit to the Middle East, told reporters that the
secretary will "see what she and the United States can do to help
Israel and the Palestinians address the crisis of confidence" and
"explore with the parties how we can again find ways to move
forward towards a comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
Albright will also consult with the regional leaders concerned
"about a variety of other important issues, including the security
of the Persian Gulf, the issue of Iran, and the issue of Iraq,
Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
PARIS -- The French navy's aircraft carrier "Foch," which will
replace another carrier "Clemenceau" when the latter retires by
the end of this year, will return to military service by the end
of September.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted the Service of Information
and Public Relations of the Army as saying that "Foch," which has
had an overall careenage over the past 18 months in Toulon, is
having its final equipment and material operational verifications.
</P>
<P>
"Foch" will serve until mid-1999, when the new nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier "Charles de Gaulle" enters service.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The United States Friday reaffirmed that there
will be no role of the Stabilization Forces (SFOR) in Bosnia in
the arrest of the indicted war criminals in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"That has been official policy from the beginning, that SFOR
troops -- it's not appropriate for SFOR troops to be involved
under the conditions laid out in the Dayton Accords, because
that's not their mission nor their training," said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff John Shalikashivili said
Thursday that American soldiers would be ill-suited for the role
in the arrest of war suspects in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fear that its some 8000 soldiers will be in danger if
they go to apprehend the indicted war criminals including former
Bosnian Serb leader Rodavan Karadzic. Two U.S. soldiers were
injured on Thursday in violent clashes with Bosnian Serbs in the
Bosnian town of Brcko.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Abide by WTO Magazine Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Canada said today that it will
abide by the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling, which deals a
severe blow to its magazine industry.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the WTO, Canada also stressed that it will use
the 15-month grace period to find new methods to protect its
cultural industries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a WTO expert panel ruled that Canada
violated the free trade principle by implementing special tax
measures to block U.S. publishers to flood its market with the
so-called split-run magazines.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Canada lost an appeal of the ruling. In addition,
the WTO ruled Canada's postal subsidies for its magazines
contravened international trade practices.
</P>
<P>
The two WTO rulings have not only a potentially devastating
short-term effect on Canada's domestic magazines, but also have
serious implications for the whole of its cultural industry.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO decision is a body blow to Canadian culture but it
isn't just about magazines. It's about a broader U.S. policy to
boost its own entertainment industry abroad," said a spokesman of
the Council of Canadians.
</P>
<P>
Canadian government officials vowed that they will use the
15-month time to find a new solution to this old emotional
problem.
</P>
<P>
"This is something we are going to have to work with the
magazine industry to find some sort of alternative solution," said
a spokesman of the International Trade Department.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Heritage Minister Sheila Copps is reported to have met
several times recently with representatives of the magazine
industry.
</P>
<P>
"There are a whole whack of suggestions that have been coming
forward," said Heritage spokeswoman Cate McCready.

<HEADLINE> China Maintains Impressive Housing Development Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China will maintain large-scale
housing development and investment during the period of its Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Housing construction is expected to account for about four
percent of the country's total GNP during the period, according to
Minister of Construction Hou Jie.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Xinhua, Hou said plans through 2010
call for the country to build a total of 1.2 billion sq.m. of
housing, with average annual housing construction of no less than
240 million sq.m.
</P>
<P>
He noted that each urban household will own an apartment with
average per-capita living space of 9 sq.m.. an some 70 percent of
the households will be able to afford well-equipped houses.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China has a population of 1.2 billion subject to
an annual net increase of 14 million raises strong demand for
housing, Hou said added.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese government
have consistently paid close attention to the improvement of
housing conditions, and has introduced a series of reforms in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth in housing development and remarkable improvements
in the Chinese People's housing conditions have been reported over
the past five years. Annual urban housing construction has
surpassed 200 million sq.m., with the figure for rural housing
standing at 600 million sq.m.
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to boost housing development and reform,
China has introduced commercialized housing, publicly funded
housing funds, individual home mortgage loans and a series of
other effective measures.
</P>
<P>
The 1.26 billion sq.m. of urban and rural housing China built
between 1992-1996 solved housing problems for approximately five
million households. Some 25 percent of urban households have been
moved into new housing in the past five years alone.
</P>
<P>
The country's average urban per-capita living space has grown
to 8.47 sq m,, with the figure for rural areas standing at 17.18
sq.m.
</P>
<P>
The "Comfortable Housing Project" has been implemented in more
than 200 cities, with the addition of over 20 million sq.m. of
housing space.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the rapid development of housing cooperatives has
effectively expanded fund-raising channels and has benefited the
low to medium income households.
</P>
<P>
Construction departments at various levels have extended great
effort to improve infrastructure facilities, including water
supply, drainage, heating, roads, bridges, highway, tree-planting
and environmental protection systems. Related efforts have greatly
helped to improve the people's living standards.

<HEADLINE> Waigel: Germany to Hit Euro Budget Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
predicted today that Germany would be able to cut its budget
deficit to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year,
just enough to qualify for the planned single European currency,
the Euro.
</P>
<P>
For 1998, Germany's budget deficit could be reduced further to
2.5 percent of GDP, Waigel added.
</P>
<P>
He also asserted that Germany would strictly apply the
membership standards for the Euro when the selection is made early
next year on which European Union (EU) states will be able to join
the club.
</P>
<P>
The EU is due to launch the Euro on January 1, 1999. Among the
qualification criteria, member states are required to bring their
budget deficit and overall national debt to less than three
percent and 60 percent respectively of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Decisions on which countries will be allowed to join the Euro
will be made early 1998, based on full economic data of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Canada, US Reach Sugar Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States have
reached an agreement in principle that guarantees Canadian access
to U.S. markets for sugar and sugar-containing products.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government announced today that the U.S. has
agreed to provide Canada with guaranteed access for a minimum of
10,300 tons of refined sugar and 59,250 tons for
sugar-containing products.
</P>
<P>
Canada can also compete for the remaining portion of the global
Tariff Rate Quota, volumes on which there are low or no tariffs.
</P>
<P>
In return, Canada will not challenge the U.S. Re-Export Program
for Sugar-Containing Products while the agreement is in effect.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, U.S. companies can import sugar at lower
world prices as long as the same amount of sugar is re-exported in
manufactured products.
</P>
<P>
Canadian companies say that the program has make their U.S.
rivals to take a larger share of the Canadian market than if they
had used higher U.S. sugar prices.
</P>
<P>
Since April 21, 1997, Canada has been in a position to request
a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) dispute settlement
panel to challenge the U.S. program.
</P>
<P>
In mid-August, the U.S. made an offer that formed the basis for
the agreement reached today, according to the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement ensures a stable, predictable trade environment
in an important export sector that employs more than 6,000
Canadians," said Canada's International Trade Minister Sergio
Marchi.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also removes a stumbling block in the
Canadian-U.S. overall trade relations, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
According to today's tentative deal, either party may terminate
the agreement on six months' notice.
</P>
<P>
If the agreement is terminated, Canada would again be in a
position to request a NAFTA dispute settlement panel ruling on the
U.S. program.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: no Role of GIs in Arrest of Bosnia War Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
reaffirmed that there will be no role of the Stabilization Forces
(SFOR) in Bosnia in the arrest of the indicted war criminals in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"That has been official policy from the beginning, that SFOR
troops -- it's not appropriate for SFOR troops to be involved
under the conditions laid out in the Dayton Accords, because
that's not their mission nor their training," said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart made the statement on the island of Martha's Vineyard
in Massachussetts, where President Bill Clinton is vacationing.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have talked about doing things to strengthen
the War Crimes Tribunal process, but I'm not going to get into
how, where or when those things might happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff John Shalikashivili said
Thursday that American soldiers would be ill-suited for the role
in the arrest of war suspects in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I have always argued that we should not ask our troops in
Bosnia to get involved in this," Shalikashivili said. "They are
not trained for that properly. That is not their task."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fear that its some 8000 soldiers will be in danger if
they go to apprehend the indicted war criminals including former
Bosnian Serb leader Rodavan Karadzic. Two U.S. soldiers were
injured on Thursday in violent clashes with Bosnian Serbs in the
Bosnian town of Brcko.

<HEADLINE> IFC To Finance $450 Mln Nickel Project in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) today announced the signing of agreements under
which IFC will furnish a project finance package of 115 million
U.S. dollars for the Minera Loma de Niquel(MLdN) project of
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
MLdN will mine and smelt lateritic nickel ore to produce an
annual average 16,000 metric tons of nickel, principally for
export, over the estimated 27-year life of the deposit.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the mine, smelter and associated
infrastructure, with a total cost of estimated 450 million
dollars, are expected to be completed by early 2000.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of financing, MLdN will owned indirectly 81.5
percent by Minorco S.A. of Luxembourg. Venezuela's Corporation
Caracas and Canada's Jordex Resources each hold 7.5 percent. IFC
will invest 74.5 million dollars of its own funds which include 65
million dollars in loan and acquirement of 3.5 percent of MLdN's
equity. A further 50 million dollars will be funded by banks
participating in an IFC-syndicated loan.
</P>
<P>
MLdN is the third mining investment IFC has made in partnership
with Minorco. Minorco and IFC are also shareholders in Codemin, a
Brazilian ferro-neckel producer, and in Quellaveco, a Peruvian
feasibility-stage copper project.
</P>
<P>
IFC is a member of the World Bank Group and the largest
multilateral source of equity and loan financing for private
sector projects in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Backs Guatemalan Government Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
announced the approval of a 28.2 million U.S. dollar loan to
Guatemala to help finance the Tax Administration Technical
Assistance Project of Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to improve the revenue performance by
strengthening the tax administration system.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala's tax revenue ratio is among the lowest in Latin
America. Revenues have averaged between 6 and 9 percent of the GDP
over the last decade and registered 8.5 percent in 1996. These low
levels severely constrain public investment and social sector
spending with a significant impact on poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the recently signed Peace Accords the
government has undertaken to raise tax revenue to 10 percent of
GDP in 1998 and 11.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The total project costs are estimated at 40.3 million dollars.
In addition to the World Bank's funding, the balance will be
financed by the 9.2 million dollar government contribution as well
as the 1.5 million dollars USAID grant and 1.4 million dollar loan
from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).

NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street finished
mixed today after bouncing around again, with the Dow Jones
industrial average ending with a plunge of 72.01 to 7,622.42.
</P>
<P>
The Dow has extended the week's decline to 265.49 points, or
3.4 percent. Though it is now about 635 points away from its
record finish on August 6, it is still up more than 18 percent on
the year.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 406.98 million
shares as against 496.31 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 4.19 to 899.48,
finishing below 900 for the first time since July 1. The NYSE
composite index fell 1.88 to 470.48, and the American Stock
Exchange composite index fell 0.53 to 650.16.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.92 to 1,587.24, and the
Russell 2000 rose 1.84 to 423.43.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were pressured at the open by the bond market, where
interest rates rose after the Commerce Department reported that
consumer spending shot up 0.8 percent in July, the biggest jump in
six months.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Commerce Department said new home sales rose 0.9
percent in July, the third straight monthly advance. Many analysts
had expected little change from the June rate.
</P>
<P>
The robust readings were the latest in a series of reports
raising the doubts that the economy has been growing at a
non-inflationary pace.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Visit Mideast Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will make her first trip to the Middle East on
September 9 to restore trust between the Palestinians and Israelis
so as to pull the peace process back on track, the State
Department announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin, in announcing her
maiden official visit to the Middle East, told reporters that the
secretary will "see what she and the United States can do to help
Israel and the Palestinians address the crisis of confidence" and
"explore with the parties how we can again find ways to move
forward towards a comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
Albright will also consult with the regional leaders concerned
"about a variety of other important issues, including the security
of the Persian Gulf, the issue of Iran, and the issue of Iraq,
Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
"Towards these objectives, the secretary will visit Israel, the
Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the decision to pay her visit to the violent
conflict-ridden Middle East after a twin suicide bomb killed 16
people at a Jerusalem produce market on July 30, which made the
deteriorating situation in the region even worse.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright conditioned her trip to the region when some
progress there is made on security issue so that the way could be
paved for addressing "the crisis of confidence."
</P>
<P>
Now, "some progress has been made and there is a trend in the
right direction," Rubin explained why Albright has now decided to
go to the region.
</P>
<P>
Rubin played down expectations that the trip would achieved
instant results, saying the secretary of state "is not a magician.
She is a realist."
</P>
<P>
"The problems between the two parties (the Palestinians and
Israelis) are complex, they are deeply entrenched and they will
not be solved by one trip," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Albright spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinians leader Yasser Arafat on Friday in preparation for the
trip.
</P>
<P>
When the secretary meets with Netanyahu and Arafat, she will
try to address a "crisis of confidence" that has kept Israel and
the Palestinians from resuming their negotiations, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
She will also promised direct U.S. participation in their
negotiations once resumed on the bases of trust between them.
</P>
<P>
She will also try to jump-start to the final settlement
negotiations, which include Palestinian demands for a state with
its capital in Jerusalem and the future of Jewish settlements on
land that the Arabs claim is theirs.
</P>
<P>
In Syria, Albright will try to revive the sporadic negotiations
with Israel which came to a standstill early last year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries negotiated for more than four years over an
Israeli withdrawal on the Golan Heights, saized from Syria in
1967, but reached no agreement.

who has spent most of his vacation on Martha's Vineyard in
Massachusetts, took time out to call Massachusetts Representative
Joseph Kennedy II about the congressman's decision not to run for
governor next year.
</P>
<P>

WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Friday made his nomination of former House Speaker Thomas Foley to
be ambassador to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Foley, if confirmed by the Senate, would replace former Vice
President Walter Mondale in Japan. Mondale left Tokyo last
December, leaving the critical diplomatic post vacant.
</P>
<P>
Foley, a Democrat first elected to the House in 1964, is a
longtime advocate of trade with the Pacific rim. His home state of
Washington is a leading exporter to the region.
</P>
<P>
Foley was defeated in the 1994 Congress elections and his post
of the House speaker was taken over by Republican Newt Gingrich.
Since then, he has been associated with Aiken, Gump, Strauss,
Houer and Feld, a Washington, D.C. law firm.

<P>
Clinton also nominated former State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns as ambassador to Greece.
