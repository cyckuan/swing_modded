INS Official Charged With Spying for Cuba
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A high-ranking U.S. immigration official was arrested Thursday
and charged with spying for the Cuban government, the FBI said. Mariano Faget,
54, was being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami and scheduled to
appear in court Friday, the FBI said in a statement. Faget, a native of Havana,
is employed at the Immigration and Naturalization Service as a supervisory
district adjudication officer. He held a "secret" security clearance and was
responsible for supervising decisions that affected immigrants and people
seeking political asylum, the FBI said.

China, U.S. Meet on Security

<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- China and the United States have made progress in resumed
discussions on strategic security concerns, including Taiwan, a senior U.S.
envoy said Friday as he prepared to wrap up the two-day talks. U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was meeting again Friday morning with Chinese
Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. Earlier this week, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao said China planned to raise its concerns about U.S. weapons sales to
Taiwan. Beijing is worried that U.S. support for Taiwan will counter China's
growing arsenal of missiles, making it easier for the island to resist Chinese
overtures for reunification.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain fares better than Gov. George W. Bush
against Democrat Al Gore, says a national poll out Thursday that challenges the
Bush campaign's claim that their man is the Republican most likely to win the
presidential election. McCain led Gore by 49 percent to 41 percent in the
hypothetical matchup in the poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the
Press. Bush and Gore were in a dead heat.

Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat expressed confidence that a deal will be
reached on how to broadly allocate the funds during talks in Washington March
7-8. Both men emphasized an atmosphere of flexibility in the talks.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In one of the largest single Colombian cocaine
seizures, an American naval ship intercepted a fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean
laden with six tons of cocaine, officials said Thursday. Colombian Navy chief
Adm. Sergio Garcia said the Colombian-flagged vessel named "Rebel" was seized in
international waters yesterday, 1,530 miles northwest of the country's port of
Buenaventura. The 66-foot vessel and its seven-member Colombian crew left the
port on Jan. 22 with cocaine stashed in the boat's fuel compartment, Garcia
said.

Flaw Found in Mars Lander's Design

<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A flaw in the design of NASA's Mars Polar Lander
could have caused its engines to cut off prematurely while the $165 million
spacecraft was descending to the surface, engineers said Thursday. The glitch is
the latest of several possibilities under investigation into why the spacecraft
has not made contact since Dec. 3, when it was to have gently landed to begin a
90-day mission to study Mars' climate history. Other scenarios include the
possibility that the spacecraft landed on the steep side of a canyon and toppled
over, or that its radios broke down. It was not known if any have been ruled
out.

<HEADLINE> Koch: Bradley has lost intensity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Former New York Knicks star Bill Bradley has lost
the intensity he needs to succeed in his bid for Democratic presidential
nomination, according to one of his most prominent New York supporters.
<P>
	   "That doesn't mean Bradley can't recoup. He certainly can do that in New
York," former New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch said Thursday. "If he doesn't
win New York, he's finished, so I hope he wins New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Bradley falling behind Al Gore in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch, in a telephone interview about the state's March 7 primary, had high
praise for Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. McCain is battling Texas Gov.
George W. Bush for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   "McCain has done a terrific job," Koch said. "He's doing what we hoped Bill
Bradley would do, turning his campaign into a crusade of integrity."
</P>
<P>
	   Koch said that while the former senator from New Jersey seemed to have his
presidential campaign in high gear several months ago, "regrettably, Bradley has
not continued with that intensity and McCain has."
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're an insurgent, what you have to do is to show that there is this
insatiable obsession on your part to get your message out, no matter what the
physical cost to you," the former mayor said. "McCain has conveyed that. Bradley
hasn't."
</P>
<P>
	   Julia Rothwax, a spokeswoman for Bradley's New York campaign, said "Bill
Bradley has been campaigning hard in New York. He was in Buffalo and Rochester
earlier in the week ... He has been in New York City several times.
</P>
<P>
	   "He will be campaigning very hard here in the next few weeks with energy and
commitment to victory on March 7," she added.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch said it wasn't too late for Bradley to regain momentum in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bradley can take New York," Koch said. "I hope he gives me an opportunity
to be with him to help it come true."
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Koch said he felt Gore and Bush would wind up with the
nominations. "They're going to both be bloodied before they get there," he
added.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, Koch was the chief supporter in New York of Gore's unsuccessful
presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Court says teen-age model can't sue over use of her picture  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A teen model's picture appears in a magazine advice
column near a letter from a girl who "got trashed and had sex with three guys."
<P>
	   But the model says she didn't write the letter, even though she said it
appears she did. In New York, she can't sue because the magazine's advice to
girls who did get drunk and have sex with three guys was newsworthy, the state's
highest court says.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Court of Appeals ruled 6-1 that Jamie Messenger can't collect
damages from Young and Modern magazine because her picture was used to
illustrate an article on a matter of public interest, even though she had
nothing to do with the events in the article.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have time and time again held that, where a plaintiff's picture is used
to illustrate an article on a matter of public interest, there can be no
liability," the court's majority said. "That has been so even where a
plaintiff's photograph, when juxtaposed with an article, could reasonably have
been viewed as falsifying or fictionalizing plaintiff's relation to the
article."
</P>
<P>
	   The court said there are only two exceptions to the law: when the picture
has no real relationship to the article or the article is an advertisement in
disguise. Judge Joseph Bellacosa, the lone dissenter, said there should be a
third: when there is "material and substantial falsification."
</P>
<P>
	   "Even though the column enjoys the academic quality of a newsworthy subject
matter, its presentation publicly paraded plaintiff as the epitomized subject
for sensationalized impact," Bellacosa said. "That should not be immune from the
statute's reach."
</P>
<P>
	   The suit now goes back to federal court, where it likely will be dismissed,
said lawyer Robert Sugarman, who represented the magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we're very pleased," he said. "It basically reaffirms the law as
we've interpreted it that's been in existence for 30 years in connection with
the use of photographs to illustrate articles and columns."
</P>
<P>
	   A call to Ms. Messenger's lawyers was not returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Messenger posed in 1994 or 1995 for the magazine when she was 14 years
old. The magazine later used the photos to illustrate a letter from an
unidentified girl who was seeking advice after drinking and having sex with
three men.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter was printed with the headline "I got trashed and had sex with
three guys," and was signed "Mortified." Ms. Messenger said she never consented
to having her photos used with the advice column.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, her parents never consented to the photo shoot and Ms.
Messenger's mother sued the publisher in federal court in 1998 under sections of
New York's Civil Rights Law, which prohibits the use of commercial use of a
person's name or likeness without written consent. An exception to the law
allows the media to use photos without consent as long as they illustrate
matters of public interest or "newsworthiness."
</P>
<P>
	   The jury in that case found in Ms. Messenger's favor and awarded her
$100,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the magazine's publisher, Gruner &AMP; Jahr Printing and Publishing,
appealed the verdict in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Judges
there asked New York's highest court to decide whether that law applies to the
fictionalized use of a photo to portray a newsworthy issue.
</P>
<P>
	   In court, Ms. Messenger's lawyers conceded that the "Love Crisis" column
where the picture appeared was newsworthy and the pictures had a real
relationship with the article. They also made no allegation that the article was
really an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given these facts, (previous case law) dictate that plaintiff may not
recover under the Civil Rights Law, regardless of any false implication that
might be reasonably drawn from the use of her photographs to illustrate the
articles," the court said in an unsigned majority decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellacosa disagreed, saying there were other laws that were more applicable.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a purveyor is going to present the photograph of an individual, even in
conjunction with a newsworthy item, the presentation must be legitimately made
without false or misleading material," he said. "That is still good law and
supports the affirmative answer I would give."

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton and Gore to campaign together  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - For the first time this year, Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Al Gore will campaign Sunday in New York in the same place and at the same
time.
<P>
	   Aides said Thursday that the two will attend a church service Sunday morning
in Albany that is a highlight of the annual weekend gathering of the state
Legislature's black and Hispanic legislative caucus. Clinton and Gore are
expected to speak at the service.
</P>
<P>
	   While Gore is planning to leave after the service to prepare for Monday's
debate in New York City against former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Clinton
expects to stay in Albany through the day and attend the caucus' banquet Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucus weekend annually brings together hundreds of the state's top
black and Hispanic leaders and New York's minority community is an increasingly
powerful voting bloc. Blacks and Hispanics made up 15 percent of voters in the
state's 1998 election for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power comes in the state's March 7
presidential primary, considered a major showdown for Gore and the former New
York Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their
bids for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that presidential candidate Gore and Senate candidate Clinton
haven't yet campaigned together in New York has raised some eyebrows. It
prompted a front-page article in Thursday's editions of The New York Times that
carried the headline: "Gore and Mrs. Clinton Keeping A Wary Distance as
Candidates."
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Gore was asked if he and the first lady would be crossing paths
in Albany. "Don't know," he responded. Asked if he would like to, he said:
"Sure."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said there was no intentional
distancing of the two candidates and Gore's New York team appeared ready
Thursday to embrace the first lady, at least until after March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the next 19 days, she helps us tremendously," one Gore adviser said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. "Her numbers are just off the charts with
Democratic primary voters."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked recently why they hadn't been campaigning together, Gore told one
television interviewer that, "It's a matter of scheduling. Not just me, but also
her."
</P>
<P>
	   Both have made it clear that they feel they must step out of the shadow of
President Clinton. As part of that effort, Hillary Rodham Clinton has become
simply "Hillary" in campaign posters and news releases.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates have had nice things to say about each other.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm all for her. I think she's going to win," Gore said recently. "I think
she will be a great senator. I look forward to campaigning with her."
</P>
<P>
	   "I will do whatever I can in whatever way is open to me in supporting his
candidacy because I truly believe he would be the best person we could have to
lead our country into this new century," she said last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Key members of their New York campaign staffs have close relationships from
past campaigns and their offices are located in the same Manhattan office
building, three floors apart.

<HEADLINE> Spitzer sues over terms of GE dishwasher recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Judy Cookinham is one of those meticulous types who
keeps appliances working seemingly forever. The 60-year-old Ilion woman uses a
microwave from 20 years ago.
<P>
	   So when she learned General Electric Co. was recalling her 10-year-old
dishwasher due to a fire hazard, she fully expected her money back, a new
machine, or at least the opportunity to repair it - after all, it still looked
new.
</P>
<P>
	   But GE didn't offer any of those options - to her or 3 million other
customers that bought the defective products. Now New York's attorney general is
suing the company - saying it offered a sweeter deal to businesses that owned
the dishwashers than it did to individual customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company knew how its dishwashers could be fixed - and actually provided
inexpensive repair kits to commercial customers," Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   GE encouraged individual consumers, however, to "spend hundreds of dollars
on new machines when clearly they did not need to do so," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the recall, GE and the CPSC said they were aware of 50
incidents in which the slide switch, which selects the heat drying and energy
save functions, melted and ignited fires. Seven of the fires spread beyond the
dishwashers and three damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general said he would file a lawsuit in state Supreme Court
against GE later this month seeking restitution and damages for customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only winner in this case is GE, not me," Cookinham said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company dismissed Spitzer's claim, announced on the "Today" television
show as "grandstanding." GE noted that its October 1999 recall arrangement was
approved by the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are working very hard to communicate effectively about this recall with
our consumers and to satisfy all of them during our implementation," GE
spokesman Terry Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defective dishwashers were sold in the 1980s under the General Electric
and Hotpoint labels. The defect in the machines was in a slide switch.
</P>
<P>
	   GE told individuals the switch could not be fixed and offered them rebates
of $75-$125 for new GE or Hotpoint dishwashers. New GE dishwashers at a Sears
store on Thursday cost $399 to $499. Hotpoints sold at $229 and $279.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's office said labor would have cost about $75 for the ten-minute
procedure to correct the defect.
</P>
<P>
	   Commercial customers like hotels and landlords were provided with rewiring
kits, a video explaining how to fix the problem, and a $15 labor allowance.
</P>
<P>
	   GE did not deny treating individuals and businesses differently, and
suggested that was part of its agreement with the CPSC.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar charges are in a class-action suit that St. Petersburg, Fla.,
attorney John Yanchunis said he was filing Thursday in federal court. The
damages he is seeking - compensation for a defective product and for repairs -
would also apply to every customer in the country who bought the dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
	   Yanchunis filed another suit shortly after the recall on behalf of residents
of a condominium who had the dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that in his state, GE's practices were especially problematic for
the elderly on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's lawsuit will seek restitution and damages for customers whether or
not they took advantage of the rebate.
</P>
<P>
	   The defective models include those made under General Electric and Hotpoint
names with the model numbers GSD500D, GSD500G, GSD540, HDA467, HDA477, and
HDA487. The recalled models also carry the serial number that has a second
letter of A, M, R, S, T, V or Z.

<HEADLINE> Former town official pleads innocent to murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - Less than two months after firing a gun at his
head, a former town official appeared in court to plead innocent in the murder
of a fellow worker.
<P>
	   The plea Thursday from Fred Andros, 60, was followed by a release of court
documents in which he admitted to being romantically involved with the victim,
48-year-old Susan Fassett.
</P>
<P>
	   The developments were the latest in a sometimes lurid series of revelations
involving Town of Poughkeepsie officials. Andros had already pleaded guilty in a
long-running federal corruption probe into town government when he was charged
last month in the slaying of Fassett, the town personnel director.
</P>
<P>
	   Andros fired a gun at his chin Dec. 29, as police appeared at his door.
</P>
<P>
	   As Andros stood before a judge Thursday, the lower part of his face remained
discolored and shrunken looking. He appeared gaunt in a loose-fitting blue suit
and softly said "thank you" to the judge as he left.
</P>
<P>
	   Andros is one of two people charged with second-degree murder in connection
with the Oct. 28 killing of Fassett. The married mother of two was shot to death
in a church parking lot as she left choir practice.
</P>
<P>
	   His alleged co-conspirator, Dawn Silvernail of Earlton in Greene County,
told police she was coerced by Andros to be the triggerwoman, according to court
documents summarizing her statements to police. The confession Silvernail gave
police also included allegations that she and Fassett had lesbian encounters
facilitated by Andros.
</P>
<P>
	   Silvernail's lawyer has said he would challenge the validity of her
statement. She has pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   A summation of Andros' own statements to authorities give yet another
version of events surrounding Fassett's slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   "I did not kill that woman," Andros told authorities, instead laying blame
on Silvernail.
</P>
<P>
	   In Andros' account, Silvernail believed that Fassett was "singing to the
FBI" - an apparent reference to the federal probe that has implicated Andros,
local Republican boss William Paroli Sr. and others in an alleged extortion
scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly-released documents reveal that law enforcement officials had
interviewed Andros within hours of Fassett's death, and many times through the
end of 1999. Andros sometimes changed his answers at different interviews. For
instance, after telling authorities he had intercourse once with Fassett a year
earlier, he later admitted to a number of encounters with her up to the week she
died, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   Andros told of a lesbian relationship between Fassett and Silvernail. But he
denied having a sexual relationship with Silvernail, contradicting her
confession.
</P>
<P>
	   Through his many interviews with police, FBI agents and federal prosecutors,
Andros consistently maintained Fassett was a "wonderful" woman whom he felt
deeply for.
</P>
<P>
	   Even after he shot himself, when he could only indicate "yes" by nodding or
squeezing a state police investigator's hand, he still expressed feelings for
her.
</P>
<P>
	   In that same hospital interview, police asked him: "Are you sorry about what
you did to Susan?" According to court papers, Andros placed an investigator's
hand on his chest and "squeezed it very tightly with both hands"
</P>
<P>
	   Andros still suffers headaches and memory loss and is "somewhat depressed,"
his lawyer Noel Tepper said outside of court.
</P>
<P>
	   Andros was remanded to jail without bail.
</P>
<P>
	   In a related development Thursday, the special commissioner appointed by
Gov. George Pataki to oust Paroli from his job as county elections commissioner
said he found several instances of misconduct that could warrant Paroli's
removal.
</P>
<P>
	   Austin Campriello, a New York City lawyer, said those instances included a
conspiracy with Andros to accept bribes from contractors; the use of a Town of
Poughkeepsie employee to perform manual labor at Paroli's home using materials
paid for by the town; the billing of the town for electrical work at Paroli's
house and for four tires for his car and for Paroli's alleged failure to file
financial disclosure statements from 1992-98.
</P>
<P>
	   Campriello scheduled a hearing for March 3 in Poughkeepsie on the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli has maintained his innocence.

<HEADLINE> Jury decides Cayuga's lost homeland worth $37 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - It was less than they argued for. It was less than
they expected. Yet, if it remains unchanged, the $36.9 million award recommended
by a federal court jury is enough for the Cayuga Indian Nation to get what they
wanted in the first place.
<P>
	   "We have always said this was not about money," Clint Halftown of Gowanda, a
spokesman for the Cayugas, said Thursday after jurors announced their judgment
in the groundbreaking damages trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "So we have a little less money to buy back our land, to begin rebuilding
our nation. It is enough to start," Halftown said. "What's most important to us
is that there are no restrictions on buying land."
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the Cayugas' attorneys said they would file motions seeking to
have the decision set aside, calling it a "ridiculous" amount.
</P>
<P>
	   "Apparently nine people didn't pay attention to the evidence," said Martin
Gold, one of the Cayugas' lawyers, referring to the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have no idea what they were thinking," added Raymond Heslin, another
attorney for the Cayugas. "Not only did they go against all the credible
evidence. They went against the state's evidence."
</P>
<P>
	   An expert real estate appraiser testified for the state that the Cayugas
should receive no more than $51 million for the 100-square mile patch in Cayuga
and Seneca counties. Appraiser John Dorchester said the land had a rental value
of approximately $10 million and a current market value ranging from $25 million
to $40 million.
</P>
<P>
	   An expert appraiser for the federal government told the jury the Cayugas
deserved $335 million for the land, including $70 million in back rent.
</P>
<P>
	   The award by the nine-member U.S. District Court jury consisted of a rental
value of $1.9 million for the use and occupancy of the 64,015 acres over 204
years and $35 million for current market value.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision is a recommendation to Judge Neal McCurn, who will determine
how much the Cayugas receive. McCurn plans a second non-jury trial to consider
"equitable factors," such as interest on the back rent and deductions for public
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   Heslin and Gold were perturbed that the jury used the same fair-market value
- $17,156.86 - for each year from 1796 through 1999 as the basis for calculating
a gross total. They then subtracted past payments and compensation already paid
by the state to reach the $1.9 million figure.
</P>
<P>
	   "Imagine, $17,156 rent for a 100-square-mile tract. That wouldn't buy you a
Buick," said Hank Meshorer, an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department, who
sided with the Cayugas during the 11-day trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant State Attorney General David Roberts applauded the jury for its
"excellent focus on a complex and difficult case."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an outcome that was better than the alternatives. But it's just one
step," Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury of five women and four men deliberated about 10 hours over two days
after reviewing 11 days of conflicting experts' testimony and boxes of
transcripts, documents and maps.
</P>
<P>
	   To that mountain of paper, McCurn on Wednesday added a 10-page template for
the jury to compute damages. From that, the jury calculated what they believed
to be a fair market rental rate for each of those years.
</P>
<P>
	   Halftown admitted he was surprised by the jury's decision. He questioned
whether they were protecting their personal interests.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas case is the first land claim case in New York to reach the
damages phase. There are three other land claims pending against New York and
the Onondaga Nation expects to file a fourth land claim sometime this year.
Together, the land claims cover a large portion of upstate New York, the
historical home of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
	   "They came back with a figure that was even lower than what the state asked
for. I have no idea how or why they reached this decision," said Halftown.
"Maybe it was personal fear."
</P>
<P>
	   Halftown said the tribe had expected at least $100 million for its lost
lands.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on a 1985 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, McCurn previously ruled that New
York illegally acquired the land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the
Cayugas without the federal government's required approval.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas once spread out over 3 million acres of upstate New York.
Currently, about 500 Cayugas live in western New York on and around the Seneca's
Cattaraugus reservation. Two other larger groups of Cayugas, who also are party
to the claim, live in Canada and Oklahoma.

<HEADLINE> Psych Patient testifies she wanted to hurt, not kill, caseworker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A psychiatric outpatient said she wanted to scare
her caseworker, not kill her, when she planned and followed through with a
hammer attack during a home visit.
<P>
	   Taking the stand during her murder trial in Erie County Court Thursday,
Diane Wylie, 46, described in detail how she bludgeoned Judith Scanlon from
behind and then struggled with the nurse before striking more blows.
</P>
<P>
	   "I couldn't get through to her," said Wylie, who said she believed Scanlon
would cause her to lose custody of her 4-year-old daughter. "I thought if I hurt
her maybe she would feel fear. I wanted her to be carried out of my house on a
stretcher."
</P>
<P>
	   Scanlon's death Nov. 24, 1998, ignited demands by her union for better
safety measures for workers who care for the mentally ill, including a
moratorium on unaccompanied home visits. The New York State Public Employees
Federation also has said intensive case managers, like Scanlon, should not be
required to drive clients to meetings and appointments.
</P>
<P>
	   Wylie told Judge Sheila DiTullio that "black spirits" told her to take
action if Scanlon took her daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   "The plan was coming from evil spirits," she said. "They were saying you
have to do something."
</P>
<P>
	   Wylie said she planned to hit Scanlon from behind with a hammer and then say
a black man had climbed in through the window and attacked her.
</P>
<P>
	   "I followed her to the door and when she got in the hall ... I hit Judy in
the back with the hammer," said Wylie, whose attorneys are pursuing an insanity
defense. But the nurse did not fall down, and instead turned and approached
Wylie. The two struggled for the hammer before Scanlon eventually fell to the
floor, where she was struck numerous times.
</P>
<P>
	   A medical examiner testified Tuesday that any one of 13 hammer blows Scanlon
took to the face could have killed her.
</P>
<P>
	   "She was very aggressive. It was like a street fight," Wylie said. She said
she struck Scanlon and tried to stab her while she was unconscious to keep her
from getting up.
</P>
<P>
	   "On TV, people get shot twice and they can still keep coming," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wylie, who waived her right to a jury trial, was acquitted in four bank
robberies on insanity grounds in 1982 and was hospitalized for two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Should DiTullio find her criminally insane and not legally responsible for
Scanlon's death, Wylie likely would face long-term treatment in a state
psychiatric facility.
</P>
<P>
	   If found guilty of murder, she faces a mandatory prison term of at least 15
to 25 years to life.

<HEADLINE> Koch: Bradley has lost intensity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Former New York Knicks star Bill Bradley has lost
the intensity he needs to succeed in his bid for Democratic presidential
nomination, according to one of his most prominent New York supporters.
<P>
	   "That doesn't mean Bradley can't recoup. He certainly can do that in New
York," former New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch said Thursday. "If he doesn't
win New York, he's finished, so I hope he wins New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Bradley falling behind Al Gore in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch, in a telephone interview about the state's March 7 primary, had high
praise for Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. McCain is battling Texas Gov.
George W. Bush for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   "McCain has done a terrific job," Koch said. "He's doing what we hoped Bill
Bradley would do, turning his campaign into a crusade of integrity."
</P>
<P>
	   Koch said that while the former senator from New Jersey seemed to have his
presidential campaign in high gear several months ago, "regrettably, Bradley has
not continued with that intensity and McCain has."
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're an insurgent, what you have to do is to show that there is this
insatiable obsession on your part to get your message out, no matter what the
physical cost to you," the former mayor said. "McCain has conveyed that. Bradley
hasn't."
</P>
<P>
	   Julia Rothwax, a spokeswoman for Bradley's New York campaign, said "Bill
Bradley has been campaigning hard in New York. He was in Buffalo and Rochester
earlier in the week ... He has been in New York City several times.
</P>
<P>
	   "He will be campaigning very hard here in the next few weeks with energy and
commitment to victory on March 7," she added.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch said it wasn't too late for Bradley to regain momentum in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bradley can take New York," Koch said. "I hope he gives me an opportunity
to be with him to help it come true."
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Koch said he felt Gore and Bush would wind up with the
nominations. "They're going to both be bloodied before they get there," he
added.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, Koch was the chief supporter in New York of Gore's unsuccessful
presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Court says teen-age model can't sue over use of her picture  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A teen model's picture appears in a magazine advice
column near a letter from a girl who "got trashed and had sex with three guys."
<P>
	   But the model says she didn't write the letter, even though she said it
appears she did. In New York, she can't sue because the magazine's advice to
girls who did get drunk and have sex with three guys was newsworthy, the state's
highest court says.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Court of Appeals ruled 6-1 that Jamie Messenger can't collect
damages from Young and Modern magazine because her picture was used to
illustrate an article on a matter of public interest, even though she had
nothing to do with the events in the article.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have time and time again held that, where a plaintiff's picture is used
to illustrate an article on a matter of public interest, there can be no
liability," the court's majority said. "That has been so even where a
plaintiff's photograph, when juxtaposed with an article, could reasonably have
been viewed as falsifying or fictionalizing plaintiff's relation to the
article."
</P>
<P>
	   The court said there are only two exceptions to the law: when the picture
has no real relationship to the article or the article is an advertisement in
disguise. Judge Joseph Bellacosa, the lone dissenter, said there should be a
third: when there is "material and substantial falsification."
</P>
<P>
	   "Even though the column enjoys the academic quality of a newsworthy subject
matter, its presentation publicly paraded plaintiff as the epitomized subject
for sensationalized impact," Bellacosa said. "That should not be immune from the
statute's reach."
</P>
<P>
	   The suit now goes back to federal court, where it likely will be dismissed,
said lawyer Robert Sugarman, who represented the magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we're very pleased," he said. "It basically reaffirms the law as
we've interpreted it that's been in existence for 30 years in connection with
the use of photographs to illustrate articles and columns."
</P>
<P>
	   A call to Ms. Messenger's lawyers was not returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Messenger posed in 1994 or 1995 for the magazine when she was 14 years
old. The magazine later used the photos to illustrate a letter from an
unidentified girl who was seeking advice after drinking and having sex with
three men.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter was printed with the headline "I got trashed and had sex with
three guys," and was signed "Mortified." Ms. Messenger said she never consented
to having her photos used with the advice column.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, her parents never consented to the photo shoot and Ms.
Messenger's mother sued the publisher in federal court in 1998 under sections of
New York's Civil Rights Law, which prohibits the use of commercial use of a
person's name or likeness without written consent. An exception to the law
allows the media to use photos without consent as long as they illustrate
matters of public interest or "newsworthiness."
</P>
<P>
	   The jury in that case found in Ms. Messenger's favor and awarded her
$100,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the magazine's publisher, Gruner &AMP; Jahr Printing and Publishing,
appealed the verdict in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Judges
there asked New York's highest court to decide whether that law applies to the
fictionalized use of a photo to portray a newsworthy issue.
</P>
<P>
	   In court, Ms. Messenger's lawyers conceded that the "Love Crisis" column
where the picture appeared was newsworthy and the pictures had a real
relationship with the article. They also made no allegation that the article was
really an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given these facts, (previous case law) dictate that plaintiff may not
recover under the Civil Rights Law, regardless of any false implication that
might be reasonably drawn from the use of her photographs to illustrate the
articles," the court said in an unsigned majority decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellacosa disagreed, saying there were other laws that were more applicable.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a purveyor is going to present the photograph of an individual, even in
conjunction with a newsworthy item, the presentation must be legitimately made
without false or misleading material," he said. "That is still good law and
supports the affirmative answer I would give."

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton and Gore to campaign together  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - For the first time this year, Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Al Gore will campaign Sunday in New York in the same place and at the same
time.
<P>
	   Aides said Thursday that the two will attend a church service Sunday morning
in Albany that is a highlight of the annual weekend gathering of the state
Legislature's black and Hispanic legislative caucus. Clinton and Gore are
expected to speak at the service.
</P>
<P>
	   While Gore is planning to leave after the service to prepare for Monday's
debate in New York City against former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Clinton
expects to stay in Albany through the day and attend the caucus' banquet Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucus weekend annually brings together hundreds of the state's top
black and Hispanic leaders and New York's minority community is an increasingly
powerful voting bloc. Blacks and Hispanics made up 15 percent of voters in the
state's 1998 election for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power comes in the state's March 7
presidential primary, considered a major showdown for Gore and the former New
York Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their
bids for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that presidential candidate Gore and Senate candidate Clinton
haven't yet campaigned together in New York has raised some eyebrows. It
prompted a front-page article in Thursday's editions of The New York Times that
carried the headline: "Gore and Mrs. Clinton Keeping A Wary Distance as
Candidates."
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Gore was asked if he and the first lady would be crossing paths
in Albany. "Don't know," he responded. Asked if he would like to, he said:
"Sure."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said there was no intentional
distancing of the two candidates and Gore's New York team appeared ready
Thursday to embrace the first lady, at least until after March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the next 19 days, she helps us tremendously," one Gore adviser said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. "Her numbers are just off the charts with
Democratic primary voters."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked recently why they hadn't been campaigning together, Gore told one
television interviewer that, "It's a matter of scheduling. Not just me, but also
her."
</P>
<P>
	   Both have made it clear that they feel they must step out of the shadow of
President Clinton. As part of that effort, Hillary Rodham Clinton has become
simply "Hillary" in campaign posters and news releases.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates have had nice things to say about each other.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm all for her. I think she's going to win," Gore said recently. "I think
she will be a great senator. I look forward to campaigning with her."
</P>
<P>
	   "I will do whatever I can in whatever way is open to me in supporting his
candidacy because I truly believe he would be the best person we could have to
lead our country into this new century," she said last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Key members of their New York campaign staffs have close relationships from
past campaigns and their offices are located in the same Manhattan office
building, three floors apart.

<HEADLINE> Sherrill forecloses on Oneida factory, tribe will oppose eviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SHERRILL, N.Y. (AP) - An Indian tribe is using the U.S. Constitution to
fight city hall.
<P>
	   After being hit for foreclosure on Wednesday for back taxes, the Oneida
Indian Nation plans to fight the city of Sherrill's attempt to foreclose on its
T-shirt printing factory. Tribal officials said the city is violating federal
law and the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, city attorneys served foreclosure papers on the Oneidas,
demanding they pay $2,928 in delinquent property taxes or face eviction from
their Oneida Indian Textile Design factory. A hearing is scheduled next Thursday
in Sherrill City Court.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our lawyers will take the necessary steps to halt the eviction before
Thursday," Oneida Nation spokesman Mark Emery said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Emery declined to elaborate, it is likely tribal attorneys would
ask a federal court for an injunction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneida Nation already has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court to stop
the city from foreclosing on the T-shirt factory, as well as its gas station and
several vacant parcels, which will come up on the city's tax-delinquent property
list over the next two years. A pretrial hearing is set for June.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation claims it is a sovereign nation that does not have to pay
property taxes on reservation land.
</P>
<P>
	   Emery said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that New York state illegally
acquired 250,000 acres in Madison and Oneida counties from the Oneidas by
violating a 1795 federal law requiring all Indian land transactions be approved
by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneidas and New York state are engaged in long-running negotiations to
settle the claim under the guidance of a court-appointed mediator.
</P>
<P>
	   "From our viewpoint, it is an ironclad case. Sherrill is clearly violating
federal law and the Constitution by attempting to foreclose on this property.
They are committing the same violation that the state committed," Emery said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Supreme Court has ruled that this is reservation land ... any land in
the claim area that we reacquire becomes reservation land," Emery said.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, he said, the property tax question is one being addressed in
land claim negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are litigating a case already being litigated," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past six years, the Oneidas have purchased more than 11,000 acres
of their lost homeland with profits from their casino. City officials contend
that Sherrill is outside the boundaries of the Oneidas" land claim.
</P>
<P>
	   The city put the factory property on the auction block two years ago, then
bought the property at its own auction earlier this month. Last week, the city
transferred the deed into its own name.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant employs 27 people and plans to hire eight to 10 more this year,
nation officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, the city has started foreclosure proceedings on 10 parcels owned by
the Oneidas for nonpayment of approximately $12,000 in city property taxes.

<HEADLINE> Spitzer sues over terms of GE dishwasher recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Judy Cookinham is one of those meticulous types who
keeps appliances working seemingly forever. The 60-year-old Ilion woman uses a
microwave from 20 years ago.
<P>
	   So when she learned General Electric Co. was recalling her 10-year-old
dishwasher due to a fire hazard, she fully expected her money back, a new
machine, or at least the opportunity to repair it - after all, it still looked
new.
</P>
<P>
	   But GE didn't offer any of those options - to her or 3 million other
customers that bought the defective products. Now New York's attorney general is
suing the company - saying it offered a sweeter deal to businesses that owned
the dishwashers than it did to individual customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company knew how its dishwashers could be fixed - and actually provided
inexpensive repair kits to commercial customers," Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   GE encouraged individual consumers, however, to "spend hundreds of dollars
on new machines when clearly they did not need to do so," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the recall, GE and the CPSC said they were aware of 50
incidents in which the slide switch, which selects the heat drying and energy
save functions, melted and ignited fires. Seven of the fires spread beyond the
dishwashers and three damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general said he would file a lawsuit in state Supreme Court
against GE later this month seeking restitution and damages for customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only winner in this case is GE, not me," Cookinham said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company dismissed Spitzer's claim, announced on the "Today" television
show as "grandstanding." GE noted that its October 1999 recall arrangement was
approved by the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are working very hard to communicate effectively about this recall with
our consumers and to satisfy all of them during our implementation," GE
spokesman Terry Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defective dishwashers were sold in the 1980s under the General Electric
and Hotpoint labels. The defect in the machines was in a slide switch.
</P>
<P>
	   GE told individuals the switch could not be fixed and offered them rebates
of $75-$125 for new GE or Hotpoint dishwashers. New GE dishwashers at a Sears
store on Thursday cost $399 to $499. Hotpoints sold at $229 and $279.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's office said labor would have cost about $75 for the ten-minute
procedure to correct the defect.
</P>
<P>
	   Commercial customers like hotels and landlords were provided with rewiring
kits, a video explaining how to fix the problem, and a $15 labor allowance.
</P>
<P>
	   GE did not deny treating individuals and businesses differently, and
suggested that was part of its agreement with the CPSC.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar charges are in a class-action suit that St. Petersburg, Fla.,
attorney John Yanchunis said he was filing Thursday in federal court. The
damages he is seeking - compensation for a defective product and for repairs -
would also apply to every customer in the country who bought the dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
	   Yanchunis filed another suit shortly after the recall on behalf of residents
of a condominium who had the dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that in his state, GE's practices were especially problematic for
the elderly on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's lawsuit will seek restitution and damages for customers whether or
not they took advantage of the rebate.
</P>
<P>
	   The defective models include those made under General Electric and Hotpoint
names with the model numbers GSD500D, GSD500G, GSD540, HDA467, HDA477, and
HDA487. The recalled models also carry the serial number that has a second
letter of A, M, R, S, T, V or Z.

<HEADLINE> Former town official pleads innocent to murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - Less than two months after firing a gun at his
head, a former town official appeared in court to plead innocent in the murder
of a fellow worker.
<P>
	   The plea Thursday from Fred Andros, 60, was followed by a release of court
documents in which he admitted to being romantically involved with the victim,
48-year-old Susan Fassett.
</P>
<P>
	   The developments were the latest in a sometimes lurid series of revelations
involving Town of Poughkeepsie officials. Andros had already pleaded guilty in a
long-running federal corruption probe into town government when he was charged
last month in the slaying of Fassett, the town personnel director.
</P>
<P>
	   Andros fired a gun at his chin Dec. 29, as police appeared at his door.
</P>
<P>
	   As Andros stood before a judge Thursday, the lower part of his face remained
discolored and shrunken looking. He appeared gaunt in a loose-fitting blue suit
and softly said "thank you" to the judge as he left.
</P>
<P>
	   Andros is one of two people charged with second-degree murder in connection
with the Oct. 28 killing of Fassett. The married mother of two was shot to death
in a church parking lot as she left choir practice.
</P>
<P>
	   His alleged co-conspirator, Dawn Silvernail of Earlton in Greene County,
told police she was coerced by Andros to be the triggerwoman, according to court
documents summarizing her statements to police. The confession Silvernail gave
police also included allegations that she and Fassett had lesbian encounters
facilitated by Andros.
</P>
<P>
	   Silvernail's lawyer has said he would challenge the validity of her
statement. She has pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   A summation of Andros' own statements to authorities give yet another
version of events surrounding Fassett's slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   "I did not kill that woman," Andros told authorities, instead laying blame
on Silvernail.
</P>
<P>
	   In Andros' account, Silvernail believed that Fassett was "singing to the
FBI" - an apparent reference to the federal probe that has implicated Andros,
local Republican boss William Paroli Sr. and others in an alleged extortion
scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly-released documents reveal that law enforcement officials had
interviewed Andros within hours of Fassett's death, and many times through the
end of 1999. Andros sometimes changed his answers at different interviews. For
instance, after telling authorities he had intercourse once with Fassett a year
earlier, he later admitted to a number of encounters with her up to the week she
died, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   Andros told of a lesbian relationship between Fassett and Silvernail. But he
denied having a sexual relationship with Silvernail, contradicting her
confession.
</P>
<P>
	   Through his many interviews with police, FBI agents and federal prosecutors,
Andros consistently maintained Fassett was a "wonderful" woman whom he felt
deeply for.
</P>
<P>
	   Even after he shot himself, when he could only indicate "yes" by nodding or
squeezing a state police investigator's hand, he still expressed feelings for
her.
</P>
<P>
	   In that same hospital interview, police asked him: "Are you sorry about what
you did to Susan?" According to court papers, Andros placed an investigator's
hand on his chest and "squeezed it very tightly with both hands"
</P>
<P>
	   Andros still suffers headaches and memory loss and is "somewhat depressed,"
his lawyer Noel Tepper said outside of court.
</P>
<P>
	   Andros was remanded to jail without bail.
</P>
<P>
	   In a related development Thursday, the special commissioner appointed by
Gov. George Pataki to oust Paroli from his job as county elections commissioner
said he found several instances of misconduct that could warrant Paroli's
removal.
</P>
<P>
	   Austin Campriello, a New York City lawyer, said those instances included a
conspiracy with Andros to accept bribes from contractors; the use of a Town of
Poughkeepsie employee to perform manual labor at Paroli's home using materials
paid for by the town; the billing of the town for electrical work at Paroli's
house and for four tires for his car and for Paroli's alleged failure to file
financial disclosure statements from 1992-98.
</P>
<P>
	   Campriello scheduled a hearing for March 3 in Poughkeepsie on the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli has maintained his innocence.

<HEADLINE> Jury decides Cayuga's lost homeland worth $37 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - It was less than they argued for. It was less than
they expected. Yet, if it remains unchanged, the $36.9 million award recommended
by a federal court jury is enough for the Cayuga Indian Nation to get what they
wanted in the first place.
<P>
	   "We have always said this was not about money," Clint Halftown of Gowanda, a
spokesman for the Cayugas, said Thursday after jurors announced their judgment
in the groundbreaking damages trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "So we have a little less money to buy back our land, to begin rebuilding
our nation. It is enough to start," Halftown said. "What's most important to us
is that there are no restrictions on buying land."
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the Cayugas' attorneys said they would file motions seeking to
have the decision set aside, calling it a "ridiculous" amount.
</P>
<P>
	   "Apparently nine people didn't pay attention to the evidence," said Martin
Gold, one of the Cayugas' lawyers, referring to the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have no idea what they were thinking," added Raymond Heslin, another
attorney for the Cayugas. "Not only did they go against all the credible
evidence. They went against the state's evidence."
</P>
<P>
	   An expert real estate appraiser testified for the state that the Cayugas
should receive no more than $51 million for the 100-square mile patch in Cayuga
and Seneca counties. Appraiser John Dorchester said the land had a rental value
of approximately $10 million and a current market value ranging from $25 million
to $40 million.
</P>
<P>
	   An expert appraiser for the federal government told the jury the Cayugas
deserved $335 million for the land, including $70 million in back rent.
</P>
<P>
	   The award by the nine-member U.S. District Court jury consisted of a rental
value of $1.9 million for the use and occupancy of the 64,015 acres over 204
years and $35 million for current market value.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision is a recommendation to Judge Neal McCurn, who will determine
how much the Cayugas receive. McCurn plans a second non-jury trial to consider
"equitable factors," such as interest on the back rent and deductions for public
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   Heslin and Gold were perturbed that the jury used the same fair-market value
- $17,156.86 - for each year from 1796 through 1999 as the basis for calculating
a gross total. They then subtracted past payments and compensation already paid
by the state to reach the $1.9 million figure.
</P>
<P>
	   "Imagine, $17,156 rent for a 100-square-mile tract. That wouldn't buy you a
Buick," said Hank Meshorer, an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department, who
sided with the Cayugas during the 11-day trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant State Attorney General David Roberts applauded the jury for its
"excellent focus on a complex and difficult case."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an outcome that was better than the alternatives. But it's just one
step," Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury of five women and four men deliberated about 10 hours over two days
after reviewing 11 days of conflicting experts' testimony and boxes of
transcripts, documents and maps.
</P>
<P>
	   To that mountain of paper, McCurn on Wednesday added a 10-page template for
the jury to compute damages. From that, the jury calculated what they believed
to be a fair market rental rate for each of those years.
</P>
<P>
	   Halftown admitted he was surprised by the jury's decision. He questioned
whether they were protecting their personal interests.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas case is the first land claim case in New York to reach the
damages phase. There are three other land claims pending against New York and
the Onondaga Nation expects to file a fourth land claim sometime this year.
Together, the land claims cover a large portion of upstate New York, the
historical home of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
	   "They came back with a figure that was even lower than what the state asked
for. I have no idea how or why they reached this decision," said Halftown.
"Maybe it was personal fear."
</P>
<P>
	   Halftown said the tribe had expected at least $100 million for its lost
lands.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on a 1985 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, McCurn previously ruled that New
York illegally acquired the land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the
Cayugas without the federal government's required approval.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas once spread out over 3 million acres of upstate New York.
Currently, about 500 Cayugas live in western New York on and around the Seneca's
Cattaraugus reservation. Two other larger groups of Cayugas, who also are party
to the claim, live in Canada and Oklahoma.

<HEADLINE> Psych Patient testifies she wanted to hurt, not kill, caseworker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A psychiatric outpatient said she wanted to scare
her caseworker, not kill her, when she planned and followed through with a
hammer attack during a home visit.
<P>
	   Taking the stand during her murder trial in Erie County Court Thursday,
Diane Wylie, 46, described in detail how she bludgeoned Judith Scanlon from
behind and then struggled with the nurse before striking more blows.
</P>
<P>
	   "I couldn't get through to her," said Wylie, who said she believed Scanlon
would cause her to lose custody of her 4-year-old daughter. "I thought if I hurt
her maybe she would feel fear. I wanted her to be carried out of my house on a
stretcher."
</P>
<P>
	   Scanlon's death Nov. 24, 1998, ignited demands by her union for better
safety measures for workers who care for the mentally ill, including a
moratorium on unaccompanied home visits. The New York State Public Employees
Federation also has said intensive case managers, like Scanlon, should not be
required to drive clients to meetings and appointments.
</P>
<P>
	   Wylie told Judge Sheila DiTullio that "black spirits" told her to take
action if Scanlon took her daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   "The plan was coming from evil spirits," she said. "They were saying you
have to do something."
</P>
<P>
	   Wylie said she planned to hit Scanlon from behind with a hammer and then say
a black man had climbed in through the window and attacked her.
</P>
<P>
	   "I followed her to the door and when she got in the hall ... I hit Judy in
the back with the hammer," said Wylie, whose attorneys are pursuing an insanity
defense. But the nurse did not fall down, and instead turned and approached
Wylie. The two struggled for the hammer before Scanlon eventually fell to the
floor, where she was struck numerous times.
</P>
<P>
	   A medical examiner testified Tuesday that any one of 13 hammer blows Scanlon
took to the face could have killed her.
</P>
<P>
	   "She was very aggressive. It was like a street fight," Wylie said. She said
she struck Scanlon and tried to stab her while she was unconscious to keep her
from getting up.
</P>
<P>
	   "On TV, people get shot twice and they can still keep coming," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wylie, who waived her right to a jury trial, was acquitted in four bank
robberies on insanity grounds in 1982 and was hospitalized for two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Should DiTullio find her criminally insane and not legally responsible for
Scanlon's death, Wylie likely would face long-term treatment in a state
psychiatric facility.
</P>
<P>
	   If found guilty of murder, she faces a mandatory prison term of at least 15
to 25 years to life.

<HEADLINE> Sherrill forecloses on Oneida factory, tribe will oppose eviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SHERRILL, N.Y. (AP) - An Indian tribe is using the U.S. Constitution to
fight city hall.
<P>
	   After being hit for foreclosure on Wednesday for back taxes, the Oneida
Indian Nation plans to fight the city of Sherrill's attempt to foreclose on its
T-shirt printing factory. Tribal officials said the city is violating federal
law and the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, city attorneys served foreclosure papers on the Oneidas,
demanding they pay $2,928 in delinquent property taxes or face eviction from
their Oneida Indian Textile Design factory. A hearing is scheduled next Thursday
in Sherrill City Court.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our lawyers will take the necessary steps to halt the eviction before
Thursday," Oneida Nation spokesman Mark Emery said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Emery declined to elaborate, it is likely tribal attorneys would
ask a federal court for an injunction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneida Nation already has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court to stop
the city from foreclosing on the T-shirt factory, as well as its gas station and
several vacant parcels, which will come up on the city's tax-delinquent property
list over the next two years. A pretrial hearing is set for June.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation claims it is a sovereign nation that does not have to pay
property taxes on reservation land.
</P>
<P>
	   Emery said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that New York state illegally
acquired 250,000 acres in Madison and Oneida counties from the Oneidas by
violating a 1795 federal law requiring all Indian land transactions be approved
by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneidas and New York state are engaged in long-running negotiations to
settle the claim under the guidance of a court-appointed mediator.
</P>
<P>
	   "From our viewpoint, it is an ironclad case. Sherrill is clearly violating
federal law and the Constitution by attempting to foreclose on this property.
They are committing the same violation that the state committed," Emery said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Supreme Court has ruled that this is reservation land ... any land in
the claim area that we reacquire becomes reservation land," Emery said.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, he said, the property tax question is one being addressed in
land claim negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are litigating a case already being litigated," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past six years, the Oneidas have purchased more than 11,000 acres
of their lost homeland with profits from their casino. City officials contend
that Sherrill is outside the boundaries of the Oneidas" land claim.
</P>
<P>
	   The city put the factory property on the auction block two years ago, then
bought the property at its own auction earlier this month. Last week, the city
transferred the deed into its own name.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant employs 27 people and plans to hire eight to 10 more this year,
nation officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, the city has started foreclosure proceedings on 10 parcels owned by
the Oneidas for nonpayment of approximately $12,000 in city property taxes.

<HEADLINE> Aeroflex Leaving NYSE for Nasdaq  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking to compete among its high-technology peers,
Aeroflex Inc. is making the unprecedented move of shifting its publicly traded
stock from the New York Stock Exchange to the computerized Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Companies often move from the Nasdaq to the NYSE as they grow in size and
value. For example, Qwest Communications International, a Denver-based
telecommunications company, jumped to the NYSE earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
	   But no company has ever left the Big Board for the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   The move reflects the shifting attitude of U.S. investors, who have become
increasingly infatuated with the growth potential of small tech-sector
companies, many of which are listed on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   Demand for those stocks fueled an unprecedented 86 percent rise in the
Nasdaq composite index in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Aeroflex President Michael Gorin said at a news conference in Manhattan
Thursday that the shift was made to capture the extraordinary valuations
currently afforded many Nasdaq listed tech companies and to boost Aeroflex's
exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   All of Aeroflex's peers -- both in size and business model -- are listed on
the Nasdaq, Gorin said.
</P>
<P>
	   A typical NYSE listed company is currently worth about $5.3 billion. The
typical Nasdaq listed company is much smaller.
</P>
<P>
	   Aeroflex, of Plainview, N.Y., makes parts for high-tech communications
systems and has a stock market valuation of about $750 million. It first listed
on the NYSE in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1983, the Nasdaq market was 'the other market.' Nasdaq is now at least
on a comparable plain with the NYSE. If we thought otherwise, we wouldn't have
made the change," Gorin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aeroflex shares will begin trading on the Nasdaq on March 21 under the
symbol ARXX.
</P>
<P>
	   Nasdaq spokesman Scott Peterson predicted that other NYSE-listed tech
companies will follow Aeroflex to the Nasdaq, but he declined to provide
examples.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE spokesman Ray Pellecchia said the exchange doesn't think the Aeroflex
move represents the start of a trend. Thirty companies have jumped to the NYSE
in the last six months, according to Pellecchia -- 21 from the Nasdaq and nine
from the American Stock Exchange, which merged last year with the Nasdaq, .
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Zarb, chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
which overseas the Nasdaq market, said high-profile moves by tech companies from
the NYSE to the Nasdaq will add value to the Nasdaq as it prepares for its own
shift to a for-profit company, a move expected by midyear.

<HEADLINE> Olive Business Blossoms in Nunnery  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHELLE LOCKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Glinting blue-black in the pale afternoon sun, the
olives of Mission San Jose hang plump and smooth against a wintry sky.
</P>
<P>
	   "See how much? Look above you -- amazing!" exclaims Sister Jane Rudolph, her
dark eyes sparkling. "I love it!"
</P>
<P>
	   For years, a labor shortage meant the fruit of these trees sprinkled across
the neatly manicured lawns of the Dominican Sisters convent fell to the ground
neglected.
</P>
<P>
	   This fall, the sisters decided to strike the oil in their backyard and
connect with a tradition that stretches back two centuries.
</P>
<P>
	   "The thing that is important to us is being stewards of the earth. We've
been blessed and now to use this historic resource -- it's exciting," said
Sister Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
	   Nestled at the foot of wintergreen hills about 40 miles southeast of San
Francisco, the Dominican Sisters' 47-acre property has more than 200 trees,
believed to have been planted by Franciscan missionaries two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, the olives were used to make oil that was used for sacramental
purposes, as gifts to benefactors and for convent cooking.
</P>
<P>
	   But in 1964, the nuns could no long handle the labor of harvesting, crushing
and bottling the oil. They stopped production and gave away their crushing
machine to monks in Big Sur.
</P>
<P>
	   For a while the olives were mainly a nuisance, dropping onto parking lots,
sticking to the tile and wood floors of the elegant, early 20th-century convent,
and blooming with flowers that played havoc with some of the sisters' allergies.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, in the late 1980s, there was a resurgence of interest in California
olive oil, fueled by a new generation of gourmands hungry for fresh, local and
unique products.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996-1997, the harvest of California extra-virgin, the highest quality,
olive oil was 123,000 gallons. By 1998-1999 it was 321,000 gallons -- a 161
percent jump.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're where the California wine industry was in the late '60s early '70s,"
said Patty Darragh of the California Olive Oil Council.
</P>
<P>
	   It was about three years ago when the Dominican Sisters started thinking
about reviving their grove and got a "wholeheartedly, 'Yes, let's go,"' from
leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   The project got a big boost when Modesto grower Dan Sciabica offered to
crush the olives and bottle the oil for free. "We are wild with gratitude," said
Sister Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
	   Sciabica, whose family -- the name is pronounced Sha-bEE-ka -- has been
making olive oil for three generations, is happy to help. He's particularly
pleased oil proceeds have been earmarked for the care of elderly nuns.
</P>
<P>
	   "I"m a product of Catholic education," he said. "Now these sisters are
getting older. They've given so much to us. It's time for us to give something
back."
</P>
<P>
	   Since December, the nuns and a squadron of community volunteers have picked
enough olives to yield about 100 gallons.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Rudolph was on hand to watch a batch of the olives being processed.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was like purple oatmeal. The aroma was wonderful," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   An enthusiastic saleswoman, Sister Rudolph recommends mixing the mission
product with a little balsamic vinegar and some fresh garlic and scooping it up
with fresh bread.
</P>
<P>
	   But it will take some patience. The nuns don't plan to sell the olive oil
until their annual fund-raising arts and crafts sale in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Sciabica expects interest to be high. The medium-fruity oil is "quite
delicious," he said. "It's very vibrant and alive."
</P>
<P>
	   If things go well -- back in the '40s the sisters produced 400 gallons a
year -- they might consider expanding sales, but for now Sister Rudolph is still
working on things like pricing and profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have not set any goals. This is really an adventure," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The next order of business is looking for ways to accomplish the essential
but expensive business of pruning.
</P>
<P>
	   Although they're hardly a threat to commercial growers, the nuns do have a
secret weapon in their business plan -- each sister has adopted a tree and is
praying for it.

<HEADLINE> More Trouble for Rite Aid  </HEADLINE>
    By HOPE YEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Troubles continue to mount for the Rite Aid drug
store chain.
</P>
<P>
	   A published report said the company faced a criminal fraud investigation in
connection with its past accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wall Street Journal cited anonymous sources Thursday in reporting that
Frank Bergonzi, Rite Aid's former chief financial officer, had received a
subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Harrisburg to produce documents
relating to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's third-largest pharmacy chain, based in Camp Hill, would not
comment on whether the U.S. Attorney's Office is investigating it, but noted it
is cooperating with an ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission over similar issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll cooperate with any investigation the government sees fit to take,"
said Karen Rugen, a senior vice president at Rite Aid.
</P>
<P>
	   David Barasch, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania,
refused to comment Thursday as did Bruce A. Hiler, Bergonzi's attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   The pharmacy chain has been trying to recover after financial woes sent the
company's stock tumbling by more than 80 percent in a year. Former top executive
Martin L. Grass was ousted in October, and a new team led by CEO Robert Miller
has pledged to improve profitability with stricter financial controls and
strategic marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid also has switched auditing firms and a restatement of its earnings
for the past three years was expected to result in a $500 million reduction. The
SEC is continuing to review the company's accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper reported that the U.S. Attorney's Office wants to know whether
the company inflated its profit in last year's fiscal quarter by improperly
claiming credits from suppliers for goods that were supposedly damaged or
outdated.
</P>
<P>
	   The office also is investigating whether Rite Aid boosted earnings by
overaggressively estimating gross margins. It has questioned at least one other
person besides Bergonzi on the matter, the Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid has about 3,800 stores and nearly 90,000 employees nationwide. It
reported 1999 sales of $12.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> SEC Reviewing Mutual Fund Marketing  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators, concerned about recent mutual fund
ads boasting of triple-digit returns, are reviewing fund companies' marketing
and sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech Thursday to a mutual fund conference, Securities and Exchange
Commission chairman Arthur Levitt said he had asked SEC staff members to conduct
the special review, which will include Web sites, sales literature and
advertising of mutual fund companies. The staff will determine whether a fund's
performance and investment strategies are in line with its advertising
statements and prospectus documents, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to be sure that funds today are telling the whole story in their
marketing efforts to attract new customers," Levitt said in the text of his
evening speech, which was provided in advance by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today it seems you can't open a newspaper or read a magazine without seeing
ads promoting the stellar performance of 'hot' mutual funds," he said. "And how
many funds have we all seen claiming to be the 'Number one performing fund' --
some boasting returns of over 100 percent?"
</P>
<P>
	   If the SEC review finds lapses, the agency could take the kind of
enforcement action against mutual fund companies it pursued last fall against
one firm for allegedly misleading investors in ads.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview last month with The Associated Press, Levitt decried a
recent proliferation of ads by mutual fund companies boasting of triple-digit
returns that may have been pumped up by stocks whose shares soared after an
initial public offering. Only the fine print in the ads explains why the
performance was so strong, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Levitt also urged investors to look at mutual fund fees and other factors
besides past performance when choosing funds, and not to get sucked into playing
"the performance game."
</P>
<P>
	   At a time when 177 mutual funds are posting annual gains of 100 percent or
more, investors also should look at a fund's costs, which can have a huge impact
on returns, Levitt said. A 1 percent higher annual fee can reduce a fund
investor's ending balance by 18 percent after 20 years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes are high. Some 83 million Americans now invest in mutual funds,
whose total assets are estimated at $6 trillion, up from around $1 trillion in
1990.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech Thursday, Levitt said the SEC will ask independent directors
of mutual fund companies to critically review their funds' advertisements and to
challenge "overly aggressive" ads.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is neither in funds' nor shareholders' interests for fund advertisements
to encourage unreasonable expectations and unwise investment decisions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, he noted, the SEC will review the current rules governing fund
advertising in an effort to promote balance and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Under an agreement with the SEC, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, a self-policing industry group, reviews ads within 10 days of their
being published or broadcast. NASD officials say the group rarely has ads
killed, though it does sometimes suggest changes to the text to disclose
investment risks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Investment Company Institute, a group representing the mutual fund
industry, also has been looking into the matter of advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   John Brennan, ICI's chairman, who also heads the big fund company Vanguard
Group, has said advertising that touts triple-digit returns isn't desirable
because it ultimately will disappoint investors.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first case of its kind, the SEC in September went after a mutual fund
company for allegedly misleading investors in ads and disclosure documents by
not explaining how one of its funds made big first-year gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp., agreed to pay $100,000 in
a settlement. It neither admitted to nor denied the SEC's allegations.

<HEADLINE> GE Is Faulted on Dishwasher Recall  </HEADLINE>
    By JENNIFER JORDAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Judy Cookinham is one of those meticulous types who
keeps appliances working seemingly forever. The 60-year-old Ilion woman uses a
microwave from 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   So when she learned General Electric Co. was recalling her 10-year-old
dishwasher due to a fire hazard, she fully expected her money back, a new
machine, or at least the opportunity to repair it -- after all, it still looked
new.
</P>
<P>
	   But GE didn't offer any of those options to her or 3 million other customers
that bought the defective products. Now New York's attorney general is suing the
company, alleging it offered a sweeter deal to businesses that owned the
dishwashers than it did to individual customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company knew how its dishwashers could be fixed -- and actually
provided inexpensive repair kits to commercial customers," Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   GE encouraged individual consumers, however, to "spend hundreds of dollars
on new machines when clearly they did not need to do so," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general said he would file a lawsuit against GE later this
month seeking restitution and damages for customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The company dismissed Spitzer's claim as grandstanding, noting that its
October 1999 recall arrangement was approved by the federal Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are working very hard to communicate effectively about this recall with
our consumers and to satisfy all of them during our implementation," GE
spokesman Terry Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 3.1 million of the defective dishwashers were sold in the 1980s under
the General Electric and Hotpoint labels.
</P>
<P>
	   The defect in the machines was in a slide switch. GE told individuals the
switch could not be fixed and offered them rebates of $75 to $125 toward new GE
or Hotpoint dishwashers. New GE dishwashers at a store in Albany on Thursday
ranged from $399 to $499.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's office said labor would have cost about $75 for the 10-minute
procedure to correct the defect.
</P>
<P>
	   Commercial customers like hotels and landlords were provided with repair
kits, a video explaining how to fix the problem, and a $15 labor allowance.
</P>
<P>
	   GE did not deny treating individuals and businesses differently, and
suggested that was part of its agreement with the CPSC.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's lawsuit will seek restitution and damages for customers whether or
not they took advantage of the rebate.
</P>
<P>
	   The defective models include those made under General Electric and Hotpoint
names with the model numbers GSD500D, GSD500G, GSD540, HDA467, HDA477, and
HDA487. The recalled models also carry the serial number that has a second
letter of A, M, R, S, T, V or Z.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the recall, GE and the CPSC said they were aware of 50
incidents in which the slide switch, which selects the heat drying and energy
save functions, melted and ignited fires. Seven of the fires spread beyond the
dishwashers and three damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries were reported.

<P>
    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone had 30 points and 13 rebounds as Utah
beat Sacramento 119-108 on Thursday night, the Jazz's highest-scoring game of
the season.
</P>
<P>
	   John Stockton added 22 points and 10 assists. The star point pushed his
NBA-record assists total to 13,500 on a crosscourt pass to Jeff Hornacek for
Utah's first basket of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Hornacek also had 22 points and made all four of his 3-point attempts as the
Jazz won for just the third time in their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Webber led the Kings with 22 points, and Corliss Williamson added 18.
Sacramento has lost five of its last six road games.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockton hit two free throws to give Utah a 104-93 lead midway through the
fourth quarter, but Sacramento cut the margin to six on Jon Barry's 3-pointer
and Tony Delk's basket.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz regained control with their trademark precision, with Stockton
scoring on a driving layup, Hornacek hitting a jumper as the shot clock expired,
and Malone adding two free throw to make it 110-98 with 3:21 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah shot 52.5 percent from the field as it topped its previous season high
of 118 points against Charlotte on Jan. 5. The Jazz had 30 assists, 14 more than
the Kings.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah scored the first five points of the second half and took its biggest
lead at 69-47 on Hornacek's free throw. But Williamson, who had 16 points in the
third quarter, had seven points in a 16-4 spurt that made it 79-71 with 3:40
left in the period.

<HEADLINE> Bulls 83, Heat 76  </HEADLINE>
    By NANCY ARMOUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Toni who?
</P>
<P>
	   Playing their first game without Toni Kukoc, the Chicago Bulls got big
nights from Elton Brand and Hersey Hawkins and put together one of their best
defensive efforts of the season Thursday night as they stunned the Miami Heat
83-76.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a real big win for us for many reasons, including the mental
health of our team," coach Tim Floyd said. "With Toni gone, we needed to show we
could win without him, especially against a team like Miami."
</P>
<P>
	   Brand, the No. 1 pick in last year's draft, led the Bulls with 26 points and
10 rebounds. Hawkins, who had only scored in double figures once in the 13 games
since he returned from the injured list, had 20 points and a season-high nine
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Carr added a season-high 18, including six during a key stretch in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago, which might actually be a better team defensively without Kukoc,
held the Heat to 41 percent from the floor and their second-lowest point total
of the season. The Bulls also outrebounded Miami 47-40.
</P>
<P>
	   Alonzo Mourning led Miami with 15 points and 11 rebounds, but he was well
below his season average of 22.6 points. Tim Hardaway had 14, and Jamal Mashburn
added 12 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very devastating when you lose to teams like this," Hardaway said. "We
feel like we're an elite team, but when you lose to a team like this, I don't
know."
</P>
<P>
	   The Heat got within 60-59 with 8:15 left on a layup by Chris Carter, but
Brand made two free throws and Hawkins drilled a short jumper and a 3-pointer to
put the Bulls back up 70-59. After that, all that was left was the celebrating.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second straight victory over Miami, owner of the second-best
record (31-18) in the Eastern Conference, by the Bulls, the NBA's worst team
(11-38).
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not devastating," Miami coach Pat Riley said. "The Bulls have one of
the worst records in the league, but one of the best defenses."
</P>
<P>
	   Defense or no defense, Chicago's already dim fortunes looked even worse when
Kukoc, the team's leading scorer and the last key piece of the championship
dynasty, was traded to Philadelphia on Wednesday. When he missed 24 games with
lingering back spasms earlier this season, the Bulls went 2-22 and flirted with
the NBA record for futility.
</P>
<P>
	   With Kukoc gone for good, would Chicago win another game?
</P>
<P>
	   "The confidence level wasn't good, especially at shootaround with Toni
saying his goodbyes," Hawkins admitted. "Walking into the training room, it was
as if somebody died it was so quiet. But like coach told us, 'You can put your
heads down and mail the rest of the season in or go out there and play like
men."'
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago looked lost for much of the first quarter, scoring just two field
goals in the last 4:15 as Miami took a 23-16 lead. But the Bulls opened the
second quarter with a 12-3 run, and back-to-back 3-pointers by Matt Maloney and
Hawkins, followed by Brand's dunk, gave them a 28-26 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Any time the Heat seemed on the verge of pulling away, the Bulls came up
with an answer. When P.J. Brown's jumper gave Miami a 44-39 lead, Hawkins
responded with a 3-pointer. When Hardaway hit a 3-pointer, Carr scored six
straight points to pull Chicago within one at 49-48.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls took the lead on a three-point play from Brand, and he and Maloney
each made a pair of free throws to give the Bulls a 55-53 lead at the start of
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a huge boost because of the trade," Brand said. "Before the game,
coach came to me personally and said, 'I need a big night from you. A reporter
or someone said we're only going to win two more games. Let's get one of those
tonight.'
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess we got one of the two wins."

<HEADLINE> INS Official Charged With Spying  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official with ``secret'' security clearance
was arrested Thursday and charged with spying for the Cuban government, the FBI
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariano Faget, 54, was being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami
and was to appear in court Friday, the FBI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, a native of Havana, is employed at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service as a supervisory district adjudication officer. He held a ``secret''
security clearance and was responsible for supervising decisions that affected
immigrants and people seeking political asylum, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faget has access to classified and sensitive INS files relating to
confidential law enforcement sources and Cuban defectors,'' the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said he had made unauthorized contacts with Cuban intelligence
officers in Miami and in other U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
	   It could not be determined it Faget was represented by an attorney; there
was no answer at his home Thursday night. A message was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section, which represents the nation in
Washington, declined comment. The White House also had no comment, spokesman
Mike Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI said it wouldn't release any further details on the case until a
news conference set for Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Russ Bergeron, director of media relations at INS headquarters in
Washington, said he could not comment on Faget's arrest. He said it is INS
policy to cooperate with such investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Basulto, president of the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue,
said he believed there were many Cuban spies working in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. should be very embarrassed by this finding,'' he said. ``Until
the cancer is removed, which is Castro, this will continue.''
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1998, 14 people were charged in Florida in what authorities
called the largest Cuban espionage ring uncovered in the United States in
decades. Authorities said the group tried to penetrate U.S. military bases,
infiltrate anti-Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media and political
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI spokesman Terry Nelson told The Orlando Sentinel that Faget's arrest was
unrelated to this spy ring. Five people of the 14 have pleaded guilty and the
other are scheduled for trial in May.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in January 1961,
two years after Fidel Castro's rise to power, and initiated a trade embargo in
1962. Travel to and from the country is restricted by the U.S. government, but
athletic, cultural and academic exchanges have been allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Relations between the United States and Cuba recently have been strained by
the case of Elian Gonzalez. The INS has said the 6-year-old boy should be
returned to his father in Cuba while his relatives in Miami have been fighting
to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian survived a crossing from Cuba last November but his mother drowned
when their boat capsized.

<HEADLINE> EPO Test May Be Ready for Sydney  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A test to detect the banned super drug EPO is
almost foolproof and could be ready in time for the Sydney Olympics, the
Australian Institute of Sport said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	Initial trials showed the chance of a faulty test was only one in 100,000,
according to Allan Hahn, head of physiology at the institute. The center is
receiving funds from the Australian government and the International Olympic
Committee to develop a test for erythropoietin (EPO).
</P>
<P>
	After the test has been tested more widely, it will be delivered to the IOC in
July to be legally and medically checked and hopefully cleared for use at the
Sydney Olympics in September, Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
	He said initial testing had shown the probability of a false positive test was
very low.
</P>
<P>
	Hahn said the institute was collecting four blood samples from 1,200
Olympic-level athletes worldwide to show the normal range of EPO, which occurs
naturally.
</P>
<P>
	They would then compare the results to a trial on 105 recreational athletes,
half of whom would be injected with EPO and half with a placebo.
</P>
<P>
	``Because the test is based on probabilities, we're measuring a number of
different parameters,'' Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
	``We believe there is a very low probability that someone could be abnormal on
all those parameters unless they were taking EPO.
</P>
<P>
	``We're aiming to have a test that's an extremely low probability of any false
positive.''
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the institute was given nearly $1 million by the IOC to continue its
second stage of testing, which Hahn said would broaden the base
</P>
<P>
	``That (one in 100,000) probability's worked out so far on a relatively small
sample that consists pretty much of Australians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	``The next phase of the research is to put a similar analysis on a much larger
sample of people from around with world with a large range of different
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	``Our assessment of that probability will be much stronger after we finish the
second phase of the research.''

<HEADLINE> No. 4 Arizona 92, USC 85  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB BAUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Jason Gardner snapped out of a three-week shooting
slump to score 15 of his 19 points in the second half Thursday night as
fourth-ranked Arizona pulled out a tough 92-85 victory over Southern California
to avenge the Wildcats' lone Pac-10 loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert Arenas scored 21 points and Michael Wright, who had just three
points and was 0-for-3 from the field in Arizona's Jan. 22 loss to the Trojans
in Los Angeles, added 20 points and 14 rebounds for the Wildcats (22-4, 11-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Scalabrine, who scored a career-high 27 points against Arizona the
first time, bettered that with 28 this time despite playing most of the game in
foul trouble. Jeff Trepagnier had 20 points and 13 rebounds for USC (13-10, 6-5)
but missed a 3-pointer that would have tied the game with 24 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Brandon Granville had 21 points for USC, 15 in the first half, and 11
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Gardner, whose underhanded layup in traffic gave Arizona an 88-82 lead with
1:16 remaining, clinched it with two free throws that made it 90-55 with 17
seconds to play. Wright punctuated the victory with a breakaway stuff with a
second to go.
</P>
<P>
	   All five Arizona starters scored in double figures. Loren Woods, bothered by
a sore back, had 17 points and eight rebounds and Luke Walton matched his career
high with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
	   USC lost its fourth in a row and fifth in seven games, but not before
seriously threatening Arizona's 26-game Pac-10 homecourt winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats scored the first basket of the game, then trailed the rest of
the half. Scalabrine scored 13 points in the first 8 1/2 minutes, mostly on
layups, and USC built a 27-18 lead on Trepagnier's 3-pointer with 10:33 left in
the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing 43-39 at halftime, Arizona scored the first nine points of the
second half on 3-pointers by Gardner, Arenas and Walton to go up 48-43, but the
Trojans didn't fold.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona outscored USC 17-9 to go ahead 83-73 on Gardner's two free throws
with 4:45 remaining, but the Trojans used a 12-5 spurt to cut it to 88-85 on
Granville's 3-pointer with a minute to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Scalabrine stole Walton's pass inside to give USC a chance to tie it, but
Trepagnier's 3-pointer was just long.
</P>
<P>
	   Gardner, 7-for-41 from the field in his previous five games, was 3-for-5 in
the second half and 6-for-13 for the game. He also had eight rebounds and six
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though both teams have little depth because of injuries, it was an
up-tempo game. USC shot 64 percent in the first half but just 34 percent in the
second. Arizona shot 42 percent in the first half and 53 percent in the second.

	   BEIJING (AP) -- China and the United States have made progress in resumed
discussions on strategic security concerns, including Taiwan, a senior U.S.
envoy said Friday as he prepared to wrap up the two-day talks. U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was meeting again Friday morning with Chinese
Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. Earlier this week, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao said China planned to raise its concerns about U.S. weapons sales to
Taiwan. Beijing is worried that U.S. support for Taiwan will counter China's
growing arsenal of missiles, making it easier for the island to resist Chinese
overtures for reunification.

Poll: McCain Fares Well Against Gore
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain fares better than Gov. George W. Bush
against Democrat Al Gore, says a national poll out Thursday that challenges the
Bush campaign's claim that their man is the Republican most likely to win the
presidential election. McCain led Gore by 49 percent to 41 percent in the
hypothetical matchup in the poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the
Press. Bush and Gore were in a dead heat.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In one of the largest single Colombian cocaine
seizures, an American naval ship intercepted a fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean
laden with six tons of cocaine, officials said Thursday. Colombian Navy chief
Adm. Sergio Garcia said the Colombian-flagged vessel named "Rebel" was seized in
international waters yesterday, 1,530 miles northwest of the country's port of
Buenaventura. The 66-foot vessel and its seven-member Colombian crew left the
port on Jan. 22 with cocaine stashed in the boat's fuel compartment, Garcia
said.

Flaw Found in Mars Lander's Design
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A flaw in the design of NASA's Mars Polar Lander
could have caused its engines to cut off prematurely while the $165 million
spacecraft was descending to the surface, engineers said Thursday. The glitch is
the latest of several possibilities under investigation into why the spacecraft
has not made contact since Dec. 3, when it was to have gently landed to begin a
90-day mission to study Mars' climate history. Other scenarios include the
possibility that the spacecraft landed on the steep side of a canyon and toppled
over, or that its radios broke down. It was not known if any have been ruled
out.

<HEADLINE> Volpe says Wiese, not Schwarz, was there for Louima assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Testifying under oath for the first time about the
sodomy attack on Abner Louima, a contrite Justin Volpe insists that another cop
facing life as his accomplice in the brutal incident was never in the room at
the time.
<P>
	   The trial of Charles Schwarz and two other officers for conspiring to
obstruct justice went into a four-day weekend recess after Volpe spent a
gripping two hours on the stand in Brooklyn federal court on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers said they hoped to wrap up their case next week, with
Schwarz himself as the final witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, who faces a possible life sentence on his conviction for holding
Louima down while Volpe sodomized him with a broken broom handle, had no part in
the attack, Volpe told the Brooklyn federal court jury. He said another officer,
Thomas Wiese, was the only person present during the attack in a police station
lavatory.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never saw Schwarz in the bathroom at any time," Volpe repeatedly told a
packed and tense courtroom. "When I was in the bathroom, the only officer who
assaulted Mr. Louima was myself."
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe, sentenced to 30 years after pleading guilty last year to the August
1997 assault, was the first defense witness in the trial of Schwarz, 34, Wiese,
34, and Thomas Bruder, 37, for conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing
Schwarz's role in the attack on the Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe said Wiese stood by the entire time, making no move to take part or
intercede in the attack. That conflicted sharply with Wiese's assertion, to
detectives and Brooklyn district attorney investigators, that he had entered the
bathroom during the attack and intervened by dragging a prostrate, bleeding
Louima from a toilet stall by his legs.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz faces a possible life sentence after his 1999 conviction for
violating Louima's civil rights by holding him down. Volpe, at his own
sentencing last December, said for the first time that Wiese, not Schwarz, was
the second officer in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   The courtroom was rapt as Volpe, speaking in a voice edged with emotion,
elaborated on his story for the first time during two hours and 15 minutes on
the stand.
</P>
<P>
	   As to why he had not come forward sooner to try to exonerate Schwarz of a
false accusation, Volpe said he could not explain "the horrible things I did
that night" to himself or to his family.
</P>
<P>
	   "I couldn't deal with it, think about it, talk about it. As time went on, I
just kept my mouth shut and blocked it out," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since being sentenced to 30 years in prison, Volpe said, "part of me
reclaiming my life is telling the truth about what happened that night... I want
to do my time with a clear mind, with a clear conscience, and I can't live with
myself and do my time in peace, knowing that another man is paying for the crime
that I committed."
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz attorney Ronald Fischetti said his client was happy with Volpe's
testimony. "Volpe got on the stand and said under oath what Chuck has been
saying all along - 'I was never in that bathroom."'
</P>
<P>
	   Seeking to counter suggestions that Volpe was only trying to save a cop
crony from trouble, Fischetti asked if the two officers had socialized during
their years on the job in Brooklyn's Flatbush section.
</P>
<P>
	   "We never had a relationship of any kind," Volpe said. "We weren't friends.
... I never knew him as Chuck. I knew him as Schwarz, a guy who worked in my
precinct."
</P>
<P>
	   Nervous and presenting himself as deeply regretful, the 27-year-old ex-cop
told of punching the handcuffed prisoner repeatedly, throwing him to the floor
and threatening the suspect before attacking him with the broomstick.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe said he mistakenly believed that Louima had punched him during a
street riot outside a Haitian nightclub. When Louima became defiant and profane
after his arrest, Volpe grew "frustrated and angry."
</P>
<P>
	   "I was looking for some answers or an apology," Volpe said under strenuous
cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Resnick. "But I'm not blaming
Mr. Louima or trying to say it's his fault. I was the one who assaulted him."
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe's dramatic appearance came after the prosecution rested its case, but
was delayed briefly after U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson objected to the
witness showing up in blue prison fatigues and sneakers. U.S. marshals scrambled
to find a dark blue blazer, white shirt and tie that would fit the burly Volpe.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution ended its presentation by focusing on phone records showing
the contacts between the accused officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad briefly recalled an FBI agent who has
testified that the trio made an unusual number of calls to each other in the
days after Volpe attacked Louima.

<HEADLINE> Senator's Remarks Sparks Outcry  </HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES WOLFE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- One senator's argument that non-Christian religions
should be excluded from history lessons about colonial America has sparked
outcry among fellow lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the boat came to these great shores, it did not have an atheist, a
Buddhist, a Hindu, a Muslim, a Christian and a Jew,'' Republican Sen. Albert
Robinson told his colleagues this week. ``Ninety-eight-plus percent of these
people were Christians.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican senator pushed a resolution Tuesday to have the Kentucky
Board of Education stop ``suppression and censorship of American history'' as it
relates to ``Christianity's influence.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate changed the resolution to say ``Judeo-Christianity.'' Robinson
objected, but few stood with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Assembly's only Jewish legislator, Rep. Kathy Stein, said
Wednesday she is getting tired of thinly disguised attempts among her colleagues
to ``impose a majority faith.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Robinson's legislation, she singled out a proposed resolution
urging schools to prohibit extracurricular activities on Sunday because of
students' ``religious obligations,'' among other things.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that her Sabbath is from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, Stein
said: ``I am beginning to get, as a mother of three children, about fed up with
this thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even some within Robinson's own party have been critical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't believe we're arguing this,'' Senate President David Williams, a
Republican, said during the debate. ``We're trying to exclude people of faith,
people of a common ancestry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson added that he ``never intended to be inclusive.'' By adding a
reference to Judaism, ``we've done Christians and the Christian history of this
nation a terrible injustice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some newspapers' editorial pages weighed in on the issue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not sure which boat Sen. Robinson had in mind,'' said The
Courier-Journal of Louisville. ``Did he include the boats filled with Africans,
stolen from their homeland faith and brought here on slave ships?''
</P>
<P>
	   The Kentucky Post noted that ``a large number of boats ... have come to
these shores over the years. Not all of the immigrants have been Christian.''

<HEADLINE> Bankers argue that fee ban would limit competition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - After failing to convince a court that a 1970s
law made ATM convenience fees illegal in Connecticut, Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal is asking the Legislature to pass a new law specifically banning the
surcharges.
<P>
	   Blumenthal testified Thursday before the General Assembly's Banks Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   House leaders have promised a bipartisan push to outlaw the fees that would
ban fees levied on customers who use an ATM owned by a bank where they do not
have an account.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar bill passed the House last year but died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "Connecticut's ban on such fees for several years has produced no harmful or
negative impact on banks or other financial institutions," Blumenthal said.
"Indeed, the number of ATMs has skyrocketed."
</P>
<P>
	   That proves the ban would not stifle competition, backers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If banks didn't think it was a worthwhile investment, they wouldn't do it,"
said state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Brian McDermott, D-Wallingford, co-chairman of the Banks Committee,
said he would not try to kill the bill in committee. But he said he would not
try to pass it to the General Assembly unless there was widespread support for
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bankers argued Thursday that banning the fees would stifle free-market
competition.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have seen how the market has fared in a no-fee environment in
Connecticut," said Thomas H. O'Brien, Jr., regional president for First Union
National Bank. "I recommend that we now allow the market an equal opportunity to
react with fees in place, and let the natural forces of market competition
determine the landscape."
</P>
<P>
	   The Connecticut Bankers Association, which represents all but three of the
state's 82 banks, told the committee there should be no law prohibiting a
financial institution from competitively pricing its products.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that it is not unreasonable for non-customers to expect some
nominal charge for the benefit of convenience," said Richard A. Higginbotham,
president and CEO of Fleet Bank Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Supreme Court ruled in December that the banking commissioner
could not ban the fees. The state had ordered a ban under a 1970s law that said
banks could not collect fees from non-customers. But the high court said the law
had been written before the era of ATMs.
</P>
<P>
	   After the ruling, large, federally-charted banks began charging
non-customers the convenience fees. Smaller, state-chartered banks are not
charging the fees.
</P>
<P>
	   At the request of bankers in New Jersey, a federal judge on Thursday blocked
an ordinance that sought to ban the fees in the city of Woodbridge.

<HEADLINE> Bill Bradley appeals to students' idealism in visit to Yale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - With three weeks to go until the Connecticut
presidential primary, former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley took aim at the youth vote
in the state.
<P>
	   Bradley spoke Thursday at Toad's Place, a club near the Yale campus and
pledged to take advantage of good economic times by being responsive to the
needy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I appreciated his dedication to ideals. I don't know if he can really
follow through in attaining these ideals, but I definitely honor his
dedication," said Tyler Welti, a 19-year-old Yale English major.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also took some swipes at Vice President Al Gore, his sole opponent
for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator punctuated his speech by saying he is the
"only Democrat running" to offer health care coverage for all Americans,
consistently support abortion rights, and oppose tobacco companies and the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "If your dream is my dream, if you believe what we can do are the things
that I've laid out, if you believe that we have a politics that we can reclaim
with a combination of your energy and your idealism ... then join me in this
race," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can surprise a lot of people. We can make it happen in Connecticut," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's visit came the same day a Quinnipiac College poll showed him
trailing Gore, 49 percent to 41 percent among Connecticut voters. A Quinnipiac
poll in October had Bradley favored over Gore, 51 percent to 34 percent. The
polls had margins of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   State Comptroller Nancy Wyman, speaking for the Gore campaign, would not
comment on the poll. But she said Gore was not taking Connecticut for granted,
and the campaign would continue to spread his message until the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Al Gore's going to run on his record, and I think the problem is
that Bill Bradley hasn't had a record. He's been gone for seven years. Al Gore
stayed and fought the Republican Congress, fought for health care, fought for
education and fought for a good economy," Wyman said.
</P>
<P>
	   At an earlier stop at the Old Saybrook Diner, Bradley greeted a crowd of
about 500 supporters and chatted with a table of high school students who were
eager to vote in their first presidential election.
</P>
<P>
	   "You always remember your first vote," Bradley told them. "I remember my
first vote. I voted for Lyndon Johnson, but I never met Lyndon Johnson."
</P>
<P>
	   Kate Davey, senior at Old Saybrook High School, was thrilled to bend
Bradley's ear for a minute.
</P>
<P>
	   "We really believe in everything that you stand for - from education to pro
choice issues," she told him. "We know you can bring respect back to the
country."
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone was happy with the attention showered on the presidential
hopeful - namely the diner's owner.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Pertesis, who has been running the restaurant in the largely Republican
shoreline town for eight years, said he stripped Bradley campaign placards from
the diner's windows.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't want to use the diner for Mr. Bradley's campaign," Pertesis said
before Bradley arrived. "He's here for a bite to eat, then he will be on his
way. I'm not associated with Mr. Bradley, his campaign or his party."

<HEADLINE> Former GOP hopeful stumps state for George W. Bush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) - As former presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole
arrived at Sacred Heart University to campaign for George W. Bush, students
greeted her with enthusiastic chants of "Dole V-P."
<P>
	   But Dole, who withdrew from the race for the Republican nomination in
October, said she's not thinking about the Number Two spot on the presidential
ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's really premature," she said. "George Bush has to win the nomination
and when he does, he's going to have a whole group of talented leaders from
which to choose."
</P>
<P>
	   Dole, who is considered a likely candidate to be Bush's running mate should
he win the Republican nomination, visited Hartford and Fairfield Thursday to
stump for the Texas governor. She said Bush would attract more women to
politics, cut taxes and improve education.
</P>
<P>
	   In her remarks to about 200 people at a Metro-Hartford Chamber of Commerce
luncheon, Dole said Bush - who was born in New Haven, while his father was a
student at Yale University - has what it takes to beat Al Gore in the general
election. But she never mentioned Bush's main rival for the GOP nomination,
Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe we must have a president for all Americans," Dole said. "We need
a president who has vision and executive experience. I believe that person is
Gov. George Bush."
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut, California, New York and other states hold their presidential
primary March 7. A Quinnipiac College poll released Thursday found McCain
favored over Bush among likely voters in Connecticut's Republican primary, 52
percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll also found that among all registered voters, McCain is the favorite
in matchups for the presidency in November.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was favored 55 percent to 33 percent over Gore, and 50 percent to 34
percent over Democrat Bill Bradley, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dole, in an interview, brushed off the poll, saying the results simply
showed McCain enjoying a bounce following his victory in the New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole praised Bush's proposal for a tax cut, which has drawn fire from
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "The average worker is working five months for the government just to pay
his taxes. Isn't it time to give people a break and let them invest?" Dole said.
</P>
<P>
	   She also said Bush's platform will increase competition in education by
allowing local boards of education to take more control of their curricula.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you need is an increase in student performance, not paperwork," Dole
said.
</P>
<P>
	   And she said Bush would get more young people and women interested in
politics. She said two-thirds of the women in Texas voted for Bush in his
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "This gender gap that we hear a lot about is going to turn itself inside
out," she said. "Women are going to help take George Bush to the White House and
Al Gore is going to be the one with the gender gap in the year 2000 election."

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Enjoying the Good Life  </HEADLINE>
   By HRVOJE HRANJSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- To Quinto Ebony, it seems only yesterday that the
Ugandan capital was a war zone, contested by thousands of drunken fighters who
proved more adept at looting houses and shaking down civilians than fighting
each other.
</P>
<P>
	   Each morning, he recalled, a colleague would emerge from his home after a
night huddled in terror to find two or three bodies crumpled, beaten and shot at
one of the dozens of impromptu checkpoints in Kampala's devastated
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Ebony is a regular at The Musicians' Club 89, where every Monday
evening he and his friends play music to celebrate something Ugandans have not
always known -- a good life.
</P>
<P>
	   It doesn't matter who plays what in the crowded, dark room on the first
floor of the rundown National Theater. It can be a passable cover of Paul
Simon's ``Diamonds on the Soles of Your Shoes'' or a female duo trying their
best at ``Knocking on Heaven's Door'' -- just as long as the rhythm is right.
</P>
<P>
	   After two decades of dictatorship, war and poverty that ended in 1986 and
left up to a million people dead or missing, Ugandans as a rule are a contented
people, enjoying the fruits of unprecedented personal freedom and 7 percent
annual economic growth.

<P>
	   ``We've never had this good time before,'' Ebony said, tuning his electric
guitar. Although the 30-year-old medical school graduate wants to practice
medicine, he is not unhappy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not easy, without a proper job and all that. But I can sing, change
professions if I want, and nobody is harassing me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The peace and prosperity has meant a shift in the direction of the
population exodus that once beset the central African country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before, in Uganda, all you would do is think how to leave this place.
Today, children of those parents who left for the United Kingdom, the United
States or Europe are coming back to stay, not visit,'' said Hope Kivengere, a
spokeswoman for President Yoweri Museveni, who is given most of the credit for
Uganda's revival.
</P>
<P>
	   Museveni's National Resistance Movement originally was a leftist rebel group
that trained in North Korea and Libya and modeled itself on African socialist
movements in Tanzania and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
	   But after it won power in 1986 following a five-year military campaign
against the successive dictatorships of Idi Amin and Milton Obote, the movement
took a capitalist path.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Uganda is a darling of Western donors. Its strict adherence to
economic liberalization, privatization and private investment made it the first
African nation and second in the world to have half of its $3.6 billion foreign
debt written off.
</P>
<P>
	   That means money saved on debt payments can go into schools, health care and
roads.
</P>
<P>
	   The news may not be entirely rosy for Ebony and his friends, who graduated
from medical school at Makarere University. They are among 500 unemployed
doctors in Uganda, victims of government cost-cutting at state-run hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Kampala, a bustling capital of up to 4 million people, they're
well-positioned to get the most out of life in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside Kampala, life can be dicey. The northern third of the country
suffers from incursions from neighboring Sudan by the Lord's Resistance Army,
which is made up of northern Ugandans bent on settling scores with dominant
southern leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   In the west, another rebel group, the Allied Democratic Forces, has been
terrorizing and abducting people along Uganda's mountainous border with Congo,
also with Sudanese backing.
</P>
<P>
	   With rural Uganda not altogether secure, Kampala is a regular destination.
There, street hawkers and small-shop owners -- the pillar of the city's economy
-- can afford cellular phones, transportation and a good time in the local bars.
</P>
<P>
	   From thousands of tiny rundown shops to new air-conditioned marble shopping
arcades, everything from Chanel perfume to secondhand Toyotas is sold in Uganda
-- not all of it genuine or imported through proper channels.
</P>
<P>
	   There is even a word for the ill-gotten windfall -- ``bichupuli,'' or fake
currency in Luganda, the language of Buganda, which is Uganda's largest
traditional kingdom. Buganda is renowned for having an underground economic
system that has enriched many small-time traders.
</P>
<P>
	   The current king of bichupuli is Nasser Sebaggala, a former Kampala mayor
convicted of fraud in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   When Sebaggala returned last week after serving a 15-month jail term in
Boston, Mass., for forging checks and lying to U.S. Customs officials about it,
he was greeted by the largest crowd Kampala had seen in years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Muslim trader, often ridiculed for his bad English, announced then that
he would run for president in 2001 elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The government is embarrassed by the Sebaggala phenomenon. But his story
reflects the premium Ugandans now place on business and the economy, and not on
the politics of the past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ugandans are finally building a middle class which can sustain political
changes. It will be our protection from wars and civil unrest,'' Ebony said,
plucking the strings of his guitar.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Calif. Cargo Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. (AP) -- Flight data and cockpit voice recorders were
retrieved Thursday from the wreckage of a DC-8 cargo plane that crashed into a
salvage yard, killing its three crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators hope the recorders will provide more clues about the pilot's
report of a ``center of gravity'' problem shortly after the plane's takeoff from
Mather Field in suburban Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	   The recorders, which were damaged by fire but in fairly good shape, were
sent to Washington for analysis, said George Black of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Emery Worldwide Flight 17 plunged into the Insurance Auto Auctions yard just
before 8 p.m. Wednesday, killing its three crew members and setting dozens of
cars ablaze. The plane was bound for Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims' bodies were recovered Thursday afternoon, Black said.
</P>
<P>
	   The center of gravity problem could have several causes, including a
shifting load, incorrect cargo weight and mechanical problems, said Preston
Hicks, also of the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
	   Black said the flight recorder data could indicate weight and balance
problems from the performance of the plane. However, the report of an unsettled
load is not the sole focus of the investigation, Black said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything is a focus,'' he said. ``We never begin with a prejudged
position.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, carrying a load of transmission fluid, clothing and a small
packet of detonators, was at 800 feet when it tried to return to Mather for an
emergency landing and crashed in a fireball about a mile east of the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of small pieces from the plane are scattered among the
burned-out cars over five to six acres, Black said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``About the only thing you can recognize as part of an airplane is one
section of fuselage, about 6 to 7 feet high, maybe 15 feet long, with several
windows,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
	   One witness said the plane hit the ground belly first and was immediately
engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
	   Those aboard were dead by the time fire crews arrived at the site, said
Capt. Dan Haverty of the American River Fire Department. Firefighters were
hampered by intense flames, which burned for several hours after the crash.
Smoke was visible in the moonlit night several miles away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no chance of rescue,'' Haverty said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims were identified as Capt. Kevin Stables, 43, of Berlin, N.Y., who
had been with Emery for five years; First Officer George Land, 35, of
Placerville, Calif., 3 years; and Second Officer Russell Hicks, 38, Sparks,
Nev., 1 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokesman James Allen said the crash was the first fatal accident in
the company's 50-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   Nobody on the ground was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash set as many as 200 cars on fire, many with gas in their tanks,
causing several explosions.
</P>
<P>
	   Motorist Scott Colyn saw the plane as it approached the salvage yard ``at
eye level.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It looked like it was skipped like a stone,'' said Colyn, who saw the
crash while he was driving home. ``I looked in my rear view mirror and there
were flames everywhere, sparks and a big old mushroom cloud.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, carrying 62,000 pounds, was a DC-8 71, a four-engine plane
manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, Allen said. It has a capacity of 90,000
pounds, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   An FAA official once charged with checking some Emery planes said the agency
was concerned about how the company strapped down cargo in some planes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were some problems with it, we can't deny that,'' Terge Kristiansen
told the Los Angeles Times for Friday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Kristiansen nor an FAA spokesman in Seattle would divulge results of
a 1999 inspection of Emery planes that focused on ``loading issues.'' Emery's
Allen said he was unaware of any problems with straps or other equipment used to
secure cargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Redwood City-based Emery Worldwide specializes in transportation services
for business shippers of heavyweight cargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Oscarson, director of marketing for the Insurance Auto Auctions, said
the company has not started to estimate the damage from the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're very grateful it wasn't during an auction and that it was when the
facility was secured and no one on the ground was injured,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Treating Russians, Chechens  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW KRAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- During brutal fighting around Chechnya's capital,
surgeon Hasan Baiyev operated on Russian soldiers and Chechen rebel fighters
alike in a village hospital. That has made him the enemy of both sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Baiyev fled Chechnya fearing for his life after a marathon session in a
poorly equipped operating room, where he performed 60 amputations over a two-day
period -- including one on Shamil Basayev, one of the most prominent Chechen
commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chechen surgeon said he never refused anyone medical care. But military
men on both sides saw his work differently, and after receiving threats he went
into hiding this month in the neighboring republic of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
	   His latest travails began when about 3,000 rebels broke out of the Chechen
capital Grozny and stumbled onto a minefield on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a very peaceful night, the snow was falling,'' Baiyev said in an
interview. ``Toward morning, we could hear small explosions -- lots of them. It
turned out they were mines.''
</P>
<P>
	   Scores of wounded found their way to the hospital in the village of
Alkhan-Kala, where Baiyev was the only doctor on duty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I started to operate, more and more arrived and were collecting in the
yard and hallways,'' he said. In all, Baiyev and a group of nurses and
volunteers treated about 150 wounded fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   Trained as a plastic surgeon, Baiyev had already grown used to the
difficulties of battlefield work during the first Chechen war, in 1994-96:
operating by the light of dim lamps hooked up to car batteries, breaking skulls
open to remove shrapnel without the aid of X-rays.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I adapted to working in all conditions,'' he said. ``I have operated in
holes in the ground and on the street.''
</P>
<P>
	   But nothing had prepared him for the wave of amputations. He worked with
only local anesthetic and morphine, and had six nurses helping him. He performed
an amputation about every 25 to 30 minutes, he said. He also removed shrapnel
from wounded fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   Nurses spooned him bites of food and sips of tea as his hands were busy
cutting flesh and bone, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   His first break came only the following morning, when he nearly passed out.
Rebels helped him outside into the fresh air, and he rubbed snow on his face
before returning to the operating table.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops had meanwhile surrounded the village and begun shelling,
sending a new wave of wounded to Baiyev's hospital -- this time, civilians.
Despite another day and night of work, about 150 rebels went without treatment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Baiyev helped some of the wounded fighters into basement hiding places as
Russian storm troops closed on the village. Some of the wounded were carried
away by healthy rebels, but the Russians discovered others and loaded them into
buses for the trip to prison. Baiyev said Russian soldiers shot and killed six
wounded rebels in the hospital basement.
</P>
<P>
	   Now he fears Russian authorities will arrest him, and keeps his movements
secret.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They never say I operated on women, children, old people -- only that I
operated on Basayev,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Baiyev kept the doors to his hospital open to wounded from both
sides. Russian soldiers near the city in December and January brought comrades
seriously wounded by snipers to his hospital, he said. Young conscripts would
also sometimes bring wounded civilians for treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The policy nearly cost Baiyev his life. The ground his hospital occupied
changed hands in the seesaw battle for the Chechen capital, when rebels stormed
into Alkhan-Kala in the first days of January in a fierce counterattack led by a
radical Islamic warrior, Arbi Barayev.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He came to the hospital strapped with weapons'' and angry after locals
told him the hospital had treated Russian soldiers, Baiyev said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barayev put a gun in Baiyev's face and threatened to shoot, although the
doctor had treated the warlord for a wound in the last war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said 'you receive soldiers off their APCs.' I said 'yes, and I will
continue to, because for me they are only wounded people.''
</P>
<P>
	   A television set flickered in the background during the interview, showing a
Russian-dubbed rerun of the American hospital drama ``ER.'' Doctors and nurses
scurried about glossy, sterile rooms in white coats and studied a large X-ray
print.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When they show these conditions, it's a dream,'' he said, staring at the
screen. ``I could work a week and never get tired.''

<HEADLINE> Soviet-Era Waste Causing Concern  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL TARM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SILLAMAE, Estonia (AP) -- When they withdrew from this seaside Estonian town
that for five decades supplied the Soviet Union with enriched uranium to make
nuclear bombs, the Soviet military left behind something to remember them by: 12
million tons of greenish-brown radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
	   The sludge is in a pond-sized deposit that lies behind a mud-and-rock
containment wall just yards from the Baltic Sea. Chemical wastes and nitrates
seep around and through the wall into the sea, which during storms can slap up
against the dam, pulling parts of it off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It makes us think that we shouldn't wait too long to deal with the
situation here,'' Anti Siinmaa, one of the engineers responsible for ensuring
environmental safety at Sillamae, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Romania goes to show you can't always know what can happen, or when. Let's
hope nothing like that happens in Sillamae,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Romania, a Jan. 30 cyanide spill from a containment dam at a gold mine
killed tons of fish and contaminated rivers in neighboring Hungary and
Yugoslavia. That focused public attention on the lethal residue left behind by
the Soviet Union in its former republics after it collapsed a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union included Sillamae, 110 miles east of the capital Tallinn,
on a list of about 800 hazardous waste deposits in the former communist bloc. It
determined there was a real danger its containment walls could collapse and its
toxins splash into the Baltic Sea, poisoning one of Europe's major waterways.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, Sillamae has been the largest single source of nitrate pollution
in the Baltic, according to the U.S.-based Los Alamos National Laboratory, which
recently studied the site.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Sillamae deposit is already doing damage to the Baltic on a very large
scale,'' said Valdur Lahtvee of the Estonian Green Movement.
</P>
<P>
	   While no health dangers have been documented, some of Sillamae's 20,000
residents claim the incidence of cancer, including in children, is higher than
average.
</P>
<P>
	   The waste deposit covers about 99 acres and is about 20 feet high, rising to
within a yard of the top of the containment wall, which is perhaps 50 feet thick
at the base, narrowing to 10 feet at the top.
</P>
<P>
	   After it won independence in 1991, Estonia appealed for international help,
saying it didn't have the expertise to deal with Sillamae alone and could not
afford the clean-up costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Last October, Estonia signed a $20 million plan to fortify the site with
concrete walls, construct a breakwater to prevent waves from pounding it, and
seal the entire dump with a waterproof cover. The EU provided $5 million of the
funding. Estonia will contribute $3 million; and Norway, Sweden, Finland and
Denmark will pay most of the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This waste is a byproduct of the Cold War, and that makes it an
international problem,'' Dennis Hjeresen, an American researcher at the Los
Alamos laboratory, said during a recent NATO-sponsored conference on Sillamae.
``This is part of the clean-up of the battlefield after the war is over.''
</P>
<P>
	   Siinmaa said the first step will be to secure the base of the dam with a new
concrete wall. That could take til the end of next year to complete. Covering
the site could take another five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Estonia says Sillamae is only one of a host of environmental problems
inherited from the Soviet military, which once had more than 1,500 bases here
that sprawled across more than two percent of Estonia's territory. The
government has estimated it could cost five billion dollars to clean them all
up.

<HEADLINE> Jury finds city did not violate group's First Amendment rights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization finally got its
day in court but not the answer it wanted in its attempt to be allowed to march
on Fifth Avenue on St. Patrick's Day.
<P>
	   "We're disappointed, very disappointed with the verdict," said ILGO lawyer
Steven Rawlings after a federal jury in Manhattan ruled Thursday that the city
hadn't violated its First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Waters, a lawyer for the city, said she was "very, very, very
happy" with the verdict, which she said vindicates a city policy not to allow
two groups to march in the same place on the same day.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the city would continue to offer ILGO alternative ways to protest
its exclusion from the St. Patrick's Day parade, including marching on streets
other than Fifth Avenue on the holiday itself.
</P>
<P>
	   The verdict, she added, was vindication for the city because it showed the
city was not violating anyone's First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ILGO had tried to prove during the three-week trial that the city
unconstitutionally blocked the group from marching on Fifth Avenue on St.
Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   If the jury had ruled the other way, the trial resulting from the 1996
lawsuit could have led to monetary damages against the city and an order
requiring parade organizers to permit the group to march.
</P>
<P>
	   After the verdict, U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl urged both sides to
negotiate the issues before another federal judge, but the city and the Ancient
Order of Hibernians said there was little chance of that.
</P>
<P>
	   Ernest L. Matthews Jr., a lawyer for the Ancient Order of Hibernians, said
the parade organizers he represented believe their First Amendment rights were
protected by the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   He had told jurors that the parade had policies which disallowed groups
marching if they took positions contrary to those of the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
	   He said groups also were not permitted to use the parade to cause
confrontation or for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Protestants and Jews may march. People who hate the church may march, but
not as a group," Matthews had said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the verdict, Matthews said the parade organizers would be pleased.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time we've gone to court, we've won every case," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   One juror, Andrew Gardner, said outside court afterwards that the
nine-person jury agreed that ILGO was in a sympathetic position and deserved to
get its message out but the law did not allow the jury to conclude its rights
had been violated.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would have liked to find a way to help everybody with this, including
finding ILGO some comfort, but that wasn't my job," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gardner said the jury found that witnesses called by ILGO during the trial
were honest but that some city witnesses were coloring their testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   "I certainly thought some of the witnesses seemed to have an evolving story
or seemed to be spending more time trying to stick it to the other side than
stick to the truth," he said of some city witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the jury verdict, the dispute that began in 1991 when ILGO first
lobbied to join the parade was likely to continue, lawyers in the case agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard McKewen, ILGO's treasurer, said the group will continue to stage
protests on parade day.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll be there every year until we're able to get what we deserve," he
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Seeks Probe on Cyanide Spill  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BANDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- The European Union's senior environmental official
has called for an international task force to investigate a cyanide spill that
contaminated two major Balkan rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   EU Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstroem said in Budapest Thursday she
wanted a commission set up ``within a few weeks'' to assess the extent of
contamination from the spill and to prevent similar accidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallstroem also announced that her office would begin an inventory next week
of other potential European ecological time bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   Tons of cyanide poured into Romania's Lapus River on Jan. 30 from a
containment dam at gold mine. The poison passed through Hungary and Yugoslavia
via the Szamos and Tisza rivers before returning to Romania on the Danube.
</P>
<P>
	   Cyanide is used to separate gold ore from the surrounding rock.
</P>
<P>
	   Angry farmers near the spill site at a gold mine close to Baia Mare,
Romania, told Wallstroem on Thursday of earlier spills that they knew nothing
about until they found livestock dead or blinded.
</P>
<P>
	   Romania's environment minister acknowledged for the first time the magnitude
of the pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We regret the unfortunate accident that neither Aurul SA nor Romania
wanted,'' said Environment Minister Romica Tomescu, referring to the gold-mining
company responsible for the pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Romania did not ever want to hide or play down the magnitude of the
accident,'' said Tomescu, addressing reporters in Szolnok, Hungary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Romania did not ever want to hide or play down the magnitude of the
accident,'' Tomescu said, addressing reporters in Szolnok, Hungary.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vienna, Austria, Philip Weller, director of the World Wildlife Fund's
Danube Carpathian Program, described the spill as ``clearly one of the major
river disasters that has happened in Europe in the last decade.''
</P>
<P>
	   He compared it to the 1987 spill of tons of agricultural chemicals into the
Rhine at Basel, Switzerland, after fire damaged a chemical warehouse owned by
Sandoz AG.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, environmentalists said it might take a decade for the Rhine to
fully recover. Wallstroem on Thursday told reporters that the impact of the
cyanide spill may first ``come in 20 or 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   International officials say preliminary findings indicate that about 100
tons of cyanide escaped, along with tons of toxic heavy metals.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungarian Environment Minister Pal Pepo said Thursday the spill was ``the
biggest accident in the history of Hungary.'' He said that rehabilitation of the
rivers might take up to ten years.
</P>
<P>
	   His statement was challenged by Petre Marinescu, who heads the Romanian
state water company. Marinescu said the fish had died not because of the cyanide
concentration in the water but because of substances used afterward to
neutralize the chemical.
</P>
<P>
	   A joint commission of experts from both countries is currently investigating
the cause of the spill.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Health Organization earlier expressed concern that heavy metals
such as lead and cadmium also might have escaped into the water, potentially
posing a far greater health threat.
</P>
<P>
	   In Yugoslavia, ecologists warned of long-term food poisoning, not only
through the cyanide but also because of dangerous concentrations of lead and
other toxic metals that have already killed tons of fish in the contaminated
Danube and Tisza rivers.

<HEADLINE> Ex-bank employee pleads innocent in Russia probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A former Bank of New York employee has pleaded innocent
to charges she lied in connection with the government's probe of money
laundering by Russians through the bank's accounts.
<P>
	   Svetlana Kudryavtsev entered the plea Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, where her former boss at the Bank of New York named her a day earlier
as someone who had aided the massive money laundering scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev's lawyer, Charles D. Adler, declined to comment after the brief
appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Douglas F. Eaton.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Lucy Edwards, the bank's former vice president in the Eastern
European Division, and her husband, Peter Berlin, pleaded guilty to money
laundering charges, admitting they helped Russian bankers funnel more than $7
billion through the accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said she started the scheme to help launder money after she was
approached by Russian bankers in late 1995. She said she was transferred to
London in 1996 and began paying Kudryavtsev $500 monthly to continue to look
after the money laundering accounts in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "She received these payments from us in return for serving as a point of
contact at the Bank of New York in the event there were problems with transfers
and to send my husband account statements so that he could calculate commissions
we were owed," Edwards said during her plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev was an associate in the bank's Eastern European division in
August when she was questioned by the FBI as it investigated several bank
accounts, according to a criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   She was later fired as it became publicly known that the Russians allegedly
illegally washed billions of dollars through the Bank of New York, the nation's
15th-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev remained free on $30,000 bail after Thursday's court appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege that Kudryavtsev lied about whether she or her husband
had ever received any money or loans from Edwards or Berlin.

<HEADLINE> EU Seeks Probe of Cyanide Spill  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BANDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- The European Union's senior environmental official
has called for an international task force to investigate a cyanide spill that
contaminated two major Balkan rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   EU Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstroem said in Budapest Thursday she
wanted a commission set up ``within a few weeks'' to assess the extent of
contamination from the spill and to prevent similar accidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallstroem also announced that her office would begin an inventory next week
of other potential European ecological time bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   Tons of cyanide poured into Romania's Lapus River on Jan. 30 from a
containment dam at gold mine. The poison passed through Hungary and Yugoslavia
via the Szamos and Tisza rivers before returning to Romania on the Danube.
</P>
<P>
	   Cyanide is used to separate gold ore from the surrounding rock.
</P>
<P>
	   Angry farmers near the spill site at a gold mine close to Baia Mare,
Romania, told Wallstroem on Thursday of earlier spills that they knew nothing
about until they found livestock dead or blinded.
</P>
<P>
	   Romania's environment minister acknowledged for the first time the magnitude
of the pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We regret the unfortunate accident that neither Aurul SA nor Romania
wanted,'' said Environment Minister Romica Tomescu, referring to the gold-mining
company responsible for the pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Romania did not ever want to hide or play down the magnitude of the
accident,'' said Tomescu, addressing reporters in Szolnok, Hungary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Romania did not ever want to hide or play down the magnitude of the
accident,'' Tomescu said, addressing reporters in Szolnok, Hungary.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vienna, Austria, Philip Weller, director of the World Wildlife Fund's
Danube Carpathian Program, described the spill as ``clearly one of the major
river disasters that has happened in Europe in the last decade.''
</P>
<P>
	   He compared it to the 1987 spill of tons of agricultural chemicals into the
Rhine at Basel, Switzerland, after fire damaged a chemical warehouse owned by
Sandoz AG.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, environmentalists said it might take a decade for the Rhine to
fully recover. Wallstroem on Thursday told reporters that the impact of the
cyanide spill may first ``come in 20 or 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   International officials say preliminary findings indicate that about 100
tons of cyanide escaped, along with tons of toxic heavy metals.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungarian Environment Minister Pal Pepo said Thursday the spill was ``the
biggest accident in the history of Hungary.'' He said that rehabilitation of the
rivers might take up to ten years.
</P>
<P>
	   His statement was challenged by Petre Marinescu, who heads the Romanian
state water company. Marinescu said the fish had died not because of the cyanide
concentration in the water but because of substances used afterward to
neutralize the chemical.
</P>
<P>
	   A joint commission of experts from both countries is currently investigating
the cause of the spill.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Health Organization earlier expressed concern that heavy metals
such as lead and cadmium also might have escaped into the water, potentially
posing a far greater health threat.
</P>
<P>
	   In Yugoslavia, ecologists warned of long-term food poisoning, not only
through the cyanide but also because of dangerous concentrations of lead and
other toxic metals that have already killed tons of fish in the contaminated
Danube and Tisza rivers.

	   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official with "secret" security clearance
was arrested Thursday and charged with spying for the Cuban government, the FBI
said. Mariano Faget, 54, was being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami
and was to appear in court Friday, the FBI said in a statement. Faget, a native
of Havana, is employed at the Immigration and Naturalization Service as a
supervisory district adjudication officer. He held a "secret" security clearance

Flaw Found in Mars Lander's Design

<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A flaw in the design of NASA's Mars Polar Lander
could have caused its engines to cut off prematurely while the $165 million
spacecraft was descending to the surface, engineers said Thursday. The glitch is
the latest of several possibilities under investigation into why the spacecraft
has not made contact since Dec. 3, when it was to have gently landed to begin a
90-day mission to study Mars' climate history. Other scenarios include the
possibility that the spacecraft landed on the steep side of a canyon and toppled
over, or that its radios broke down. It was not known if any have been ruled
out.

<HEADLINE> Judge finalizes jury instructions in Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A jury could opt to acquit four police officers
accused of murdering Amadou Diallo if it believes the defendants thought they
were arresting a dangerous criminal - even though Diallo was unarmed.
<P>
	   Siding with the defense at a hearing Thursday, Supreme Court Justice Joseph
Teresi said he would instruct jurors in the officers' trial that they can find
the shooting was justified under penal codes governing police. State law says
officers can use force against anyone they "reasonably believe" is committing a
crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors had tried to convince Teresi that the evidence showed the
defendants had tried to "stop and frisk" an innocent man - not make an arrest -
and therefore had forfeited the law's usual "justification" protections for
police.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Richard Murphy, 27, Sean Carroll, 37, and Edward McMellon,
27, have pleaded innocent to charges of intentional and depraved indifference
murder in the slaying of the West African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Teresi also granted a prosecution request - unopposed by the
defense - to allow jurors to consider second-degree manslaughter and criminally
negligent homicide as alternatives when they begin deliberating next week. Those
charges do not mandate jail time.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi ruled from the bench without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys have said they wanted to give the jury a wide range of options in
the racially charged case. But both sides appeared to be hedging their bets -
the prosecution against exoneration of defendants in a high-profile case, the
defense against harsh prison terms for their clients.
</P>
<P>
	   The second-degree murder charges brought by a Bronx grand jury last year
carry a minimum 15-year sentence, and a maximum of 25 years to life. The
officers had refused to cooperate with the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying for the first time earlier this week, the defendants claimed they
fired 41 bullets at Diallo on Feb. 4, 1999, because the 22-year-old Diallo
refused to stop for questioning, retreated into the vestibule of his Bronx
building and pulled out what appeared to be a gun. He was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were in plain clothes searching for armed suspects. The object
Diallo pulled turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution contends the officers never yelled any warnings before
wantonly cornering Diallo with a "wall of lead." Backed by autopsy findings,
prosecutors also say most of the bullets hit Diallo while he was going down or
flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   With the ruling on lesser charges, the jury must weigh all the charges for
each defendant. A verdict clearing some of the officers and convicting others is
possible.

<HEADLINE> New Pest Research Holds Promise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- New research shows that a beneficial fungus that ravages
sugar beet root maggots could give farmers a new, natural defense against the
pest.
</P>
<P>
	   While it's less than a half-an-inch long, the maggot's assaults on sugar
beet crops cost growers millions of dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to 38 percent of Americas sucrose for condiments, baked goods, and other
products comes from the 1.5-million-acre sugar beet crop.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly half is treated with granular insecticides like chlorpyrifos to kill
root maggots, offspring of the fly species Tetanops myopaeformis.
</P>
<P>
	   As they feed, maggots badly scar sugar beet roots, causing yield losses of
10 percent to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, a new species of fungus -- Syngliocladium tetanopsis -- may help curb
the pest's sweet tooth.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Wozniak discovered the fungus in 1994 and in September received a U.S.
patent.
</P>
<P>
	   His laboratory and field studies at the U.S. Agricultural Research Service
indicate Syngliocladiums spores can be sprayed or "seeded" into soils as a
biological pesticide. Dormant until a maggot makes contact, the missile-shaped
spores bore into their hosts body to germinate, destroying organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
	   In lab experiments this killed nearly all exposed, newly hatched maggots in
three to five days. Up to 96 percent of older, final-stage maggots died after
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet scientists didn't observe a similar fate in non-host insects, including
beneficial lady bugs and lace wings or pests like Colorado potato beetles.
</P>
<P>
	   Wozniaks chief colleague is Ann Smigocki, at ARS' Molecular Plant Pathology
Lab in Beltsville, Md. ARS is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's principal
research arm.
</P>
<P>
	   Wozniak, now at EPA's Biopesticide and Pollution Prevention Division,
continues collaborating with Smigocki.
</P>
<P>
	   They're seeking a commercial partner to help develop the fungus into a
biopesticide product that growers can use as an alternative to conventional
insecticides.
</P>
<P>
	   Coated onto beet seed, for example, it could be applied to soils where
maggot-killing chemicals can harm non-target insects, or endanger groundwater.
</P>
<P>
	   Use of the fungus, which doesn't infect plants, could also spare seedlings
from phytotoxic harm caused by some insecticides.

<HEADLINE> Employee says missing boss had no intention of selling her home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Irene Silverman thought Kenneth Kimes was "a low-class
jerk" who "smelled like jail," an employee of Silverman's testified at the trial
where Kimes and his mother are accused of murdering the 82-year-old widow.
<P>
	   Mengistu Melesse, who was Silverman's maintenance man, testified Thursday
that his boss vowed that her luxurious Upper East Side home would be sold only
"over my dead body."
</P>
<P>
	   Silverman, who is missing and presumed dead, planned to leave the six-story
mansion to a foundation she established in memory of her mother, Melesse said.
</P>
<P>
	   Melesse's testimony was presented to rebut claims by ex-convict scam artist
Sante Kimes, 65, and her son, Kenneth, 24, that Silverman was a friend of theirs
who had sold her home to them for a fraction of its value.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kimeses are on trial in Manhattan's State Supreme Court, charged with
second-degree murder, conspiracy, robbery, forgery and other charges.
Silverman's body has never been found.
</P>
<P>
	   In opening remarks, Assistant District Attorney Consuelo Fernandez told the
jury that Silverman is dead because the Kimeses "killed her out of simple,
ordinary greed. They wanted Irene Silverman's townhouse."
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Assistant District Attorney Ann Donnelly asked Melesse whether
Silverman was ever interested in selling the mansion.
</P>
<P>
	   "She would never sell her home," Melesse said. "She said 'over my dead
body."'
</P>
<P>
	   Melesse, who began working as Silverman's maintenance man in 1992, said his
boss immediately disliked Kenneth Kimes, whom she knew as "Manny Guerrin."
</P>
<P>
	   "He smells like jail," Melesse quoted Silverman as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   The witness said he and Silverman, while watching the monitor from the
security camera, sometimes saw the Kimeses enter the house.
</P>
<P>
	   When Kenneth Kimes came in alone, Melesse said, "He slid against the wall.
He looked like he was hiding himself from the camera. Every time, he comes in
like that."
</P>
<P>
	   "Mrs. Silverman looked at him," said Melesse, a 32-year-old Ethiopian who
speaks in moderately accented but fluent English. "She said, 'Low-class jerk."'
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Muniz, one of the defense lawyers, objected to Melesse's testimony as
hearsay.
</P>
<P>
	   Donnelly told Justice Rena Uviller that Melesse's testimony was necessary
because, "It demonstrates that she wasn't selling her house to him and she
wasn't leaving it voluntarily."
</P>
<P>
	   Uviller said she would let jurors hear the testimony so they could
understand Silverman's state of mind about the Kimeses.
</P>
<P>
	   When they were arrested July 5, 1998, the last day Silverman was seen alive,
the Kimeses had the woman's house keys, her personal documents, and a forged
deed that purported to transfer her mansion to them for $395,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Melesse said Silverman kept documents about her mother and her late husband,
Sam, and her Radio City memorabilia locked in her office, just off her bedroom,
and no one was allowed in there.
</P>
<P>
	   Silverman always signed with a felt-tipped pen, not a hard ball-point of the
type used on the allegedly fake deed the Kimeses had, Melesse said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested the Kimeses on a Utah warrant that alleged they had paid for
a Lincoln Town Car with a bogus $14,000 check. It was not until two days later
that police connected the pair to Silverman.

<HEADLINE> NRC, Con Ed defend actions leading up to Indian Point 2 leak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) - The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is defending its
decision to postpone an inspection at the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant where a
radioactive steam leak occurred this week.
<P>
	   Westchester County executive Andrew Spano said Thursday that the leak raises
"a much broader issue as to the competency of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the commission had put off an inspection of the plant's steam
generators from June 1999 to June 2000 despite its own doubts about the
reliability of the type of pipes used in the generator.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday night, a leak at the plant in Buchanan resulted in the brief
release of slightly radioactive steam into the air. There were no injuries and
officials said no increase in environmental radiation was detected. But it was
the worst accident in the plant's 26 years.
</P>
<P>
	   NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan said Consolidated Edison, which owns and operates
the plant, requested the inspection delay because the plant had been out of
commission for 10 months, "during which there would have been no degradation."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the September document Spano referred to was a "technical issues
paper" which noted the potential of radioactivity escaping if a pipe bursts
while a plant is operating.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would not have allowed Indian Point 2 to continue to operate if we felt
it would put the public or plant workers in any sort of jeopardy," Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spano demanded a meeting with the NRC and said none of the Indian Point
plants should be sold until he is "satisfied with the NRC's oversight ability."
Con Ed has acknowledged interest in selling Indian Point 2 and the state Power
Authority has already reached a tentative agreement to sell Indian Point 3 to
Entergy Corp. of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   On another safety issue, Con Ed and the NRC said a slight increase in the
amount of leakage from the generator in recent weeks was not a signal that
Tuesday's major leak was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheehan said leakage of up to 432 gallons a day was allowable, and Indian
Point 2 had been leaking only about 3 gallons just before the accident. "They
were not close to their allowable limits," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Based on our past experience, nobody would have had reason to believe that
this was suddenly going to go from three gallons a day up to 57 gallons a
minute," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside Indian Point, meanwhile, demonstrators demanded that the reactor
stay closed permanently. About 40 protesters, organized by the Westchester
People's Action Coalition, held signs saying, "Make Westchester a Nuclear-Free
Zone."
</P>
<P>
	   They said the plant is unsafe and should not be reopened; if it is, Con Ed
should replace the steam generators and distribute potassium iodide tablets to
counter the effects of radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   And Johnny Rip's, a neighborhood tavern, offered the special of the day:
"nuclear-fried chicken."
</P>
<P>
	   Bartender Luann Hatzmann said the special was really the bar's usual
honey-dipped chicken, but "the owner had a sense of humor this morning."

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Tokyo Stocks Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen Friday afternoon on
expectations that Moody's Investors Service will downgrade Japanese government
bonds. Tokyo stocks closed slightly lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 110.92 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market at
3 p.m. (0600 GMT), up 0.78 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its
late New York level of 110.59 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, fell 2.37 points, or 0.01
percent, to finish at 19,789.03. On Thursday, the average closed up 192.22
points, or 0.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar rose on growing sentiment that Moody's will
downgrade yen-denominated bonds issued or guaranteed by the Japanese government.
The U.S. ratings agency said Thursday it will review Japan's credit rating for
possible downgrade within three months.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, U.S. funds sold the yen, pushing the dollar as high as 110.97
yen, its highest in five-months, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The dollar-bullish sentiment is strengthening," said Shuji Takano,
assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The greenback was also supported by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments
Thursday that a dearth of workers may force employers to offer higher wages,
leading to higher prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said they interpreted the remarks, which Greenspan made in
congressional testimony, as a sign that the Fed would consider raising interest
rates to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates tend to make a nation's currency more attractive to
investors because interest-bearing securities yield higher returns.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.66 yen, up from 108.73 yen
late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, traders said prices fell because some companies have
started to sell shares in their affiliated companies to book profits ahead of
the end of the fiscal year on March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was estimated at 668
million shares, down from 763 million shares Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 699 to 524, while 139 issues were
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.84 points, or 0.4
percent, to 10,514.57 at Thursday's close. The technology-rich Nasdaq composite
index rose 121.25, or 2.5 percent, at 4,548.90, surpassing its record close of
4,485.63, set a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section rose 2.66 points, or 0.15 percent, to close at 1,719.77. The TOPIX
closed up 25.99 points, or 1.54 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8250
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8500 percent. Its price rose 0.21 point to
98.93.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Residents Launch Petition  </HEADLINE>
   By ERICA WERNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the shadow of the world-famous Hollywood sign, what
used to be seen as divine is now viewed by some as just another dive.
</P>
<P>
	   Posh eateries that once lined streets like Hollywood Boulevard have been
replaced by seedy check-cashing joints, tattoo parlors, fast-food outlets and
junky souvenir stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Many residents believe Hollywood might stop falling down around them if it
had its own city government looking out for its 160,000 residents, instead of
one that is answerable to 3.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the residents who want to revive the glamor and glitz of Tinseltown's
glory days have launched a petition drive to do just that. This week, they
kicked off their campaign to secede from sprawling Los Angeles and incorporate
as their own city.
</P>
<P>
	   Doing so could be a touchy matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Petition supporters want to take the world-famous hilltop sign with them,
along with the other icons that make Hollywood Hollywood -- from Mann's Chinese
Theater to the star-studded Walk of Fame to celebrities like Nicholas Cage and
Lorenzo Lamas who call the place home.
</P>
<P>
	   The sign could present a challenge because it's part of a Los Angeles public
park.
</P>
<P>
	   Other local fixtures can't wait to turn their backs on scandal-ridden Los
Angeles and strike out on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Take longtime resident Cassandra Peterson, better known to TV horror-movie
aficionados as ``Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've actually wanted this forever,'' she said recently. ``Millions of
people come here every year to see Hollywood, and when you get here there's
nothing here. It's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the leaders of Hollywood VOTE -- Voters Organized Toward
Empowerment -- held a secession kickoff drive at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel,
site of the first Academy Awards in 1928.
</P>
<P>
	   The first petition signature was that of Johnny Grant, Hollywood's honorary
mayor by decree of the Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   Separatist leaders have six months to gather some 15,000 signatures,
representing 25 percent of the registered voters in the area under
consideration. By Thursday morning, VOTE President Fares Wehbe said he already
had 1,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   If the required signatures are collected, Los Angeles County's Local Agency
Formation Commission would undertake a feasibility study, and if results show no
negative impact for either Los Angeles or Hollywood, the issue could be placed
on the ballot as soon as 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood was founded in 1887 by a real estate developer. The community was
incorporated as a city in 1903, then was annexed to Los Angeles in 1910.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles officials have vowed to keep the entertainment center of
Southern California within the boundaries of what is now the nation's
second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Larry Calemine, the commission's executive officer, the last
time a local community seceded from its parent city was 107 years ago, when
Coronado broke away from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   The process is so complicated, he said, that the feasibility study alone is
``a Donald Trump divorce to the 10th power.''
</P>
<P>
	   But supporters are determined that cityhood would help them reawaken the
magic of old Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, tourists and locals milling about outside Mann's Chinese
Theater, where for decades celebrities have left their footprints and handprints
in cement, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Many said they would welcome more grandeur, and fewer T-shirt shops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This walk of fame, for example,'' said Theo Ligthart, 50, who was visiting
from Amsterdam. ``You hear so much about it, but it's very simple. It's nothing,
in effect.''

<HEADLINE> Family speaks out after report clears officer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The family of Aquan Salmon says a racist judicial
system led to the decision that cleared a Hartford police officer in the
shooting death of the 14-year-old.
<P>
	   In a news conference Thursday that only black reporters were invited to
attend, Norma Watts, 71, said she believes officer Robert Allan should be in
jail for killing her grandson.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I did it, I would never see the streets again," she said. "He never
spent one day in jail. We are the ones suffering."
</P>
<P>
	   The news conference was the family's first since special prosecutor Kevin
Kane issued a 200-page report Wednesday that concluded the shooting was
justified.
</P>
<P>
	   Allan shot Salmon early in the morning of April 13 after several teen-agers,
one carrying a lighter shaped like a gun, fled from a car police had been
chasing through the city's north end.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the special prosecutor's report, Salmon had reached toward his
waistband and was turning toward Allan when the officer fired one shot into the
left side of his back.
</P>
<P>
	   "A part of each of us died with him," the grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts said she, along with Minister Naeem Muhammad, of Hartford, plan to
organize the families of others killed by police in Connecticut since 1997,
including Malik Jones, Franklyn Reid, Hector Colon, Jeffrey Grant, Darrell
Holeman and Victoria Cooper.
</P>
<P>
	   Once they are together, Muhammad said he will attempt to force the state
Legislature to change a system that harbors police officers who say they shoot
to kill out of fear for their own lives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fear is not reason to shoot and kill. Why would Allan fear for his life?
Aquan didn't have a gun," Muhammad said. "We need psychologists to look into why
so many officers, statewide and nationally, use statements of fear to justify
killing."
</P>
<P>
	   The family also plans to file a wrongful death lawsuit against Allan.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts did not say what her grandson was doing out after 2 a.m. on a school
night in a car that had been linked to several robberies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regardless to him out on the street, when he'd sneak out of the house, it
didn't give that man no right. He didn't deserve to die," Watts said.

<HEADLINE> Relatives ask lawmakers to bring prisoners back home to  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut residents whose incarcerated
relatives have been transferred to a remote Virginia prison are begging
lawmakers to bring those prisoners back home.
<P>
	   A noisy group, composed of prisoners' friends and family members, gathered
at the state Capitol on Thursday to make their case. They said the 480
Connecticut inmates sent to Wallens Ridge State Prison in Big Stone Gap, Va.,
have been physically and mentally abused, and need to be closer to their
families.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting came as the Rowland Administration asked the Legislature to
allow up to 1,000 inmates to be shipped out of state.
</P>
<P>
	   The current limit is 500, and with a growing prison population, Connecticut
has sent 480 inmates to Wallens Ridge over the past four months.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration says transferring inmates out of state can save money
because the per-inmate cost is cheaper at Wallens Ridge prison than in
Connecticut. The transfers also allow the state to manage the size of the inmate
population while weeding out troublesome prisoners, Rowland says.
</P>
<P>
	   Speakers at Thursday's "speak out" said their relatives should pay for their
crimes, but also should be treated humanely. And some said their loved ones are
there for relatively minor crimes and haven't been troublesome prisoners but
were still transferred to the maximum-security prison in the heart of the
Appalachian Mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   About 75 friends and family members took part in the forum. They reacted
angrily when State Rep. Robert Farr, R-West Hartford, said Wallens Ridge was
well run and that said some inmates had told him they preferred being confined
there than in Connecticut prisons.
</P>
<P>
	   Eleven-year-old Dominic Hernandez was among those who spoke. He stood on a
chair, stretched to reach a microphone and pleaded for Connecticut officials to
bring his dad back from a remote Virginia prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hartford boy said he and his 6-year-old sister want their father, a
convicted robber, to be closer to home so they can visit and get "special
sleepover visits."
</P>
<P>
	   "Not only am I asking you, I am begging you to please bring our dad back,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others alleged that their relatives have been beaten and in other ways
abused at Wallens Ridge. They noted that New Mexico authorities have called for
an FBI investigation into charges that inmates from that state were abused at
Wallens Ridge, a so-called "supermax" prison for dangerous criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Farr was among several Connecticut lawmakers who visited Wallens Ridge, and
talked to Connecticut inmates there. He said none of the inmates told him of
being abused, and their major complaints seemed to be lack of programs and
visits from family members.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipping inmates to Virginia has also made it safer in Connecticut prisons
by easing overcrowded conditions, Farr said. And he noted the per-inmate cost is
cheaper in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Dean Pagani, a spokesman for the governor, said everyone feels bad about
family separations caused by imprisonment. "But people in prison made a decision
to commit a crime," Pagani said. "And when you go to prison, you lose a lot of
rights that you have as a member of a free society. Keep in mind that inmates
are paying a debt to society."

FBI's Internet Cases Quadruple
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internet attacks originally aimed at e-commerce sites
are continuing this week and even cropping up abroad, so federal investigators
are looking into whether copycats are targeting less well-known Web sites. Newly
opened FBI computer-hacking investigations have quadrupled since the first
attack at Yahoo! on Feb. 7. Some attacks, not noticed by the public and not
identified by the FBI, have continued into this week, and no one knows if they
have ended, FBI spokeswoman Debbie Weierman said Thursday. And attacks have
cropped up abroad, said one federal investigator, who requested anonymity.

U.S. Immigration Official Charged With Spying
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official with "secret" security clearance
was arrested Thursday and charged with spying for the Cuban government, the FBI
said. Mariano Faget, 54, was being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami
and was to appear in court Friday, the FBI said in a statement. Faget, a native
of Havana, is employed at the Immigration and Naturalization Service as a
supervisory district adjudication officer. He held a "secret" security clearance
and was responsible for supervising decisions that affected immigrants and
people seeking political asylum, the FBI said.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- The European Union's senior environmental official
has called for an international task force to investigate a cyanide spill that
contaminated two major Balkan rivers. EU Environment Commissioner Margot
Wallstroem said in Budapest Thursday she wanted a commission set up "within a
few weeks" to assess the extent of contamination from the spill and to prevent
similar accidents in the future. Wallstroem also announced that her office would
begin an inventory next week of other potential European ecological time bombs.

China, U.S. Meet on Security
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- China and the United States have made progress in resumed
discussions on strategic security concerns, including Taiwan, a senior U.S.
envoy said Friday as he prepared to wrap up the two-day talks. U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was meeting again Friday morning with Chinese
Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. Earlier this week, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao said China planned to raise its concerns about U.S. weapons sales to
Taiwan. Beijing is worried that U.S. support for Taiwan will counter China's
growing arsenal of missiles, making it easier for the island to resist Chinese
overtures for reunification.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain fares better than Gov. George W. Bush

Bush campaign's claim that their man is the Republican most likely to win the
presidential election. McCain led Gore by 49 percent to 41 percent in the
hypothetical matchup in the poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the

6 Tons of Cocaine Seized in Pacific
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In one of the largest single Colombian cocaine
seizures, an American naval ship intercepted a fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean
laden with six tons of cocaine, officials said Thursday. Colombian Navy chief
Adm. Sergio Garcia said the Colombian-flagged vessel named "Rebel" was seized in
international waters yesterday, 1,530 miles northwest of the country's port of
Buenaventura. The 66-foot vessel and its seven-member Colombian crew left the
port on Jan. 22 with cocaine stashed in the boat's fuel compartment, Garcia
said.

<HEADLINE> Issues by the Half Dozen  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fury of the campaign to win South Carolina's
Republican presidential primary is casting the positions of Gov. George W. Bush
and Sen. John McCain in sharper relief, turning differences into a seemingly
great divide.
</P>
<P>
	   Here is how Bush, McCain and Alan Keyes compare on a half dozen issues:
</P>
<P>
	   ABORTION: McCain and Bush both say abortion should be illegal except in
cases of rape, incest or to save the woman's life. Yet, both say there's not
enough support now to pass a constitutional amendment banning abortion, and
neither has committed explicitly to making anti-abortion views a prerequisite
for federal judges or a vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Only McCain supports amending the Republican Party platform to spell out the
exceptions they both believe in. Bush supports the platform language, although
he said earlier that ``I support the goal of a Human Life Amendment with
exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes' campaign is underpinned by his beliefs against abortion. He says
induced abortion is immoral in all cases.
</P>
<P>
	   CAMPAIGN FINANCE: With Bush delving a little deeper into campaign finances,
the chief differences between him and McCain on the issue are narrower now, but
still significant.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator would ban all soft money -- the unlimited and unregulated
donations to parties -- while the governor would prohibit it from corporations
and unions, but not from individuals. As well, unlike McCain, Bush would
preserve the right of advocacy groups to run ``issue ads'' during campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes has said he would support a ban on soft money but also has expressed
concern about any infringement on political expression.
</P>
<P>
	   DEFENSE: Bush and McCain both have proposed spending at least $1 billion
more a year to raise military salaries beyond a recent pay increase. Bush wants
an aggressive program of weapons research and development, while McCain has
outlined some $4 billion in proposed savings by closing more bases. He's also
identified what he considers unneeded weapons systems, including the B-2 bomber.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men support the current ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the
military; Keyes would ban them from serving. All three support development of a
national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
	   EDUCATION: The GOP candidates all say more education decisions should be
made locally but have different ways of going about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has laid out a detailed plan to improve public education through use of
federal financial incentives and penalties. He'd set minimum national standards
for state tests of pupils and link federal education money to how well states
perform in raising student achievement.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain proposes to send block grants to schools ``with no bureaucratic
strings attached.'' He'd also offer $500 million a year for teacher merit pay in
return for matching state grants. Although he, too, speaks of the need to
measure student performance, he hasn't explained how he can achieve that kind of
accountability when he would give schools no-strings grants.
</P>
<P>
	   All three support using federal aid to help send poorly served pupils to
schools of their parents' choice, including private schools, although the
details of their plans differ.
</P>
<P>
	   FOREIGN POLICY: McCain says he'd support, in some fashion, forces trying to
overthrow regimes in ``rogue states'' such as Iraq and North Korea. He'd also
``use our primacy in world affairs for humanity's benefit.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, too, counsels against isolationism but has emphasized more than McCain
that the United States should intervene in conflicts when it is in the nation's
direct interest to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   In a debate Tuesday, for example, McCain indicated he would commit U.S.
forces to try to prevent a genocide such as the one in Rwanda in 1994; Bush
indicated that would not meet his benchmark for intervention. Keyes says even
humanitarian intervention can backfire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain are ardent supporters of freer trade and agree China should
be let into the World Trade Organization. Keyes disagrees.
</P>
<P>
	   TAXES: Bush proposes a package of tax cuts double the size offered by
McCain, who wants to use more of the projected federal budget surpluses to shore
up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's plan would eventually cut income taxes for most people, bringing the
highest bracket down to 33 percent and the lowest to 10 percent. McCain would
keep the lowest bracket at 15 percent but let couples with taxable income of up
to $70,000 qualify for that rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush pays for his plan by tapping into the portion of the budget surplus not
devoted to Social Security. McCain dips into the non-Social Security surplus,
too, but not as deeply. He pays for part of his plan by ending an assortment of
tax breaks, which he calls corporate loopholes. Keyes wants to replace the
income tax with a national sales tax.

<HEADLINE> Clinton criticizes Giuliani's garden blitz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's decision to bulldoze a community garden but he dismissed her comments
as being overtly political.
<P>
	   "The mayor seems to think that you bulldoze first and ask questions later
and I don't think you can bulldoze your way in the Senate," Clinton said
Thursday. "I don't think you can take that kind of attitude and be effective in
the Senate."
</P>
<P>
	   When asked at a news conference about Clinton's comment, Giuliani laughed.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't see through that one? I can. Move on to a serious subject rather
than a political game," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Esperanza Garden in Manhattan's East Village was bulldozed Tuesday to
make way for low-income housing. Police arrested 31 people who had tried to
block the demolition.
</P>
<P>
	   NY1 News reported Thursday night that the purchaser of the lot, BFC
Construction, is a financial supporter of Giuliani. BFC's executives - including
Don Capoccia - contributed more than $33,000 to the mayor's re-election fund,
his Senate campaign and his political action committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said there was "no quid pro quo here.
The only quid pro quo is that they share the same ideas. Don Capoccia is a
fiscal conservative and a social moderate."
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer had requested an injunction in state
court to protect all the city's community gardens, but the lot was bulldozed
before a judge could rule.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm also concerned that the destruction of the garden went on while the
attorney general was in court seeking an injunction which the mayor's office
knew was being sought," Clinton said. She said his actions suggest "a continuing
disregard for the legal process."
</P>
<P>
	   Later Thursday, Clinton attended a fund-raiser for the Working Families
Party, whose endorsement she is seeking and is likely to get. The party, a new
progressive political group, only has a few thousand registered members. Its
endorsement would provide Clinton with a line on the ballot besides the
Democrats, possibly drawing votes from people disillusioned by the major
parties.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last gubernatorial election, 51,500 people voted for Peter Vallone -
who lost to Gov. George Pataki - on the Working Families Party line. Working
Families Party officials believe they could garner several hundred thousand
votes - many of them union members - on their line in November, which could make
a substantial difference in a close race.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the polls we're seeing Hillary Clinton is weak with white males,
upstaters and suburbanites," said Jimmy Duncan, a leader of the Working Families
Party and the United Auto Workers. "We feel we can bring her some of those
votes. We're finding that a lot of our people are not signing up with the
Democratic Party or the Republican Party, particularly young people."

<HEADLINE> McCain Seeks To Energize Base  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HILTON HEAD, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain sought to broaden and energize his
base in hopes of countering rival George W. Bush's massive turnout effort, again
bashing a Bush campaign so negative it's ``low comedy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush countered that McCain was the candidate on the attack, and said key
Republicans have concluded Bush is the one who can carry out the GOP agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   On the eve of a South Carolina primary that's too close to call, both
candidates were beginning to focus on the mechanics of getting voters to the
polls on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush assembled a major effort. McCain's approach, while more modest, was
aimed at a broader base. McCain was the one needing the larger turnout because
he's broadened his appeal to independents and Democrats, while Bush's strength
is in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was invoking the name of another GOP president in charting his
tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the old Reagan coalition, what we used to call Reagan Democrats,''
the Arizona senator said. ``I think that's one of the question marks in this
election. How many Democrats will turn out.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the stump, McCain was hammering Bush for running a relentlessly negative
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a certain amount of desperation coming out of the Bush
campaign,'' McCain said. ``They've unleashed the dogs of war.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was graphic evidence of the air war at work. McCain was using his
cellular phone to call radio talk shows and raised his eyebrows during one
commercial break.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've just heard two attack ads during the break,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, for his part, continued waving a McCain campaign flyer he said was an
attack that violated McCain's positive campaign pledge, arguing McCain was
riding his ``high horse'' down a ``low road.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm saying this is a man who says one thing and does another,'' the Texas
governor said, drawing a frosty retort from McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems to me that the governor really doesn't care for losing,'' McCain
countered, pointing to polls showing him in a dead heat. ``Two weeks ago we were
20 points down in this race.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush changed his tune as the day wore on to suggest that his ties to
establishment Republicans meant he would be effective as president. He noted
that 38 senators have endorsed him, compared with four for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are asking that question, who can lead America?'' Bush said. ``Which
one of us can stand up and have an agenda and get it done. They're sick and
tired, I'm confident, of people who talk the talk. They're interested in people
who walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show the race as close, with a slice of undecided voters likely
holding the key.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Usually, undecided will break toward the person they haven't known,'' said
McCain, claiming to be that person.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina primary is being closely watched, because it could have
an effect on Michigan next Tuesday and Virginia the following week. McCain, who
thumped Bush in New Hampshire on Feb. 1, hopes to build momentum with the early
wins, while Bush is seeking to build a firewall among party regulars.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bush and McCain said they would soldier on regardless of what happens
in South Carolina, but Bush had the most to lose as the race's presumptive
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think if we make it a very close race, it's obviously in some ways a
victory,'' said McCain. ``We sure would like a win.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm continuing one way or the other,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Gearing up for the voting, both rivals stumped relentlessly across the state
while putting in place intensive voter turnout operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's was by far the more extensive, including repeated phone calls and
mailings to identified backers. McCain was molding a more modest effort, but
targeted about 65,000 veterans for a mailing, and officials were heading for VFW
and American Legion Halls to drop literature touting McCain's record as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he felt momentum, though he conceded he couldn't match Bush's
extensive operation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You just count on the enthusiasm of your supporters,'' said McCain. ``We
never expected to outspend him. It's my gut that turnout is heavy and it is in
my gut that it's moving in my direction.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign trail crowds were sending a mixed signal. McCain drew 1,500 for a
Clemson University rally Wednesday night, but was drawing far fewer on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush drew 1,500 enthusiastic backers to a Thursday rally.

<HEADLINE> Primary Strategy May Haunt GOP  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina's Republican presidential primary was
born in 1980 to help elect Ronald Reagan. It worked.
</P>
<P>
	   But 20 years later, the strategy hatched by political wonder kid Lee
Atwater, may come back to haunt Republicans, as the campaign of the
establishment's candidate, Gov. George W. Bush is being threatened by Arizona
Sen. John McCain's appeal to Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Atwater convinced state GOP leaders in 1979 that South Carolina could build
its Republican party and reap political importance by dumping the tradition of
picking presidential candidates at state conventions and holding an open, early
primary election.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats and independents turned out to help elect Reagan. McCain is now
wooing those same voters, and Bush and his Republican backers are accusing
Democrats of encouraging participation in Saturday's open primary just to make
mischief.
</P>
<P>
	   But College of Charleston political scientist Bill Moore said McCain truly
appeals to Democrats in South Carolina who are more conservative than the
national party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a good number of South Carolina Democrats who say the Democratic
Party has left them -- they haven't left the party,'' Moore said. ``Those would
be the Reagan Democrats who are attracted to McCain.''
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina does not register voters by party and any registered voter
can cast a ballot Saturday. State Republican officials have said they hope to
attract as many as 400,000 voters, up from 278,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Independents and Democrats historically have not participated in large
numbers. But the state's Democratic primary March 9 was canceled in favor of a
caucus, giving McCain's camp even more reason to think Democrats and
independents may turn out on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reagan went outside the normal conservative, Republican activist base and
brought other people to the table -- independents and Democrats,'' said Trey
Walker, McCain's national field director and former South Carolina Republican
Party executive director. ``And that's what John McCain is doing now. That's how
you win.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Tenenbaum, for instance, circulates in the South Carolina Democratic
Party hierarchy and has headed inauguration planning for Democratic Gov. Jim
Hodges and former Gov. Richard Riley. Tenenbaum's wife, Inez, is state education
superintendent and a leader in Vice President Al Gore's South Carolina effort.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet he also has given $1,000 to McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenenbaum said he was impressed that McCain told Pat Buchanan he should
leave the Republican Party because of Buchanan's views on Hitler and Nazi
Germany. Tenenbaum also noted that the Arizona senator met with a group of gay
Republicans to hear their concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those two things alone said to me that this man has real character,''
Tenenbaum said. ``He is talking about a bigger vision.''
</P>
<P>
	   Independents and Democrats' dislike for Bush could drive them to the polls
for McCain, said State Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian, pointing to
Bush's recent appearance at Bob Jones University, which bans interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
	   They ``do not want to vote for a candidate who appears on the Bob Jones
stage with Dan Quayle and David Beasley,'' Harpootlian said. Beasley, a
Republican, lost a bid for a second term to Hodges in 1998 despite then-Gov.
Carroll Campbell's organizational support. Campbell is backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Top Democrats toyed with the idea of mobilizing their voters to beat Bush,
but say there is no organized effort to support McCain -- but they wouldn't mind
if it happened.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But it's not going to upset anybody close to Jim Hodges if Carroll
Campbell gets another beating like he did in November 1998'' when Beasley lost,
said Kevin Geddings, Hodges' main political adviser and former chief of staff.

<HEADLINE> Comparison of Bush's Press Releases  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A comparison of George W. Bush's Jan. 27 campaign press releases announcing
Jack Kemp's endorsement. The first was written for the minority media; the
second is the generic release posted on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Minority media: MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Former Buffalo Bills quarterback, vice
presidential nominee and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp
endorsed Texas Governor George W. Bush as president on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Generic: MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Leading conservative and former vice
presidential nominee Jack Kemp today endorsed Texas Governor George W. Bush as
the candidate most worthy of the Reagan legacy and most capable of leading
America as president.
</P>
<P>
	   Minority media: ``Governor Bush is someone who can inspire this nation and
reach out to minority men and women,'' Mr. Kemp said in making the endorsement.
``I can't think of a better way to serve our country in 2000 than electing
George W. Bush as president. Governor Bush's tax cut plan is practical,
realistic and will get America on the right track for the next century.''
</P>
<P>
	   Generic: ``I believe you serve your party best by serving the country
first,'' Mr. Kemp said in making the endorsement. ``I can't think of a better
way to serve our country in 2000 than electing George W. Bush as president.
Governor Bush's tax cut plan is practical, realistic and will get America on the
right track for the next century. And Governor Bush is someone who can inspire
this nation and reach out to minority men and women.''
</P>
<P>
	   Minority media: ``My tax plan focuses on helping those who live on the
outskirts of poverty and yet pay high marginal tax rates as they work to reach
the middle class,'' added Governor Bush. ``My plan will knock down the tollbooth
to the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
	   Generic: ``Last night's debate highlighted clear differences between me and
my friend Sen. John McCain on key issues including tax cuts, education reform
and campaign finance reform. ... It's important for Republicans to nominate
someone who will debate the Democrats this fall, not mimic them,'' said Governor
Bush.

<HEADLINE> For Campaigns, the Best TV Is Free  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore was in Baltimore, but that didn't mean he
couldn't be on local TV in Albany, N.Y, too. Thanks to satellites and a
sophisticated operation, he was.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's time for a whole new focus on upstate New York,'' the vice
president told WTEN viewers, focusing on local economic woes. ``If you look at
upstate as a region it would rank 49th among our 50 states if it were a state by
itself, and I think we have to do something about that.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was one of four satellite interviews Gore did Tuesday, one of the
increasingly sophisticated ways campaigns use to target their message.
Thirty-second ads get most of the attention, but with tightening budgets and a
crush of states to compete in, the presidential candidates are using new ways to
secure as much free media time and space as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   For Gore, the satellite interviews allow him to get into news shows in
important states that would otherwise ignore him that day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Satellite is one way to have a presence without shipping the whole road
show there,'' Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigns regularly feed stations audio and video sound bites. They
broadcast events over satellites, allowing stations to easily use the tape
without sending a camera crew. And the candidates flood the Sunday morning talk
shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They rarely say `no' to the guy who might be president,'' said Steve
Rabinowitz, whose company arranges satellite interviews for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has opened a new frontier on free media, allowing reporters to travel
with him on his bus in a nonstop, rolling news conference. Just this week, NBC's
``Today'' show broadcast live from McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' bus and
the McCain campaign is considering installing a videocamera on board to transmit
the chats with reporters onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   It helps McCain counter the huge financial advantage amassed by his chief
rival, Gov. George W. Bush. The Arizona senator also has appeared on Sunday
morning talk shows 13 times since October.
</P>
<P>
	   But he is hardly alone in wooing the media.
</P>
<P>
	   When Republican Jack Kemp endorsed Bush, the campaign wrote a press release
tailored for minority media that explained how Bush's tax plan helps those ``on
the outskirts of poverty,'' and how Kemp has reached out to low-income
communities. None of that was in the generic press release posted on Bush's
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   The generic press release also described Kemp as a ``leading conservative
and former vice presidential nominee.'' For the minority media, he was a
``former Buffalo Bills quarterback, vice presidential nominee and Housing and
Urban Development secretary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said it is part of the Texas governor's effort
to reach minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That means it's important to get your message to those who can convey it
to Hispanic-American readers and African-American readers,'' he said. As for the
quarterback reference, Fleischer said: ``No rhyme or reason. It's one of Jack
Kemp's many hats.''
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the courting is over the air. McCain talks to radio talk shows at
least every other day, and Bush phones three or four disc jockeys each morning
in South Carolina, where Republicans vote Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore does satellite interviews about once a week. The campaign pays for the
hookup, picks the target states and chooses markets and individual stations
based on their demographic profiles. A smaller city might be chosen over a
larger one, for instance, if it has a history of supporting Democrats, a
campaign aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, the Clinton-Gore campaign refined the targeting, using census data
and Nielsen research to choose stations, and a similar operation is gearing up
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a snap to get local TV stations to go along, even if the candidate has
nothing particularly local to say, said Rabinowitz, who also handled satellite
work for Clinton-Gore four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabinowitz estimates a free interview to be worth 10 times as much as an ad:
``We tell our clients that the local news anchors are among the most trusted
individuals in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the campaigns use the stations for publicity, reporters get to ask the
questions. ``They're not stupid,'' Rabinowitz said. ``They can ask as tough a
question as they want.''
</P>
<P>
	   Not quite, said Tracy Egan, an anchor at WTEN in Albany. Her station got
only three and a half minutes with the vice president and the campaign cut off
the sound when the time was up -- just as Egan had begun asking Gore questions
about him being a born-again Christian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a way of controlling,'' Egan said in an interview. ``How can you ask
follow-up questions when they limit the time so much?''
</P>
<P>
	   After the Gore interview, she said, the station got a call from a Gore aide
admonishing it for asking the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Getting on TV is easier because of the explosion of cable news outlets
looking to fill time. On Wednesday, MSNBC and Fox News both went live from Bush
events, said Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
	   ``More and more,'' she said, ``a lot of what happens on the campaign trail
goes out on live television.''

<HEADLINE> Landry Memorial Draws Large Crowds  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- All five former Dallas Cowboys players in the Pro Football
Hall of Fame were there. So were most of the 10 members of the team's Ring of
Honor. Even the NFL commissioner showed up.
</P>
<P>
	   They all came to memorial services Thursday because of the respect and love
they shared for the same man: Tom Landry.
</P>
<P>
	   "Life isn't about winning and losing, it's about being the best you can be.
I think I learned that first-hand through practical experiences with Tom
Landry," said Don Perkins, one of the first Cowboys stars and a member of the
Ring of Honor.
</P>
<P>
	   "We love you. It's a word that we male athletes throw around like manhole
covers. It's real hard for us to express those kinds of things, but we do love
you and we do miss you."
</P>
<P>
	   Drew Pearson said he was glad he told Landry he loved him. Dan Reeves said
he's sorry he didn't.
</P>
<P>
	   "About two months ago, I was fortunate enough to speak with coach Landry on
the telephone," Reeves said. "I certainly didn't know that would be the last
time I'd ever get a chance to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish I had thought -- probably like a lot of other people sitting out
here the last time they saw you -- that we'd have used the three words that's
the most beautiful in the English language, and told you I loved you."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry died Saturday at age 75 after fighting leukemia for nine months. He
was buried Wednesday in a private ceremony that featured his son, Tom Landry
Jr., placing one of his father's trademark fedora hats into the casket.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,000 people attended a private memorial service Thursday at Highland
Park United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Two ministers, Landry Jr. and former star quarterback Roger Staubach were
the only speakers at the hour-long event that was typical of the class and
simplicity that marked Landry's life.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours later, former players and the city of Dallas hosted a public service
that drew about 1,200 guests and thousands of television viewers. The two-hour
ceremony was capped by players walking across the stage, one at a time, each
taking a yellow rose and placing it into a vase near a large photo of Landry,
all while a choir sang "Amazing Grace."
</P>
<P>
	   A third service was held in Mission, the South Texas town where Landry was
born and raised. Statewide, Texas flags were flown at half-staff on state
buildings per order of Lt. Gov. Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry's fame comes from the record he amassed over 29 years as coach of the
Cowboys: 270 victories, five Super Bowl appearances, two championships.
</P>
<P>
	   But Landry made a deeper impact on people because of his strong character
and high moral principles.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had a decency about him unsurpassed by anyone that I've ever known,"
Staubach said. "He achieved great fame while never seeking that fame. Everyone
knew that he was true. He didn't put on airs. He did things for the right
reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was a deeply religious man who treated everyone fairly. He never
considered himself very important even though he was the most popular man in
town.
</P>
<P>
	   During the peak of his career, the late 1970s, Landry even went door-to-door
seeking donations for his church. Why? Because that's what members were asked to
do and he considered himself equal to all other members, minister Mark Craig
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig was hired by the Highland Park church five years ago. He was so in awe
of Landry that it took him several months before he worked up the nerve
introduce himself.
</P>
<P>
	   The first time he tried, he froze. Another minister told him to call Landry
"Tom," but Craig couldn't bring himself to do it. He never could.
</P>
<P>
	   But the two became friends and this past Christmas the minister visited
Landry in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was heavily medicated and could not speak. Craig stood in silence at
the foot of the bed and began to cry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wondered why I was crying and I realized it was because I was in the
presence of greatness," he said. "I don't think we often have the opportunity to
stand in the presence of greatness. When we do, if we do, it is very emotional.
</P>
<P>
	   "I simply said to myself, 'Tom Landry is a great gift. A great gift to his
family, a great gift to our church, a great gift to our city, a great gift to
athletics and a great gift to this nation.' "

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Lewis Proclaims Innocence  </HEADLINE>
    By STEPHEN MANNING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Pro Bowl linebacker Ray Lewis will not have to
wear electronic monitoring equipment while awaiting trial on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The Baltimore Ravens Pro Bowl linebacker, however, was scheduled to meet
with corrections officials today to determine what other stipulations might be
placed on him pending his trial in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis is under indictment for the stabbing deaths of two men following a
Super Bowl party in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   LaMont W. Flanagan, commissioner of pretrial detention and services for
Maryland, said his department agreed to conduct weekly tests for drugs and
alcohol and to have a caseworker meet with Lewis weekly at the pretrial services
office in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis' bond requires him to stay in Maryland unless he is traveling to
Georgia for court appearances or to meet with his lawyers. It doesn't permit him
to visit Florida, where his fiancee and two of his children live.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, meanwhile, made a brief statement proclaiming his innocence after
returning from Georgia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've heard many times before from my attorneys and from a lot of other
people, but now you get to hear it from me: I am innocent," Lewis said Thursday.
"I'm looking forward to the day all the facts come out, everything is out front
and my name is cleared."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis also had a message for those who were close to Richard Lollar, 24, and
Jacinth Baker, 21 -- the two men killed in the Jan. 31 stabbings.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am sorry about the tragedy that occurred in Atlanta. I mean, my sympathy
goes out to the families, the friends of both of the men that died. I know their
hearts are broken," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As he spoke, Lewis was surrounded by team management, including owner Art
Modell and coach Brian Billick.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis thanked God, his family, teammates and fans -- "everybody who was
there with me. I feel so sorry for them because it has been very hard for them."
</P>
<P>
	   Under a gag order in a murder case, Lewis couldn't say much more.
</P>
<P>
	   And right after he said it, he left the Ravens complex, got into a car and
went home for the first time since he headed for Atlanta in a rented limousine
to watch the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis was released Tuesday on $1 million bail from an Atlanta jail where he
had been since he was charged. He flew home Thursday and went directly to the
Ravens' training facility.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, 24, and two companions, Joseph Sweeting, 34, of Miami, and Reginald
Oakley, 31, of Baltimore, were indicted Feb. 11 on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis' lawyers say he tried to stop the fight and that he was at least 60
feet away when Lollar and Baker were stabbed. Police say Lewis drove away in a
limousine and later lied when they tried to determine who was in his entourage.
</P>
<P>
	   Not even waiting for Billick to speak, Lewis immediately left the building
and went to his home a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
	   Billick said Lewis' status with the team is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ray Lewis is a member of this organization. He's a member of this football
team and will be afforded all the rights we give members of this football team,"
Billick said.
</P>
<P>
	   Billick also stressed that any moves the team makes to sign or draft a
linebacker should not be interpreted as being related to Lewis' legal problems.
To conclude that "would not only be wrong, but it would be inappropriate,"
Billick said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ravens officials said neither Lewis nor any member of the team would talk
about the case again.

<HEADLINE> Poll: McCain Fares Well Against Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain's strength among independents and older
voters makes him a formidable opponent for Democratic front-runner Al Gore,
possibly tougher than GOP national front-runner George W. Bush, a poll suggests.
</P>
<P>
	   That runs counter to the Bush campaign's frequent claim that their candidate
would make the strongest GOP candidate in the general election.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain led Gore by 49 percent to 41 percent in the hypothetical matchup in
the poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press. Bush and Gore
were in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain is the new, exciting candidate,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of
the Pew Research Center. ``The message of this poll is that McCain is taking off
nationally -- more so among independents than Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator trails Bush nationally in polls of likely GOP primary
voters by 20 points to 30 points, depending on the poll, but is closer to Bush
now than he was before winning the New Hampshire primary. In the next three
primary states, McCain is running close to Bush in South Carolina and Michigan,
and is well ahead in his home state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a fourth of voters are paying close attention to the campaign at this
point, according to the Pew poll of 971 registered voters taken Feb. 9 through
Monday. It had an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points, larger for
subgroups.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's strength in a hypothetical matchup with Gore is based largely on
his appeal with independents and older voters, according to polls. In a race
between Bush and Gore, Gore fares better with older voters, especially women.
</P>
<P>
	   A key advantage for Bush early in the campaign was voters' perception of him
as the Republican most likely to win in November. That was fueled by his record
$70 million warchest and overwhelming lead in the polls -- both in the
Republican race and against likely Democratic opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, voters in exit polls were slightly more likely to say Bush
had the best chance of winning the White House. Almost all of Bush's voters felt
that way, while a fifth of McCain's supporters said Bush would be the GOP
candidate most likely to win in November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In terms of Republicans, Bush still is their first choice nationwide,''
said Kohut. ``He's seen as a candidate who is effective and a strong leader --
that's the card he's got.''
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina polls indicate the race between Bush and McCain for the
crucial primary Feb. 19 is a dead heat with turnout the likely determining
factor. McCain needs a heavy turnout of independents and Democrats to win.
</P>
<P>
	   Other state polls show the race very close in Michigan and McCain well ahead
in his home state of Arizona, both with primaries on Feb. 22. Bush was ahead in
a Virginia poll, which has a primary Feb. 29, while McCain led in Connecticut,
which holds its primary March 7.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To Keep Anthrax Program  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is sticking to its plan to inoculate all 2.4
million active duty and reserve troops against anthrax, the deadly biological
agent that defense officials believe poses a threat to tens of thousands of U.S.
troops stationed in the Middle East and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials on Thursday rejected a call by a House subcommittee to
suspend the vaccination program on grounds that some military members do not
trust the Pentagon's medical information.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very important that we use the existing and available, safe and
effective vaccine to give our troops that go in harm's way the protection that
they deserve,'' Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Randy West told a Pentagon news
conference. He is a special adviser to Defense Secretary William Cohen on
biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
	   Sue Bailey, the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said the
Defense Department intends to continue toward its goal of immunizing all
military members.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthrax is a naturally occurring bacteria that, when inhaled, can cause
death within a few days. The Pentagon believes Iraq and other nations hostile to
the United States have produced anthrax weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report released Thursday, the House Government Reform national security
subcommittee said the anthrax vaccine does provide a degree of protection to
those who receive it. ``Just how much protection is acquired, by whom, for how
long ... are questions the Defense Department answers with an excess of faith
but a paucity of science.'' it said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Plagued by uncertain supplies, uncertain safety and unproven efficacy
against the anthrax threat, the mandatory, force-wide immunization program
should be suspended until the Department of Defense gets approval to use an
improved vaccine,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., chairman of the
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon says it is searching for an improved vaccine but may not get
one for years.
</P>
<P>
	   So far more than 400,000 troops have been given approximately 1.5 million
shots, Bailey said. There have been 620 reported adverse reactions, 26 of which
required hospitalization, and only six of the hospitalizations are known to be
related to the vaccine, she said. The illnesses of the 20 others were unrelated
to the vaccine, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a very safe and effective vaccine against a very deadly biologic
agent that we know to be in the hands of many of our adversaries and could be
used against our forces,'' Bailey told reporters. ``That would imply were they
not vaccinated and exposed to this agent, they would die a horrible death.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers as a growing
number of troops have refused to take the six-shot regimen. Complaints have
included fevers, muscle pain and dizziness. Some military members testified in
hearings held by Shays' panel that the vaccine controversy is hurting morale.
</P>
<P>
	   West, who was with Marine units that routed the Iraqi army from Kuwait in
the 1991 Gulf War, said he is concerned that an Internet-driven campaign to stop
the Pentagon's vaccination program is taking a toll.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do worry about divisiveness'' within the military, he said. ``I worry
about any serviceman or woman that would leave the military or face any kind of
disciplinary action for no reason other than the fact that he refused to take a
shot that was designed only to be good for him.''
</P>
<P>
	   West said 351 members of the active and reserve forces have refused to take
the vaccine since the program started in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Shays report said that because there is little research on the
inhalation of anthrax spores by humans, the vaccine should be regarded as an
investigational drug, requiring the approval of troops to be administered. The
Pentagon counters by saying research on humans is not possible because anthrax
is deadly.

<HEADLINE> Tightened Biotech Crop Regs Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government officials say they are considering
recommendations by a panel of scientists for more testing and monitoring of
genetically engineered crops to ensure they aren't killing butterflies and other
harmless insects.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel, which advises the Environmental Protection Agency, says the crops
should be tested on a wider variety of insects than the four species currently
done and that EPA should require more data from seed companies on the impact of
crops in the field.
</P>
<P>
	   About 30 percent of the corn grown in the United States last year was
genetically altered to produce its own toxin, known as Bt, that kills the
European corn borer, a major pest. Concerns were raised about the corn last
spring when a Cornell University study said its pollen could be harmful to the
monarch butterfly.
</P>
<P>
	   The recommendations ``are very consistent with the enhancements we have
already begun to implement,'' Steven Johnson, an official in the EPA division
that regulates biotech crops, said Thursday. The recommendations were posted on
the Internet this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Registrations for the Bt corn and a similar variety of cotton will expire
next year. The scientists will be asked to make specific recommendations on the
crops before they are renewed, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   EPA must approve any crop that is engineered to kill pests and also controls
how it can be grown.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the agency issued planting restrictions on Bt corn to prevent
the borers, which are moth larvae, from developing resistance to it and is
requiring more field monitoring by the seed companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Seed companies insist that the crops are safe for the environment. EPA
scientists and outside researchers have questioned the findings of the Cornell
study, saying it's doubtful that many butterflies would actually be exposed to
toxic corn pollen. The butterflies feed on milkweed that sometimes grows near
corn fields.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've expected the regulatory process for agricultural biotechnology to be
a flexible and transparent one and will respond to and conduct additional
relevant and reasonable research,'' said Dan Verakis, a spokesman for Monsanto
Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Monsanto already is doing what the panel recommended, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jane Rissler, a senior staff scientist with the Union of Concerned
Scientists, said the panel's report shows that EPA's approval process for
biotech crop is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have yet to do a good ecological assessment of (Bt corn and cotton),
even through they've been approved for five years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers say that the pesticides they use when they plant conventional crops
are a greater risk to beneficial insects than the biotech varieties.
</P>
<P>
	   EPA currently requires genetically altered crops to be tested on ladybird
beetles, wasps, honeybees and the green lacewing. The panel's report did not
recommend a list of additional species but said they should vary according the
crop and where it is grown.
</P>
<P>
	   As for crops already in production, the panel said that more field
monitoring is needed, ``at least until we better understand the ways in which
non-target organisms are exposed to transgenic plant toxins.''
</P>
<P>
	   The European Commission, which enforces rules for the 15-member European
Union, cited Cornell's monarch study last summer in delaying approval of pending
requests to sell the corn variety.

<HEADLINE> Budget Chief Backs Coverage Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's proposal to provide prescription drug
coverage for all Medicare recipients is a better use for federal budget
surpluses than Republican tax-cut plans, the White House budget director says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've proposed something that can be afforded in the context of limited
resources,'' budget chief Jack Lew told reporters and editors of The Associated
Press in an interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real debate is, is there room for a tax cut much larger than we
proposed,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fiscal 2001 budget he introduced on Feb. 7, Clinton proposed $351
billion in tax cuts over the coming decade. Congressional Republicans have not
offered their own tax proposal, but have said Clinton's was too small.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also proposed a 10-year, $195 billion program that would provide
optional prescription coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of
income.
</P>
<P>
	   After ignoring a similar proposal last year, Republicans have said they will
put together a drug plan of their own in this election year. But House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has said the GOP will focus on aiding elderly people who
lack access to or cannot afford private prescription coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have said Clinton's proposal threatens a federal takeover of the
prescription drug industry. Among the GOP's options are tax credits and block
grants to states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real choice is do you want to have the government take over
prescription drugs, or have a program that helps seniors get drugs they need
without encouraging a government takeover of the prescription drug industry?''
said Hastert spokesman John Feehery.
</P>
<P>
	   Lew defended Clinton's proposal to cover even the wealthiest of Americans.
He said that if Clinton's plan were to be reconfigured to make it less costly,
``the vast majority of people who would not benefit ... are not rich people.
They're not the Bill Gateses.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added, ``Having an income cutoff at a very moderate income level is the
only way to save substantial amounts of money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lew offered no figures. But his defense of the president's program
underlined that Democrats see Clinton's prescription drug coverage plan as a
political winner in this election year, whether or not it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats traditionally have opposed proposals to restrict Medicare and
Social Security benefits to lower-income people. They worry that such limits
would risk eroding the two programs' political support, which long has come from
across the income spectrum.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Clinton's prescription drug proposal would be paid for from
anticipated budget surpluses. About one-third of the cost would come from
proposed savings to be extracted from Medicare health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan envisions an optional Medicare drug benefit for the elderly
beginning in 2002. It would cover half of retirees' prescription costs up to a
$5,000 cap by 2009, when it would be fully phased in.
</P>
<P>
	   On other issues, Lew said:
</P>
<P>
	   --Over time, repealing the Social Security earnings limit for thousands of
elderly people would be ``free'' because it would keep extra people working and
paying taxes. Republicans have put a 10-year price tag of $22.7 billion on the
proposal. The plan, supported by Clinton, would end the practice of trimming
Social Security benefits for many people age 65-69 who continue working.
</P>
<P>
	   --Amid rising heating-oil costs, the White House is monitoring energy prices
``carefully'' and will watch whether any long-term economic trends develop as a
result.
</P>
<P>
	   --He hopes the White House and Congress will strike a broad budget agreement
this year on spending, taxes and debt reduction. But if not, he said the
administration priorities are so strong that ``Democrats are comfortable
defending them in the political process.''

<HEADLINE> Genetic Liver Therapies Researched  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL RECER AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new way of growing liver cells in the laboratory may
eventually lead to renewed hope for millions of Americans who suffer from liver
disease and are waiting for a transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   In a study published today in the journal Science, researchers report that
genetically manipulated cells grown in test tubes were able to restore normal
liver function to lab rats whose livers had been 90 percent removed for the
experiment.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers said their experiment involved growing millions of new liver
cells, called hepatocytes, and then transplanting them into rats that had
virtually no liver function. The injected cells took over the job of the failing
organ.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have no idea when we could use it in humans" because the technique is
still so experimental, said the study's chief researcher, Dr. Philippe Leboulch
of Brigham and Women's Hospital. But he said it offers the promise of one day
helping stave off organ failure in patients waiting for a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   Leboulch, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said
transplanted hepatocytes have been used in patients with failing organs before,
but the therapy had limited success because doctors were unable to isolate
enough liver cells. Hepatocytes are very difficult to grow in the laboratory, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new technique uses a gene to solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Leboulch and his colleagues inserted into laboratory liver cells a cancer
gene that forced those cells to start reproducing without limit, a technique
known as "immortalizing."
</P>
<P>
	   Although the cells multiplied by the millions, they could not be
transplanted because in the body they would be like a cancer, growing out of
control.
</P>
<P>
	   To solve this problem, the researchers treated the cells with an enzyme that
acts like a "genetic scissors." It cut out and deactivated the inserted cancer
gene, halting the rapid growth of new cells.
</P>
<P>
	   The cells were then injected into the spleens of rats, whose livers had been
90 percent removed surgically. About 60 percent of these animals lived normally
after receiving the genetically engineered cells.
</P>
<P>
	   Control animals, which also were missing 90 percent of their livers, did not
receive the manipulated cells and died within three days.
</P>
<P>
	   "This system may do away with the shortage of hepatocytes," Dr. Ira Fox, a
co-author of the study, said in Science. "You could keep (the cells) in the
freezer and take them whenever you needed, which is not possible with primary
hepatocytes."
</P>
<P>
	   Fox is a liver transplant surgeon at the University of Nebraska Medical
Center in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Roy Chowdhury, a liver expert at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine
in New York, said in Science that the study results were "very encouraging," but
he questioned whether rats with 90 percent of their livers surgically removed
represented a true model of human liver failure.
</P>
<P>
	   Human liver failure often involves a virus or a toxin that may persist even
after the liver cells are transplanted, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 400,000 of the 20 million Americans with liver disease die annually.
Liver transplants are the only hope for many of these patients, but there only
enough organs to treat about 4,000 patients each year.

<HEADLINE> Graham Issue in Chaplain Imbroglio  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Billy Graham is now at the center of the latest
accusations involving selection of a chaplain for the House.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Speaker Dennis Hastert said Graham, an adviser to presidents
from Dwight Eisenhower to Bill Clinton, called the speaker this week to discuss
the candidacy of the Rev. Charles Wright, a Presbyterian minister who is the
Republican choice for chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Democrats and Roman Catholics have accused GOP leaders of having an
anti-Catholic bias and snubbing the Rev. Timothy O'Brien, a Catholic priest who
got the most votes from a bipartisan selection committee of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   The House has never had a Catholic chaplain; the Senate had one in 1832 but
he was on the job only a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The speaker's ``mind was already set that Dr. Wright was the right choice,''
spokesman John Feehery said Thursday. ``The phone call didn't hurt his
resolve.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do think he (Graham) did express support for (Wright),'' Feehery said,
although he said that Graham had not ``lobbied'' on Wright's behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   But a spokesman for Graham said the minister was only returning a call from
Hastert and did not specifically weigh in on the chaplain issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His response was he did not and could not take sides on this issue,'' said
Larry Ross, spokesman for Graham, the Southern Baptist evangelist. ``Any
inference that he did take sides was a misunderstanding of a private phone call
between Mr. Graham and the speaker.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert's office insists the speaker never called Graham.
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless, the idea that Graham commented on the matter prompted an
immediate outcry from critics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody respects Billy Graham but he is wrong on this issue,'' William
Donahue, president of the 350,000-member Catholic League for Religious and Civil
Rights, said Thursday. ``While anyone is free to enter the debate, everyone who
does so is morally obligated to weigh the evidence and not simply offer support
or criticism for the process.''
</P>
<P>
	   A House vote to select a chaplain has been postponed due to the controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that he (Billy Graham) has entered into this controversy will,
unfortunately, only serve to polarize the conversation and will ultimately lead
to hard words between the parties,'' said Deal Hudson, editor and publisher of
Crisis, a magazine of politics, culture and the Catholic church. ``I think it
will make Catholics even more determined to see that a priest becomes
chaplain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hudson was one of several Catholic leaders invited to meet with GOP
officials Thursday. He did not attend.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the issue has caused a division between Republicans and Catholics,
the largest denomination in the country with 30 million voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Just last week, the Rev. Richard Sklba, auxiliary bishop of Milwaukee, wrote
to Hastert saying, ``The appearance that religious discrimination was involved
is abhorrent. A number of respected leaders in our nation have made accusations
of anti-Catholicism and I pray that such is not the case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Majority Leader Dick Armey recently told reporters how one of his sons had
to sit through church service in Texas as a priest harangued Republicans for the
issue.

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy Scare Said False Alarm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Extensive tests have found that gene therapy given to a
group of dying cancer patients was not contaminated with hepatitis C or the
virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, several newspapers reported that highly preliminary laboratory
testing suggested an experiment at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and
Houston's Baylor College of Medicine might have exposed children to the viruses.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Food and Drug Administration said those lab tests are prone to
errors.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the children, who had advanced cases of the nervous system cancer
neuroblastoma, have died of their cancer since the experiment. After the media
reports, the hospitals tracked down survivors' families to warn them.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday, after finishing several rounds of confirmatory testing, the FDA
said there was no problem -- the children were not exposed to infection.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said the scare also shows research labs must be careful in how
they test gene therapy products for possible contamination -- the lab St. Jude's
hired used an error-prone method not even FDA-approved for gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   The concern arose when a St. Jude's researcher realized cells used to grow
some of the gene-based medicine might not have undergone proper quality testing,
and so began to double-check. The FDA will continue to investigate whether that
portion of the experiment followed federal rules.

<HEADLINE> Land Conservation System Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT WELLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Hoping to instill a sense of pride within the Bureau of Land
Management, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt unveiled a new land conservation
system as part of the Clinton administration's plan to protect more federal
lands in the West.
</P>
<P>
	   The new National Landscape Monuments system, unveiled Thursday, will be
operated by the BLM rather than more traditional agencies such as the U.S.
Forest Service and the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Babbitt, who has often battled with the BLM over what he considers its
pro-mining and logging policies, said the new responsibility will give the
agency a purpose that it has lacked. Previously, land that was deemed important
was given to the Park Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The nation's largest land management agency ought to be induced to have a
sense of pride,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tina Arapkiles, the Sierra Club's southwest regional representative, praised
the announcement, saying it would shift the BLM from its traditional mining and
logging mindset.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's trying to protect land for the future. And the land that has been
traditionally managed by the BLM has been viewed in our country's history as
giveaway land or trash land. It's not worth anything but having cows or mines,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The land being considered for landscape monument status is already owned by
the federal government, though some holdings might be purchased as well. Other
uses, such as hunting, will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The areas
involved do not have significant mining or other industrial uses.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the sites under consideration are:
</P>
<P>
	   -- In Oregon, Steens Mountain and Soda Mountain.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In Colorado, Canyon of the Ancients, an expansion of the Colorado
National Monument and enlarging the Sand Dunes National Monument.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In California, the Santa Rosa Mountains near Palm Springs and Carrizo
Plain in the San Joaquin Valley near Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In Arizona, the Empire Ranch near Tucson.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In Montana, an area along the Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some of the property I am personally familiar with that he is looking at
deserves the protection of monument status irrespective of the agency that
manages it,'' said Tom Kiernan of the National Parks Conservation Association in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do have a fundamental concern that BLM doesn't now have the management
policies and staffing and culture to manage these more sensitive lands. It is
going to require scientific skills and staffing,'' Kiernan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Babbitt said there will have to be changes in the internal workings of the
BLM as a result of the new system.
</P>
<P>
	   Babbitt said he hoped Congress will act on his suggestions, but President
Clinton could declare the land monuments by proclamation.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, Clinton declared the Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah as a
national monument over local protests. Last month, he bestowed national monument
status on land around the Grand Canyon.

<HEADLINE> Independent truckers seeking higher rates plan weekend meeting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Independent truckers idling their rigs to push for
higher freight rates plan to meet this weekend for an update on their protest
against rising fuel and maintenance costs.
<P>
	   "We seem to be making a little progress, we're trying to get some offers on
the table," one of the organizers, Chris Van Schaizk, an independent trucker
from Levittown, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Schaizk was one of more than 230 truckers from 65 different companies in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware who voted last weekend to halt deliveries
and push for a 30 percent rate increase and a 15 percent fuel surcharge from
companies whose goods they haul.
</P>
<P>
	   He said another meeting is planned Saturday in Bucks County, with about 300
drivers expected to attend, though the group has not received any concrete
offers of higher freight-hauling rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The drivers are dealing separately with the various companies they work for,
and the companies in turn must negotiate with customers such as steel companies
and railroads whose freight they haul, Van Schaizk said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a lot of riding around making visits and talking to the different
carriers," Van Schaizk said.
</P>
<P>
	   The main impact of the truckers' efforts in southeastern Pennsylvania
appeared to be at U.S. Steel's Fairless Hills plant, which was switching to rail
rather than truck deliveries for some of its shipments, spokesman Mike Dixon
said. He said U.S. Steel has paid the drivers fuel surcharges totaling 10
percent since January.
</P>
<P>
	   Dixon said the truckers' action "slowed deliveries to some degree" at the
plant but declined to give specifics. The plant sends steel to auto, appliance
and food-container manufacturers, he said, so consumers "wouldn't see any
immediate impact."
</P>
<P>
	   Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp. spokesmen said deliveries to and from
their rail terminals in Philadelphia had not been affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Malvern-based Acme Markets Inc. has not seen any interruption of deliveries
by independent truckers to its warehouses, spokesman Walt Rubel said.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Mixed in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices are mixed in early trading today. The Dow
industrials are down 30 points. Losing issues on the New York Stock Exchange
hold a slim lead over gainers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 14 points and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
Stock Index is down four points.
</P>
<P>
	   It could well be a lively session today for investors. For one thing,
today's session features expirations on certain options contracts and that
typically results in big spurts of trading at the beginning and ending of the
trading day.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, today's session is the last before a three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, the Nasdaq begins the session from a record high after closing
yesterday above 4,500 for the first time ever.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 60.50; Nasdaq Off 8.78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks opened lower today as investors ignored a
positive inflation report from Washington, dwelling instead on Thursday's
remarks about the economy from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 60.50
at 10,454.07.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index, which started the session higher, reversed
direction and was off 8.78 at 4,540.14.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, the market's broadest indicator, was down
8.60 at 1,379.65.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the market opened, the Labor Department released January's Consumer
Price Index, which edged up 0.2 percent as the biggest drop in clothing prices
in nearly 11 years helped offset rising costs for fuel oil, gasoline and other
energy products.
</P>
<P>
	   The modest advance in the most closely watched inflation gauge was slightly
less than the 0.3 percent increase many analysts were expecting and marked four
months in a row where inflation stood at 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was little comfort to investors after Greenspan cautioned the House
Banking Committee that higher wages, driven by the tight labor market, would
fuel inflation. He warned that the Fed will raise interest rates again this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, investors were likely worried about holding certain stocks
before a three-day weekend. U.S. stock markets will be closed Monday in
observance of President's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the biggest decliners was Novell, down 5 11/16 at 37 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the most active shares, Lucent was down 1 1/16 at 52 7/16, Home Depot was
down 1 1/8 at 54, and SBC Communications fell 1 7/8 to 38 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks was the only index in
positive territory, up 0.30 at 558.72.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 168.99 million shares, up from
135.84 million shares the same time Thursday. And declining issues outnumbered
advancing issues by about a three-to-four margin.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was off 0.01 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.15
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.94 percent.

	   Trade Deficit Hits High in 1999
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. trade deficit surged to an all-time
high of $271.3 billion last year, up more than 65 percent from
1998. Deficits with Japan, China, Canada, Mexico and the European
Union all set records. The huge imbalance for 1999 reflected a 33.7
percent jump in the U.S. foreign oil bill as world prices climbed
from $9.19 at the start of the year to $22.67 in December.
</P>
<P>

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices edged up 0.2 percent in
January as the biggest drop in clothing prices in nearly 11 years
helped offset rising costs for fuel oil, gasoline and other energy
products, the government said today. The modest advance in the
Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, the most closely watched
inflation gauge, was slightly less than the 0.3 percent increase
many analysts were expecting. It was the fourth month in a row in
which inflation has stood at 0.2 percent.

	   Colo. Lawmakers OK Internet Ad Bill
</P>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Internet spammers would have to slap a
crystal-clear ``advertisement'' label on all electronic junk mail
and provide an easy way for consumers to scratch their names from
mailing lists under a bill passed yesterday by a state House
committee. Before approving the bill by a 10-2 vote, the House
Business Affairs and Labor Committee toughened the rules further by
adding politicians and nonprofit groups to the mailers who must use
the dreaded ``ADV:'' label. The tag must appear at the beginning of
any junk mail's subject memo, which appears in consumers' lists of
new e-mail and guides them on what they wish to read.

	   PlayStation Orders Jam Web Site
</P>
<P>
	   CHIBA, Japan (AP) -- Sony's upgraded PlayStation video-game
machine generated so much interest today that the system's Web site
jammed, a company official said. The Sony PlayStation 2 goes on
sale in Japan on March 4 and late this year in the United States.
Sony hopes to sell a million of the machines here in its first
shipment. The Web site for the advance orders, which opened today,
received some 500,000 hits a minute and went down, Sony officials
said. PlayStation 2 is considered a deal at $360 because it is also
a digital video disk player.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is denying a published report
that chairman Bill Gates said he was willing to disclose the code

trial. Gates previously has rejected any suggestion that Microsoft
share the ``blueprint'' to its flagship product, which has earned
the company billions of dollars. Bloomberg, which taped an
interview with Gates, said it would stand by the story. The
software giant also earlier this week rejected any plans to break
up the company as a settlement to monopolist charges.

	   Airline Web Site Raises Questions
</P>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- The nation's travel agents are seeking a
federal investigation into the airlines' plan to set up a Web site
to sell low-cost tickets. The American Society of Travel Agents
says the plan would lead to price fixing. The group also says it
would cause consumers to stop buying tickets through its members,
paving the way for a monopoly. The company setting up the Web site
says the travel agents' concerns are invalid. It says airlines will
continue to operate their own competing Web sites. Some 27 airlines
plan to participate in the Web site.

	   U.S. Probes Newsprint Industry
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newsprint prices are going up and the Justice
Department is looking into possible antitrust violations within the
industry. The Wall Street Journal said a federal grand jury in
Cleveland has subpoenaed more than two dozen Canadian newsprint
salesmen as part of an inquiry into price increases during 1994 and
1995. The newsprint industry is in the midst of a price increase,
with increases of about 7 percent to about $515 a ton since
mid-1999, the Journal said. Presstime, the magazine of the
Newspaper Association of America, said that the top five newsprint
producers control more than 60 percent of North American newsprint
capacity, compared with about 44 percent 10 years ago.

	   Ford To Cut Jobs at British Plant

	   LONDON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. plans to cut 1,350 jobs, or about
28.7 percent of the work force, at its biggest car plant in Britain
and to reduce from two shifts to one. The Dagenham factory in east
London has suffered recently from labor disruptions. Ford chief
executive Jac Nasser intervened personally in October after some
800 employees stopped working for a day to protest alleged racist
abuses and bullying by some plant foremen. The company said it was
cutting jobs as a way of reducing excess capacity and operating
costs at the plant.

<HEADLINE> Navy Assigns Liaison for Vieques  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy said Friday that Rear Adm. Kevin Green will be
the main liaison in Puerto Rico for implementing President Clinton's plan on
resuming bombing exercises on the island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement from Norfolk, Va., the U.S. Atlantic Fleet said it had
established a new U.S. Naval Forces South Command (NAVSOUTH), after
consolidating Atlantic and hemispheric commands as a cost-saving and efficiency
move.
</P>
<P>
	   It said the new organization will be headed by Green, whose career has
included two years as military assistant to the secretary of defense and one as
commander of a cruiser-destroyer group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He will oversee forces participating in drug enforcement operations and
interaction with South American Navy forces ... (and) serve as the principle
liaison with the government of Puerto Rico,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As such, Rear Adm. Green will work closely with government officials to
implement President Clinton's directives regarding resumption of Naval exercises
on the Island of Vieques,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton issued directives early this month to Defense Secretary William
Cohen ordering that a referendum on Vieques be set by the Navy, probably on May
1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The island has been central to Atlantic fleet training for more than 50
years. But exercises were suspended in April amid residents' protest after a
civilian was accidentally killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has said he will ask Congress for $90 million in aid to Vieques for
housing and infrastructure improvements if they vote to let the Navy resume
full-scale training.

<HEADLINE> Union Rips Mannesmann CEO's Package  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The world's largest trade union blasted German
telecommunications company Mannesmann AG on Friday for giving its chief
executive a $30 million severance package once his company merges with Britain's
Vodafone AirTouch PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is irresponsible and incomprehensible to any employee," said Klaus
Zwickel, head of IG Metall, which represents 3.4 million metal and electronics
workers. Zwickel also sits on the board at Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
	   Zwickel added that other employee representatives on Mannesmann's
supervisory board voted against giving Mannesmann chief executive Klaus Esser
the package as well. Zwickel is currently leading his union in wage negotiations
with employers across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the wage rounds that just began, workers are being asked to make do with
an increase pegged to inflation. And at the same time, one chief executive is
being paid 60 million marks in one shot," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Esser was awarded the bonus last week on top of normal severance pay already
negotiated into his retirement package.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann agreed to be acquired for a record $180 billion by mobile phone
giant Vodafone two weeks ago after refusing Vodafone's takeover offers for more
than two months. Esser agreed to the merger only after Vodafone sweetened its
offer by giving Mannesmann a 49.5 percent stake in the combined company, as
opposed to an original offer of 47.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   He is expected to leave the merged company after a five-month transition
period.

<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean prices burst to new contract highs in early dealings
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid a brighter outlook for U.S. exports.
Grain prices were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was limited ahead of the three-day holiday weekend as well as a
Chicago-area snowstorm that sidelined some market participants.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans initially dipped on the prospects for rain in South America, then
jumped higher. Investors said the market was bullish because of China's
continued buying. The U.S. Department of Agriculture disclosed another sale to
China of 110,000 tons of U.S. soybeans.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat prices slipped on forecasts for slightly wetter weather in the
relatively dry U.S. winter wheat belt next week.

Midwest.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Rise Modestly  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices edged up 0.2 percent in January as the
biggest drop in clothing prices in nearly 11 years helped offset rising costs
for fuel oil, gasoline and other energy products, the government said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The modest advance in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, the most
closely watched inflation gauge, was slightly less than the 0.3 percent increase
many analysts were expecting and marked four months in a row in which inflation
stood at 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1.1 percent decline in clothing prices -- the largest drop since February
1989, reflecting post-holiday discounting by retailers to make room for new
merchandise -- helped offset a big 1 percent jump in energy prices and rising
costs for other products.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the "core" rate of
inflation rose 0.2 percent last month, matching many analysts' predictions. That
followed a slim 0.1 percent rise in the core in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The report comes one day after the government said inflation at the
wholesale level was unchanged in January and that core wholesales prices,
excluding energy and food, actually fell 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Both inflation reports suggest that outside the burst in energy costs, most
other prices remain in check. But some economists said the CPI report could set
the stage for bigger price increases in the future. Among other things, they are
worried that rising energy costs will push up other prices. "The tame headline
number hides some real pressures on consumer prices," said economist Joel Naroff
of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street, however, appeared to dwell on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's signal Thursday that interest rates will be raised again. The Dow
Jones industrial average was down more than 80 points and the Nasdaq was off
more than 13 at late morning. But inflation-sensitive bonds rallied on the CPI
news. Bond prices rose as the yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 6.18
percent this morning from 6.22 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In another report, the Commerce Department today said the 1999 trade deficit
was up a sharp 65.1 percent from the $164.3 billion of a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the trade deficit for last year surged to an all-time high of
$271.3 billion. Deficits with Japan, China, Canada, Mexico and the European
Union all set records.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve has bumped up interest rates four times since June to
slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan, in his twice-a-year report on the economy to Congress on
Thursday, said inflation remains a threat to the economic good times many
Americans are enjoying. His concern: the tight labor market will lead to wage
gains that not blunted by other forces could lead to a sharp run-up in prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Most analysts widely expect the Fed to boost interest rates again on March
21 and believed Greenspan's remarks appeared to support their predications of a
series of rate increases this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1 percent rise in overall energy prices last month was led by a 7.9
percent gain in fuel oil prices, the steepest increase in four years. Gasoline
prices rose 1.6 percent and natural gas prices went up 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Production limits by oil-producing nations and increased demand because of
the cold weather accounted for the increase in energy prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil prices on Monday moved past the $30-a-barrel mark for the first
time since the eve of the Persian Gulf War nine years ago as production cuts
adopted by leading producers squeezed world supply.
</P>
<P>
	   A rebound in energy prices, which had fallen sharply in 1998 as the Asian
financial crisis severely dampened global demand, was the main factor in pushing
up overall consumer prices last year by 2.7 percent, the biggest increase since
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the increase in energy costs, airfares actually fell by 1.4 percent
last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, food prices, fell by 0.1 percent in January, the best showing
since March. Falling prices for vegetables, fruits, dairy products and pork more
than offset rising prices for poultry and beef.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the report, new car prices fell by 0.3 percent in January, the
best performance in almost a year, and prescription drug prices rose 0.2
percent, the smallest increase since November 1998. Tobacco prices, including
cigarettes, rose 1.6 percent, the biggest jump in four months.

<HEADLINE> Spitzer sues over terms of GE dishwasher recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Judy Cookinham is one of those meticulous types who
keeps appliances working seemingly forever. The 60-year-old Ilion woman uses a
microwave from 20 years ago.
<P>
	   So when she learned General Electric Co. was recalling her 10-year-old
dishwasher due to a fire hazard, she fully expected her money back, a new
machine, or at least the opportunity to repair it - after all, it still looked
new.
</P>
<P>
	   But GE didn't offer any of those options - to her or 3 million other
customers that bought the defective products. Now New York's attorney general is
suing the company - saying it offered a sweeter deal to businesses that owned
the dishwashers than it did to individual customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company knew how its dishwashers could be fixed - and actually provided
inexpensive repair kits to commercial customers," Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   GE encouraged individual consumers, however, to "spend hundreds of dollars
on new machines when clearly they did not need to do so," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the recall, GE and the CPSC said they were aware of 50
incidents in which the slide switch, which selects the heat drying and energy
save functions, melted and ignited fires. Seven of the fires spread beyond the
dishwashers and three damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   CPSC officials added today that they are investigating whether GE knew about
the defect several years before it reported it to the safety agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general said he would file a lawsuit in state Supreme Court
against GE later this month seeking restitution and damages for customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only winner in this case is GE, not me," Cookinham said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company dismissed Spitzer's claim, announced on the "Today" television
show as "grandstanding." GE noted that its October 1999 recall arrangement was
approved by the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are working very hard to communicate effectively about this recall with
our consumers and to satisfy all of them during our implementation," GE
spokesman Terry Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety commission, however, said today the fact that GE did not let
customers know the part could be rewired "came as a surprise to us," according
to Alan Schoem, who worked with GE on the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission said they asked GE to offer free repairs, but the company
refused, and the rebate option to consumers was a legal option.
</P>
<P>
	   The defective dishwashers were sold in the 1980s under the General Electric
and Hotpoint labels. The defect in the machines was in a slide switch.
</P>
<P>
	   GE told individuals the switch could not be fixed and offered them rebates
of $75-$125 for new GE or Hotpoint dishwashers. New GE dishwashers at a Sears
store on Thursday cost $399 to $499. Hotpoints sold at $229 and $279.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's office said labor would have cost about $75 for the ten-minute
procedure to correct the defect.
</P>
<P>
	   Commercial customers like hotels and landlords were provided with rewiring
kits, a video explaining how to fix the problem, and a $15 labor allowance.
</P>
<P>
	   GE did not deny treating individuals and businesses differently, and
suggested that was part of its agreement with the CPSC.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar charges are in a class-action suit that St. Petersburg, Fla.,
attorney John Yanchunis said he was filing Thursday in federal court. The
damages he is seeking - compensation for a defective product and for repairs -
would also apply to every customer in the country who bought the dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
	   Yanchunis filed another suit shortly after the recall on behalf of residents
of a condominium who had the dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that in his state, GE's practices were especially problematic for
the elderly on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's lawsuit will seek restitution and damages for customers whether or
not they took advantage of the rebate.
</P>
<P>
	   The defective models include those made under General Electric and Hotpoint
names with the model numbers GSD500D, GSD500G, GSD540, HDA467, HDA477, and
HDA487. The recalled models also carry the serial number that has a second
letter of A, M, R, S, T, V or Z.

<HEADLINE> 4 Quit Aurora Amid Internal Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Four senior management officials at Aurora Foods Inc.
have resigned as the company prepares to investigate its internal accounting
practices.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said Friday the following executives resigned: chairman and
chief executive Ian R. Wilson, vice chairman James B. Ardrey, executive vice
president Ray Chung and chief financial officer M. Laurie Cummings.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson and Ardrey also resigned from the company's board of directors, the
company said in a release. Officials at Aurora did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The board has formed a special committee to investigate Aurora's accounting
practices that it expects will result in a non-cash charge to 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The accounting practices immediately under investigation relate primarily to
the accrual of trade promotion expenses in 1999. The committee has also asked
outside advisors to conduct a broader review of accounting practices for earlier
periods.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora's brands include Mrs. Butterworth's, Duncan Hines, Van de Kamp's and
Chef's Choice. The company has grown by acquiring well-known brands and
revitalizing them with marketing support, expanded distribution, and new product
development.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading in Aurora was halted today on the New York Stock Exchange on the
news. Shares closed Thursday at $7.31 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Child witnesses double suicide in Rensselaer County market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HOOSICK, N.Y. (AP) - State police responding to a 911 call arrived at a
Rensselaer County market to find two people dead in an apparent double suicide.
<P>
	   A 5-year-old girl who witnessed the incident has been turned over to family
members.
</P>
<P>
	   According to police, 38-year-old Derek Stacey called 911 at about 10:15 p.m.
Thursday. Stacey reported that his girlfriend had just shot herself and then
hung up.
</P>
<P>
	   When the 911 center called the number back, a child answering the phone said
there had been another shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Police traced the call to Stacey's Market in the town of Hoosick, 28 miles
east of Albany, which is also a residence. Upon arrival, both Stacey and his
girlfriend, 30-year-old Linda Murphy, were found dead of apparent gunshot wounds
to the head.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple is believed to be from Vermont.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators say Murphy shot herself during an argument and that Stacey
shot himself after calling 911.

<HEADLINE> Family speaks out after report clears officer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The family of Aquan Salmon says a racist judicial
system led to the decision that cleared a Hartford police officer in the
shooting death of the 14-year-old.
<P>
	   Norma Watts, 71, said she believes officer Robert Allan should be in jail
for killing her grandson.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I did it, I would never see the streets again," she said. "He never
spent one day in jail. We are the ones suffering."
</P>
<P>
	   The news conference was the family's first since special prosecutor Kevin
Kane issued a 200-page report Wednesday that concluded the shooting was
justified. WTNH-TV reported that only black reporters were invited to attend,
not out of a desire to exlude whites but because the family felt black reporters
would better understand their position.
</P>
<P>
	   Allan shot Salmon early in the morning of April 13 after several teen-agers,
one carrying a lighter shaped like a gun, fled from a car police had been
chasing through the city's north end.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the special prosecutor's report, Salmon had reached toward his
waistband and was turning toward Allan when the officer fired one shot into the
left side of his back.
</P>
<P>
	   "A part of each of us died with him," the grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts said she, along with Minister Naeem Muhammad, of Hartford, plan to
organize the families of others killed by police in Connecticut since 1997,
including Malik Jones, Franklyn Reid, Hector Colon, Jeffrey Grant, Darrell
Holeman and Victoria Cooper.
</P>
<P>
	   Once they are together, Muhammad said he will attempt to force the state
Legislature to change a system that harbors police officers who say they shoot
to kill out of fear for their own lives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fear is not reason to shoot and kill. Why would Allan fear for his life?
Aquan didn't have a gun," Muhammad said. "We need psychologists to look into why
so many officers, statewide and nationally, use statements of fear to justify
killing."
</P>
<P>
	   The family also plans to file a wrongful death lawsuit against Allan.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts did not say what her grandson was doing out after 2 a.m. on a school
night in a car that had been linked to several robberies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regardless to him out on the street, when he'd sneak out of the house, it
didn't give that man no right. He didn't deserve to die," Watts said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors plan to boost charges against former bank employee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The U.S. government said today it plans to boost charges
against a former Bank of New York employee already accused of perjury in a $7
billion Russian money laundering scam.
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Buehler said a rewritten indictment against
Svetlana Kudryavtsev will "expand to some degree the scope of the charges."
</P>
<P>
	   "There were some very recent developments in this case, your honor," Buehler
told U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Buehler did not elaborate. However, Kudryavtsev's lawyer, Charles D. Adler,
said he believed the prosecutor was referring to guilty pleas made Wednesday by
Lucy Edwards, the bank's former vice president in the Eastern European Division,
and her husband, Peter Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair admitted aiding Russian bankers in washing more than $7 billion
through accounts at the bank to avoid taxes in Russia and to cover up the
money's connection to crimes, including $300,000 used as ransom for a kidnapping
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   In her plea, Edwards identified Kudryavtsev, saying the couple paid her $500
a month after they moved from New York to London in 1996 so she could protect
the accounts used for money laundering.
</P>
<P>
	   "She received these payments from us in return for serving as a point of
contact at the Bank of New York in the event there were problems with transfers
and to send my husband account statements so that he could calculate commissions
we were owed," Edwards said during her plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev was an associate in the bank's Eastern European division in
August when she was questioned by the FBI as it investigated several bank
accounts, according to the lone perjury charge in a criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside court today, Kudryavtsev declined to comment a day after pleading
innocent to the charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Adler, though, said the charge resulted from the fact that during an
"unscheduled and difficult interview with non-Russian speaking (FBI) agents, she
made inaccurate statements."
</P>
<P>
	   He said prosecutors would, in addition, "presumably charge her with some
responsibility in the offenses to which Lucy Edwards and Peter Berlin pleaded
guilty."
</P>
<P>
	   He described his client as a low-level employee, an administrative assistant
who developed a friendship with Edwards and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their relationship was not limited to banking," he said. "Their families
visited together. They traveled together. They were very close friends."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the relatively small payments allegedly made to Kudryavtsev by
Edwards and Berlin reflect what little his client would have known.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's quite possible to have no idea what the accounts are for, whose money
it is and why the money was moved," Adler said. "It would be absurd to charge
her as being part of the billion dollar global money laundering enterprise."

on new machines when clearly they did not need to do so," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general said he would file a lawsuit against GE later this
month seeking restitution and damages for customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The company dismissed Spitzer's claim as grandstanding, noting that its
October 1999 recall arrangement was approved by the federal Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are working very hard to communicate effectively about this recall with
our consumers and to satisfy all of them during our implementation," GE
spokesman Terry Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 3.1 million of the defective dishwashers were sold in the 1980s under
the General Electric and Hotpoint labels.
</P>
<P>
	   The defect in the machines was in a slide switch. GE told individuals the
switch could not be fixed and offered them rebates of $75 to $125 toward new GE
or Hotpoint dishwashers. New GE dishwashers at a store in Albany on Thursday
ranged from $399 to $499.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's office said labor would have cost about $75 for the 10-minute
procedure to correct the defect.
</P>
<P>
	   Commercial customers like hotels and landlords were provided with repair
kits, a video explaining how to fix the problem, and a $15 labor allowance.
</P>
<P>
	   GE did not deny treating individuals and businesses differently, and
suggested that was part of its agreement with the CPSC.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety commission, however, said today the fact that GE did not let
customers know the part could be rewired "came as a surprise to us," according
to Alan Schoem, who worked with GE on the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission said they asked GE to offer free repairs, but the company
refused, and the rebate option to consumers was a legal option.
</P>
<P>
	   CPSC officials also said they are investigating whether GE knew about the
defect several years before it reported it to the safety agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's lawsuit will seek restitution and damages for customers whether or
not they took advantage of the rebate.
</P>
<P>
	   The defective models include those made under General Electric and Hotpoint
names with the model numbers GSD500D, GSD500G, GSD540, HDA467, HDA477, and
HDA487. The recalled models also carry the serial number that has a second
letter of A, M, R, S, T, V or Z.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the recall, GE and the CPSC said they were aware of 50
incidents in which the slide switch, which selects the heat drying and energy
save functions, melted and ignited fires. Seven of the fires spread beyond the
dishwashers and three damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> Court Will Hear Colo. River Dispute  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said today it wants to hear arguments
in a Colorado River water-use dispute it has been refereeing intermittently
since 1952.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue are disputed boundary claims and related water rights that have an
impact on users in California and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices scheduled an April 25 argument date to help them determine
whether some 25,000 acres of disputed land are part of the Fort Yuma Indian
Reservation in California.
</P>
<P>
	   If so, the Quechan Indian Tribe is entitled to additional allocations of
Colorado River water each year. The additional water could come from amounts
currently allocated for non-Indian users in California, such as Coachella Valley
Water District and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the case began when Arizona was allowed to ``sue'' California in
the Supreme Court 48 years ago without first having to litigate in a lower
court, the two states now are on the same side of the dispute. On the other side
are the Quechans and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court can invoke its ``original'' jurisdiction and serve as a
trial court for certain cases, most often boundary disputes among states.
</P>
<P>
	   The case's latest incarnation dates back to 1989, and asks the justices to
decide whether the tribe and the federal government are barred from claiming
additional water rights.
</P>
<P>
	   A court-appointed special master, Frank McGarr of Chicago, has recommended
that no additional water rights be granted for the Fort Yuma reservation.
McGarr, a retired federal judge, also recommended that the justices ratify
settlements on water use for the Fort Mojave and Colorado River Indian
Reservations.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Arizona vs. California, 8 Original.

<HEADLINE> Reno Won't Meet With Elian Gonzalez  </HEADLINE>
   By MILDRADE CHERFILS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno denied a request to meet with
Elian Gonzalez during a visit to her hometown Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's relatives had asked Reno to meet with them and the 6-year-old Cuban
boy in hopes she would sympathize with their plight to keep the child in the
United States. She was in town to speak at an awards ceremony for an
organization that provides legal assistance to neglected children.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, an attorney representing the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, wrote a letter to Reno requesting the meeting so the boy and the
relatives can ``make their plea to you, and for you to meet the child whose fate
rests so largely in your hands.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They turned down the meeting,'' Eig said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department said Reno would prefer arranging a meeting with
Elian's relatives in Washington next week so that Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner could also attend, according to a letter
from Associate Deputy Attorney General James Castello.
</P>
<P>
	   But she believes it is ``unnecessary'' for Elian to attend, the letter said,
explaining that the adult relatives could convey any new information that they
want her to hear.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25, clinging to an inner
tube after a boat wreck killed his mother and 10 other people fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's relatives in Miami want to keep him in the United States. His
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is fighting to get him back.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of returning
Elian to his father. Reno has backed that ruling. Eig said Reno might have had a
change of heart if she was able to see Elian with his U.S. relatives, who are
challenging the INS decision in federal court.

<HEADLINE> China Adjusts to New Market Rules  </HEADLINE>
    By ELAINE KURTENBACH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- The Year of the Dragon got off to a roaring start as China's
securities regulators feted the Lunar New Year with new rules intended to boost
the markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Share prices hit record highs Monday, the first trading day after the new
year holiday, on news that brokerages would be allowed to borrow from banks
using stocks as collateral and that investors would have the right to buy
initial offerings of stock before they begin to trade.
</P>
<P>
	   The initial euphoria was punctured, however, by reports this week of plans
for several new share offerings -- news that revived fears the government might
allow a flood of stocks to swamp the market as it tries to raise capital to pay
for reforms of state-owned industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Share prices ended sharply lower Thursday and market indicators for foreign
investors stumbled, with the Shanghai index down 3.91 percent at 39.32 and the
Shenzhen B-share index off 1.60 percent at 87.85. They rose slightly Friday, but
the week's earlier gains had for the most part vanished.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators "are ignoring the rules and laws of the market because they think
they can rule the market. They cannot," said Shawn Xu, an economist with the
investment house China International Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have very good intentions, but unfortunately this is not the right
thing to do."
</P>
<P>
	   For several years now, every time the government has sought to build up the
market in hopes of making it easier for cash-starved, state-owned firms to raise
capital, the attempts have backfired.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators have tended to follow cycles, moving to curb volatility when
prices surge, fearing a speculative bubble, and then struggling to encourage
investment when trading lags. Average share prices have soared more than 24
percent since the beginning of this year, aided by market-bolstering moves over
the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, more than half of the 900-odd listed companies traded by domestic
investors rose as much as regulations allowed while trading volume soared.
</P>
<P>
	   The government then relaxed previous limits that had required a half-day
trading halt after a stock had risen the maximum amount allowed for three
consecutive days. The latest changes permit continued trading of hot stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Under rules set in 1996, local shares were not allowed to fluctuate more
than 10 percent from their previous day's close while shares of companies that
had two consecutive years of losses were limited to 5 percent fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
	   This week's change did not apply to shares that have hit their daily loss
limits. Also exempted were companies with two consecutive years of losses and
firms that have issued loss warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the measures appear likely to ensure the market gyrates with the
unpredictability the Chinese zodiac says is typical of the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
	   "The volatility will still be there. It is really a speculative market,"
said Charles M.L. Cheung, vice president for Asia Pacific Equity Research for
Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheung said he expects the government to continue to introduce reforms to
stimulate the market. Enthusiasm over fast-growing Internet and other high-tech
companies also may help boost prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, the outlook for China's stock markets is overshadowed by poor earnings
and expectations of a steady stream of new share offerings that could soak up
all liquidity, the official newspaper China Economic Times cautioned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given both favorable factors and unfavorable factors, our verdict is that
the foundation isn't stable for a full year bull market," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This year, as long as regulators don't change their thinking, the pressure
from share expansion will be like a sword hanging constantly over the markets."
</P>
<P>
	   The key problem for China's unruly markets is a lack of good investments,
said Xu of China International Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   China's publicly traded companies are in the process of announcing full-year
results for 1999 and the number of businesses with losses for the entire year is
expected to be well above the 89 out of some 900 that posted losses in their
mid-term reports last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's exactly because people are not sure of the quality of the companies
being listed that they worry. The core issue is how to change the management of
state-owned enterprises and improve their efficiency," Xu said.

<HEADLINE> Official Warns on Clinton-Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tensions between Pakistan and India could be aggravated
if President Clinton bypasses Pakistan during his visit to South Asia next
month, Pakistani Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, the new ambassador said her
nation's military rulers are plotting a road map to democracy and economic
stability and welcomed Clinton's offer to mediate Pakistan's dispute with India
over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United States has a declared objective of promoting peace and security
in South Asia,'' Lodhi said. ``He will be defeating that objective if he engages
with only one country. He may unwittingly embolden the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has left the door open to a stop in Pakistan. His planned visit to
India and Bangladesh will be the first presidential visit to the region with
one-sixth of the world's population since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   President Jimmy Carter bypassed Pakistan that year, and Lodhi contended the
decision emboldened the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan in 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United States should be aware of the consequences of a decision not to
visit Pakistan,'' the ambassador said. ``That would be unwittingly sending
signals. There is a law of unintended consequences.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he would base his decision whether to go to Pakistan on what
would best serve U.S. interests in trying to stop a nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he would be willing to mediate between India and Pakistan, Clinton
responded, ``Absolutely, I would.'' Then he added, however: ``Unless we are
asked by both parties to help, we can't get involved.''
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir. Their dispute over the
three-fifths of the Himalayan state under Indian control is considered even more
dangerous now that they both exploded nuclear devices in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   India never has accepted outside mediators. That means the President's offer
to intercede, as he has in the Arab-Israeli dispute and in Northern Ireland, may
be academic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We welcome that offer,'' Lodhi said. ``A half-century of Indo-Pakistani
relations show they are unable to resolve many of their disputes. If the United
States and other nations intervened in Northern Ireland, the Middle East,
Central Europe, why doesn't one of the most dangerous places on Earth warrant
similar intercession?''
</P>
<P>
	   To overcome India's historic aversion, ``it is up to the international
community to persuade India it is in the interest of world peace that India
accept there is a problem in Kashmir, and it needs to be addressed,'' Lodhi
said.	   Force was not the solution, she said. ``Negotiations, talks, dialogue
is the answer,'' Lodhi said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan sent a cabinet minister, Omar Asghar Khan, to Washington this week
to try to neutralize U.S. worries about the training of terrorist groups in
Pakistan-held territory and anti-democratic trends in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The ambassador, who presented her credentials to Clinton two weeks ago, said
the outlook is good for a return to democracy in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf, which seized power last October,
``has come to reform, not rule,'' Lodhi said. ``They have already said local
elected government will be in place before the year is out, and they are trying
to road-map the return of elected officials at provincial and national levels.''
</P>
<P>
	   But before setting dates, she said, ``We want to ensure reforms Pakistan
needs are in place.'' An independent election commission must be established and
voting lists drawn up. ``There is a lot of work to be done,'' Lodhi said.
</P>
<P>
	   And, she said, ``Absolutely, I think the President should go to Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is giving high priority to stopping the spread of nuclear
technology, and Clinton's trip to South Asia is ``an opportunity for the
President to try to arrest the nuclear arms race between the two countries,''
Lodhi said. ``He cannot do that just be engaging one country and not the
other.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Quit Aurora Amid Internal Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Four senior management officials at Aurora Foods Inc.
have resigned as the company prepares to investigate its internal accounting
practices.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said today the following executives resigned: chairman and chief
executive Ian R. Wilson, vice chairman James B. Ardrey, executive vice president
Ray Chung and chief financial officer M. Laurie Cummings.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson and Ardrey also resigned from the company's board of directors, the
company said in a release. Officials at Aurora did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The board has formed a special committee to investigate Aurora's accounting
practices that it expects will result in a non-cash charge to 1999 earnings. It
also said it was having outside advisors conduct a broader review of accounting
practices for prior periods.
</P>
<P>
	   The accounting practices immediately under investigation relate primarily to
the accrual of trade promotion expenses in 1999. The committee has also asked
outside advisors to conduct a broader review of accounting practices for earlier
periods.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora Foods has not yet reported full-year earnings for 1999, but expects
to by March. It also said the accouting investigation should not affect the
company's ability to operate.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in November, Aurora Foods said it expected to report 1999 earnings
between 78 cents to 81 cents per share. According to First Call/Thomson
Financial survey, analysts were expecting 79 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora's brands include Mrs. Butterworth's, Duncan Hines, Van de Kamp's and
Chef's Choice. The company has grown by acquiring well-known brands and
revitalizing them with marketing support, expanded distribution, and new product
development.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading in Aurora was halted today on the New York Stock Exchange on the
news. Shares closed Thursday at $7.31 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama, Karmapa Make Appearance  </HEADLINE>
   By LYNSEY ADDARIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DHARMSALA, India (AP) -- Buddhists danced and drummed Friday at a
celebration for the Dalai Lama, where for the first time the spiritual leader
appeared with a 14-year-old monk who heads one of the most important sects of
Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
	   There was little interaction at the event between the Dalai Lama and the
Karmapa, who fled Tibet last month in order to seek religious instruction denied
him by Chinese authorities. He secretly crossed into India Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dalai Lama smiled and laughed through much of the four-hour ceremony
honoring the 60th anniversary of his enthronement at age 4 as spiritual leader
of Tibetan Buddhists. He briefly tapped the Karmapa's hand as he blessed the
monks and lamas, but little other interaction was seen.
</P>
<P>
	   But close aides said the two have formed a strong bond in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa was among four senior lamas who appeared on the upper pavilion
of the Namgyal Monastery to join the celebration Friday in Dharmsala, seat of
the Dalai Lama's government in exile.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd could not see the ceremony but listened over loudspeakers to the
festivities, which included sharing food, dancing and singing, and the offering
of gifts and prayers for the Dalai Lama's long life.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dalai Lama delivered a message in Tibetan of peace, nonviolence, and
universal brotherhood, the United News of India reported. It said he asked
people to develop goodness in their hearts and share it with others.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dalai Lama broke his personal retreat to hold five meetings with the
Karmapa since his arrival, including a visit Thursday during dress rehearsals
for the ceremony, and a special blessing audience on Tibetan New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa's flight from his monastery has dealt a setback to the Chinese
contention that it respects Tibetan culture and religion. While Chinese
authorities approved his selection as the reincarnation of his predecessor and
he traveled widely in China, the young monk was not allowed to leave or have his
teachers brought to him.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the public audiences he has given since beginning his studies with
senior teachers at Gyuto Monastery outside Dharmsala, the Karmapa said it was
impossible to practice the basic teaching of Buddhism -- compassion -- without
freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been wide speculation about his future role. His Karma Kagyu sect
was once the most politically powerful in Tibet, before the Dalai Lama's sect
assumed ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been fears that during the period between the Dalai Lama's death
and the discovery and education of what the Tibetan Buddhists see as his
reincarnation, a vacuum of political leadership could develop among Tibetan
exiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether or not the Karmapa could fill that role remains to be seen. The
Indian government has not yet decided on his status, although the Dalai Lama has
requested that he be allowed to remain in India.
</P>
<P>
	   Tibetans began to fill up the courtyard between the monastery and the Dalai
Lama's residence before dawn, and not a space was left as they even slipped
beneath the roof and perched on walls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's great that the Karmapa is here. But above all the Tibetans consider
his holiness (the Dalai Lama) the highest. It's great to see everyone
together,'' said Tenzin Tsanchoe, 24, of Dharmsala, adding she had never seen so
many Tibetans in one place before.

<HEADLINE> Bank of NY Charges May Be Expanded  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. government said today it plans to boost charges
against a former Bank of New York employee already accused of perjury in a $7
billion Russian money laundering scam.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Buehler said a rewritten indictment against
Svetlana Kudryavtsev will "expand to some degree the scope of the charges."
</P>
<P>
	   "There were some very recent developments in this case, your honor," Buehler
told U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff at a hearing today.
</P>
<P>
	   Buehler did not elaborate. However, Kudryavtsev's lawyer, Charles D. Adler,
said he believed the prosecutor was referring to guilty pleas made Wednesday by
Lucy Edwards, the bank's former vice president in the Eastern European Division,
and her husband, Peter Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Lucy Edwards, the bank's former vice president in the Eastern
European Division, and her husband, Peter Berlin, pleaded guilty to money
laundering charges, admitting they helped Russian bankers funnel more than $7
billion through the accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said she started the scheme to help launder money after she was
approached by Russian bankers in late 1995. She said she was transferred to
London in 1996 and began paying Kudryavtsev $500 monthly to continue to look
after the money laundering accounts in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "She received these payments from us in return for serving as a point of
contact at the Bank of New York in the event there were problems with transfers
and to send my husband account statements so that he could calculate commissions
we were owed," Edwards said during Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev was an associate in the bank's Eastern European division in
August when she was questioned by the FBI as it investigated several bank
accounts, according to a criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   She was later fired as it became publicly known that the Russians allegedly
moved billions of dollars through the Bank of New York illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege she lied about whether she or her husband had ever
received any money or loans from Edwards or Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside court today, Kudryavtsev, who is free on $30,000 bail, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Adler, though, said the charge resulted from the fact that during an
"unscheduled and difficult interview with non-Russian speaking (FBI) agents, she
made inaccurate statements."
</P>
<P>
	   He said prosecutors would, in addition, "presumably charge her with some
responsibility in the offenses to which Lucy Edwards and Peter Berlin pleaded
guilty."

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Rise Modestly  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices edged up 0.2 percent in January as the
biggest drop in clothing prices in nearly 11 years helped offset rising costs
for fuel oil, gasoline and other energy products, the government said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The modest advance in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, the most
closely watched inflation gauge, was slightly less than the 0.3 percent increase
many analysts were expecting and marked four months in a row in which inflation
stood at 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1.1 percent decline in clothing prices -- the largest drop since February
1989, reflecting post-holiday discounting by retailers to make room for new
merchandise -- helped offset a big 1 percent jump in energy prices and rising
costs for other products.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the "core" rate of
inflation rose 0.2 percent last month, matching many analysts' predictions. That
followed a slim 0.1 percent rise in the core in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The report comes one day after the government said inflation at the
wholesale level was unchanged in January and that core wholesales prices,
excluding energy and food, actually fell 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Both inflation reports suggest that outside the burst in energy costs, most
other prices remain in check. But some economists said the CPI report could set
the stage for bigger price increases in the future. Among other things, they are
worried that rising energy costs will push up other prices. "The tame headline
number hides some real pressures on consumer prices," said economist Joel Naroff
of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street, however, appeared to dwell on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's signal Thursday that interest rates will be raised again. The Dow
Jones industrial average had lost more than 200 points by early afternoon. But
inflation-sensitive bonds rallied on the CPI news. Bond prices rose as the
yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 6.18 percent this morning from 6.22
percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In another report, the Commerce Department today said the 1999 trade deficit
was up a sharp 65.1 percent from the $164.3 billion of a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the trade deficit for last year surged to an all-time high of
$271.3 billion. Deficits with Japan, China, Canada, Mexico and the European
Union all set records.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve has bumped up interest rates four times since June to
slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan, in his twice-a-year report on the economy to Congress on
Thursday, said inflation remains a threat to the economic good times many
Americans are enjoying. His concern: the tight labor market will lead to wage
gains that not blunted by other forces could lead to a sharp run-up in prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Most analysts widely expect the Fed to boost interest rates again on March
21 and believed Greenspan's remarks appeared to support their predications of a
series of rate increases this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1 percent rise in overall energy prices last month was led by a 7.9
percent gain in fuel oil prices, the steepest increase in four years. Gasoline
prices rose 1.6 percent and natural gas prices went up 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Production limits by oil-producing nations and increased demand because of
the cold weather accounted for the increase in energy prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil prices on Monday moved past the $30-a-barrel mark for the first
time since the eve of the Persian Gulf War nine years ago as production cuts
adopted by leading producers squeezed world supply.
</P>
<P>
	   A rebound in energy prices, which had fallen sharply in 1998 as the Asian
financial crisis severely dampened global demand, was the main factor in pushing
up overall consumer prices last year by 2.7 percent, the biggest increase since
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the increase in energy costs, airfares actually fell by 1.4 percent
last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, food prices, fell by 0.1 percent in January, the best showing
since March. Falling prices for vegetables, fruits, dairy products and pork more
than offset rising prices for poultry and beef.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the report, new car prices fell by 0.3 percent in January, the
best performance in almost a year, and prescription drug prices rose 0.2
percent, the smallest increase since November 1998. Tobacco prices, including
cigarettes, rose 1.6 percent, the biggest jump in four months.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Protest US Israeli Support  </HEADLINE>
   By ZEINA KARAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Thousands took to the streets Friday to denounce
Israel and the United States as Lebanon's president threatened to deal Israel
``more painful blows'' if it carried out reprisals against Lebanese civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
	   The main demonstration was largely peaceful, but student demonstrators in a
smaller protest outside the offices of CNN were confronted with tear gas and
sprayed with water.
</P>
<P>
	   Government-sanctioned protests are rare in Lebanon. Friday's was the biggest
protest since a 1993 demonstration against Israeli-Palestinian peace accords
ended with the army killing eight protesters. The government has since banned
most street demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan's King Abdullah II postponed a long-awaited visit to Israel,
reflecting mounting Arab disappointment in Israel's peace policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior Jordanian government officials said Friday that Israel's attacks on
south Lebanon and its deadlocked negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians
have prompted the king to postpone ``indefinitely'' his planned visit, which was
to have been his first since ascending to the throne a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   In Beirut, more than 6,000 people marched peacefully in the early afternoon,
carrying Lebanese flags and those of Hezbollah and Amal, the main guerrilla
groups fighting Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Men and women, many wearing Islamic headscarves, chanted ``Death to
America'' and ``Death to Israel'' as the protest, guarded by several hundred
policemen and army troops, made its way from the Barbir district to downtown
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been trampled on enough times by the Israelis and their American
friends. This is our way of saying we won't take it anymore,'' said Mohammed
Saad, a 31-year-old engineer who participated in the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters burned and stomped on an Israeli flag. They shouted slogans
calling on the government to expel U.S. Ambassador David Satterfield and
criticizing U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who has accused
Hezbollah of being responsible for the latest flare-up in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Satterfield must go'' and ``You old hag, we can't stand your ambassador
anymore,'' they shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrations came amid growing anti-U.S. sentiment sparked by
Washington's perceived backing of Israel in its Feb. 8 airstrikes, which
destroyed three power stations and wounded at least 15 Lebanese civilians.
Israel said the airstrikes were in retaliation for guerrilla attacks against
Israeli soldiers in an occupied zone in southern Lebanon. Seven Israeli soldiers
have been killed since Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   President Emile Lahoud warned in a statement Friday that if Israel targets
Lebanese citizens and civilian infrastructure, it would be putting its own
civilians and installations at risk of attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think that our blows will be more painful in this case,'' Lahoud said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in Beirut, more than 1,500 demonstrators gathered outside the
offices of CNN to protest what they saw as bias in its coverage of the Israeli
airstrikes. A fire engine sprayed water and police fired tear gas canisters as
students scuffled with policemen. Scores were overcome by tear gas and two were
treated by local medics.
</P>
<P>
	   CNN correspondent Brent Sadler told The Associated Press that the students'
comments were aimed mainly at CNN's Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's unfair and baseless, accusing us here in Beirut of not
covering the story objectively,'' he said. ``It is my opinion that we have been
covering the story in a comprehensive way.''

<HEADLINE> U.K.: Nuke Plant Falsified Records  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Workers at a nuclear reprocessing plant deliberately falsified
records relating to the quality of fuel pellets, and the plant has been shut
down until the problem is corrected, the government's safety agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate said it has been unable to determine
why the records were falsified at the Sellafield plant in northwestern England,
operated by British Nuclear Fuels PLC. The inspectorate is part of the Health
and Safety Executive.
</P>
<P>
	   The company faces prosecution over the safety regulations breaches, the
Health and Safety Executive said Friday night. The agency said the lapses did
not compromise the safety of the uranium and plutonium mixed-oxide fuel used in
nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Minister Helen Liddell said the report documented ``serious
management failures'' and noted that she has given company chairman Hugh Collum
two months to develop ``comprehensive and radical suggestions for change.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report speculated that workers may have falsified records because it was
a tedious job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no excuse for process workers not following procedures and
deliberately falsifying records to avoid doing a tedious task. These people need
to be identified and disciplined,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``However, the management on the plant allowed this to happen and since it
had been going on for over three years must share responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   British Nuclear Fuels said it had apologized to its Japanese customer,
Kansai Electric Power Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansai Electric Power Co had planned to use the fuel for an experimental
nuclear power program at a reactor in Takahama, in central Japan, starting in
January. The program was delayed after BNFL disclosed the quality control
problem in December, and Kansai said it would return the fuel.

<HEADLINE> Bass PLC Mulls Sale of Breweries  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Bass PLC, which owns some of Britain's best-known beer
brands, is considering selling its breweries at a time when it is focusing more
on its Holiday Inn and other hotel holdings and expanding its pub chains.
</P>
<P>
	   Bass confirmed Friday that it is weighing "strategic options" for its
brewing business, but said in a letter to the London Stock Exchange that "no
decisions have been taken."
</P>
<P>
	   A Bass official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the strategic
review could result in a sale. Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it might make a
bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Bass also owns the Holiday Inn, Inter-Continental and Crown Plaza hotel
chains and hundreds of pubs.
</P>
<P>
	   Its popular beer brands include Bass Ale and Carling lager.
</P>
<P>
	   Bass refused to say if it was talking with any potential buyers of its six
breweries, including its interests in breweries in China and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   Heineken said Friday that it might make an offer for the business. "Of
course, we are interested," Heineken spokesman Albert Holtzappel told Dow Jones
Newswires in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to divulge any details of possible talks with Bass.
</P>
<P>
	   Bass is reviewing its brewing business at a time when beer consumption in
Britain is waning and the government is investigating possible industry
price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
	   Bass earned 23 percent of its profits last year from sales of beer. Its
return on capital for brewing was a respectable 18.9 percent, but company
spokesman Mark Rigby said the opportunities for growth are better in the hotel
and pub businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Bass is currently expanding its hotel network in Asia and the Pacific
region, and it's adding to its pub holdings in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   It bought 550 pubs from Punch PLC after Punch bested Whitbread PLC in a
furious bidding war last summer for pubs belonging to Allied Domecq PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Bass issued its letter to the stock exchange after investors, reacting to
media speculation that it wanted to sell its brewing operations, bid the
company's share price up almost 8 percent from Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   Bass shares fell later when it became clear that a sale wasn't imminent, and
they ended the day up 1 percent at 701 pence, or $11.29 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Whitbread also rose temporarily on hopes that a Bass sale might
force Whitbread to follow suit to focus on its own hotel and pub businesses.
Whitbread stock surged 7 percent before dropping to 488 pence, or $7.86, a drop
of 2 percent from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The prospect that Bass might sell its breweries dismayed at least one
customer of a central London pub. Peter Watmough, 48, called Bass ale a "class"
product.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sure it would go downhill," he said. "It would be taken over by a
bigger company that wouldn't bother producing it as well as in the past."
</P>
<P>
	   Fellow patron David Fraser, 40, expressed no such concern about Carling. He
dismissed a glass of Carling in front of him as a bottom-of-the-barrel "cooking
lager."

<HEADLINE> India Seizes Time Magazines  </HEADLINE>
   By CHANDRA BANERJEE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) -- India seized 3,000 copies of Time magazine's
upcoming edition in order to black out an interview with the brother of Mohandas
Gandhi's assassin because it could hurt national prestige and cause riots, a
senior customs official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The article ``contains a lot of derogatory and defamatory remarks on Mahatma
Gandhi, the father of the nation, which is injurious to national prestige,''
said Sumit Dutta Mazumdar, commissioner of customs in Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The article also contains statements which have all the ingredients of
sparking communal disharmony'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mazumdar said he personally had stopped the delivery of the Feb. 21 editions
of the magazine and that they would be released once the article had been
blacked out.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian customs law, he said, allows the government to prevent dissemination
``of documents containing any matter which is derogatory to national prestige
and maintenance of public order.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Fathers, Time's New Delhi bureau chief, said: ``One man in Calcutta
is acting as an arbiter on what 2 million Indians should read or not read.''
</P>
<P>
	   The interview with Gopal Godse, brother of Nathuram Godse, was conducted
last year, when Time was considering naming Gandhi as its ``Man of the
Century.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Hindu nationalist, Nathuram was enraged by Gandhi's overtures to Muslims
after the partition of Britain's Indian empire into predominantly Hindu India
and officially Islamic Pakistan. He assassinated Gandhi in 1948.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gopal Godse didn't say anything different to what was contained in his
late brother's statement,'' said Meenakshi Ganguly, the correspondent who
conducted the interview.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement during his trial, before he was sentenced to hang, Nathuram
criticized Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
	   In the interview, Gopal made clear that he subscribed to the view that
Gandhi helped Muslims at the expense of Hindus. Gandhi's peace principle was
``bogus,'' Gopal said, and ``he was encouraging the Muslims to kill Hindus.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also called Gandhi ``the most cruel person for the Hindus in India.''

    	   ROCK HILL, N.Y. (AP) - Frontier Insurance Group on Thursday laid off 71
employees, including 60 from its corporate headquarters here.

<HEADLINE> Presidential primary ballot finally set in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Steve Forbes may still get some votes in New York
for his defunct Republican presidential campaign, even though he has said he
doesn't want the position anymore.
<P>
	   Even though the New Jersey publisher dropped out of the GOP race Feb. 10,
his name will still appear on the March 7 New York primary ballot statewide,
just like Texas Gov. George Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would take a court order to take him off the ballot," said Lee Daghlian,
a spokesman for the state Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge ordered state party officials to put McCain and Forbes on
the ballot after Bush's New York supporters tried to block the two from
appearing in the statewide primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders, most of whom are backing Bush, had hoped to guarantee
him an easy ride through the primary. They had challenged the validity of
McCain's and Forbes' presidential petitions, claiming they should be kicked off
ballots in some districts because of technical problems with their petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. District Judge Edward Korman overruled the challenges and on Feb. 4
ordered the state party to put McCain and Forbes in the primary all over the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes later said he was withdrawing from the race, saying "we were nosed
out by a landslide" after coming in third in the Delaware primary behind Bush
and McCain, who never campaigned in that state.
</P>
<P>
	   But Forbes' withdrawal came after Korman's decision, Daghlian said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The ballots are being printed now, if they haven't been printed already,"
he said. "And no one asked the judge to take Forbes off the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes did not endorse either Bush or McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes will be on the Republican ballot also, although his name will not
be available in four districts in the state, Daghlian said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore, former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley and Lyndon LaRouche will all be on the ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The Green Party also will have a primary on March 7. But the New York Reform
Party's primary has been canceled, Daghlian said. "You can't have a primary if
you don't have two candidates," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Megadeveloper Donald Trump had thought about challenging Reform Party
candidate Pat Buchanan but a judge here threw Trump's delegates off the New York
ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump later announced that he would not run for president.

<HEADLINE> Tax Payments Lead to Budget Surplus  </HEADLINE>
   By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government recorded a budget surplus of $62.15
billion in January helped along by a flow of tax payments into its coffers, the
Treasury Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   That compared with a $70.50 billion surplus posted for January 1999. That
figure was distorted because the Treasury shifted that month's Social Security
payment, which fell on a weekend date, to December.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for January 2000 totaled $189.48 billion, while expenditures came to
$127.33 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The main source of revenue was individual income tax payments, which came to
$111.31 billion compared with $99.86 billion in January 1999. Corporate income
tax payments totaled $5.34 billion in January, up from $5.13 billion in the
corresponding month in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   January's surplus was bigger than the $55 billion many analysts anticipated
and the $60.8 billion projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, in a statement, said the latest numbers ``indicate that
we are on track this year to reach a third consecutive budget surplus. ... These
surpluses will allow us to repay a projected $157 billion in debt this year
alone, bringing the debt reduction over three years to nearly $300 billion.''
</P>
<P>
	   If a surplus materializes as expected for fiscal year 2000, which ends Sept.
30, it would be the first time the government reported three consecutive years
of surplus since 1947, 1948 and 1949.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first four months of fiscal 2000, the government is running a
surplus of $41.53 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration is predicting a $166.69 billion surplus for all
of fiscal 2000, while the CBO sees a $176 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   For fiscal year 1999, the government reported a record surplus of $124.4
billion. The 1999 surplus followed a $69.2 billion surplus in 1998, the first
time the government finished in the black since 1969, and the back-to-back
annual surpluses were the first since 1956 and 1957 under President Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
	   The government did not revise December's surplus of $33.08 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the biggest spending categories were Social Security, $33.48
billion; programs of the Health and Human Services Department, $25.95 billion;
interest on the public debt, $19.69 billion; and military spending, $16.56
billion.

</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fuel oil prices hit a four-year high, but the
surge in gasoline and other energy costs was blunted by the
steepest decline in clothing prices in nearly 11 years as consumer
prices rose a mild 0.2 percent in January. Overall energy prices
rose a sizable 1 percent last month, Labor Department figures
showed today, and some economists believe the resulting higher
energy bills are likely to drive up other product prices in the
coming months.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. trade deficit surged to an all-time
high of $271.3 billion last year, up more than 65 percent from
1998. Deficits with Japan, China, Canada, Mexico and the European
Union all set records. The huge imbalance for 1999 reflected a 33.7
percent jump in the U.S. foreign oil bill as world prices climbed
from $9.19 at the start of the year to $22.67 in December.

``strategic options'' for its brewing business, but said in a

U.S. Attorney Robert Buehler said a rewritten indictment against
Svetlana Kudryavtsev will ``expand to some degree the scope of the

recall. Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said yesterday the company
knew how the dishwashers could be fixed, and provided inexpensive

<HEADLINE> English Musical Wins Olivier Award  </HEADLINE>
    By MATT WOLF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- "Honk! The Ugly Duckling," a modest musical reworking of the
Hans Christian Andersen tale, and American writer Richard Nelson's low-key play
"Goodnight Children Everywhere" were the unexpected winners of best musical and
best play at the Olivier Awards on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oliviers, London's equivalent to Broadway's Tony awards, honor theater,
opera and dance.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson, a resident of Rhinebeck, N.Y., sounded as surprised as the audience
when he stepped to the podium to accept his prize for the play, a family drama
about separation, loss and renewal: "Are you sure you got that right?" he asked
presenter Mal Young. "I'm amazed."
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Drewe, author of the book and lyrics for the prize-winning musical
"Honk!", sounded a similar theme. "I guess the judges couldn't get tickets for
'The Lion King,"' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   The Disney hit had been the frontrunner for that award, along with critic's
darling "Spend," about a real-life woman, Viv Nicholson, who won a fortune in
the early '60s and then lost it all.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbara Dickson won best actress her portrayal of Nicholson. In 1983,
Dickson won an Olivier for playing a similarly gritty northern English woman in
the musical "Blood Brothers," which is still running.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously, I've cornered the market in downtrodden northern women," Dickson
told the celebrity audience. "Don't bother going up for any of (those roles);
they're mine."
</P>
<P>
	   Audience favorite "Mamma Mia!" got a supporting actress nod for the feisty
Jenny Galloway, while "The Lion King" itself snared two prizes -- for Garth
Fagan's choreography and Julie Taymor's costumes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Royal National Theater's remounting of the classic American musical,
"Candide," was named best musical production and won a musical actor prize for
Simon Russell Beale.
</P>
<P>
	   The state-funded National was the day's pre-eminent prize-winner, taking
nine awards in 21 categories.
</P>
<P>
	   A revival of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" won the best actor prize
for Henry Goodman, and Trevor Nunn, who directed that and two other shows, won
best director. The revival of the Victorian-era comedy "Money" won prizes for
best supporting actor and actress in a play for Roger Allam and Patricia Hodge.
</P>
<P>
	   Best actress went to Janie Dee for Sir Alan Ayckbourn's West End comedy,
"Comic Potential," in which Dee plays a robotic performer in cheesy TV soaps.
This was Dee's second Olivier following a 1993 supporting award for playing
Carrie Pipperidge in the American musical, "Carousel."
</P>
<P>
	   The prize constituted a hat trick for Dee, whose performance in the
Ayckbourn play was already lauded at the Drama Critics' Circle earlier this
month and, in November, at the Evening Standard Drama Awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Both top actress winners, Dee and Dickson, were given their prizes during
the curtain calls of their respective shows Thursday night, the evening before
the ceremonies. The feeling was that an element of occasion would enhance the
Olivier program when an edited version of the ceremony is televised Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Joan Plowright, Lord Olivier's widow, presented the outstanding achievement
award to Peter O'Toole for his return to the London stage last fall playing a
famously bibulous magazine columnist in "Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell." Bernard has
died since O'Toole first played the role a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Plowright, presenters included Elaine Paige, Alan Bates, Zoe
Wanamaker, and American TV and film star Jason Priestley, who makes his British
stage debut Feb. 28 in the Broadway play, "Side Man."

<HEADLINE> Sweden Worried About TV Violence  </HEADLINE>
   By KIM GAMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Government officials in this country known for its
sexual liberalism sat down Friday with television executives to examine whether
too much violence is slipping into pornographic films shown on TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue made national headlines after Swedish television aired excerpts
Tuesday of a documentary film called ``The Shocking Truth.'' The documentary
revealed that some of the pornographic movies broadcast on Swedish cable
television after midnight contain scenes depicting violent sex.
</P>
<P>
	   The film was also shown in the Riksdag, or parliament. It has led to calls
to re-examine whether the law forbidding child pornography, violent pornography
and threats of violent sexuality is enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweden, once seen as a bulwark of sexual liberalism, has clamped down in
recent years on commercial and exploitative sex.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I certainly don't think that Sweden should change their liberal views on
sex, but I do think that ... we should demand a responsibility from the porno
industry,'' said Lena Ag, spokeswoman for the women's caucus in the ruling
Social Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
	   But government officials are treading carefully as they approach this
Scandinavian country's highly prized freedom of speech laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not discussing a ban on pornography, but we think it has gone too
far,'' Culture Minister Marita Ulvskog said Friday after she met with executives
of French-based Canal Plus, one of the cable television stations that features
pornographic films.
</P>
<P>
	   Ulvskog declined to comment on what action the ministry would take. She said
it would analyze television stations' policies and the law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are sticking to the rules,'' she said. ``The problem is if the rules
don't work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Canal Plus executives said they have policies against showing violence. They
agreed to step up attempts to develop screening devices for parents who want to
block their childrens' access to sexual programming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are in agreement that it's much more about violence in pornography than
pornography itself,'' Canal Plus chief executive Stefane France said. ``We are
very keen to give our subscribers all the means to control what they see.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down More Than 300  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged Friday, with the Dow down more than 300
points late in the afternoon, after a warning a day earlier from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 309.94 points, or almost 3
percent, at 10,204.63.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow is now off more than 12 percent from its record high closing of
11,722.98, reached Jan. 14. That is a steep enough drop to be considered a
"correction" on Wall Street but not necessarily a sign of the end of the bull
market that began in October 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was off 143.61, or by 3.2 percent, at 4,405.31,
after rising more than 121 points Thursday to a record 4,548.92.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop came despite encouraging figures on inflation. The Labor Department
reported Friday that the Consumer Price Index edged up a smaller-than-expected
0.2 percent in January. Lower prices for clothing helped offset rising costs for
fuel oil and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Greenspan warned the House Banking Committee that higher wages,
driven by the tight labor market, would fuel inflation. He said the Fed will
raise interest rates again this year to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
	   "As Yogi Berra would say, 'It's deja vu all over again,"' said Ned Riley,
chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors. "The same issues,
the same problems the Fed had at the end of last year, it is confronted with all
over again."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said investors were probably worried about holding certain stocks
before a three-day weekend. U.S. stock markets will be closed Monday in
observance of Presidents Day.

<HEADLINE> Snow, rain create slushy mess across New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Just as the last remnants of the last snow storm
were melting away, New Jersey was socked by another winter storm Friday.
<P>
	   The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory with snowfall
projections as high as 6 inches for northern parts of the state. But by
mid-afternoon, the precipitation had changed to rain in most places.
</P>
<P>
	   As the storm rolled in from the Midwest, roads got slippery, many schools
closed early and passengers at Newark International Airport experienced flight
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, though, people took it in stride.
</P>
<P>
	   Waldir Silva, 21, pushed a salt spreader across the parking lot at the
Ramada Hotel near Newark International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, this is nothing," said Silva. "I saw the winter of '94. That was
worse."
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby, Sue Ann Seich, 50, was waiting for an airport shuttle bus, hoping to
catch an afternoon flight back to Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, I didn't call ahead. I'm just taking my chances," said Seich, a
frequent flier. "I've been through this a lot, and I've already slept at an
airport once."
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, there were scattered cancellations at New York's JFK
International Airport, and numerous cancellations and delays at LaGuardia
Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   By 3 p.m., 50 flights were canceled at Newark International Airport,
including 32 inbound and outbound Continental Airlines flights, said Alan Hicks,
spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   There were three-hour delays on most inbound flights and 1 1/2-hour delays
outbound, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Jersey Department of Transportation began calling its crews around 3
a.m. in anticipation of the storm, and 400 salt and sand spreaders were rolling
by 8 a.m. when the snow began falling in the southern portion of the state,
according to a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, police radios crackled throughout the day with reports of
spinouts and collisions on highways throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this time, we're monitoring the change in temperature and concentrating
on salt spreading," Dourgarian said at mid-day. "We're preparing for sleet and
freezing rain and will probably have crews out for the rest of the day and into
the evening."

<HEADLINE> New Croatian President Sworn In  </HEADLINE>
   By EUGENE BRCIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Stipe Mesic took office as Croatia's president
Friday, vowing to open a new road toward genuine democracy for his country after
a decade of authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Lets open a new course for Croatia,'' Mesic sad at his swearing-in
ceremony, promising to invest his whole mind, strength and abilities in a
``joint venture to make Croatia better.''
</P>
<P>
	   The strong international presence at the inauguration -- about 70
dignitaries including heads of state and foreign ministers, among them U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright -- reflected the vast improvement in
Croatia's relations with the outside world after its people chose to discard the
nationalist policies of the late president, Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
	   After the ceremony, Albright described the changes brought by parliamentary
and presidential elections that voted in democratic-minded leaders as ``another
joint step forward in this country.'' She told reporters that President Clinton
had invited Mesic and the new premier, Ivica Racan, to visit Washington sometime
by June.
</P>
<P>
	   And, in an allusion to neighboring Yugoslavia, tightly controlled by
President Slobodan Milosevic, she said she hoped she and the two Croatian
politicians could meet soon in Belgrade ``to celebrate the same democratic
changes.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Austria, and participation of Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party in
government there, Albright said she told Austrian President Thomas Klestil of
her disappointment with political developments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have nothing against the Austrian people, but we are concerned about
the inclusion of the Freedom Party,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Croatia, a left-of-center coalition was voted into power in Jan. 3
parliamentary elections, and the wave of democratic renewal was capped by
Mesic's victory in Feb. 7 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Tudjman, who led Croatia to independence in 1991, ruled until his death on
Dec. 10, 1999. Only low-ranking international officials and one head of state
attended his funeral in a clear show of disapproval toward his authoritarian
style of rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic won power on promises to cut a clean break from the Tudjman era. His
brief and modest inauguration ceremony was in sharp contrast to the long and
pompous fanfare adored by Tudjman.

<HEADLINE> Diet Rite Switches Sweeteners  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Diet Rite soft drinks are packing new sweeteners in a bid
to reverse the brand's prolonged sales slide by giving consumers an alternative
to what they are getting in the major low-calorie sodas.
</P>
<P>
	   The brand's owners have replaced the aspartame commonly used in diet drinks
with a blend of two other sweeteners approved for use in soft drinks less than
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Diet Rite says the blend makes its cola and flavored drinks taste more like
sugared sodas, leaves no aftertaste and lasts longer on the store shelves.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry watchers say it also gives the nearly 40-year-old brand something
to talk about as it competes for consumers' attention with the sugar-free
heavyweights backed by deep-pocketed rivals Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola and Cadbury
Schweppes.
</P>
<P>
	   "No aspartame," the new Diet Rite packages and ads say, referring to the
sweetener also known as Nutrasweet that it has been using along with bigger
rivals like Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
	   Diet Rite shipments that are expected to reach stores in 90 percent of the
nation by the end of March contain a sweetener blend of sucralose and acesulfame
potassium, also known as ace-K. Sucralose is marketed as Splenda by Johnson &AMP;
Johnson's McNeil Speciaty Products unit while ace-K is sold as Sunett by
Nutrinova.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the only major diet soft drink in the country without aspartame,"
said Jeffrey Spencer, senior vice president of marketing for Royal Crown Co., a
unit of Triarc Beverage Group based in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the company wasn't suggesting there is anything wrong with aspartame
although he noted that beverages with the ingredient must carry a cautionary
note for people with the rare genetic disease phenylketonuria.
</P>
<P>
	   The print ads feature covers of fictional magazines like Staying Fit and
Active Life that promise stories like "How to cut out aspartame and still enjoy
great taste" and "Why bloat? Leave the sodium behind."
</P>
<P>
	   A Diet Rite can with a redesigned label is shown in the lower left corner.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer said the new sweetener blend adds to the "healthier halo" he has
been trying to create for Diet Rite, which also contains no sodium or caffeine.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry watchers say the new sweeteners could revitalize the diet drink
segment which has been losing customers to bottled waters, teas and fruit
drinks, allowing beverage makers to concoct their own blends.
</P>
<P>
	   "Then everybody can make a claim they are different from the others," said
Tom Pirko, head of the consultant Bevmark Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepsi-Cola Co., for example, uses a blend of ace-K and aspartame in Pepsi
One introduced in late 1998. Coca-Cola Co. added ace-K to the aspartame in its
Diet Cherry Coke, Diet Sprite and Fresca brands last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Royal Crown already uses sucralose as the lone sweetener in its Diet RC
Cola, a sister brand to Diet Rite. Diet RC, which is available in less than half
the country, saw its sales surge 33 percent last year, Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diet Rite could use a lift. Its products, in addition to a cola has 14
flavored drinks including red raspberry, tangerine and white grape.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of the entire line have declined every year since 1991, falling more
than 46 percent, figures from the trade publication Beverage Digest show.
</P>
<P>
	   Diet Rite accounted for about 0.3 percent of the estimated $58 billion
carbonated soft-drink market in the U.S. in 1999, Beverage Digest said. Diet
Coke alone accounted for 8.5 percent of the market and Diet Pepsi 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to take more than a sweetener change to make a brand
successful," said Gary Hemphill of the consulting firm Beverage Marketing Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   The key target for Diet Rite is women over 25 years old, and Spencer said he
will try to reach them via print ads in magazines like People, Prevention and
Healthy Living and in radio commercials. Blum Group of New York is the ad
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer will also use direct mail and the Internet to reach prospective
customers, physicians and nutritionists.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Diet Rite will spend "a couple million dollars" on advertising this
year, starting in March magazines. That is far less than the big rivals but is
up from virtually nothing last year, Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The objective is to start growing again," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down More Than 300  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as a good report on inflation
failed to calm investor nerves about interest rates following Thursday's warning
from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   In late afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 253.17
at 10,260.40 after having been down more than 300 points in earlier trading. The
blue chip index is down more than 12 percent from its Jan. 14 high of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
	   After gaining ground all week, the Nasdaq composite index was down 110.42 at
4,438.50. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, the market's broadest indicator, was
down 37.63 at 1,350.62.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department said today January's Consumer Price Index edged up a
smaller than expected 0.2 percent as lower clothing prices helped offset rising
fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
	   But the report did little to comfort investors after Greenspan told Congress
Thursday that higher wages, driven by the tight labor market, would lead to a
rise in inflation. He warned that the Fed will raise interest rates again this
year after four increases over the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-eight of the 30 Dow stocks were down, led by International Paper, off
2  3/4 to 39 3/4 and IBM, down 4 to 113.
</P>
<P>
	   Although technology stocks have withstood fears about higher interest rates,
they joined in the market's tumble today.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, big decliners were led by Novell, down 9 7/16 to 34  1/4
after the computer network software company fell short of analysts' estimates.
Amazon.com was down 3  5/8 at 65  3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   "As Yogi Berra would say, 'It's deja vu all over again,"' said Ned Riley,
chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors. "The same issues,
the same problems the Fed had at the end of last year, it is confronted with all
over again."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Colombians Hold Human Rights Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Leftist Colombian rebels and government officials brought
their secretive peace talks to Geneva on Friday, discussing human rights at the
headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're very happy with the discussion we held today,'' ICRC President Jakob
Kellenberger said. ``I greatly appreciated the spirit of openness in this
discussion on humanitarian law.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It appeared to us that there is a real interest in this law on both
sides,'' he said, adding that the ICRC is ready to provide experts on the
subject for peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting with guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
known as FARC, and the Colombian government's peace commissioner was the latest
stop on a European tour aimed partly at gaining European support for the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombian peace commissioner Victor G. Ricardo said the two sides had asked
for ICRC expertise ``on international humanitarian law, on its differences with
human rights -- their differences and similarities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chief FARC negotiator Raul Reyes -- who has shed his camouflage fatigues for
a business suit during the tour that began Feb. 2 and has included stops in
Stockholm, Oslo and Rome -- said he hoped for clarity on the issue ``because in
my country, this unfortunately is not clear.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least 30,000 people have died in Colombia's 35-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   Many in Colombia have been critical of President Andres Pastrana's decision
to pursue peace talks with the 15,000-strong guerrilla army without first
obtaining a cease fire.

<HEADLINE> Cyanide Levels in Danube Said Down  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Romania (AP) -- Cyanide levels have diminished in the Serbian part
of the Danube to the point that only one recent sample was above acceptable
drinking levels, U.N. environmental officials said Friday. Their report came
more than two weeks after a spill at a gold mine.
</P>
<P>
	   And in another sign that the pollution was becoming less dangerous, Serbia's
Agriculture Minister on Friday revoked its ban on drinking and otherwise using
the waters of the Danube and Tisza rivers, saying toxic substances in both had
dropped below dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the extent of the improvement remained unclear, with the Romanian
Ministry of Environment saying earlier in the day that contamination levels of
cyanide and heavy metals in the Danube were measured at three times acceptable
European Union standards.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't clear, however, if the reports from Serbia and the U.N. conflicted
with those from Romania or whether different standards were being used.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement carried by the Fonet news agency, the Serbian ministry said
that cyanide was found only in ``traces'' of water samples taken Thursday. And
the U.N. environmentalists said that of 18 samples taken from the Danube as it
left Serbia and flowed into Romania, only one was slightly above the maximum for
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned about the cyanide levels which are certainly still some
risk for the aquatic life,'' said the head of the U.N. team, Pekka Haavisto.
``But fortunately only one of the samples was found above the limit for drinking
water.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another member of the team, Peter Literathy, said analysis of other possible
poisons released with the cyanide, notably heavy metals, would be available at
an unspecified later date.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists have called the spill Europe's worst river disaster in a
decade, and the EU has called for an international commission to help with
cleanup. The United Nations also plans to send a team of experts to assess the
damage to the Tisza and Danube rivers in Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill said Friday Australia would help
with clean up the rivers, as the Australian mining company Esmeralda Exploration
is a major partner in the Baia Mare gold mine, where the spill originated.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 30, a containment dam broke at the mine, sending an estimated 100
tons of cyanide and tons of toxic heavy metals pouring into streams, passing
through Hungary and Yugoslavia via the Szamos and Tisza rivers before returning
to Romania on the Danube.
</P>
<P>
	   Literathy said that ``all fish practically died,'' in the Tisza before the
poison started diluting in the much larger Danube.
</P>
<P>
	   Janos Goenczy, the Hungarian official appointed to coordinate his country's
efforts to deal with the spill and its impact, told the state MTI news agency of
Hungary that it would take a year or two for life to return to the Tisza at ``a
humanly acceptable level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tests taken Friday morning at a dam near the city of Drobeta Turnu-Severin,
170 miles west of Bucharest, showed cyanide levels three time above the
acceptable EU standard and 14 times the Romanian norms, said Gheorghe
Constantin, of the Romanian Ministry of Environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Romanian environmentalists found high concentrations of copper, chrome, zinc
and iron in the Danube farther upriver Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Geneva-based World Health Organization expressed concern about the
presence of toxic metals in the water that experts fear could have an additional
impact on human health and called for a review of environment and health
regulatory standards related to precious metal mining in Europe.

<HEADLINE> US Air: Boeing Withheld Test Info  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- US Airways officials have accused Boeing Co. of withholding
flight test data they say could have prevented a plane crash near Pittsburgh in
1994 that killed all 132 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   In court documents unsealed this week in Chicago, the airline said the test
data involved the Boeing 737's flying characteristics at a certain speed.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board ruled last year that a rudder
reversal probably caused the 737 to crash into a gully near Aliquippa, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the crash, airlines have instructed their pilots to fly the 737 faster
when first deploying flaps to give themselves more time to correct problems that
can't be fixed at slower speeds. The higher speed was officially adopted into
Boeing's 737 operating manual last March.
</P>
<P>
	   The court documents included depositions from US Airways officials. The
documents were part of a petition filed by attorneys for families of two of the
crash victims. The families are seeking punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
	   James Gibbs, who was flight manager for USAir -- now US Airways -- at the
time of the crash, was quoted as saying that if Boeing had not withheld the
data, the crew would have been able to fly out of the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing denied the US Airways allegations and said the information was made
available to the Federal Aviation Administration when the airplane was being
certified in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have always been upfront and honest with the FAA," said Mike Denton,
former chief engineer for the 737.

<HEADLINE> Drought Devastates Parts of Brazil  </HEADLINE>
   By HAROLD OLMOS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEZERROS, Brazil (AP) -- A ``real rain'' -- two inches or more -- is so rare
in Brazil's arid northeast that residents count the intervals in years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is 2 1/2 years,'' says Pedro Pereira, the agriculture secretary in this
remote northeastern town, ticking off the time on his fingers.
</P>
<P>
	   Chronic drought has devastated Brazil's ``sertao,'' or northeastern outback,
for as long as anyone can remember, and is a key reason the region remains the
poor, undernourished cousin of Brazil's prosperous southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, some northeasterners are looking for new strategies in the daily
struggle for water.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest project is a low-cost, Israeli hydroponics method, which
irrigates crops grown inside long trays of nutrient-rich soil with a steady
stream of water dripped through hoses with tiny holes bored in the sides. Any
excess water is recycled, collected in buckets and pumped back into the hoses.
</P>
<P>
	   A demonstration of the method at a farm in Bezerros produced protein-rich
animal feed in just nine days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Horses, cows, pigs, chickens all like it,'' Pereira said. ``The return in
animal protein is fantastic. It could be the solution for agribusiness in the
northeast.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some ranchers are already using the system, including Bezerros Mayor Lucas
Carneiro Soares Cardosa, who got the idea from irrigation projects he saw on a
visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   It requires a small electric generator and costs about $1,000 -- an
unattainable fortune for many in Bezerros, where few make even the minimum wage
of $77 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   For such have-nots, water remains a luxury.
</P>
<P>
	   Just outside town, Sebastiao Silva, a pensioner in his 60s, scrambled for
bottles, buckets, jars, any receptacle within reach. Water was dripping from a
leaky pipe on a tank truck filling a community cistern and he didn't want to
miss a drop. Peddlers were charging 1 real -- 85 cents -- for 10 gallons needed
for a bath.
</P>
<P>
	   ``God has opened this hole for me,'' he mumbled, collecting the water in a
bucket. He looked sadly at the spilled water being quickly absorbed by the sandy
ground. ``It is a sin to have this precious water wasted. Anyway, tonight
everybody at home will have an extra water ration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the United Nations Conference to Combat Desertification met in
Recife, the capital of Pernambuco state 1,100 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro,
and called for renewed efforts to fight drought. The main targets were those
caused by man through land overuse, poor irrigation, forest burning and massive,
unplanned settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say that expanding deserts shrink the amount of arable land
worldwide by as much as 23,000 square miles a year -- an area the size of West
Virginia. They estimate annual losses from such desertification at $300 million
in Brazil, and $42 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Northeastern Brazil contains the world's single biggest mass of semiarid
land, almost 386,000 square miles. Drought has driven millions to big cities,
creating more pressure on housing and public services.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those who stayed was Cicera Maria Farias Silva, the leader of a group
of landless peasants in Bezerros. Their dream seemed about to come true in 1998,
when the government gave 50 families title to 2,750 acres of land.
</P>
<P>
	   The first thing they did was drill a well. But after spending some $2,500,
all they found was salty water, which is not uncommon in semiarid regions like
the sertao. They drilled deeper, but the water was bitter and even saltier.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, they gave up and went looking for a desalinator. But the
equipment cost nearly $13,000 and they couldn't muster the guarantees for a bank
loan.
</P>
<P>
	   Silva is confident that, ``with a lot of patience,'' they eventually will
get the loan. In the northeast, patience is a tool of daily life.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 500 miles to the north, the little rain that fell on Ceara state last
year wasn't enough to save Iraucuba's town pond, once a source of income for
local fishermen.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of fish now rot in the pond's thick, green mud, the stench
drifting on the afternoon wind.
</P>
<P>
	   Cicero Conceicao da Silva used to fish there, catching up to 10 pounds of
fish daily. Now he gets up at 4 a.m. and walks two hours to a lagoon, where he
catches far less. Customers are fewer and prices are low.
</P>
<P>
	   From his two-room adobe shack, cradling one of his two children, da Silva
reminisces about life before the latest drought.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were customers waiting for the catch and they paid a fair price,''
he said, his eyes bloodied red from eight hours in the sun. ``Now I have to sell
on the street and get whatever I can. If they pay me three reals a kilo (78
cents a pound), it's a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Former Poughkeepsie political boss enters plea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A former Dutchess County Republican chairman
accused of running a six-year extortion scheme pleaded guilty Friday to a
federal felony charge.
<P>
	   William Paroli Sr., 71, admitted in federal court that he conspired with
others to extort payments from companies wanting to do business in the Town of
Poughkeepsie. The surprise plea deal closes a chapter in a three-year federal
probe that has rattled Poughkeepsie and resulted in five previous convictions.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew what I was doing was wrong and illegal," Paroli told U.S. Magistrate
Judge Mark Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli had been strenuously maintaining his innocence in the face of a trial
next month on a 19-count federal indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   He was accused last May of controlling a scheme in which town officials
shook down businesses for thousands of dollars in return for favorable
treatment. Prosecutors allege that Paroli - a large man with a robust manner -
used his posts as the county and town GOP leader to dominate town government.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted on all counts, Paroli could have faced more than 200 years in
prison. With his deal to plead guilty on a single count, he could face 15 to 21
months in prison when he is sentenced May 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Paroli faces a maximum sentence of 20 years, Fox said he would
recommend acceptance of the plea to the sentencing judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli also agreed to: pay a fine of $4,000 to $40,000; perform 15 hours a
week of community service during his supervised release from prison; pay up to
$20,000 in restitution to the town; refrain from engaging in partisan politics
during his supervised release; immediately quit his job as county elections
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're quite pleased with the result," U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said
after the plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli quit his partisan posts, but had resisted calls from Republican Gov.
George Pataki to resign his for-pay commissioner's job.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials had been investigating the workings of Poughkeepsie's town
government since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the people implicated in the scandal was tax assessor Basil Raucci,
who was found drowned in the Hudson River after FBI agents approached him in
October 1997. His death was ruled a suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Another ensnared official was former water department head Fred Andros, who
pleaded guilty last May to a federal count of conspiracy. Andros has since been
charged by county prosecutors with second-degree murder in the shooting death of
the town's personnel director.
</P>
<P>
	   Andros, recovering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his chin, pleaded
innocent to the murder charge Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli admitted in court Friday to conspiring with Andros and Raucci to
extort payments.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've substantially broken the back of corruption in the Town of
Poughkeepsie," White said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the probe was continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli was released on his own recognizance to await sentencing. He did not
speak to reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli is the second former county GOP leader in suburban New York City area
to plead guilty in federal court this month. Suffolk County Republican Chairman
John Powell pleaded guilty Friday to racketeering and also admitted that he had
taken bribes for access to a town landfill in the extortion case.

<HEADLINE> Iran Voters' Fashion Is Political  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Neckties were out in force and plenty of hair peeked
out from under women's head scarves at polling booths around Tehran Friday,
where many of the fashion statements were political too.
</P>
<P>
	   It has been more than 20 years since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, when the
clergy came to power here and Western dress was declared un-Islamic. Neckties
were seen as signs of decadence and makeup became taboo.
</P>
<P>
	   But since President Mohammad Khatami started his campaign in 1997 to grant
social freedoms, Iranians have become bolder in their fashion choices. Wearing a
necktie has become almost an affirmation of a man's liberal politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Iranians with such sensibilities were out in force Friday, when voters were
expected to give reformists a majority in Iran's parliamentary elections and
strengthen Khatami's chances of pushing through reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   In a wealthy Tehran neighborhood, five young friends -- all wearing neckties
-- came to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, anybody will know who we are voting for. We are of course voting for
candidates who support Khatami,'' said Barbod Babak, 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Although ties were never declared illegal here, people in the 1980s and
early 1990s rarely wore them for fear of being branded pro-Western -- a sure way
to attract retribution.
</P>
<P>
	   Naveed Saodati, 23, said he has a collection of about 20 ties, all bought in
Tehran clandestinely. He said he used to sport ties only at private parties to
avoid confrontation with authorities. Now, he said, ``it is no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Until a few years ago, special courts set up by the Islamic clergy imposed
nominal fines on women who wore makeup. Today, smartly attired women with
lipstick and mascara are a common sight on streets in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islamic veil, or hijab, includes the still-mandatory head covering. But
scarves -- sometimes colored and often pushed back over the head by the young --
are deemed sufficient now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't have a problem with hijab, but I don't understand why we can't
have boyfriends,'' said Bita, a university student who did not want to give her
full name. She admitted to having a secret boyfriend whom she was meeting after
casting her vote for the reformists.

<HEADLINE> Snow, rain create slushy mess across New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Just as the last remnants of the last snow storm
were melting away, New Jersey was socked by another winter storm Friday.
<P>
	   The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory with snowfall
projections as high as 6 inches for northern parts of the state. But by
mid-afternoon, the precipitation had changed to rain in most places.
</P>
<P>
	   As the storm rolled in from the Midwest, roads got slippery, many schools
closed early and passengers at Newark International Airport experienced flight
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, though, people took it in stride.
</P>
<P>
	   Waldir Silva, 21, pushed a salt spreader across the parking lot at the
Ramada Hotel near Newark International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, this is nothing," said Silva. "I saw the winter of '94. That was
worse."
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby, Sue Ann Seich, 50, was waiting for an airport shuttle bus, hoping to
catch an afternoon flight back to Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, I didn't call ahead. I'm just taking my chances," said Seich, a
frequent flier. "I've been through this a lot, and I've already slept at an
airport once."
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, there were scattered cancellations at New York's JFK
International Airport, and numerous cancellations and delays at LaGuardia
Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   By 3:30 p.m., over 80 flights were canceled at Newark International Airport,
said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark had delays of up to five hours on arrivals and one hour on
departures, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Jersey Department of Transportation began calling its crews around 3
a.m. in anticipation of the storm, and 400 salt and sand spreaders were rolling
by 8 a.m. when the snow began falling in the southern portion of the state,
according to a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, police radios crackled throughout the day with reports of
spinouts and collisions on highways throughout the state.
</P>

	   "At this time, we're monitoring the change in temperature and concentrating
on salt spreading," Dourgarian said at mid-day. "We're preparing for sleet and
freezing rain and will probably have crews out for the rest of the day and into
the evening."

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Cuts Costs With Layoffs  </HEADLINE>
   By ZAHID HUSSAIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Looking to revive a stalled economy, Pakistan is
overhauling its banking sector and laying off workers at state-run companies,
Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to do this to try to get these companies running at a profit.
Right now they are taking huge losses,'' Aziz told reporters in the southern
port city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
	   When he threw out the elected government last year, Army Chief Gen. Pervez
Musharraf accused ousted premier Nawaz Sharif of driving the country to economic
ruin. He promised to restore investor confidence and revive the shattered
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Aziz heads the government's finance team, which has been given that task.
But the job ahead is a difficult one, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reforms program started by the government will take time to show
results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's National Accountability Bureau has recovered millions in
outstanding loans that borrowers never paid back, he said. To jump-start reforms
in the banking sector, he said, the army-led government is beginning by
appointing new executives.
</P>
<P>
	   International lending agencies have been critical of Pakistan's banking
sector. They have accused it of being misused by the country's rich and
influential, who have taken loans and not repaid them or offered collateral far
below the value of the loans.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been some encouraging economic signs in recent months, Aziz said.
He pointed to recent increases in exports and tax collections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't say it is a turnaround, but they are good indicators,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tanker Leaves Omani Waters  </HEADLINE>
   By SAEED AL-NAHDI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) -- A Russian tanker unloaded its cargo and was released
Friday, more than two weeks after the vessel was detained by the U.S. Navy for
allegedly smuggling Iraqi oil in violation of U.N. sanctions, a Foreign Ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Volga-Neft-147 and its crew, including 17 Russians and an Iraqi, left
Omani waters Friday evening, said Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Syed Badr bin
Hamad al-Busaidi.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the rusty 30-year-old tanker began unloading its oil through
jetty operation, which involves transferring oil to another tanker for storage
at Oman's Al-Fahal port. The unloading was finished earlier Friday, al-Busaidi
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He did not say where the tanker was heading.
</P>
<P>
	   The tanker was seized Feb. 2 in the Gulf of Oman off the United Arab
Emirates on suspicion it was carrying Iraqi oil. Military personnel on the USS
Monterey cruiser stopped and boarded the ship after it failed to respond to
routine queries. The tanker was sent to Oman, where technical problems stalled
the unloading of 4,000 tons of oil cargo aboard the ship.
</P>
<P>
	   Omani authorities had said they would allow Volga-Neft-147 and its crew to
leave once the alleged contraband cargo was unloaded.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has backed off its initial denials that the vessel could have been
carrying illicit Iraqi oil. But it said more tests were needed, and commissioned
a Swiss firm to conduct the tests. In Moscow, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said
Thursday he could not comment on those tests.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States said tests confirmed that the tanker was carrying Iraqi
crude in violation of U.N. sanctions that bar Baghdad from selling oil
unilaterally. The cargo is to be auctioned off, and some of the proceeds are to
be used to pay for the U.N. sanctions monitoring operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is allowed to sell oil only under U.N. financial controls, with
proceeds used for funding humanitarian programs and Gulf War reparations. The
sanctions cannot be lifted until the U.N. Security Council certifies Iraq is
free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia supports steps that would lead to lifting the embargo.

<HEADLINE> Tribe demands meteorite at center of new planetarium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - When the Museum of Natural History's new planetarium
opens Saturday, the 16-ton Willamette Meteorite will be sitting in a place of
honor, propped on a steel pedestal specially imbedded in the main hall.
<P>
	   But a group of American Indians says the meteorite is a holy tribal object
and has made a claim under federal law for the behemoth from space - about the
size of a small car - to be returned to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
	   The meteorite hit Earth more than 10,000 years ago and was moved by glacial
ice to a hillside in West Linn, Ore. The Clackamas tribe adopted it as a sacred
object, and the rain water that collected in its deep craters was prized for its
holiness.
</P>
<P>
	   "Songs given to us by the meteorite are still sung today," said Ryan Heavy
Hand, a consultant to the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde, which includes
the Clackamas.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the meteorite called "Tomanoas" by the Indians embodies three
heavenly realms - sky, earth and water. Clackamas youths were sent on vigils to
the meteorite to await messages from the spirit world and other tribes also made
pilgrimages, said Heavy Head, a Blackfoot.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grand Ronde submitted a claim for the meteorite to the museum last
September, acting under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation
Act. The federal law gives the museum until Feb. 29 to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Ann Conty, a museum spokeswoman, would not comment on the Indian claim. But
she and an architect of the new building made clear that it would not be easy to
move the meteorite from the planetarium, officially the Rose Center for Earth
and Space.
</P>
<P>
	   "Because the meteorite is so massive, parts of the facility had to
essentially be built around it," Conty said
</P>
<P>
	   The meteorite had sat in the old planetarium since 1935 and was moved with a
large crane when that building was dismantled. Two years before the new center
was finished, contractors installed three structural piles - 60-foot tubes
driven into the ground - just to support the meteorite's bulk.
</P>
<P>
	   "The meteorite had to go in first," said Todd Schliemann, one of the
architects who worked on the Rose Center. "It went in before the planetarium
sphere, before the building's glass housing, before the walls."
</P>
<P>
	   When asked if the meteorite could be moved, Schliemann said, "We could find
a way, but we would have to disassemble a large portion of the building.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a permanent fixture," he added. "It landed there, and there it will
stay."
</P>
<P>
	   When tribal representatives visited in September, they "had quite a problem
getting in to see the meteorite," Heavy Hand said in a telephone interview from
his home in Salem, Ore.
</P>
<P>
	   Over six days, he and his wife Adrienne took thousands of pictures
documenting objects in the museum for possible repatriation. He said the museum
staff was "civil but not necessarily cooperative" when he asked to see the
meteorite.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had to remind them that we had a federal grant behind us," he said.
"Eventually they gave us hard hats and let us in, but when we started taking
pictures, they freaked."
</P>
<P>
	   The Willamette Meteorite changed hands several times before the museum
acquired it in 1906. A part-time miner named Ellis G. Hughes discovered it in
1902 on land belonging to an iron company, moved it into his barn and began
charging a quarter for admission.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1905, a state Supreme Court returned the meteorite to the iron company;
it was then bought for $20,600 by a New York woman, Mrs. William Dodge, who
donated it to the museum.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim McKeown, who oversees Indian claims for the National Park Service, said
proof of ownership could decide the case of the meteorite or the two parties
could reach agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   But McKeown said if the case goes to a federal review committee or to court,
it may take time. He noted the fight over Indian claims to the Kennewick Man in
Washington state has dragged on virtually since the discovery of the skeletal
remains in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy Hand said he does not expect a harmonious exchange given the effort
and expense devoted to building the meteorite into the Rose Center.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a good thing that it traveled to the museum," he said. "Their
ownership was essential to its safety. But now it needs to come home."

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Balloons to New High  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit widened by more than $100 billion
last year, reaching a record of $271.3 billion, the government said Friday. The
booming U.S. economy pushed up demand for foreign goods, and the cost of
imported oil more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department also reported trade deficits with Japan, China,
Canada, Mexico and the 15-nation European Union all set records in 1999. The
overall deficit rose by 65 percent from the previous record, 1998's imbalance of
$164.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade deficit narrowed a slight 5.7 percent to $25.5 billion in December
as exports climbed by a solid 3.2 percent to outpace a 1 percent gain in
imports.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, U.S. exports were up 2.7 percent to $958.5 billion, an
improvement from an export decline of 0.5 percent in 1998. But this small gain
was swamped by a 12 percent rise in imports, which soared to $1.23 trillion last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration drew comfort from the fact that export sales are
beginning to bounce back as overseas nations recover from the steep recessions
brought on by the 1997-98 global currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   "Continued economic recovery abroad has spurred our exports in late 1999,
particularly in December. If this trend continues, it bodes well for our trade
balance," said Commerce Department chief economist Lee Price.
</P>
<P>
	   But opponents of President Clinton's trade policy pointed to the
back-to-back record annual deficits as evidence that the administration's trade
strategies are not working to open export markets or protect U.S. workers from a
flood of cheap imports. Critics pointed out that despite the overall economic
boom, manufacturing lost 341,000 jobs in 1999 alone.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we let our trade deficit continue to skyrocket in 2000, we're likely to
see more job losses," warned Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   America's trade gap is certain to be a debating point when Congress takes up
Clinton's request to grant China normal trade relations on a permanent basis in
exchange for China's pledge to lower its high barriers to U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the big rise in the deficit was led by a 33.7 percent jump
in oil imports to $65.7 billion, up $43.4 billion from 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase was totally reflected in a huge jump in domestic oil prices.
After a big drop in world oil prices in 1998, a reflection of slumping demand,
crude oil rose from $9.19 per barrel last January to $22.67 per barrel in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts predicted more bad news on this front as the spot crude oil price
topped $30 this week for the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   As U.S. farmers and manufacturers suffered from the loss of overseas markets
brought on by 1997-98 global financial crisis, U.S. consumers reaped the benefit
of a flood of cheaper goods coming into this market, which has helped hold down
inflation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers,
declared that the "worst should be over by midyear" in terms of widening
deficits.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the world economy picking up speed, ... it will actually be possible
to achieve an export boom in 2001 and beyond," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   By country, the United States suffered its largest deficit with the
perennial front-runner, Japan, a record imbalance of $73.9 billion, up 15.5
percent from a $64 billion deficit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The deficit with China was close behind at $68.7 billion, an increase of
14.6 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other record deficits were with Canada, at $32.1 billion; Mexico, $22.8
billion; and the 15-nation European Union, $43.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the higher oil bill, America's rising trade deficit reflected
an increase in the imbalance of imports over exports for cars and trucks, up $25
billion, and computers and office machines, up $7.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain makes for messy travel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A winter storm mixing snow, sleet and freezing
drizzle on Friday stranded air travelers and stalled motorists, while giving
many workers and students an early start to the Presidents Day holiday weekend.
<P>
	   Dozens of downtown workers left offices early to get a jump on the storm
before snow turned to sleet and freezing rain making for slick roads later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm a wimp," joked Donna Thayer of Burlington.
</P>
<P>
	   She left work about an hour early, expecting the commute home to take longer
than the usual 35 minutes. "It's all uphill," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some state agencies sent workers home early Friday. Personnel at the
governor's office were allowed to leave at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   For others, the holiday weekend got off to a sluggish start.
</P>
<P>
	   Icy conditions at Bradley International Airport led to flight delays in the
early afternoon, with most delays caused by storm conditions in other parts of
the country, said Chris Failla, assistant airport operations specialist.
</P>
<P>
	   A series of minor car accidents beginning early Friday afternoon snarled
traffic on the Merritt Parkway, said state police spokesman Lt. Ralph Carpenter.
Injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Minor accidents were reported across the state, with afternoon traffic down
to a crawl in some areas.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're expecting a busy Friday afternoon as it is, with holiday travelers,
the weather makes it more so," said John Carey, storm monitor for the Department
of Transportation. "All crews are out there."
</P>
<P>
	   Schools across the state canceled or postponed classes, giving youngsters an
extra day to enjoy the long weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Ski Sundown in New Hartford was busy, with many families spending a day on
the slopes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have had a good, busy day," said Chad Christie, marketing director. "I
think the anticipation of snow makes people excited."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Office of Emergency Management was activated at 1 p.m. Friday,
said Paul Gibb, lead planning analyst. Several state agencies, including the
DOT, the Red Cross and the state police assembled at the headquarters in the
state armory ready to brace the storm.

<HEADLINE> Zero Tolerance Disparity Noted  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wide racial disparities exist in the numbers of school
children disciplined under zero tolerance programs, but that does not
necessarily mean racism is at work, as critics like Jesse Jackson claim, an
Education Department official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said he is concerned
the numbers provide evidence that get-tough punishments used in America's
classrooms may be applied unfairly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not saying the disparities are proof of anything, but there is at
least smoke,'' Harvard University law professor Christopher Edley said at a
commission hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments came in response to figures showing that for the 1997 school
year, black children made up 17 percent of all U.S. students but 32 percent of
those suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   Hispanics made up 14 percent of students and 13.5 percent of those
suspended, while whites accounted for 63 percent of students and 51 percent of
those suspended, according to Education Department figures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A numerical disparity does not by itself prove discrimination,'' Norma
Cantu, assistant secretary of education for civil rights, told the commission.
Cantu said the disproportionately high suspension rate for black students
predates new zero tolerance policies and goes back as far as the mid 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   In the same way mandatory minimum sentences and three-strike sentencing laws
have been used widely as a no-nonsense way to battle crime, zero tolerance
policies in schools have grown since the 1994 Gun-Free Schools Act passed.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Jackson brought the issue to national attention, defending six
black teenagers who were expelled for up to two years as the result of a
bleacher-clearing fight at a football game in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   He called the policy ``an ugly, expensive, uneducational failure'' and the
biggest civil rights issue facing the country.
</P>
<P>
	   After Jackson's intervention, the city's school board cut the expulsions to
one year and let the six students attend alternative schools.
</P>
<P>
	   At Friday's hearing, commission chairman Mary Frances Berry said due process
concerns arise from the automatic nature of the punishments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Suspension or expulsion may accelerate students' likelihood of falling
into a life of poverty and crime,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Early evidence suggests zero tolerance discipline might be helping to reduce
the number of guns students carry to school.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1996-97 school year, 5,724 students were expelled for bringing a
firearm to school. That number fell 31 percent to 3,930 the following year,
according to William Modzeleski, director of the Education Department's Safe and
Drug-Free Schools Program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We realize that denying students educational services is not in the best
interest of students or the community,'' Modzeleski said. ``However, we
understand and support the need to maintain order, discipline and safety in the
classroom.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the racial dynamics of zero tolerance have captured the headlines,
Lilliam Rangel-Diaz, a member of the National Council on Disability, said
disabled children are also disproportionately suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   In Florida, for example, during the 1998-1999 school year, 14 percent of
disabled students got out-of-school suspensions while just 6.6 percent of
nondisabled students got the same punishment, Rangel-Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In our zealous pursuit of safety in schools, we must exercise caution and
vigilance that under the guise of zero tolerance programs our students
constitutional rights do not continue to be violated,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> SEC Head Criticized for Meetings  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, is taking heat for meeting privately with Wall Street leaders as the
SEC prepares to craft rules governing the radically changing stock markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Levitt, in a quest to tap opinions on the future shape of the markets, has
held several meetings in recent weeks in New York with top executives of Wall
Street powerhouses, including Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that the meetings took place behind closed doors prompted Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform, to ask
Levitt to provide detailed information on the gatherings.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am interested in knowing whether the (SEC) considered important issues
about the future of our markets in the nonpublic meetings, or if they influenced
the (SEC's) actions in any way," Burton told Levitt in a Feb. 3 letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton wants to know whether the meetings violated the Federal Advisory
Committee Act, which prohibits government officials from debating public policy
without the public being allowed to attend. He has given Levitt until Feb. 25 to
respond.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy was first reported in Friday's editions of The Washington
Post; The Wall Street Journal first noted the private meetings in a column on
Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post reported that Charles Schwab, chairman of the big discount
brokerage that bears his name, is said to have attended a meeting with the Wall
Street titans but strongly disagreed with their agenda and was not invited to
later meetings. The newspaper cited unnamed sources close to Schwab.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Gable, a spokesman for Charles Schwab Corp. at its headquarters in San
Francisco, declined comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Levitt, a Clinton appointee now in his second term who came to government
from the Wall Street establishment, is defending his actions as being part of an
open, inclusive process.
</P>
<P>
	   "Seeking an array of perspectives from all market participants is the
hallmark of Chairman Levitt's tenure. That's why he's an effective regulator,"
his spokesman, Chris Ullman, said Friday. "His door is always open and we
welcome input from everyone."
</P>
<P>
	   He said Levitt used the same opinion-gathering process before he gave a
major speech in September on the future shape of the markets, consulting
government officials, executives of big and small companies and even renowned
investor Warren Buffett.
</P>
<P>
	   John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University, said it
would be hard to make a case that Levitt's meetings with the industry officials
violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act, since the meetings didn't involve a
formal structure.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's just meeting with the major constituents of financial market reform,"
Coffee said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesmen for Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs declined comment on the
meetings Friday; spokesmen for Morgan Stanley and Citigroup didn't immediately
return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC plans to put out for public comment next week a "concept release"
presenting several possible options for changing how stocks are traded.
</P>
<P>
	   Tumultuous change has been sweeping the markets, as millions of individual
investors have rushed in and competition from new electronic communications
networks, known as ECNs, has put pressure on the nation's two biggest exchanges,
the New York Stock Exchange and the electronic Nasdaq Stock Market. Both are
considering selling stock to the public to raise money and give themselves
greater operating flexibility, a move that would transform them into for-profit
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The ECNs, meanwhile, have asked the regulators to put them on the same legal
footing as the traditional exchanges.
</P>
<P>
	   Extended trading hours and an anticipated switch this year to decimalization
-- quoting stocks in dollars and cents, rather than the 200-year-old tradition
of fractions -- also are reshaping the markets.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, mammoth full-service Wall Street brokerage firms are
restructuring their stock-selling arms to catch up with discount brokers like
Schwab that have brought about a boom in low-cost, online trading.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 205.95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged Friday, with the Dow losing nearly 300
points, following a warning a day earlier from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jlose Down trial average fell 295.05 in heavy trading, or by 2.8
percent, to close at 10,219.55, according to preliminary figures. It was the
seventh-biggest daily drop in terms of points but wasn't close to the largest
percentage declines.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow is now off more than 12 percent from its record high closing of
11,722.98, reached Jan. 14. That is a steep enough drop to be considered a
"correction" on Wall Street but not necessarily a sign of the end of the bull
market that began in October 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was off 135.16, or by almost 3 percent, at
4,413.76, according to preliminary figures, after rising more than 121 points
Thursday to a record 4,548.92. It was the fourth-largest daily point drop in
Nasdaq history.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop came despite encouraging figures on inflation. The Labor Department
reported Friday that the Consumer Price Index edged up a smaller-than-expected
0.2 percent in January. Lower prices for clothing helped offset rising costs for
fuel oil and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Greenspan warned the House Banking Committee that higher wages,
driven by the tight labor market, would fuel inflation. He said the Fed will
raise interest rates again this year to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
	   "As Yogi Berra would say, 'It's deja vu all over again,"' said Ned Riley,
chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors. "The same issues,
the same problems the Fed had at the end of last year, it is confronted with all
over again."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said investors were probably worried about holding certain stocks
before a three-day weekend. U.S. stock markets will be closed Monday in
observance of Presidents Day.

<HEADLINE> Execs Quit Aurora Foods Amid Probe  </HEADLINE>
    By KIM CURTIS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Four senior management officials at Aurora Foods Inc.,
owner of such well-known brands as Duncan Hines and Aunt Jemima, resigned Friday
as the company launched an investigation into its internal accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman and chief executive Ian R. Wilson, vice chairman James B. Ardrey,
executive vice president Ray Chung and chief financial officer M. Laurie
Cummings all stepped down, the company said in a statement. Wilson and Ardrey
also resigned from the company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora Food's board said it has formed a special committee with its New
York-based auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers to investigate Aurora's accounting
practices that it expects will result in a non-cash charge to 1999 earnings and
could affect earnings projections for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Board member Richard C. Dresdale, president of investment firm Fenway
Partners was appointed acting chairman while Peter Lamm, chairman and CEO of
Fenway, was appointed acting president and CEO of Aurora Foods. Fenway and
fellow investment firm McCown De Leeuw &AMP; Co. own 46 percent of Aurora Food's
outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
	   The accounting practices immediately under investigation relate primarily to
the accrual of trade promotion expenses in 1999. The committee has also asked
hired the law firm Ropes &AMP; Gray and auditor Deloitte &AMP; Touche to investigate the
practice and see if it also affects prior earnings statements.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora Foods spokesman Tom Franco refused to elaborate on the statement.
PricewaterhouseCoopers also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's pretty apparent that there's a difference opinion between the auditors
and management," said David Goldman, a Bank of America analyst who follows the
company. "Management believes that the retail promotion expense should be
deferred into future periods; auditors believe that it should be recognized in
the current period ... There's no hard and fast rule and the auditors are
demanding a conservative approach."
</P>
<P>
	   Goldman said he didn't know what was the precise reason behind the dispute,
but was hoping to obtain more information from the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no evidence of wrongdoing that's available to the public, but there
was enough evidence that the management resigned," Goldman said. It's unlikely
the accounting practice in question goes back further than the last fiscal year,
he added.
</P>
<P>
	   SEC spokesman John Heine declined comment on whether the agency was looking
into Aurora Foods. The agency, as a rule, does not comment when asked about
possible investigations of companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora Foods has not yet reported full-year earnings for 1999, but expects
to by the end of March. It also said the accounting investigation should not
affect the company's ability to operate.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in November, Aurora Foods said it expected to report 1999 earnings
between 78 cents to 81 cents per share. According to a First Call/Thomson
Financial survey, analysts were expecting 79 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past few years, the San Francisco-based company has grown by
acquiring well-known brands and revitalizing them with marketing support,
expanded distribution, and new product development. Among the brands under the
Aurora Foods umbrella are Mrs. Butterworth's pancake mix, Log Cabin syrup,
Chef's Choice frozen meals, Lender's bagels, Celeste frozen pizza and Van de
Kamp's frozen seafood.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading in Aurora was halted Friday on the New York Stock Exchange on the
news. Shares closed Thursday at $7.31 1/4, well off their 52-week high of
$19.50.

<HEADLINE> Presidential primary ballot finally set in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Steve Forbes may still get some votes in New York
for his defunct Republican presidential campaign, even though he has said he
doesn't want the position anymore.
<P>
	   Even though the New Jersey publisher dropped out of the GOP race Feb. 10,
his name will still appear on the March 7 New York primary ballot statewide,
just like Texas Gov. George Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would take a court order to take him off the ballot," said Lee Daghlian,
a spokesman for the state Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge ordered state party officials to put McCain and Forbes on
the ballot after Bush's New York supporters tried to block the two from
appearing in the statewide primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders, most of whom are backing Bush, had hoped to guarantee
him an easy ride through the primary. They had challenged the validity of
McCain's and Forbes' presidential petitions, claiming they should be kicked off
ballots in some districts because of technical problems with their petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. District Judge Edward Korman overruled the challenges and on Feb. 4
ordered the state party to put McCain and Forbes in the primary all over the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes later said he was withdrawing from the race, saying "we were nosed
out by a landslide" after coming in third in the Delaware primary behind Bush
and McCain, who never campaigned in that state.
</P>
<P>
	   But Forbes' withdrawal came after Korman's decision, Daghlian said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The ballots are being printed now, if they haven't been printed already,"
he said. "And no one asked the judge to take Forbes off the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes did not endorse either Bush or McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes will be on the Republican ballot also, although his name will not
be available in four districts in the state, Daghlian said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore, former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley and Lyndon LaRouche will all be on the ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The Green Party also will have a primary on March 7. But the New York Reform
Party's primary has been canceled, Daghlian said. "You can't have a primary if
you don't have two candidates," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Megadeveloper Donald Trump had thought about challenging Reform Party
candidate Pat Buchanan but a judge here threw Trump's delegates off the New York
ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump later announced that he would not run for president.
</P>
<P>
	   A Siena College Research Institute poll released Friday suggests McCain will
beat Bush in the primary. The survey, conducted Feb. 14-17, indicates New
Yorkers favor the Arizona Senator over Bush 46 percent to 29 percent. It had a
4.5 point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll also showed hypothetical matchups between McCain and Gore would be
extremely close. Of the 484 state residents questioned, 44 percent liked McCain,
while 40 percent went with Gore. Considering the error margin, it was hard to
tell who would come out on top.

<HEADLINE> Forbes anti-abortion views complicating re-election bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - A New York congressman who left the Republican Party
is facing a bumpy road to election as a Democrat because of his long-standing
opposition to abortion.
<P>
	   Rep. Michael Forbes' refusal to rule out running on the Right to Life line
is infuriating some Democrats in his Suffolk County district. The Democratic
chairman of the Town of Brookhaven - which makes up 60 percent of Forbes'
district - publicly "un-endorsed" him. And the county's powerful Democratic
leader Dominic Baranello has drawn a line in the sand, saying "I cannot support
someone who is also running on the Right to Life line."
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes camp maintains that beyond the Democratic line, no decision has
been made yet on what other lines to run on.
</P>
<P>
	   But Right to Life Party Chairman Ken Diem said Forbes has told him he will
seek the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   "As far as we're concerned Mike Forbes is our candidate," Diem said Friday.
Diem added if Forbes refused the nomination he would give it to Felix Grucci,
the Town of Brookhaven supervisor, who is in line to run as a Republican. In the
last congressional election the Right to Life line brought in about 8,000 votes,
Diem said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes announced in July that he was swapping parties to become a Democrat,
citing the "extremism" of GOP leadership in the House of Representatives. Forbes
has supported campaign finance reform, and is known for having an independent
streak. But he has also has also carved out a largely conservative voting
record, supporting the Contract With America and voting to repeal the ban on
certain semiautomatic assault-style weapons. He has had Right to Life backing in
all three of his congressional races.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats in Washington welcomed Forbes with open arms, their eye on taking
back the majority in the House for the first time since 1994. The Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee has pledged to provide Forbes with significant
financial help. New York's Democratic Party Chairwoman Judith Hope is also
behind him.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Suffolk County, some Democrats have been more suspicious.
</P>
<P>
	   Town of Brookhaven Democratic Committee Chairman Kevin Mitchell said he
tried to accept Forbes despite vastly different viewpoints on some issues. But
he blasted Forbes for "failing to build relationships" with local Democrats,
noting his absence from Hillary Rodham Clinton's U.S. Senate race announcement.
Forbes did not attend Clinton's event because he was at a retreat for
Congressional Democrats, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
	   But it is the abortion issue that has apparently galvanized forces against
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   "To my surpass and amazement Mr. Forbes appears poised to accept Right to
Life endorsement," Mitchell said in a scathing three-page letter. "It is totally
unacceptable to me ... that Mr. Forbes would consider such a move."
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' chief of staff said Mitchell's announcement was not significant and
brushed aside the mounting criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "We always expected there would be some bumps along the road," David
Williams said. "What matters to us is the reaction we get from rank-and-file
Democrats and constituents in Brookhaven."
</P>
<P>
	   He cited an internal poll showing Forbes with 82 percent support among
Democrats in his district.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Forbes could face a primary challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Holst, the Democrat who took 36 percent of the vote against Forbes in
his last election is making moves toward entering the race. He has the support
of Liz Abzug. The daughter of former Rep. Bella Abzug, Liz Abzug had weighed
getting into the race herself. Also still weighing the race is Tony Bullock,
chief of staff for Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Cautioned on Clinton Visit  </HEADLINE>
   By AMIR ZIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistanis may favor a visit by President
Clinton, but Islamic groups warned the country's army rulers Friday not to make
concessions in order to entice him here -- like signing the global test ban
treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is visiting South Asia next month, but so far only neighboring India
and Bangladesh are on his itinerary. The president says he hasn't ruled out a
visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has been pressing Pakistan's military rulers since last
year's army takeover to come up with a timetable for a return to democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Pervez Musharraf has refused, saying he has promised to clean up a
deeply corrupt political system and revive the ailing economy and that it will
take time.
</P>
<P>
	   Frustrated by the relentless corruption in politics, few people in Pakistan
have been lobbying for quick elections.
</P>
<P>
	   In a poll conducted recently by English and Urdu language newspapers, most
people favored a Clinton visit, but virtually everyone wanted the American
president to play a role in settling the protracted Kashmir dispute that has
dogged relations between India and Pakistan for 52 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Both countries lay claim to a united Kashmir, the former princely state
divided between the two neighbors. Kashmir has been the flashpoint of two
previous wars between India and Pakistan and there is international concern that
another confrontation between the two nuclear powers could result in the use of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has said he is willing to mediate, but both India and Pakistan have
to accept his involvement. Pakistan welcomed U.S. mediation while India has
flatly rejected it.
</P>
<P>
	   Religious groups in Pakistan have expressed concern that the military
leadership will make concessions in order to get Clinton to visit Pakistan --
like agreeing to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, something they
vehemently oppose. Pakistan and India exploded underground nuclear tests in 1998
and declared themselves nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdullah Muntazir, a spokesman of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, a key militant group
fighting Indian forces in Kashmir, warned Pakistan not to sign the treaty or to
launch a crackdown against religious groups under American pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want to invite Clinton, nor do we want to stop him, but we do not
want the government to compromise on our vital national issues,'' Muntazir said.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Chechen Rebel Area Srhunk  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDER ZEMLIANICHENKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STARIYE ATAGI, Russia (AP) -- Chechen rebels and Russian troops clashed
Friday in Chechnya's southern mountains, but Russian advances are shrinking the
area where the rebels can mount hit-and-run attacks, a top general said.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, Russia's deputy chief of staff, said Russia now
controls most of the strategically important areas in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   But up to 7,000 militants are still resisting federal forces in the southern
mountains, a rebel stronghold, he said. The military reported several clashes
with rebels in southern towns. In the village of Stariye Atagi, troops fired
shells and Grad rockets at mountains to the south.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov reiterated previous Russian claims that the 5-month-old war was
nearing an end. He said the Russian strategy of using air and artillery strikes
against distant rebel bases in the mountains was working.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The remote war tactic is successful, causing precise losses,'' Manilov
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the rebels have lost more than 11,000 since fighting began between
Chechen-based militants and Russian troops. Russia reportedly has suffered 1,221
troops dead, including 45 killed over the past week. But both sides have
exaggerated each other's casualties, and Russian troops in Chechnya have
questioned the losses reported by their commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   In Russia on Friday, prosecutors charged Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
with rebellion, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maskhadov organized an armed rebellion on the territory of the Chechen
republic and took a direct part in it as commander-in-chief of the armed
forces,'' Yuri Biryukov of the Prosecutor General's office told Interfax.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a source at the Russian command for the North Caucasus said one
of Chechnya's most notorious warlords, Salman Raduyev, had been killed, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. But the news agency Interfax quoted an unnamed
Defense Ministry official as speculating the report of Raduyev's death may be
deliberate rebel misinformation. Raduyev led a bloody hostage-taking raid in
southern Russia in 1996 and now leads one of the most radical and feared rebel
bands.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechnya has had de facto independence since the end of Moscow's botched
1994-96 campaign here.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent troops into the territory again last September after
Chechnya-based militants invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan and
terrorists allegedly tied to the rebels blew up four apartment buildings in
Russia, killing about 300 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the rebels have retreated to the mountains since abandoning the
capital, Grozny, to federal forces. They are hoping to wage a prolonged
guerrilla war from the heights.
</P>
<P>
	   In Grozny, which the military was to seal off Friday, the elderly civilians
left in the ravaged town seemed lost in a ghostly landscape of ruined buildings
and rubble. Troops rolled by them on armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials say the city must be closed to thwart possible rebel
attempts to sneak back in and to give sappers time to defuse mines planted among
the ruins. The number of civilians still in Grozny is unclear, although it is
believed to be in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, lashed out at comments made Thursday
by U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin in response to allegations
that Chechens trying to leave their war-ravaged republic were being tortured in
Russian detention camps. Russia has ``a clear obligation to investigate the
numerous credible reports of civilian killings and alleged misconduct by its
soldiers,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Ministry said Rubin was ``operating with clearly tendentious
data and even outright bias supplied by the terrorists themselves... In fact,
this amounts to assistance in information-terrorism.''

<HEADLINE> Tribe demands meteorite at center of new planetarium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - When the Museum of Natural History's new planetarium
opens Saturday, the 16-ton Willamette Meteorite will be sitting in a place of
honor, propped on a steel pedestal specially imbedded in the main hall.
<P>
	   But a group of American Indians says the meteorite is a holy tribal object
and has made a claim under federal law for the behemoth from space - about the
size of a small car - to be returned to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
	   The meteorite hit Earth more than 10,000 years ago and was moved by glacial
ice to a hillside in West Linn, Ore. The Clackamas tribe adopted it as a sacred
object, and the rain water that collected in its deep craters was prized for its
holiness.
</P>
<P>
	   "Songs given to us by the meteorite are still sung today," said Ryan Heavy
Head, a consultant to the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde, which includes
the Clackamas.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the meteorite called "Tomanoas" by the Indians embodies three
heavenly realms - sky, earth and water. Clackamas youths were sent on vigils to
the meteorite to await messages from the spirit world and other tribes also made
pilgrimages, said Heavy Head, a Blackfoot.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grand Ronde submitted a claim for the meteorite to the museum last
September, acting under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation
Act. The federal law gives the museum until Feb. 29 to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Ann Canty, a museum spokeswoman, would not comment on the Indian claim. But
she and an architect of the new building made clear that it would not be easy to
move the meteorite from the planetarium, officially the Rose Center for Earth
and Space.
</P>
<P>
	   "Because the meteorite is so massive, parts of the facility had to
essentially be built around it," Canty said.
</P>
<P>
	   The meteorite had sat in the old planetarium since 1935 and was moved with a
large crane when that building was dismantled. Two years before the new center
was finished, contractors installed three structural piles - 60-foot tubes
driven into the ground - just to support the meteorite's bulk.
</P>
<P>
	   "The meteorite had to go in first," said Todd Schliemann, one of the
architects who worked on the Rose Center. "It went in before the planetarium
sphere, before the building's glass housing, before the walls."
</P>
<P>
	   When asked if the meteorite could be moved, Schliemann said, "We could find
a way, but we would have to disassemble a large portion of the building.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a permanent fixture," he added. "It landed there, and there it will
stay."
</P>
<P>
	   When tribal representatives visited in September, they "had quite a problem
getting in to see the meteorite," Heavy Head said in a telephone interview from
his home in Salem, Ore.
</P>
<P>
	   Over six days, he and his wife Adrienne took thousands of pictures
documenting objects in the museum for possible repatriation. He said the museum
staff was "civil but not necessarily cooperative" when he asked to see the
meteorite.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had to remind them that we had a federal grant behind us," he said.
"Eventually they gave us hard hats and let us in, but when we started taking
pictures, they freaked."
</P>
<P>
	   The Willamette Meteorite changed hands several times before the museum
acquired it in 1906. A part-time miner named Ellis G. Hughes discovered it in
1902 on land belonging to an iron company, moved it into his barn and began
charging a quarter for admission.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1905, a state Supreme Court returned the meteorite to the iron company;
it was then bought for $20,600 by a New York woman, Mrs. William Dodge, who
donated it to the museum.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim McKeown, who oversees Indian claims for the National Park Service, said
proof of ownership could decide the case of the meteorite or the two parties
could reach agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   But McKeown said if the case goes to a federal review committee or to court,
it may take time. He noted the fight over Indian claims to the Kennewick Man in
Washington state has dragged on virtually since the discovery of the skeletal
remains in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy Head said he does not expect a harmonious exchange given the effort
and expense devoted to building the meteorite into the Rose Center.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a good thing that it traveled to the museum," he said. "Their
ownership was essential to its safety. But now it needs to come home."

	   Town of Brookhaven Democratic Committee Chairman Kevin Mitchell said he
tried to accept Forbes despite vastly different viewpoints on some issues. But
he blasted Forbes for "failing to build relationships" with local Democrats,
noting his absence from Hillary Rodham Clinton's U.S. Senate race announcement.
Forbes did not attend Clinton's event because he was at a retreat for
Congressional Democrats, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
	   But it is the abortion issue that has apparently galvanized forces against
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   "To my surpass and amazement Mr. Forbes appears poised to accept Right to
Life endorsement," Mitchell said in a scathing three-page letter. "It is totally
unacceptable to me ... that Mr. Forbes would consider such a move."
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' chief of staff said Mitchell's announcement was not significant and
brushed aside the mounting criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "We always expected there would be some bumps along the road," David
Williams said. "What matters to us is the reaction we get from rank-and-file
Democrats and constituents in Brookhaven."
</P>
<P>
	   He cited an internal poll showing Forbes with 82 percent support among
Democrats in his district.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Forbes could face a primary challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Holst, the Democrat who took 36 percent of the vote against Forbes in
his last election is making moves toward entering the race. He has the support
of Liz Abzug. The daughter of former Rep. Bella Abzug, Liz Abzug had weighed
getting into the race herself. Also still weighing the race is Tony Bullock,
chief of staff for Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

<HEADLINE> Former Poughkeepsie political boss enters plea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A former Dutchess County Republican chairman
accused of running a six-year extortion scheme pleaded guilty Friday to a
federal felony charge.
<P>
	   William Paroli Sr., 71, admitted in federal court that he conspired with
others to extort payments from companies wanting to do business in the Town of
Poughkeepsie. The surprise plea deal closes a chapter in a three-year federal
probe that has rattled Poughkeepsie and resulted in five previous convictions.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew what I was doing was wrong and illegal," Paroli told U.S. Magistrate
Judge Mark Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli had been strenuously maintaining his innocence in the face of a trial
next month on a 19-count federal indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   He was accused last May of controlling a scheme in which town officials
shook down businesses for thousands of dollars in return for favorable
treatment. Prosecutors allege that Paroli - a large man with a robust manner -
used his posts as the county and town GOP leader to dominate town government.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted on all counts, Paroli could have faced more than 200 years in
prison. With his deal to plead guilty on a single count, he could face 15 to 21
months in prison when he is sentenced May 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Paroli faces a maximum sentence of 20 years, Fox said he would
recommend acceptance of the plea to the sentencing judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli also agreed to: pay a fine of $4,000 to $40,000; perform 15 hours a
week of community service during his supervised release from prison; pay up to
$20,000 in restitution to the town; refrain from engaging in partisan politics
during his supervised release; immediately quit his job as county elections
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're quite pleased with the result," U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said
after the plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli quit his partisan posts, but had resisted calls from Republican Gov.
George Pataki to resign his for-pay commissioner's job.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials had been investigating the workings of Poughkeepsie's town
government since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the people implicated in the scandal was tax assessor Basil Raucci,
who was found drowned in the Hudson River after FBI agents approached him in
October 1997. His death was ruled a suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Another ensnared official was former water department head Fred Andros, who
pleaded guilty last May to a federal count of conspiracy. Andros has since been
charged by county prosecutors with second-degree murder in the shooting death of
the town's personnel director.
</P>
<P>
	   Andros, recovering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his chin, pleaded
innocent to the murder charge Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli admitted in court Friday to conspiring with Andros and Raucci to
extort payments.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've substantially broken the back of corruption in the Town of
Poughkeepsie," White said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the probe was continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli was released on his own recognizance to await sentencing. He did not
speak to reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Paroli is the second former county GOP leader in suburban New York City area
to plead guilty in federal court this month. Suffolk County Republican Chairman
John Powell pleaded guilty Friday to racketeering and also admitted that he had
taken bribes for access to a town landfill in the extortion case.

<HEADLINE> Soft Drink Sales Volume Slows  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Carbonated soft drink sales volume slowed dramatically in
1999, and analysts blamed the nearly flat performance on rising prices and the
popularity of alternative beverages like bottled water.
</P>
<P>
	   Colas, led by Coca-Cola Classic and Pepsi-Cola, continued to account for the
majority of sales in the $58 billion U.S. soda market, but they lost market
share to Mountain Dew, Sprite and Dr Pepper, according to two separate reports
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales volume rose 0.5 percent last year, according to the annual Beverage
Digest/Maxwell report. That was well below the 3 percent growth in 1998 and was
the slowest in at least 15 years, according to Beverage Digest publisher John
Sicher.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said price hikes last year helped push up the dollar value of retail
sales by 3 percent to $57.9 billion from $56.3 billion a year earlier, when
revenue rose 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Beverage Marketing Corp. estimated 1999 volume growth at 0.6
percent, down from 3.4 percent in 1998. Spokesman Gary Hemphill said he could
find no slower annual growth rate in records going back to 1980. It made no
retail sales estimate.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Bellas, chairman of Beverage Marketing, said the retail price hikes
in 1999 held down purchases of sodas.He said average consumption fell for the
first time in at least 30 years, edging down 0.2 gallon to 55.9 gallons for
every man, woman and child in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   He said fast growth in bottled water also hurt carbonated soft drink sales.
Water sales were up 12 percent in 1999 led by a 35 percent jump in water sold in
single-serve bottles, Beverage Marketing estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola Classic was the best selling soft drink brand in 1999 with 20.3
percent of the market, down from 20.6 percent in 1998, according to Beverage
Digest/Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepsi-Cola stayed in second place at 13.8 percent, down from 14.2 percent a
year earlier. Diet Coke was third at 8.5 percent versus 8.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mountain Dew's share rose to 7.1 percent from 6.7 percent. Sprite
finished fifth at 6.8 percent and Dr Pepper was sixth at 6.3 percent -- each up
0.2 percentage point from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Rounding out the Top 10 brands were Diet Pepsi at 5.1 percent, 7Up at 2.1
percent, Caffeine-Free Diet Coke at 1.8 percent and Barq's root beer at 1.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beverage Marketing figures were similar except that it listed Minute
Maid in 10th place at 1.3 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepsi One, the one-calorie brand Pepsi-Cola introduced in late 1998,
finished out of the Top 10 in both reports with about 0.8 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the soft drink companies, Coca-Cola Co. stayed on top at 44.1 percent
of the market, down 0.4 percentage point from a year earlier, Beverage
Digest/Maxwell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepsi-Cola Co. held second at 31.4 percent of the market, unchanged from the
previous year. Cadbury Schweppes's Dr Pepper/Seven Up unit was third at 14.7
percent, up 0.5 percentage point.

<HEADLINE> 'Boiler Room' Lawsuit Settled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- New Line Cinema said Friday that it has settled a libel
lawsuit with the city comptroller's chief economist who complained that a
crooked securities firm was named after him in the movie "Boiler Room."
</P>
<P>
	   John Tepper Marlin said in court papers that the movie, which stars Ben
Affleck, repeatedly refers to the "JT Marlin" firm in connection with
illegality, and the malicious and reckless destruction of lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Clare Ann Darragh, New Line spokeswoman, said, "After we found out about the
suit, our lawyers met with his lawyers and a confidential settlement was worked
out in less than an hour. New Line is quite pleased."
</P>
<P>
	   The movie, released this week, depicts the workings of a Long Island "boiler
room," slang for a brokerage in which salesmen use high-pressure tactics and
deceit to peddle worthless stocks and bonds by telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   The movie was written and directed by Ben Younger, who in 1994 and 1995 was
an employee in the New York City comptroller's officer where Marlin was his
supervisor and is now the chief economist.
</P>
<P>
	   Marlin had named New Line and Younger as defendants. He asked the court to
stop distribution of the movie, and to award him $22.2 million for invasion of
privacy, defamation, and infliction of emotional distress.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 293.50  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged today, pushing the Dow Jones industrial
average down nearly 300 points, as investors were unnerved for a second day by
Thursday's warning about interest rates from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 293.50 at 10,221.07,
its seventh-largest one day point drop, according to preliminary calculations.
The blue chip index, down more than 313 points in earlier trading today, has
fallen more than 12 percent from its Jan. 14 high of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
	   After gaining ground all week, the Nasdaq composite index fell 133.27 to
4,415.65, its seventh-biggest point drop.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to inflation fears, trading was volatile due to what's known as
"double witching," or the simultaneous expiration of contracts on options on
stocks and stock indexes. Traders also sold off ahead of the three-day holiday
weekend. U.S. markets are closed Monday in observance of Presidents' Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks fell although the Labor Department said January's Consumer Price
Index edged up a smaller than expected 0.2 percent as lower clothing prices
helped offset rising fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
	   But the report did little to comfort investors after Greenspan told Congress
Thursday that higher wages, driven by the tight labor market, would lead to a
rise in inflation. He warned that the Fed will raise interest rates again this
year after four increases over the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-eight of the 30 Dow stocks were down, led by International Paper and
IBM.
</P>
<P>
	   Although technology stocks have withstood fears about higher interest rates,
they joined in the market's tumble today.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, big decliners were led by Novell, which fell after the
computer network software company fell short of analysts' estimates. Amazon.com
and many other Internet stocks were also down.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, the market's broadest indicator, fell 42.51
to 1,345.75.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange
with 2,314 down, 735 up and 442 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE Volume totaled 1.03 billion shares as of 4 p.m., the same as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks fell 11.03 to 547.39.
</P>
<P>
	   "As Yogi Berra would say, 'It's deja vu all over again,"' said Ned Riley,
chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors. "The same issues,
the same problems the Fed had at the end of last year, it is confronted with all
over again."
</P>
<P>
	   The economy is still growing and the inflation data is still benign, but the
Fed still expects to see inflation -- the questions are when and in what form,
Riley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's drop was broad-based. Biotech stocks, which have had a resurgence in
2000, were hit hard as Biogen and Genentech slumbered.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest rate sensitive financial issues were down, led by American Express
and J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
	   Telecommunications companies fell sharply, with SBC Communications and
Sprint off.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was off 0.01 percent, Germany's DAX
index was down 0.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.7 percent, and
France's CAC-40 was down 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Turkey To Punish CNN With Blackout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's state broadcasting board ordered a one-day
blackout for CNN-Turk, a joint venture with CNN, for a news program it called
Kurdish propaganda.
</P>
<P>
	   The 24-hour news channel was punished for a question during a Jan. 13
round-table discussion program asking whether imprisoned Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan could eventually become a figure comparable to South Africa's
Nelson Mandela, who was freed after serving 27 years in jail for struggling
against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
	   The program was broadcast a day after the government postponed Ocalan's
execution pending a European court review of his appeal. He was sentenced in
June to hang for treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear when the blackout would be imposed. CNN-Turk has yet to
receive official notification, spokeswoman Berna Kurekcioglu said.
</P>
<P>
	   CNN-Turk is a joint venture between Turner Broadcasting Systems
International, the company responsible for CNN's international commercial
operations, and Turkey's Dogan Medya Grubu, which owns mass-circulation national
newspapers Hurriyet and Milliyet and national TV station Kanal D.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadcasting board often yank televisions or radios off the air for
programs or reports deemed threatening to the unity of the Turkish state.
</P>
<P>
	   The Turkish military has been fighting autonomy-seeking Kurdish rebels in
the southeast for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The government does not tolerate broadcasts seen as encouraging the
separatist cause.

<HEADLINE> Syria: Israel Disrupts Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Syria's foreign minister accused Israel of disrupting
Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations and showing contempt for international law by
threatening to destroy Lebanon, according to a letter circulated today.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Feb. 14 letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa said the Syrian-Israeli negotiations in Shepherdstown, West
Virginia in January demonstrated that Israel is unwilling to withdraw from the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is more than ever obvious that Israel is not content merely to disrupt
the peace process and deprive it of its substance but that it also seeks to
utilize its enormous military capacities instead of the political means set
forth in the resolutions of the United Nations and in its charter,'' al-Sharaa
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was responding to a letter from Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
blaming Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon for escalating attacks and accusing
Lebanon and Syria of attempting to undermine Middle East peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli warplanes destroyed three Lebanese power stations early last week
and blasted numerous Hezbollah positions in south Lebanon. The airstrikes came
after guerrillas killed more than half a dozen Israeli soldiers in three weeks
in a zone that Israel occupies in Lebanon as a buffer against attacks on its
northern towns.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Levy, in a Feb. 9 letter, accused Hezbollah of violating a 1996
U.S.-brokered understanding that forbids attacks on or from civilian areas in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel will take ``all necessary measures'' to defend its citizens and ``to
strike at terrorists and those who support and abet them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Levy said Israel expects Syria to exert restraint on Hezbollah and said
Syria will bear responsibility for any halt to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   In his response, al-Sharaa said Israel's demand that Lebanon and Syria curb
``terrorism'' ignores the legitimate right of resistance movements to fight
against ``foreign occupation.''
</P>
<P>
	   But even more serious than Levy blaming Hezbollah, he said, ``is the fact
that his letter conveys a threat of further aggression and of recourse to
military action against Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel's chief diplomat not only went so far as to threaten the use of
force but went on to appear in person on the world's television screens with the
promise to burn and destroy Lebanon,'' al-Sharaa said.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations were postponed indefinitely in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria wanted assurances that Israel would withdraw from the entire Golan
Heights, a plateau that Israeli troops captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Israel argued it could not give such a pledge until it knew the extent of peace
and security arrangements that Syria was prepared to offer.

<HEADLINE> America West Faces Computer Glitches  </HEADLINE>
    By ALISA BLACKWOOD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Ernesto Martinez wrapped himself in an airline blanket and
sprawled across a row of black vinyl chairs, trying to get some sleep while
stranded at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   His was one of 128 America West Airlines flights canceled nationwide
Thursday and Friday because of a glitch in the airline's computer system that
prepares flight plans for pilots and crews.
</P>
<P>
	   Several thousand passengers were affected, and at least 1,000 were forced to
camp out at Sky Harbor Thursday night, according to airport officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was hellish," said Martinez, of El Paso, Texas. "It was just row after
row filled with people and everyone was just disgusted."
</P>
<P>
	   The glitch is the latest in an array of unrelated problems for the airline,
including hefty maintenance fines and consistent rankings as one of the
country's worst airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline was fined $5 million by the FAA in July 1998 over maintenance
and safety violations. The airline ultimately paid only $2.5 million; the FAA
waived the rest last year.
</P>
<P>
	   America West also had the highest rate of passenger complaints to the
Transportation Department and the poorest on-time arrival record of any major
airline in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tempe, Ariz.-based airline is the nation's ninth-largest carrier, with
hubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the problems, America West is still turning record profits. America
West Holdings Corp., the parent company of America West Airlines and a travel
package arm, The Leisure Co., reported in January that it earned a record $119.4
million, or $3.03 per share, in 1999. It marked a 26 percent increase over 1998
for the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of America West were trading at $15.56 1/4, up 6 1/4 cents, at 4:30
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're a low cost carrier that serves two big growing markets -- Phoenix
and Las Vegas -- that are very popular with tourists," said Ray Neidle, an
analyst who follows the airline industry for ING Barings in New York. "Due to
the low unit cost structure they're able to survive."
</P>
<P>
	   However, if a company's success is measured by its customers' satisfaction,
the airline has work to do.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to be able to deliver a product that's consistent and when you
have situations like this, it reinforces the negative image you have," Neidle
said.
</P>
<P>
	   America West did not immediately return a phone call seeking a response to
Neidle's comments.
</P>
<P>
	   America West was operating on a backup system Friday while investigating the
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The backup had been in place since Thursday afternoon, but flights were
still being canceled Friday because of delays and crew shortages.
</P>
<P>
	   Crews had to prepare their flight plans manually during the five hours the
system was down, said airline spokeswoman Patty Nowack said earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from planning the flight's course, the computer system usually gives
crew members the flight's fuel capacity, weight balance and weather information.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem did not pose a safety threat, Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nowack said the airline did give away 1,500 hotel rooms in Phoenix Thursday
night. She disputed the airport's numbers for people spending the night in the
terminal, saying it was less than 100.
</P>
<P>
	   But amid the confusion, lost baggage and long waits -- some as long as 12
hours -- it appeared the airline could do nothing to appease some of its angry
customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will never fly America West again," said Mike Stark of Chicago, who
managed to get a hotel room. "I can't imagine how they stay in business."

<HEADLINE> Snow, rain create slushy mess across New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Just as the last remnants of the last snow storm
were melting away, New Jersey was socked by another winter storm Friday.
<P>
	   The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory with snowfall
projections as high as 6 inches for northern parts of the state. But by
mid-afternoon, the precipitation had changed to rain in most places.
</P>
<P>
	   As the storm rolled in from the Midwest, roads got slippery, many schools
closed early and passengers at Newark International Airport experienced flight
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, though, people took it in stride.
</P>
<P>
	   Waldir Silva, 21, pushed a salt spreader across the parking lot at the
Ramada Hotel near Newark International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, this is nothing," said Silva. "I saw the winter of '94. That was
worse."
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby, Sue Ann Seich, 50, was waiting for an airport shuttle bus, hoping to
catch an afternoon flight back to Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, I didn't call ahead. I'm just taking my chances," said Seich, a
frequent flier. "I've been through this a lot, and I've already slept at an
airport once."
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, there were scattered cancellations at New York's JFK
International Airport, and numerous cancellations and delays at LaGuardia
Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   By 3:30 p.m., over 80 flights were canceled at Newark International Airport,
said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Putin Calls for Property Guarantees  </HEADLINE>
   By KATYA TRUNOVA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IRKUTSK, Russia (AP) -- Saying censorship has no place in a true democracy,
acting President Vladimir Putin on Friday called for reforms including
guarantees for private property and limitations on parliamentary immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Although opinion polls show Putin widely favored to win the presidency in
March 26 elections, his stance on many issues has remained vague since he took
over when Boris Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31. He was largely unknown among the
public before becoming prime minister last August.
</P>
<P>
	   His ascent has coincided with mounting pressure on newsrooms across Russia,
but Putin said Friday that ``any censorship undermines a democratic society,''
the Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Putin said firm legal protection of property-owners' rights was
essential to the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should move away from the situation in which the state first issues
guarantees and then insists on revising them,'' Putin said during a visit to
Irkutsk, an industrial center in eastern Siberia. ``Without that, we will not be
able to create a normal investment climate in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin also said he favored limiting parliamentary immunity only to the terms
when lawmakers were in office. According to current law, lawmakers cannot be
prosecuted on charges predating their parliamentary service, unless their fellow
legislators vote to strip them of immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   The reform-oriented Union of Right Forces party had proposed a referendum on
those and other key issues. But the Central Electoral Commission rejected the
initiative on Thursday, saying the party had failed to gather enough valid voter
signatures backing the plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't do anything about that,'' Putin said. However, he added that he
``essentially'' supported the referendum proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin avoided a clear answer on another question the reformers had hoped to
put on the referendum, on limiting the president's powers in dismissing the
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Putin argued that only a strong presidency could guarantee civil
freedoms in Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must create such a society and such forms of government that would not
stifle democracy. But there must be one distinct institution to guarantee
citizens' rights and freedoms, and only the institution of the presidency can
ensure that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin flew to Irkutsk, about 2,600 miles east of Moscow, on Thursday. He met
with regional officials and toured a children's home that suffered in the 1997
crash of a military cargo plane. At least 69 people were killed in the accident.
</P>
<P>
	   He called for more intense economic development in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
	   The region ``holds more than three-quarters of mineral and other resources
in Russia, the main electric power production power and forest resources. But
its economic achievements remain very modest,'' Putin told regional leaders.
``The living standards here are worse than those in the country as a whole.''

<HEADLINE> Russia: Chechen Rebel Area Shrunk  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDER ZEMLIANICHENKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STARIYE ATAGI, Russia (AP) -- Chechen rebels and Russian troops clashed
Friday in Chechnya's southern mountains, but Russian advances are shrinking the
area where the rebels can mount hit-and-run attacks, a top general said.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, Russia's deputy chief of staff, said Russia now
controls most of the strategically important areas in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   But up to 7,000 militants are still resisting federal forces in the southern
mountains, a rebel stronghold, he said. The military reported several clashes
with rebels in southern towns. In the village of Stariye Atagi, troops fired
shells and Grad rockets at mountains to the south.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov reiterated previous Russian claims that the 5-month-old war was
nearing an end. He said the Russian strategy of using air and artillery strikes
against distant rebel bases in the mountains was working.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The remote war tactic is successful, causing precise losses,'' Manilov
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the rebels have lost more than 11,000 since fighting began between
Chechen-based militants and Russian troops. Russia reportedly has suffered 1,221
troops dead, including 45 killed over the past week. But both sides have
exaggerated each other's casualties, and Russian troops in Chechnya have
questioned the losses reported by their commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   In Russia on Friday, prosecutors charged Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
with rebellion, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maskhadov organized an armed rebellion on the territory of the Chechen
republic and took a direct part in it as commander-in-chief of the armed
forces,'' Yuri Biryukov of the Prosecutor General's office told Interfax.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a source at the Russian command for the North Caucasus said one
of Chechnya's most notorious warlords, Salman Raduyev, had been killed, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. But the news agency Interfax quoted an unnamed
Defense Ministry official as speculating the report of Raduyev's death may be
deliberate rebel misinformation. Raduyev led a bloody hostage-taking raid in
southern Russia in 1996 and now leads one of the most radical and feared rebel
bands.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechnya has had de facto independence since the end of Moscow's botched
1994-96 campaign here.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent troops into the territory again last September after
Chechnya-based militants invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan and
terrorists allegedly tied to the rebels blew up four apartment buildings in
Russia, killing about 300 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the rebels have retreated to the mountains since abandoning the
capital, Grozny, to federal forces. They are hoping to wage a prolonged
guerrilla war from the heights.
</P>
<P>
	   In Grozny, which the military was to seal off Friday, the elderly civilians
left in the ravaged town seemed lost in a ghostly landscape of ruined buildings
and rubble. Troops rolled by them on armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials say the city must be closed to thwart possible rebel
attempts to sneak back in and to give sappers time to defuse mines planted among
the ruins. The number of civilians still in Grozny is unclear, although it is
believed to be in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, lashed out at comments made Thursday
by U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin in response to allegations
that Chechens trying to leave their war-ravaged republic were being tortured in
Russian detention camps. Russia has ``a clear obligation to investigate the
numerous credible reports of civilian killings and alleged misconduct by its
soldiers,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Ministry said Rubin was ``operating with clearly tendentious
data and even outright bias supplied by the terrorists themselves... In fact,
this amounts to assistance in information-terrorism.''

<HEADLINE> Execs Quit Aurora Foods Amid Probe  </HEADLINE>
    By KIM CURTIS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Four senior management officials at Aurora Foods Inc.,
owner of such well-known brands as Duncan Hines and Aunt Jemima, resigned Friday
as the company launched an investigation into its internal accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman and chief executive Ian R. Wilson, vice chairman James B. Ardrey,
executive vice president Ray Chung and chief financial officer M. Laurie
Cummings all stepped down, the company said in a statement. Wilson and Ardrey
also resigned from the company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora Food's board said it has formed a special committee with its New
York-based auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers to investigate Aurora's accounting
practices that it expects will result in a non-cash charge to 1999 earnings and
could affect earnings projections for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Board member Richard C. Dresdale, president of investment firm Fenway
Partners was appointed acting chairman while Peter Lamm, chairman and CEO of
Fenway, was appointed acting president and CEO of Aurora Foods. Fenway and
fellow investment firm McCown De Leeuw &AMP; Co. own 46 percent of Aurora Food's
outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
	   The accounting practices immediately under investigation relate primarily to
the accrual of trade promotion expenses in 1999. The committee has alsohired the
law firm Ropes &AMP; Gray and auditor Deloitte &AMP; Touche to investigate the practice
and see if it also affects prior earnings statements.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora Foods spokesman Tom Franco refused to elaborate on the statement.
PricewaterhouseCoopers also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's pretty apparent that there's a difference opinion between the auditors
and management," said David Goldman, a Bank of America analyst who follows the
company. "Management believes that the retail promotion expense should be
deferred into future periods; auditors believe that it should be recognized in
the current period ... There's no hard and fast rule and the auditors are
demanding a conservative approach."
</P>
<P>
	   Goldman said he didn't know what was the precise reason behind the dispute,
but was hoping to obtain more information from the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no evidence of wrongdoing that's available to the public, but there
was enough evidence that the management resigned," Goldman said. It's unlikely
the accounting practice in question goes back further than the last fiscal year,
he added.
</P>
<P>
	   SEC spokesman John Heine declined comment on whether the agency was looking
into Aurora Foods. The agency, as a rule, does not comment when asked about
possible investigations of companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora Foods has not yet reported full-year earnings for 1999, but expects
to by the end of March. It also said the accounting investigation should not
affect the company's ability to operate.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in November, Aurora Foods said it expected to report 1999 earnings
between 78 cents to 81 cents per share. According to a First Call/Thomson
Financial survey, analysts were expecting 79 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past few years, the San Francisco-based company has grown by
acquiring well-known brands and revitalizing them with marketing support,
expanded distribution, and new product development. Among the brands under the
Aurora Foods umbrella are Mrs. Butterworth's pancake mix, Log Cabin syrup,
Chef's Choice frozen meals, Lender's bagels, Celeste frozen pizza and Van de
Kamp's frozen seafood.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading in Aurora was halted Friday on the New York Stock Exchange on the
news. Shares closed Thursday at $7.31 1/4, well off their 52-week high of
$19.50.

<HEADLINE> World Trade Talks Resumption Sought  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said Friday that encouraging
progress is being made toward launching a new round of global trade talks
following the spectacular failure of the World Trade Organization to get the job
done in December.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky held separate discussions
Friday with Japanese Foreign Minister Yehei Kono and Pascal Lamy, the top trade
negotiator for the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Barshefsky told reporters she believed the world's largest economies had a
new sense of commitment to clearing away the roadblocks that had prevented the
135-member WTO from beginning a new round of global negotiations aimed at
reducing trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
	   The four days of discussion in Seattle were marked by massive protests by
labor unions, environmentalists and human rights groups protesting what the harm
they said globalization had done to the environment and worker rights.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe we are seeing some elements of flexibility that clearly we did
not see in Seattle. That is very positive, but that alone does not make a new
round," Barshefsky told reporters after her meetings with Lamy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now our focus is on simply moving the process forward and if that
catalyzes the system and results in a new round this year or next, that is
great," she said. "But what is important is that we continue to move forward."
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to address the concerns of developing countries, the
administration has been exploring with the EU and Japan proposals to offer poor
nations greater access for their goods in the markets of rich countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Barshefsky said if Congress passes currently pending bills to expand
duty-free treatment of products from nations in the Caribbean and Africa, this
would represent a substantial statement of America's commitment to this effort.
</P>
<P>
	   Lamy, speaking to a Washington audience on Thursday, said, "We have hovered
too long on the brink of agreement to the tariff and quota free treatment of
goods from least developed countries. I hope we can confirm that deal shortly."
</P>
<P>
	   Barshefsky told reporters that she hoped continued discussions with the EU
and Japan would lead to developing a unified approach among rich nations on
market-opening initiatives for the goods of poor nations that could be presented
to the WTO this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Barshefsky also said she discussed several long-running US-EU trade disputes
with Lamy over bananas, U.S. beef produced with growth hormones and the use of
hush kits to silence airplane noise. She termed the discussions "constructive"
but said no breakthroughs had been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks Suit Against Clinton  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court Friday refused to revive a
lawsuit by 31 members of Congress who accused President Clinton of overstepping
his authority when he ordered the military to join in last year's NATO bombing
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   The members of Congress lacked legal standing to pursue their argument that
Clinton violated the 1973 War Powers Act, said the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   Writing for the court, Judge Laurence Silberman said the members of Congress
lacked standing because they had ``ample legislative power to have stopped
prosecution of the war.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress could have passed a law forbidding the use of U.S. forces, and it
could have cut off funds for the operation, wrote Silberman, a Reagan nominee to
the court.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vietnam war-era War Powers Act, which has been ignored by presidents of
both parties, requires a president to receive congressional approval for the
``introduction into hostilities'' of U.S. forces for more than 60 days. The NATO
air campaign began March 24, 1999, and lasted for 11 weeks with no American
combat deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Tom Campbell, the California Republican who led the lawmakers suing the
president, said lawmakers would consider appealing to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court's decision today is a disappointment to all of us who try to
uphold the Constitution,'' Campbell said in a statement released by his office.
``To allow a president to make war on his own is a terrible error.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 31 lawmakers, including four Democrats, noted in their lawsuit that a
213-213 House vote last April fell short of authorizing U.S. participation in
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman dismissed the case last June, saying those
who sued failed to show ``a sufficiently genuine impasse between the legislative
and executive branches to give them standing.''
</P>
<P>
	   All three members of the appeals court agreed that the members of Congress
lacked standing to sue, although they differed on the reasons. The other two
judges on the case were Judges A. Raymond Randolph, a Bush nominee, and David
Tatel, a Clinton nominee.

<P>
    SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- Advantica Restaurant Group will change its name to
Denny's after selling off its other restaurant chains, company spokeswoman Karen
Randall said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Advantica announced plans Thursday to sell its Coco's and Carrows chains and
concentrate on its Denny's restaurants. Last summer, the company sold its El
Pollo Loco restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   Randall said changing the name to Denny's "would obviously reflect our
one-brand, one-company philosophy." The company, which is traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, does not plan to change its ticker symbol, which is DINE.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be the company's fifth name change in the past 20 years. Since 1980,
the company has been known as Spartan Food Systems, TW Services, Flagstar and
Classic Restaurants Group Ltd. The company took the name Advantica in January
1998 after its bankruptcy restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Cyanide Levels in Danube Said Down  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Cyanide levels have diminished in the Serbian
part of the Danube River to the point that only one recent sample showed
concentrations of the poison above acceptable drinking levels, U.N.
environmental officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Their report came more than two weeks after a spill at a gold mine. In
another sign that the pollution was becoming less dangerous, Serbia's
Agriculture Minister on Friday revoked its ban on drinking and otherwise using
the waters of the Danube and Tisza rivers, saying toxic substances in both had
dropped below dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the extent of the improvement remained unclear, with the Romanian
Ministry of Environment saying earlier in the day that contamination levels of
cyanide and heavy metals in the Danube were measured at three times acceptable
European Union standards.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't clear if the reports from Serbia and the U.N. conflicted with
those from Romania, or whether different standards were being used.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement carried by the Fonet news agency, the Serbian ministry said
that cyanide was found only in ``traces'' of water samples taken Thursday. And
the U.N. environmental officials said that, of 18 samples taken from the Danube
as it left Serbia and flowed into Romania, only one was slightly above the
maximum for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned about the cyanide levels, which are certainly still some
risk for the aquatic life,'' said the head of the U.N. team, Pekka Haavisto.
``But fortunately only one of the samples was found above the limit for drinking
water.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another member of the team, Peter Literathy, said analysis of other possible
poisons released with the cyanide, notably heavy metals, would be available at
an unspecified later date.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists have called the spill Europe's worst river disaster in a
decade, and the EU has called for an international commission to help with
cleanup. The United Nations also plans to send a team of experts to assess the
damage to the Tisza and Danube rivers in Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the pollution reached Danube River towns in Ukraine, officials at
the Odessa department of the Ecological Security Ministry said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Ukrainian authorities did not expect large-scale water
poisoning similar to that in Hungary. The poisoned water was likely to remain in
Ukraine for a week, and residents were advised to abstain from fishing until
March 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill said Friday that Australia would
help clean up the rivers, as the Australian mining company Esmeralda Exploration
is a major partner in the Baia Mare gold mine, where the spill originated.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 30, a containment dam broke at the mine, sending an estimated 100
tons of cyanide and tons of toxic heavy metals pouring into streams, passing
through Hungary and Yugoslavia via the Szamos and Tisza rivers before returning
to Romania on the Danube.
</P>
<P>
	   Literathy said that ``all fish practically died,'' in the Tisza before the
poison started diluting in the much larger Danube.
</P>
<P>
	   Janos Goenczy, the Hungarian official appointed to coordinate his country's
efforts to deal with the spill and its impact, told the state MTI news agency of
Hungary that it would take a year or two for life to return to the Tisza at ``a
humanly acceptable level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tests taken Friday morning at a dam near the city of Drobeta Turnu-Severin,
170 miles west of Bucharest, showed cyanide levels three time above the
acceptable EU standard and 14 times the Romanian norms, said Gheorghe
Constantin, of the Romanian Ministry of Environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Romanian environmentalists found high concentrations of copper, chrome, zinc
and iron in the Danube farther upriver Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Geneva-based World Health Organization expressed concern about the
presence of toxic metals in the water that experts fear could have an additional
impact on human health. They called for a review of environment and health
regulatory standards related to precious metal mining in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Highway Protesters Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Misdemeanor charges have been filed against 20
people who shut down a highway during a march to protest the shooting of a black
teenager by white police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The district attorney's office charged 20 protesters with obstructing
movement on a street or public place and being a public nuisance, Chief Deputy
District Attorney Eileen Hunt said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who carried children or pushed them in strollers were also charged
with child endangerment.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators were angry that the district attorney did not charge four
white police officers who shot Tyisha Miller. Miller, 18, was killed Dec. 28,
1998, as she sat unresponsive with a gun on her lap in a locked and idling car.
</P>
<P>
	   On Nov. 1, a protester in a pickup truck stopped traffic on Highway 91 by
zigzagging across several lanes. About 40 demonstrators then hoisted signs and
prayed before marching on the freeway.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunt said charges were filed against the people police were able to
identify. They face up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Up on U.S. Sales Hopes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean prices rose sharply Friday on the Chicago Board of
Trade as the result of a possible delay in Brazilian exports that would boost
prospects for U.S. sales. Grains were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   In limited pre-holiday trading, soybeans leaped to contract highs on news
that Brazil's primary port for soybean exports may experience a two-week delay
in loading new crops.
</P>
<P>
	   That effectively would add two weeks to the window in which crops from the
United States, the No. 1 soybean producer in the world, will be fully dominant
on the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat futures also increased after four straight days of decline that
observers said had left the market oversold.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn, however, headed lower after a storm in the U.S. Midwest and forecasts
for more snow showers next week that promise to improve topsoil moisture. South
Korea's purchase of more corn from China also pressured the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.64 3/4 a bushel; March corn
fell  3/4 cent to $2.20 1/2 a bushel; March oats rose 1 1/4 cent to $1.08 3/4 a
bushel; March soybeans rose 6 1/2 cents to $5.14 1/2 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures
rose.
</P>
<P>
	   April live cattle fell .22 cent to 70.90 cents a pound; March feeder cattle
fell .37 cent to 83.10 cents a pound; April lean hogs rose .17 cent to 57.22
cents a pound; March frozen pork bellies rose 1.55 cents to 88.45 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Bond Market Up in Slow Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose in light trading Friday after news of an
unexpectedly slight rise in inflation eased fears that higher prices in the
economy could erode the value of fixed-rate securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 31/32 point, or $9.69 per $1,000
in face value, in trading that ended early ahead of the three-day President's
Day weekend. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, fell to
6.15 percent from 6.22 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index edged up a
smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in January. Lower prices for clothing helped
offset rising costs for fuel oil and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
	   The news was welcomed by investors, who bought fixed-rate securities on the
premise that tame inflation may buoy the value of their holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   Long-term bonds are eroded by high inflation. In addition, the Federal
Reserve is expected to raise interest rates on bonds to keep inflation in check,
and higher rates would hurt the value of fixed-rate securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the market, prices of short-term Treasury securities ranged
from gains of 1/16 point to 5/32 point and intermediate maturities rose by up to
9/16 point, according to Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.73 percent, with the discount
rising 0.01 percentage point to 5.57 percent. Six-month yields were 6.00 percent
as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 5.74 percent. One-year yields were
6.22 percent, with the discount falling 0.01 percentage point to 5.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.69 percent from 5.56 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose 1/16 to 92 9/32. The yield to
maturity of the index fell to 6.20 percent from 6.21 percent Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Balloons to New High  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit widened by more than $100 billion
last year, reaching a record of $271.3 billion, the government said Friday. The
booming U.S. economy pushed up demand for foreign goods, and the cost of
imported oil more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department also reported trade deficits with Japan, China,
Canada, Mexico and the 15-nation European Union all set records in 1999. The
overall deficit rose by 65 percent from the previous record, 1998's imbalance of
$164.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade deficit narrowed a slight 5.7 percent to $25.5 billion in December
as exports climbed by a solid 3.2 percent to outpace a 1 percent gain in
imports.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, U.S. exports were up 2.7 percent to $958.5 billion, an
improvement from an export decline of 0.5 percent in 1998. But this small gain
was swamped by a 12 percent rise in imports, which soared to $1.23 trillion last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration drew comfort from the fact that export sales are
beginning to bounce back as overseas nations recover from the steep recessions
brought on by the 1997-98 global currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   "Continued economic recovery abroad has spurred our exports in late 1999,
particularly in December. If this trend continues, it bodes well for our trade
balance," said Commerce Department chief economist Lee Price.
</P>
<P>
	   But opponents of President Clinton's trade policy pointed to the
back-to-back record annual deficits as evidence that the administration's trade
strategies are not working to open export markets or protect U.S. workers from a
flood of cheap imports. Critics pointed out that despite the overall economic
boom, manufacturing lost 341,000 jobs in 1999 alone.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we let our trade deficit continue to skyrocket in 2000, we're likely to
see more job losses," warned Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   America's trade gap is certain to be a debating point when Congress takes up
Clinton's request to grant China normal trade relations on a permanent basis in
exchange for China's pledge to lower its high barriers to U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the big rise in the deficit was led by a 33.7 percent jump
in oil imports to $65.7 billion, up $43.4 billion from 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase was totally reflected in a huge jump in domestic oil prices.
After a big drop in world oil prices in 1998, a reflection of slumping demand,
crude oil rose from $9.19 per barrel last January to $22.67 per barrel in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts predicted more bad news on this front as the spot crude oil price
topped $30 this week for the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   As U.S. farmers and manufacturers suffered from the loss of overseas markets
brought on by 1997-98 global financial crisis, U.S. consumers reaped the benefit
of a flood of cheaper goods coming into this market, which has helped hold down
inflation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers,
declared that the "worst should be over by midyear" in terms of widening
deficits.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the world economy picking up speed, ... it will actually be possible
to achieve an export boom in 2001 and beyond," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   By country, the United States suffered its largest deficit with the
perennial front-runner, Japan, a record imbalance of $73.9 billion, up 15.5
percent from a $64 billion deficit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The deficit with China was close behind at $68.7 billion, an increase of
14.6 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other record deficits were with Canada, at $32.1 billion; Mexico, $22.8
billion; and the 15-nation European Union, $43.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the higher oil bill, America's rising trade deficit reflected
an increase in the imbalance of imports over exports for cars and trucks, up $25
billion, and computers and office machines, up $7.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Examines Control Mechanisms  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government materials specialists are examining suspect
control mechanisms removed from several airliners during urgent inspections
following the crash of Alaska Airlines flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board said Friday its Washington
laboratories have received five jackscrews taken from planes and expects to
receive from the FAA the rest of the 18 removed so far.
</P>
<P>
	   Specialists are studying wear on the assemblies, which control the movement
of the horizontal stabilizer on the aircraft's tail. That wing-like device helps
level the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew of the Alaska Airlines MD-83 reported problems with the stabilizer
and were trying to correct them when the plane crashed Jan. 31, killing all 88
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane crashed into the sea off the coast of California. As of Friday,
the Ventura County Medical Examiner's office reported that remains of 49 victims
had been identified, the Safety Board said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered inspection of more than 1,100
MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717 planes, all of which use similar control
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the Safety Board reported its specialists also are examining
grease samples from the removed jackscrews. Some of the lubricants reportedly
had grit or metal shavings in them.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew from the crashed plane had a stripped nut, the board said, and
the screw itself carried metal shards of the same material as the nut. Turning
of the screw within that nut is what moves the stabilizer up or down.
</P>
<P>
	   There also were impact marks on the nut, and the board is trying to
determine if the impact marks and stripping of the nut occurred before the plane
crashed or afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Laboratory work on these parts is expected to take several weeks, the board
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew from the crashed plane was made in the United States, the
board noted, and was supplied to the plane manufacturer in 1990. It said
investigators are studying maintenance records for the part.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy has completed mapping the wreckage and will begin salvage
operations next week using remotely controlled vehicles, according to the board.
Recovered wreckage will be taken to a hangar at the Port Hueneme, Calif., naval
base for examination.

	   Fuel Prices Surge, Clothing Falls
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fuel oil prices hit a four-year high, but the
surge in gasoline and other energy costs was blunted by the
steepest decline in clothing prices in nearly 11 years as consumer
prices rose a mild 0.2 percent in January. Overall energy prices
rose a sizable 1 percent last month, Labor Department figures

1998. Deficits with Japan, China, Canada, Mexico and the European
Union all set records. The huge imbalance for 1999 reflected a 33.7

	   US Air: Boeing Withheld Test Info
</P>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- US Airways officials have accused Boeing Co. of
withholding flight test data they say could have prevented a plane
crash near Pittsburgh in 1994 that killed all 132 people aboard. In
court documents unsealed this week in Chicago, the airline said the
test data involved the Boeing 737's flying characteristics at a
certain speed. The National Transportation Safety Board ruled last
year that a rudder reversal probably caused the 737 to crash. Since
the crash, airlines have instructed their pilots to fly the 737
faster when first deploying flaps to give themselves more time to
correct problems that can't be fixed at slower speeds. The higher
speed was officially adopted into Boeing's 737 operating manual
last March. Boeing denied the US Airways allegations and said the
information was made available to the Federal Aviation
Administration when the airplane was being certified in 1984.

<HEADLINE> FBI Traps Suspected Cuban Spy  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official charged with spying for Cuba was
arrested after falling straight into a trap set by the FBI, investigators said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI said it fed Mariano Faget phony information about an impending
defection and then caught him passing it on just 12 minutes later to a contact
with ties to the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, 54, a Cuban-born supervisor in the Miami office of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, may have been passing on classified information
about Cuban defectors for some time, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, Faget met with Cuban intelligence officials in
Miami on at least two occasions, contacted officials with the agency that
represents Cuba in Washington and had regular contact with the man he called
last week in the sting -- a New York businessman with ties to the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they had been investigating Faget for a year but wouldn't
say how long they believe he may had been passing on classified information.
They also said they were uncertain about the effects of his alleged espionage --
whether any Cubans were prevented from coming to the United States or even
killed, for example.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget (pronounced fah-HAY), who was arrested Thursday, is charged with
violating the federal Espionage Act and making false statements to a federal
officer. The first charge carries up to 10 years in prison; the second could
bring five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing in court Friday, the paunchy, balding Faget was ordered held until
a bail hearing Thursday. He caught the eyes of relatives and friends as he
walked into court and held his left hand to his heart.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Joel Kaplan would not comment. Nor would Faget's family
members and friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors said they will ask that Faget be held as a flight risk
and a danger to the community.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget began working for the INS as a clerk 34 years ago, INS district
director Bob Wallis said. He would have been eligible for retirement next month.
</P>
<P>
	   As a supervisory district adjudication officer for the INS, Faget had
``secret'' security clearance and oversaw decisions that affected the residency
status of immigrants, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI spokesman Paul Mallett said Faget waited only 12 minutes Feb. 11 before
he passed on the phony information that a Cuban official was about to defect.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, INS and FBI officials showed Faget pictures of a
Cuban intelligence official he knew, and told Faget that the man wanted to
defect and that the information was secret and very sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, Faget returned to his office and used his personal cell
phone to call the New York businessman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faget told the businessman that `a person we both know' was `one of the
ones working with the Americans,''' U.S. Attorney Thomas Scott said in a
statement. ``Faget then identified the Cuban intelligence officer by name.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Faget called the man from home and discussed the case in more detail,
the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, Faget and the New York businessman are officers
of a Florida company whose stated purpose is to engage in future business
transactions with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   State records show Faget is vice president and secretary of America-Cuba
Inc., a company created in 1994. The company's president and chief executive is
listed as Pedro Font of Greenwich, Conn. A source close to the investigation
confirmed for The Associated Press that Font was the businessman named in the
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
	   A number listed for Font in Greenwich, Conn., was disconnected.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Goyanes, listed in state records as a Miami-based executive of
America-Cuba, said Friday he was surprised by the charges against Faget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am shocked. The guy is a family man. He works for the government,''
Goyanes said. ``This is the last thing I ever thought. The courts will prove him
innocent when it is all over.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities said that in addition to the New York contact, Faget
placed calls to the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, which represents Cuba
in the United States, and met with two Cuban intelligence officers.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Cuban Interests Section declined comment. The White House
also had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallis said all of the cases that had crossed Faget's desk would be closely
reviewed. Early Friday, authorities searched Faget's home in the Miami suburb of
Kendall and seized two computers and his automobile.
</P>
<P>
	   His arrest comes amid already strained relations with the communist island
over Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy found clinging to an inner tube
off the Florida coast Nov. 25. His mother and 10 others died when their boat
sank in an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's Miami relatives are fighting to keep him in the United States,
despite an order by the INS to reunite Elian with his father in Cuba. Faget had
nothing to do with Elian's case, Wallis said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities also said Faget had no connection to a large Cuban spy ring
broken up in 1998. Fourteen people were accused of trying to penetrate U.S.
military bases, infiltrate anti-Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media
and political organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Five people have pleaded guilty. Others go on trial in May.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Will Be Busy in April  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, working through what likely will
become a historic 1999-2000 term, has an April argument calendar loaded with
high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The fate of the famous Miranda police warnings, the Boy Scouts' ban on
homosexuals and state bans on ``partial-birth abortions'' all go before the
justices.
</P>
<P>
	   The court also will hear arguments over California's ``blanket primary''
policy and state employees' protections under a key anti-bias law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're talking about some of the biggest blockbusters of recent years,''
said American University law professor Herman Schwartz. ``This year is
unparalleled ... in the number of important cases they've taken.''
</P>
<P>
	   The April calendar, announced Friday, features 12 of the 77 cases to be
decided before the term ends in late June or early July. Arguments in the 65
others have been heard since the court term began in October.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Miranda case, to be argued April 19, the justices must decide whether
Congress in 1968 effectively overturned the landmark 1966 decision requiring
police to warn criminal suspects they have a ``right to remain silent'' and to
get a lawyer's help.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boy Scouts dispute is one of the few gay-rights disputes the justices
have tackled in recent years. Scheduled to be heard April 26, the term's last
argument day, the case centers on a New Jersey court's ruling that said the
organization unlawfully ousted a young man after learning he is gay.
</P>
<P>
	   The state court ruled that the Boy Scouts' denial of membership to
homosexual boys and leaders violated a New Jersey law banning discrimination in
public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
	   The legal and moral war over abortion is back before the court for the first
time since 1992. The justices will use a Nebraska case to decide whether states
may ban a surgical procedure opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.'' Thirty
states have such laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion-rights advocates say the court's decision in the case, to be argued
April 25, could broadly safeguard -- or dramatically erode -- abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   In arguments April 24, four political parties will ask the justices to ban a
California law that lets voters cast their ballots for primary election
candidates regardless of party affiliation. For example, the law lets someone
vote to nominate a Republican candidate for governor, a Democrat for senator and
a Libertarian for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
	   The court's decision in the case will not be announced in time to affect
this year's California primary election, scheduled for March 7. A number of
other states have more limited open-primary laws, in which voters can request
the ballot of any political party in a primary election.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of several states' rights disputes on the court's docket, the
justices are using a Florida case to decide whether state employees are
protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, which will hear that case April 26, already have ruled that
state employees cannot go into federal court and sue over age bias because of
states' sovereign immunity.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Balloons to New High  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit widened by more than $100 billion
last year, reaching a record of $271.3 billion, the government said Friday. The
booming U.S. economy pushed up demand for foreign goods, and the cost of
imported oil more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department also reported trade deficits with Japan, China,
Canada, Mexico and the 15-nation European Union all set records in 1999. The
overall deficit rose by 65 percent from the previous record, 1998's imbalance of
$164.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade deficit narrowed a slight 5.7 percent to $25.5 billion in December
as exports climbed by a solid 3.2 percent to outpace a 1 percent gain in
imports.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, U.S. exports were up 2.7 percent to $958.5 billion, an
improvement from an export decline of 0.5 percent in 1998. But this small gain
was swamped by a 12 percent rise in imports, which soared to $1.23 trillion last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration drew comfort from the fact that export sales are
beginning to bounce back as overseas nations recover from the steep recessions
brought on by the 1997-98 global currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   "Continued economic recovery abroad has spurred our exports in late 1999,
particularly in December. If this trend continues, it bodes well for our trade
balance," said Commerce Department chief economist Lee Price.
</P>
<P>
	   But opponents of President Clinton's trade policy pointed to the
back-to-back record annual deficits as evidence that the administration's trade
strategies are not working to open export markets or protect U.S. workers from a
flood of cheap imports. Critics pointed out that despite the overall economic
boom, manufacturing lost 341,000 jobs in 1999 alone.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we let our trade deficit continue to skyrocket in 2000, we're likely to
see more job losses," warned Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   America's trade gap is certain to be a debating point when Congress takes up
Clinton's request to grant China normal trade relations on a permanent basis in
exchange for China's pledge to lower its high barriers to U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the big rise in the deficit was led by a 33.7 percent jump
in oil imports to $65.7 billion, up $43.4 billion from 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase was totally reflected in a huge jump in domestic oil prices.
After a big drop in world oil prices in 1998, a reflection of slumping demand,
crude oil rose from $9.19 per barrel last January to $22.67 per barrel in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts predicted more bad news on this front as the spot crude oil price
topped $30 this week for the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   As U.S. farmers and manufacturers suffered from the loss of overseas markets
brought on by 1997-98 global financial crisis, U.S. consumers reaped the benefit
of a flood of cheaper goods coming into this market, which has helped hold down
inflation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers,
declared that the "worst should be over by midyear" in terms of widening
deficits.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the world economy picking up speed, ... it will actually be possible
to achieve an export boom in 2001 and beyond," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   By country, the United States suffered its largest deficit with the
perennial front-runner, Japan, a record imbalance of $73.9 billion, up 15.5
percent from a $64 billion deficit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The deficit with China was close behind at $68.7 billion, an increase of
14.6 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other record deficits were with Canada, at $32.1 billion; Mexico, $22.8
billion; and the 15-nation European Union, $43.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the higher oil bill, America's rising trade deficit reflected
an increase in the imbalance of imports over exports for cars and trucks, up $25
billion, and computers and office machines, up $7.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Ford Settles Discrimination Charges  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will pay $3.8 million in a settlement with
the Labor Department over charges of discrimination against women and minorities
in hiring at seven of the company's plants, federal officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford also has agreed to hire 100 female and minorities applicants who were
turned down for entry-level assembly line positions at the plants, and will
compensate other applicants for lost wages, as they are located.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor officials said the agreement ensures Ford will hire more women and
minorities at all its facilities because the company agreed to employ them in
proportion to the percentage who apply.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is significant that the company -- on a corporate-wide basis -- will
change its hiring analysis which will open a pipeline of opportunity to women
and minorities who have too long been excluded from good paying jobs on the Ford
assembly line," Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement is the fifth-largest by a company with the department's
Office of Federal Contract Compliance, which oversees federal contractors to
ensure they are complying with the government's affirmative action and
nondiscrimination rules, officials said. The department can cancel federal
contracts with companies that do not comply.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford did not admit to any discrimination in the settlement. The company said
it wanted to avoid the costs and uncertainties of litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to reestablish a good working relationship with the agency," said
Ford spokeswoman Della DiPietro. "We fully share the same goals regarding
diversity in the work force."
</P>
<P>
	   She said that prolonged litigation was not in the best interest of Ford
employees, shareholders or consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The plants involved are in Louisville, Ky; Wayne and Sterling Heights,
Mich.; Sandusky, Ohio; Kansas City and St. Louis, Mo.; and Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the money -- $2 million -- will go to qualified female applicants
who were not hired at the Kentucky Truck Plant in 1993, shortly after the
facility underwent a major expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials identified 318 qualified female applicants who were not
hired at the Kentucky plant. Women were 38 percent of qualified applicants, but
only about 25 percent of those hired for the assembly jobs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were three other facilities under review, but where no formal finding
of discrimination was made: San Francisco Parts Distribution Center;
Connersville, Ind., plant; and the Atlanta Assembly plant. Nevertheless, Ford
agreed to hire more veterans and disabled workers at the San Francisco center.
</P>
<P>
	   Herman said the agreement closed charges of discriminatory hiring practices
in the 1990s at the 10 Ford facilities. The consent decree covering the
settlement goes into effect on Saturday, three days after being approved by an
administrative law judge.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest Labor settlement involving allegations of discrimination by a
federal contractor was $14 million paid by Harris Bank of Chicago in 1989.

<HEADLINE> New Charges in Bank of N.Y. Scam  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York employee accused of perjury in
the $7 billion Russian money laundering scam will face more charges, a
prosecutor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Buehler did not describe the new indictment against Svetlana
Kudryavtsev but referred to "recent developments in this case."
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev's lawyer, Charles D. Adler, said he believed the prosecutor was
referring to guilty pleas made Wednesday by Lucy Edwards, the bank's former vice
president in the Eastern European Division, and her husband, Peter Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair admitted aiding Russian bankers in moving more than $7 billion
through accounts at the bank to avoid taxes in Russia and to cover up the
money's connection to crimes, including $300,000 used as ransom for a kidnapping
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   In her plea, Edwards said the couple paid Kudryavtsev $500 a month after
they moved from New York to London in 1996 so she could monitor the accounts
used for money laundering.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev, an associate in the bank's Eastern European division, was
questioned by the FBI in August. Kudryavtsev is charged with lying to
investigators in that interview; she pleaded innocent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Adler said that during an "unscheduled and difficult interview with
non-Russian-speaking agents, she made inaccurate statements."
</P>
<P>
	   He also described his client as a low-level bank employee, an administrative
assistant who developed a friendship with Edwards and Berlin. He said the
relatively small payments allegedly made to Kudryavtsev by the couple reflect
what little she would have known about the money laundering scheme.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Students Hired Strippers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLEASANTON, Calif. (AP) -- High school students who organized a ski trip also
hired the entertainment -- two strippers.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Sgt. Bob Lyness said last weekend's trip to South Lake Tahoe featured
a male stripper in a cabin where the girls were staying and a female stripper in
the boy's cabin.
</P>
<P>
	   A chaperone discovered the male stripper and kicked him out, but the
performer returned later to finish the show, Lyness said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foothill High School students were interviewed by police, who said no
charges would be filed because no laws were broken.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no physical contact as far as we can determine,'' Lyness said.
</P>
<P>
	   Principal Kevin Johnson said the trip wasn't a school function.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the Pleasanton School District made headlines across the country
after a mother pleaded no contest and a male stripper pleaded guilty to charges
filed after the mother hired the stripper for her 15-year-old daughter's slumber
party.
</P>
<P>
	   Pleasanton is 40 miles southeast of San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Soldier's Hearing in Kosovo Begins  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A trail of pinkish blood in the snow led
soldiers to the body of an ethnic Albanian girl allegedly killed last month by a
fellow U.S. soldier, one of the men who found the body told a military court
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The soldier was among the witnesses and investigating officers who testified
at an opening preliminary hearing for Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, who is accused
of assaulting and killing the 11-year-old girl in Kosovo. Ronghi was serving as
a peacekeeper in the NATO-led force in the province.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing was to determine if there is enough evidence to court-martial
Ronghi on charges of murder and indecent acts with a child. He could face the
death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ronghi's defense counsel disputed that his acts were premeditated, and
is seeking a lesser charge that would carry a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   The pretrial investigation is similar in some respects to a grand jury, and
Ronghi has not entered a plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Reporters were required to withhold witnesses' names to protect their
privacy. The restriction was imposed because of the nature of the case and was a
condition for reporting on the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   One visibly shaken soldier told the court how, on the night of Jan. 13, he
and several comrades drove to a wooded hillside. They followed a faint trail of
blood to where a tin can appeared to have been tossed in the snow. A few feet
away, they noticed something else.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oh, my God, don't let that be a sock, please don't let that be a sock,''
one of the soldiers said, according to the testimony. They removed some snow and
found the dead girl curled into the fetal position.
</P>
<P>
	   Some details of how the soldiers came to suspect Ronghi were unclear in
Friday's testimony. But an investigating officer testified that Ronghi told a
witness who was in his vehicle that day to keep quiet about anything he had
seen.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi allegedly said it is ``easy to get away with something like this in a
Third World country,'' and he knew that because he had ``done it before in the
desert.''
</P>
<P>
	   The officer said a superior told him that, when confronted, Ronghi initially
denied knowing anything about the body. Then he said he found it in an apartment
building and got scared so he buried it, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi, 35, is a weapons squad leader assigned to the 405th Parachute
Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, N.C. The Niles, Ohio, native previously
fought in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi is being held in detention at the U.S. Army's Mannheim confinement
facility in Germany. He was brought to Kosovo for the hearing, which could last
up to a week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army said Ronghi has made a statement on the case, but it has not yet
been released. Last month, Stars and Stripes, the U.S. military's unofficial
newspaper, reported he admitted to the killing. There has been no official
confirmation of that report.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi appeared calm as he listened to the testimony Friday. He did not
speak.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl and her family lived in Vitina, a Kosovo town.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members attended Friday's hearing. Speaking to reporters outside the
courtroom, the girl's father, Hamdi Shabiu, said they were satisfied with the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a military court, and I believe nothing will be hidden here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the hearing, an investigating officer will study the testimony and
refer the case to higher officers, who will decide whether to convene a
court-martial.

<HEADLINE> America West Faces Computer Glitch  </HEADLINE>
    By ALISA BLACKWOOD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Ernesto Martinez wrapped himself in an airline blanket and
sprawled across a row of black vinyl chairs, trying to get some sleep while
stranded at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   His was one of 128 America West Airlines flights canceled nationwide
Thursday and Friday because of a glitch in the airline's computer system that
prepares flight plans for pilots and crews.
</P>
<P>
	   Several thousand passengers were affected, and at least 1,000 were forced to
camp out at Sky Harbor Thursday night, according to airport officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was hellish," said Martinez, of El Paso, Texas. "It was just row after
row filled with people and everyone was just disgusted."
</P>
<P>
	   The glitch is the latest in an array of unrelated problems for the airline,
including hefty maintenance fines and consistent rankings as one of the
country's worst airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline was fined $5 million by the FAA in July 1998 over maintenance
and safety violations. The airline ultimately paid only $2.5 million; the FAA
waived the rest last year.
</P>
<P>
	   America West also had the highest rate of passenger complaints to the
Transportation Department and the poorest on-time arrival record of any major
airline in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tempe, Ariz.-based airline is the nation's ninth-largest carrier, with
hubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the problems, America West is still turning record profits. America
West Holdings Corp., the parent company of America West Airlines and a travel
package arm, The Leisure Co., reported in January that it earned a record $119.4
million, or $3.03 per share, in 1999. It marked a 26 percent increase over 1998
for the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of America West were trading at $15.56 1/4, up 6 1/4 cents, at 4:30
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.

<P>
	   "They're a low cost carrier that serves two big growing markets -- Phoenix
and Las Vegas -- that are very popular with tourists," said Ray Neidle, an
analyst who follows the airline industry for ING Barings in New York. "Due to
the low unit cost structure they're able to survive."
</P>
<P>
	   However, if a company's success is measured by its customers' satisfaction,
the airline has work to do.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to be able to deliver a product that's consistent and when you
have situations like this, it reinforces the negative image you have," Neidle
said.
</P>
<P>
	   America West did not immediately return a phone call seeking a response to
Neidle's comments.
</P>
<P>
	   America West was operating on a backup system Friday while investigating the
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The backup had been in place since Thursday afternoon, but flights were
still being canceled Friday because of weather-related delays and crew
shortages. America West normally offers 650 flights a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Crews had to prepare their flight plans manually during the five hours the
system was down, said airline spokeswoman Patty Nowack said earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from planning the flight's course, the computer system usually gives
crew members the flight's fuel capacity, weight balance and weather information.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem did not pose a safety threat, Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nowack said the airline did give away 1,500 hotel rooms in Phoenix Thursday
night. She disputed the airport's numbers for people spending the night in the
terminal, saying it was less than 100.
</P>
<P>
	   But amid the confusion, lost baggage and long waits -- some as long as 12
hours -- it appeared the airline could do nothing to appease some of its angry
customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will never fly America West again," said Mike Stark of Chicago, who
managed to get a hotel room. "I can't imagine how they stay in business."

<HEADLINE> Syria: Israel Disrupts Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In a letter circulated Friday, Syria's foreign
minister accused Israel not only of disrupting Middle East peace talks, but also
of resorting to military attacks instead of political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
	   Farouk al-Sharaa was responding to a letter from Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy, who accused Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon of escalating
attacks. Levy also warned that Syria would be blamed for undermining peace
efforts if it didn't act to stop the attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Both letters were sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who on Friday
issued his second statement in 10 days warning that the high level of tension in
south Lebanon ``has the potential for further destabilization of the already
very fragile situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary-general called on all parties to exercise restraint, respect
civilians and ``redouble their efforts to achieve measurable progress in the
peace process,'' U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli warplanes destroyed three Lebanese power stations early last week
and blasted Hezbollah positions in south Lebanon. The airstrikes came after
guerrillas killed more than a half dozen Israeli soldiers in a zone that Israel
occupies in Lebanon as a buffer against attacks on its northern towns.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Feb. 9 letter, Levy said Israel would continue to defend northern
Israel ``and will take all necessary measures in order to strike at terrorists
and those who support and abet them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to Levy's letter, al-Sharaa said Israel's demand that Lebanon and
Syria curb Hezbollah's ``terrorism'' ignores the legitimate right of resistance
movements to fight against ``foreign occupation.''
</P>
<P>
	   He accused Israel of ignoring U.N. resolutions to withdraw its forces from
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel's arrogance of power has reached such an extent that the aggressor
is transformed into a victim and the actual victim, defending its territory on
its own soil, has become, in Israel's understanding, an aggressor,'' al-Sharaa
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But even more serious than Israel blaming Hezbollah, he said, ``is the fact
that his letter conveys a threat of further aggression and of recourse to
military action against Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel's chief diplomat not only went so far as to threaten the use of
force but went on to appear in person on the world's television screens with the
promise to burn and destroy Lebanon,'' al-Sharaa said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said that negotiations in January in Shepherdstown, W.Va.,
demonstrated that Israel was unwilling to withdraw from the Golan Heights, which
it captured during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks were postponed indefinitely because Syria wanted assurances that
Israel would withdraw from the entire Golan Heights, but Israel first wanted to
know the extent of peace and security arrangements Syria was prepared to offer.

<HEADLINE> Summit Tries To Promote Africa  </HEADLINE>
   By PAULINE JELINEK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid the Western suits and flowing African robes, one
delegate to the National Summit on Africa came dressed in a white laboratory
coat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the moment,'' beamed Rick Collett, whose jacket bore the words
``Garden Organics.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Seize the moment!'' said Collett of Reno, Nev. ``There are business
opportunities there. You just have to adapt to the African way.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such optimism was a key word among delegates and observers at what is being
billed as the first ever grass-roots effort to boost the cause of Africa in
America.
</P>
<P>
	   Garden Organics, Collett's company, bottles and sells pesticides from
African plants in the Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are nearly 6,000 people here wanting to help,'' Collett said. ``The
biggest thing is we share a commitment, and if we have commitment, and we follow
through, Africa will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The five-day convention to strengthen an African lobby in America, improve
Africa's image and work on U.S.-African partnerships includes not only
businessmen, but also educators, health professionals, U.S. and African
government officials, former Peace Corps members, aid workers and others who
have either worked in Africa or have an interest in it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing that is so exciting for me ... is the idea of having a more
learned lobby for Africa,'' said Leroy Nesbitt Jr., an administrator from
Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vt.
</P>
<P>
	   He wants more Africans to study in the United States and more American
students to travel to Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope a lot will come out of this,'' said retired business administrator
Henry Hicks of Victorville, Calif., who came with his delegate wife. ``America
has got to help other countries. We can do better.''
</P>
<P>
	   The summit, funded by the Carnegie Foundation, Ford Foundation, businesses
and others, has been in the making since late 1996. In regional summits around
the country, delegates drafted a plan of action they would like to have folded
into official U.S. policy toward Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan contains 236 recommendation on subjects ranging from fostering
trade and democracy to tackling AIDS and Africa's conflicts. It's to be amended
and approved by delegates from all 50 states on the summit's final day Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told delegates in a speech Thursday
the summit already has accomplished much.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The drafting process, including your six regional summits, has already
proven its worth by helping to awaken the American people to our own interest in
a strong and stable and prosperous Africa,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marilyn Sephocle, a language professor at Howard University in Washington,
came as an observer and said she believed the summit would bring greater
awareness of the good in Africa, which organizers say for too long has been
portrayed as a one-dimensional land of strife.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a person of African descent, I'm interested in Africa and want to see
all of the myths about Africa dispelled,'' said Sephocle.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit organizers said Friday they registered 2,300 delegates and 3,000
people who came as observers, speakers or staff.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Presidential Primary Ballot Set  </HEADLINE>
   By JESSE J. HOLLAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York will use a Republican presidential primary
ballot that includes Steve Forbes, even though he is no longer a candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, a New Jersey publisher, left the GOP race Feb. 10, but his name will
still appear on the March 7 New York primary ballot statewide along with Texas
Gov. George Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain, elections officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would take a court order to take him off the ballot,'' Lee Daghlian, a
spokesman for the state Board of Elections, said of Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge ordered state party officials to put McCain and Forbes on
the ballot after Bush's New York supporters tried to block the two from
appearing in the statewide primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the state's Republican leaders back Bush and hoped to guarantee him
an easy primary. They challenged the validity of McCain's and Forbes'
presidential petitions, claiming they had technical problems.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. District Judge Edward Korman overruled the challenges and on Feb. 4
ordered the state party to put McCain and Forbes on the ballot all over the
state. Alan Keyes will be on the GOP ballot in all but four districts. Forbes'
withdrawal came after Korman's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore, former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley and Lyndon LaRouche will be on the ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   A Siena College poll released Friday suggests McCain is ahead of Bush in the
primary race. The survey, conducted Sunday through Thursday indicates likely
voters in a New York primary favor McCain over Bush, 46 percent to 29 percent.
The poll had a 4.5 percentage point error margin.

<HEADLINE> Snow Snarls Traffic, Cancels School  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA RAFFAELE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A storm spread snow, sleet and thunderstorms across the Midwest and East on
Friday, giving many students a day off from school and frustrating travelers
with flight delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
	   Portions of northern Illinois, southern Michigan, southeastern Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania, and New York received the heaviest snow as the storm pushed
eastward across the New England states.
</P>
<P>
	   Many students across the region enjoyed a longer than expected Presidents
Day holiday weekend as schools closed or dismissed early.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm brought 9 inches of snow to parts of Iowa and Nebraska, up to 6
inches to southern Wisconsin and north-central Illinois, and a mix of snow and
freezing rain to Detroit, with 2 to 3 inches of snow in the suburbs. A snow
emergency was declared in Milwaukee and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was blamed for the deaths of a Virginia couple killed in a
multivehicle accident in Harrisburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow was coming down, visibility was bad and it was slippery,''
Pennsylvania state Trooper Linette Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wisconsin, Greg Olson was shoveling the sidewalk outside the Tenney Plaza
on Madison's Capitol Square. He said the snow was a nice change of pace -- if
only he could enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I was a kid I would have a ball in it, but seeing that I have to work
in it, I'm going to be one sore puppy tonight,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson said he was 49, but was ``feeling right now about 63.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thunderstorms capable of producing golf-ball-size hail, high wind and
isolated tornadoes were possible in parts of the Southeast. Tornadoes were
reported in Arkansas, in Benton and near Owensville, but only minor injuries
were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy rain showers were seen south of the snow showers across portions of
Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Thunderstorms rolled through West Virginia's Kanawha Valley, while freezing
rain pelted the Eastern Panhandle. Toni McCarty, owner of D&AMP;D Cleaners in
Keyser, W.Va., said local roads were ice-covered and treacherous.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a solid sheet of ice,'' McCarty said. ``It's nasty out. I haven't
seen any street cleaners going by. ... The side streets haven't been touched.
</P>
<P>
	   In Detroit, Mayor Dennis Archer said the city was prepared to plow all
neighborhood streets for the first time in decades. His administration came
under sharp criticism when a winter storm created citywide gridlock in January
1999. Since then, Detroit has significantly boosted its snow-removal budget and
brought in dozens of new plows.
</P>
<P>
	   At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, United Airlines canceled 250
flights and American Airlines canceled 150, officials said. Northwest Airlines
and its affiliates canceled more than 200 flights scheduled to arrive or depart
from its Detroit-area hub.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, there were scattered cancellations at New York's JFK
International Airport, and numerous cancellations and delays at LaGuardia
Airport. New York City picked up at least 3 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty flights were canceled at Newark International Airport, said Alan
Hicks, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Other airports, such as Philadelphia International, felt the ripple of
delays and cancellations because of the problems elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Soldier's Hearing in Kosovo Begins  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A trail of pinkish blood in the snow led
soldiers to the body of an ethnic Albanian girl allegedly killed last month by a
fellow U.S. soldier, one of the men who found the body told a military court
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The soldier was among the witnesses and investigating officers who testified
at an opening preliminary hearing for Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, who is accused
of assaulting and killing the 11-year-old girl in Kosovo. Ronghi was serving as
a peacekeeper in the NATO-led force in the province.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing was to determine if there is enough evidence to court-martial
Ronghi on charges of murder and indecent acts with a child. He could face the
death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ronghi's defense counsel disputed that his acts were premeditated, and
is seeking a lesser charge that would carry a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   The pretrial investigation is similar in some respects to a grand jury, and
Ronghi has not entered a plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Reporters were required to withhold witnesses' names to protect their
privacy. The restriction was imposed because of the nature of the case and was a
condition for reporting on the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   One visibly shaken soldier told the court how, on the night of Jan. 13, he
and several comrades drove to a wooded hillside. They followed a faint trail of
blood to where a tin can appeared to have been tossed in the snow. A few feet
away, they noticed something else.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oh, my God, don't let that be a sock, please don't let that be a sock,''
one of the soldiers said, according to the testimony. They removed some snow and
found the dead girl curled into the fetal position.
</P>
<P>
	   Some details of how the soldiers came to suspect Ronghi were unclear in
Friday's testimony. But an investigating officer testified that Ronghi told a
witness who was in his vehicle that day to keep quiet about anything he had
seen.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi allegedly said it is ``easy to get away with something like this in a
Third World country,'' and he knew that because he had ``done it before in the
desert.''
</P>
<P>
	   The officer said a superior told him that, when confronted, Ronghi initially
denied knowing anything about the body. Then he said he found it in an apartment
building and got scared so he buried it, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi, 35, is a weapons squad leader assigned to the 504th Parachute
Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, N.C. The Niles, Ohio, native previously
fought in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi is being held in detention at the U.S. Army's Mannheim confinement
facility in Germany. He was brought to Kosovo for the hearing, which could last
up to a week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army said Ronghi has made a statement on the case, but it has not yet
been released. Last month, Stars and Stripes, the U.S. military's unofficial
newspaper, reported he admitted to the killing. There has been no official
confirmation of that report.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi appeared calm as he listened to the testimony Friday. He did not
speak.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl and her family lived in Vitina, a Kosovo town.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members attended Friday's hearing. Speaking to reporters outside the
courtroom, the girl's father, Hamdi Shabiu, said they were satisfied with the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a military court, and I believe nothing will be hidden here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the hearing, an investigating officer will study the testimony and
refer the case to higher officers, who will decide whether to convene a
court-martial.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Balloons to New High  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fuel oil prices hit a four-year high, but the surge in
gasoline and other energy costs was blunted by the steepest decline in clothing
prices in nearly 11 years as consumer inflation rose a mild 0.2 percent in
January. Still, stocks on Wall Street plummeted in a fresh wave of fears about
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall energy prices rose a sizable 1 percent last month, Labor Department
figures showed Friday, and some economists believe the resulting higher energy
bills are likely to drive up other product prices in the coming months. That
would make January's good reading on inflation fleeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a decent report, but it's really the lull before the storm," said
Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's economic forecasting
project. "Higher energy costs will show up as increases in other prices or in
surcharges. There's no question that February's numbers will be eye-openers."
</P>
<P>
	   The performance of January's Consumer Price Index, the most closely watched
inflation gauge, marked the fourth consecutive month with a 0.2 percent rise in
the CPI.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve has bumped up interest rates four times since June to
slow the sizzling economy and keep inflation under control. Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan said Thursday that inflation dangers are lurking. He signaled in an
appearance before Congress that still higher interest rates are on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street was sobered by Greenspan's warning. The Dow Jones industrial
average closed down 295.05 points at 10,219.52, its seventh-largest one day
point drop. The Nasdaq fell 137.18 points to 4,411.74, its seventh-biggest point
drop. But inflation-sensitive bonds rallied on the CPI news.
</P>
<P>
	   Most economists expect the central bank will raise interest rates again in
March and several more times after that.
</P>
<P>
	   A big 1.1 percent decline in clothing prices, the largest drop since
February 1989, helped offset rising energy prices and restrained overall
consumer prices last month.
</P>
<P>
	   But economists cautioned that the post-holiday discounting that retailers
did to make room for new merchandise is unlikely to occur in February.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were getting inventories off the shelves, and it was a one-month
event," said Russell Sheldon, economist for MCM MoneyWatch. "I think you'll see
a rebound in pricing with the new spring merchandise."
</P>
<P>
	   The big advance in overall energy prices, meanwhile, was led by a huge 7.9
percent increase in fuel oil prices, the biggest rise since February 1989.
Gasoline prices rose 1.6 percent, and natural gas prices went up 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Production limits by oil-producing nations and increased demand because of
the cold weather accounted for the increase in energy prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil prices moved past the $30-a-barrel mark Monday for the first time
since the eve of the Persian Gulf War nine years ago, as production cuts adopted
by leading producers squeezed world supply. Two days later, President Clinton
asked Congress for millions of dollars in emergency assistance to help people
meet heating-oil costs.
</P>
<P>
	   While Greenspan expressed concern Thursday about rising oil prices and low
inventories, he cautioned against releasing oil from a government reserve as
many Northeast lawmakers have urged.
</P>
<P>
	   A rebound in energy prices, which had fallen sharply in 1998 as the Asian
financial crisis severely dampened global demand, was the main factor in pushing
up overall consumer prices last year by 2.7 percent, the biggest increase since
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite higher fuel bills, airfares actually fell by 1.4 percent last month.
Economists said competitive discounting by airlines jockeying for customers
dwarfed surcharges imposed because of rising energy costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Food prices, meanwhile, in their best showing since March, declined by 0.1
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the energy and food categories, the "core" rate of inflation rose
0.2 percent last month, matching many analysts' predictions.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the report, new car prices fell by 0.3 percent in January, the
best performance in almost a year, reflecting global competition. Tobacco
prices, including cigarettes, rose 1.6 percent, the biggest jump in four months,
as companies boosted prices to pay for court settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   In another report, the Commerce Department said the 1999 trade deficit was
up a sharp 65.1 percent from the $164.3 billion of a year earlier, a testimony
to Americans' insatiable appetite for foreign goods. Overall, the trade deficit
for last year surged to an all-time high of $271.3 billion. Deficits with Japan,
China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union all set records.

<HEADLINE> Gore Finesses Way Around Picket  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore straddled a picket line problem
Friday, trying to bridge a gap between two major Democratic constituencies
gathered on opposite sides of a hotel's walls.
</P>
<P>
	   With striking union workers picketing outside the Grand Hyatt here, and the
National Summit on Africa waiting indoors, Gore was torn. Ahead of him on
Monday: a sure showdown over race relations with opponent Bill Bradley when the
two debate at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore avoided crossing the picket line by addressing the summit across a
telephone line.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hello? Can you hear me?'' Gore's voice called into the cavernous ballroom
over the clanking of silverware and china as 1,400 summit delegates dug into
their lunch of salmon and avocado salad. Huge television screens at the front of
the room stayed focused on an empty podium.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The hotel workers' union local 25 is picketing, and in solidarity with
these workers, I will not cross that picket line,'' Gore told audience members,
some of whom applauded. ``At the same time, I did not want to miss the chance to
share some words with you about the importance of our protecting the world
today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore followed President Clinton, who spoke to the group a day earlier -- at
a convention center with no picket line. Both talked about helping Africa's
developing nations by forgiving some of their debt, enacting favorable trade
policies and improving public health by fighting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit organizers gave no such pulpit to Bradley, one of his campaign aides
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke said Bradley offered to appear before the summit
via satellite, but organizers told him they preferred a personal appearance.
Ambassador Walter C. Carrington, the former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, spoke to
the group on behalf of Bradley who ``cares deeply about the connection between
the United States and Africa,'' Ludecke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit spokesman Sunni Khalid said that Gore spoke Friday as part of the
event's focus on the Clinton administration, following the president and various
White House officials. Unlike Bradley, Gore had not been invited to a separate
candidates' forum, which was canceled when only Bradley and Republican contender
George Bush signaled interest and then declined to appear personally, Khalid
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In another bid for minority votes, Gore on Friday released an ad in which he
speaks Spanish and pledges to improve schools, Medicare and the fight against
crime. A second ad released on Friday revises an ad from just two days ago to
add abortion rights to a list of issues he has fought for. The retooling comes a
day after Bradley began airing an ad across the country hitting Gore for his
early, anti-abortion votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates regularly ``appear'' before groups by telephone or satellite when
their schedules don't permit them to be there personally. But Gore's
participation in the African summit got a mixed reaction from members of the
groups he was trying to please.
</P>
<P>
	   Union members, who picketed on the sidewalk in steady sleet, appreciated
Gore's gesture.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't count'' as crossing the picket line, said Nancy Wallace, a
member of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're thrilled,'' said Ron Richardson, general vice president of the
group.
</P>
<P>
	   But delegates to the summit were less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm offended,'' said Christian Ibenacho, of Ontario, Calif., who
nonetheless said he would vote for Gore. ``We're also his constituency. He
should have come.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a politician,'' said James Alexander, a delegate from Rhode Island
who was undecided how to vote. ``They have to be sensitive, but they have their
agendas.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, campaigning Friday at a school in Harlem, invoked a bit of his past
by talking about dreaming big. He recalled his efforts, while a New York Knick,
to mentor Harlem youngsters during basketball's off-season.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm coming here today as someone who has been in this kind of setting a
lot of times,'' Bradley told 25 students, most 13 or 14 years old, who are part
of a business and computer technology ``mini-school'' within Adam Clayton Powell
Jr. Middle School Academy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look in your eyes and I see incredible excitement. I want to make sure
those eyes will have the chance to fulfill the potential that each of you
possesses,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said his education plan would double money for urban schools to $88
billion a year, with the condition that schools accepting the money ensure all
their teachers are fully qualified.

<HEADLINE> Finders of $300,000 Can't Keep It  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN PARROTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- When a suburban Dallas couple found a bag containing almost
$300,000 and a handgun two months ago, they say they didn't hesitate to turn the
bundle over to police.
</P>
<P>
	   No one came forward to claim the cash, so the couple expected to get it
back. But the police say finders-keepers doesn't apply.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The (Drug Enforcement Administration) determined this is drug money,''
said Sgt. Hollis Edwards, a spokesman for the Dallas Police Department. ``It is
not the same thing as finding a wallet.''
</P>
<P>
	   The couple -- a maintenance worker and a kidney transplant patient -- asked
not to be identified because of fear for their safety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel like it was from God,'' the woman said. ``It would get me to
doctors I'm not able to see now because of my HMO. It would be the key to saving
my life and not dying.''
</P>
<P>
	   If the money is found to be connected to a crime, the DEA and the police
department could seize the money and share it.
</P>
<P>
	   The DEA found traces of cocaine on the bills, but Robert Udashen, the
couple's attorney, said traces of illegal drugs can be found on most bills in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the ancient legal doctrine of finders keepers, losers weepers,''
he said. ``My clients found it and reported it to the police like good, honest
citizens. Under the law, it belongs to them.''
</P>
<P>
	   But claiming the money could be dangerous too, said Frank Seib of the DEA.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was found in the middle of the highway with a loaded 9 mm on top,'' he
said. ``If I take that money home, I'm going to watch out my window for a long
time. Somebody is coming after it.''

<HEADLINE> Race Issues Dog Bush, McCain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Associated Press
</P>
<P>
	   With the South Carolina primary at hand, Republican candidates George W.
Bush and John McCain continued to be dogged by racial issues Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The private Institute of Southern Studies criticized Bush for writing
anniversary letters of congratulations in 1996 to two Confederate heritage
groups. Bush wrote the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of
Confederate Veterans in honor of the organizations' 100th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
	   He also was criticized for writing a greeting letter for the ``Lone Star
Ball'' at the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Va., in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan dismissed the criticism, saying the
Texas governor sends ``thousands of greetings each year, including the
dedication of the Martin Luther King Jr. statue at the University of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Bush has sent similar greetings and congratulatory letters to more
than 40 black groups.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, refused to fire campaign adviser Richard Quinn as
requested by the private group People for the American Way. Quinn edits the
magazine Southern Partisan, which has published racially charged articles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a fine man who worked for Ronald Reagan and Strom Thurmond and
other fine people. This is an outfit I almost never agreed with and so this is
another case where we have disagreement,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he did not consider Quinn a racist and had never read anything
written by him.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bush and McCain have refused to take public sides in the debate over
the flying of the Confederate flag over the South Carolina Statehouse. Both men
have said it is an issue for voters there to decide.

<HEADLINE> Candy Co.: Chocolate Not So Bad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Craving chocolate? Preliminary research funded mostly by
a candy maker suggests a little bit might not be quite as sinful as its
reputation.
</P>
<P>
	   The study suggests chocolate seems to contain some heart-healthy compounds.
But that doesn't mean it's OK to become a chocoholic.
</P>
<P>
	   Tests were conducted on only a handful of people who made the sacrifice of
munching chocolate for science -- science funded mostly by candy maker Mars Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Plus, chocolate is fat- and calorie-laden. So even if the strange-sounding
finding that it has some heart-healthy micronutrients pans out, it still won't
help the waistline, dietitians note.
</P>
<P>
	   However, early findings made public Friday suggest dark chocolate contains
some micronutrients called "flavonoids" that seem to give red wine a health
boost. And they appeared to temporarily stimulate antioxidant and blood
clot-inhibiting effects in the chocolate munchers' blood.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not saying eat a chocolate bar every day," lead researcher Carl Keen,
nutrition chairman at the University of California, Davis, stressed in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, he says the studies suggest people shouldn't feel so guilty when
they indulge.
</P>
<P>
	   "I certainly enjoy chocolate. I don't have it every day. I don't feel guilt
about it," Keen said at a news conference unveiling the studies at an American
Association of the Advancement of Science meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Ancient cultures in Mexico drank chocolate for medicinal purposes, such as
to gain weight, calm agitation and improve digestion, said Louis Grivetti, a
UC-Davis nutritionist who studies chocolate's history. (Chocolate was considered
only a drink until about 1830, he said.)
</P>
<P>
	   Modern scientists have studied why chocolate causes cravings in some people,
and why eating chocolate purportedly makes some people feel happy.
</P>
<P>
	   But the new research concerns flavonoids, substances that act as
antioxidants, thought to offset some artery-damaging effects of oxygen. Fruits
and vegetables are full of flavonoids, but the substances became trendy after
scientists found them in red wine and concluded a glass a day could be
heart-healthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Nutritionists at UC-Davis studied dark chocolate -- just chocolate, not the
nuts, caramel and other high-fat goop often added to it -- because it contains
some of red wine's flavonoids.
</P>
<P>
	   Keen gave 10 healthy adults a cup of hot chocolate made from special
flavonoid-rich cocoa powder. After the drink, blood cells were temporarily less
prone to clot, he said. The effect was similar to how aspirin affects blood,
although aspirin is much stronger, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In other studies, small groups of healthy adults ate a Dove bar or serving
of M&AMP;M's Baking Bits. About two hours later, their blood contained elevated
levels of flavonoids and antioxidants, Keen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest trend in food science is to hunt micronutrients that claim
healthy effects, but that doesn't mean people should flock to those foods, said
Cyndi Thomson of the University of Arizona, a spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The chocolate research is too preliminary to tell if flavonoids do any good,
she cautioned. But she says the best advice is moderation -- there's room for
treats in a well-balanced diet if people eat lots of healthy foods.
</P>
<P>
	   Remember "chocolate is calorically dense," she said. "You have to weigh
that."

<HEADLINE> Teen Pleads Guilty to IBM Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A teen-ager pleaded guilty to extortion Friday for
e-mailing a threat to detonate bombs at the headquarters of IBM unless he
received $5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Jahair Joel Navarro, of New York City, sent a similar
threat to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates a day before he sent his message to IBM
in August.
</P>
<P>
	   Navarro, 18, faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine at
sentencing on May 18.
</P>
<P>
	   No bombs were found, but investigators did find literature on bomb-making
and terrorism that had been downloaded to his computer, according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said Navarro sent the bomb threats to IBM Chief Executive
Officer Lou Gerstner at company headquarters in Armonk and to Gates at Microsoft
headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
	   He identified himself as ``Shadowmega,'' claimed he had placed five bombs
that would destroy the headquarters and demanded $5 million not to set them off,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   The e-mails were traced to the apartment of Navarro's stepfather in
Brooklyn, where the teen-ager was arrested.

<HEADLINE> Ad Shows Gore As Abortion Defender  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   An analysis of Al Gore's latest television commercial:
</P>
<P>
	   TITLE: ``Committed.''
</P>
<P>
	   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   PRODUCER: Century Media.
</P>
<P>
	   AIRING: Campaign would not say.
</P>
<P>
	   SCRIPT: (Narrator:) He's taken on the worst polluters in America and become
a leading voice for clean air, clean water and the environment. Al Gore. He's
taken on the HMOs and big drug companies -- fighting for a patients' bill of
rights. He's the only candidate committed to protecting Medicare and preserving
Medicaid. He's stood up to the extreme right wing -- defending a woman's right
to choose. Endorsed by NARAL, America's leading pro-choice group. The experience
to do the job. Al Gore. Fighting for us.''
</P>
<P>
	   KEY IMAGES: Gore, in casual clothing, talking to a crowd. Dark smoke
billowing out of smokestacks during talk of polluters, then green leaves, a
beautiful lake and a sunset during talk of clear air and water. Medical offices,
Gore walking a corridor with doctors. Gore hugging an older person. Women
talking with each other and then the NARAL logo during abortion section. Ends
with Gore and his wife, Tipper, shaking hands along a rope line.
</P>
<P>
	   ANALYSIS: This is a slight revision to an ad from just two days ago, adding
the section on abortion a day after Bill Bradley released an abortion ad.
Bradley has been hammering Gore for his early, mixed record on abortion rights,
including opposition to Medicaid funding, and Bradley began airing an ad Friday
saying that he is the only candidate who has been ``pro-choice for everyone all
the time.'' This is Gore's response, as he works to maintain his edge nationally
and among women.
</P>
<P>
	   ACCURACY: The ad never mentions Gore's early record on abortion, but it
doesn't distort it either. Gore has been solidly pro-choice for years and he was
endorsed by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
Throughout his career, Gore has focused on the environment, and the Clinton-Gore
administration has fought hard for a patients' bill of rights. Gore says he's
the only candidate who is committed to preserving Medicaid -- a reference to
Bradley's plan to eliminate the program. But the ad never mentions that Bradley
would move poor people into the federal insurance program for government workers
and give many more people access to insurance.

<HEADLINE> Russia Lashes at U.S. on Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM HEINTZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia directed more harsh criticism at the United States on
Friday over the war in Chechnya, while acting President Vladimir Putin sent the
White House a message stressing the countries' mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
	   A Foreign Ministry statement lashed out at comments made Thursday by U.S.
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, in which he said ``Russia has a clear
obligation to investigate the numerous credible reports of civilian killings and
alleged misconduct by its soldiers'' in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Ministry said Rubin was ``operating with clearly tendentious
data and even outright bias supplied by the terrorists themselves ... In fact,
this amounts to assistance in information-terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin's comments were ``absolutely inadmissible both in essence and in form,
resembling the unfortunate NATO statements during the period of aggression
against Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russia vehemently opposed the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia last year, and has
said countries that participated in the bombing have no justification for
criticizing the offensive in Chechnya, which Russia says is necessary to wipe
out rebels it classifies as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Russia angrily objected to a Chechen envoy's visit to the State
Department this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The conflicts in both Yugoslavia and Chechnya have sparked substantial
tension between Washington and Moscow, along with Russia's objections to U.S.
proposals to modify the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and Russian worries about
NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia and NATO agreed this week to resume bilateral contacts, which had
been virtually frozen since last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, apparently aiming to improve relations, said in a message to Clinton
on Friday that U.S.-Russian relations were a top foreign policy priority,
Russian news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The strategic goals of Russia and the United States coincide, for the most
part,'' the message said, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A great deal of irritability and mutual criticism has cropped up lately in
the Russian-American dialogue,'' the report quoted Putin's message as saying.
``And yet, the most vital thing has been preserved -- understanding the
strategic importance of the two countries' cooperation for the world's fate in
the 21st century.''

<HEADLINE> Case Against Alleged Nazi Guard OK'd  </HEADLINE>
   By M.R. KROPKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The government's second attempt to revoke John Demjanjuk's
citizenship because he allegedly served as a Nazi concentration camp guard can
move forward, a judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Paul R. Matia on Thursday denied a motion from
Demjanjuk's lawyers asking him to dismiss the Justice Department's civil case
against him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will review this decision with our lawyers and act accordingly. I can't
comment further, because we have an active case before the judge,'' Ed Nishnic,
Demjanjuk's son-in-law and the family's spokesman, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael E. Tigar, Demjanjuk's lawyer, did not return a phone call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice Department official said the decision speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously we're pleased, and we are looking forward to going to trial on
March 26 of next year as the judge has ordered,'' said Eli Rosenbaum, director
of the department's Office of Special Investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, 79, a retired auto worker who lives in
suburban Seven Hills, lost his U.S. citizenship in 1981 and regained it in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, he was sentenced to die in Israel after being convicted as the
Treblinka death camp guard ``Ivan the Terrible.'' He was freed five years later
when evidence indicated he was a victim of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
	   In May, the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigation filed a new
civil complaint to strip Demjanjuk of his citizenship and said he had been a
guard at several Nazi death camps. But the ``Ivan the Terrible'' allegations are
no longer are part of the government's case.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said Demjanjuk lied in a U.S. visa application when he said
he spent World War II as a laborer in Poland and Germany. He entered the United
States in 1952 and became a citizen six years later.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Demjanjuk contended in July that the government's latest attempt
to strip the alleged Nazi death camp guard of his U.S. citizenship constitutes
double jeopardy. But Matia ruled that the protection against being tried twice
for the same offense does not apply in a citizenship case, because the issues
involved are civil, not criminal.

<HEADLINE> Young couple arrested after body of missing woman found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COLONIE, N.Y. (AP) - A young couple is accused of stealing from and
killing the girlfriend's 91-year-old relative for cash and kicks, police said
Friday.
<P>
	   Katherine Marie Seeber, 18, of the Town of Saratoga and Jeffrey T.
Hampshire, 19, of nearby Saratoga Springs are charged with second-degree murder
in the death of 91-year-old Ruth Witter. Witter's body was found Friday morning
over a snow embankment in rural Saratoga County about 30 miles from her home in
Colonie, an Albany suburb.
</P>
<P>
	   Witter is the step-great-gandmother of Seeber, who had lived in a small town
in Idaho with her mother until a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The unemployed suspects spent three nights last weekend in motels, allegedly
partying with alcohol and drugs, according to Colonie Police Lt. Steve Heider.
Drugs may have been involved but were not believed to be central to the slaying,
he said. Witter had been missing since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   No motive other than the alleged larceny is known, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a single case of greed, of a lack of self-control, a lack of
empathy for others and a commitment on their part to continue their lifestyle,"
Heider said. "It was a general partying thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Heider said Seeber and the victim were not close, but apparently knew each
other well enough for the victim to have allowed the suspects into her home.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that Seeber comes from a middle-class suburban family and neither
suspect is from what he would consider a poor or underprivileged background.
</P>
<P>
	   Heider said there was no sign of a struggle in Witter's home. Police believe
she either died there or during the two to three hours of traveling before her
body was dumped over the embankment, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As with an awful lot of things like this with young people, it's based on
greed," Heider said, emphasizing that he referred to a small segment of young
people. "A portion of that could be drug use and as with an awful lot of cases
involving young people (and crime), they don't have a lot of respect for
property ... they don't have a lot of respect for life."
</P>
<P>
	   Heider added that "homicide involving relatives is very frequent," citing
that 80 percent of homicides in the United States are committed by relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Witter's body was found without a coat, partly covered with snow, at the
Saratoga National Historical Park - the site of the American Revolution's Battle
of Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said a big break in the case came late Thursday night. After she was
questioned by police and released on Wednesday and earlier Thursday, police said
she spoke to an "uninvolved third party" whom they wouldn't identify. This
person then told another unnamed person, who passed the information onto the
Mechanicville Police Department just south of the national park.
</P>
<P>
	   Information was released to the media on Tuesday about a red car. On Tuesday
night police received a call from a gas station attendant who said that, days
before, he gave directions to a young couple asking for the way to Witter's
home.
</P>
<P>
	   Police then spoke to the Witter family about a red car and the investigation
moved quickly, Heider said.
</P>
<P>
	   No further arrests are expected in the slaying, Heider said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Plunge: Dow Ends Down 295.05  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged Friday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial
average down nearly 300 points, as investors ignored a positive report on
inflation and instead focused on the growing certainty of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 295.05 to 10,219.52, its
seventh-largest one-day point drop. The Dow, down 205.69 over the week, has now
fallen more than 12 percent from its Jan. 14 record high close of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index fell 137.18 to 4,411.74 just a day after having
set its own closing high of 4,548.92. Friday's decline, the Nasdaq's
seventh-biggest one-day point drop, left it up 16.29 for the week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, the market's broadest indicator, fell 42.16
to 1,346.09.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks from nearly every sector dropped as traders digested Thursday's
warning from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that interest rates would
need to go higher to prevent the U.S. economy from causing a surge in inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's decline, along with the recent slide in blue-chip stocks, appeared
to fit a pattern that began in the market last year, with interest rate concerns
setting off a series of sharp drops that then led to waves of buying.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to inflation fears, trading was volatile Friday due to "double
witching," the simultaneous expiration of contracts on options on stocks and
stock indexes. Traders also sold off ahead of the three-day holiday weekend.
U.S. markets are closed Monday in observance of Presidents' Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation fears grew Friday even as the Labor Department said January's
Consumer Price Index edged up a smaller than expected 0.2 percent as lower
clothing prices helped offset rising fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The report did little to comfort investors after Greenspan told Congress
Thursday that higher wages, driven by the tight labor market, would lead to a
rise in inflation. He warned that the Fed will raise interest rates again this
year after four increases over the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today we had overflow from the bearish comments from Greenspan that the Fed
will not be happy until it slows the economy," said Tom Galvin, chief equity
strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. Many Dow stocks "are
being unmercifully punished and its extended into some profit taking on the
Nasdaq," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-seven of the 30 Dow stocks closed lower, including International
Paper, off 1 15/16 to 44 5/16 and IBM, down 4 1/8 to 112 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Although technology stocks have withstood fears about higher interest rates,
they joined in the market's tumble Friday as traders collected profits from the
gains they have made this month.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, big decliners included Microsoft, down 4 9/16 to 95 1/16 and
Intel, down 4 5/8 to 105 3/8. Novell, a big network software maker, slid 8 15/16
to 34 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Internet stocks fell too, including Amazon.com down 4 1/2 to 64 3/4 and
America Online off 2 1/8 to 50 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   "As Yogi Berra would say, 'It's deja vu all over again,"' said Ned Riley,
chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors. "The same issues,
the same problems the Fed had at the end of last year, it is confronted with all
over again."
</P>
<P>
	   The economy is still growing and the inflation data is still benign, but the
Fed still expects to see inflation -- the questions are when and in what form,
Riley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Caught up in the selling were the recently hard-charging biotech stocks,
including Biogen, down 6 9/16 to 109 5/16 and Genentech, down 2 3/8 to 158 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest rate sensitive financial issues also fell, led by American Express,
off 10 1/16 to 137 7/8 and J.P. Morgan, off 3 1/2 to 109 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Among telecommunications companies, SBC Communications was down 3 9/16 to 36
7/16 and Sprint was off 2 7/16 to 63 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange
by a more than 3-to-1 margin with 2,314 down, 735 up and 442 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE Volume totaled 1.24 billion shares, down from 1.25 billion on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks fell 12.74 to 545.68.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was off 0.01 percent, Germany's DAX
index was down 0.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.7 percent, and
France's CAC-40 was down 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> INS Won't Change Elian's Custodian  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rejecting a request from Elian Gonzalez' father in Cuba,
the Immigration and Naturalization Service refused Friday to shift the
6-year-old boy to a new temporary custodian in Miami on grounds that would be
too disruptive.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS said that it was continuing to press in federal court for Elian's
return to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But the agency said ``transferring Elian temporarily to a new and unfamiliar
environment would not be advisable for the child after already experiencing the
trauma of leaving his home in Cuba and losing his mother.''
</P>
<P>
	   The decision was relayed by letter to the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in
Cuba, INS officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since he was found clinging to an inner tube off Florida last Thanksgiving,
Elian has been temporarily placed in the custody of a great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, whose family is fighting in federal court to keep the boy in this
country permanently. His mother and 10 others died in a boat wreck while fleeing
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father had requested that Attorney General Janet Reno shift the
boy's temporary custody to another of his great-uncles in Miami, Manolo
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Miguel Gonzalez had complained that Lazaro Gonzalez and his family had
given the news media too much access to Elian, had arranged psychiatric
treatment for the boy by doctors who had not been approved by his father, and
had allowed relatives with criminal records to be around the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS statement said the agency shares the father's concerns about the
boy's well-being ``and therefore will request information from Lazaro Gonzalez
concerning the credentials of any psychiatrist or psychologist who has seen
Elian, as well as any treatment that may have been prescribed for him.''
</P>
<P>
	   The agency also promised to obtain details of Elian's schooling in this
country.
</P>
<P>
	   A Miami-based nongovernmental organization visited Lazaro's home to verify
that it was an adequate setting for Elian, the INS said. The agency also said it
was aware that Lazaro had past convictions for driving under the influence of
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the agency said its current information does not suggest
Lazaro's home is inadequate for Elian's temporary care.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Reno rejected a request to meet with Elian during a
Friday visit to Miami, her hometown.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro's family had asked Reno to meet with them and the Cuban boy in hopes
she would sympathize with their fight to keep the child in the United States.
She spoke at an awards ceremony for an organization that provides legal
assistance to neglected children.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, Lazaro's attorney, wrote a letter to Reno requesting the
meeting so the boy and the relatives can ``make their plea to you, and for you
to meet the child whose fate rests so largely in your hands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reno would prefer to meet Lazaro's family in Washington next week so that
Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner could also
attend, according to a letter from Associate Deputy Attorney General James
Castello.
</P>
<P>
	   Castello wrote, however, that Reno believes it is ``unnecessary'' for Elian
to attend, explaining that the adult relatives could convey any new information
that they want her to hear.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Peace in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton told a visiting Russian official Friday
that Russia must look for a peaceful end to its conflict with Chechnya, even as
a top general claimed that Russia now controls most of the strategically
important areas in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president discussed concerns about the situation in Chechnya, the
humanitarian impact of the conflict, and the need for meaningful steps toward
political solutions,'' said Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the White House
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Ivanov came to the White House at
the close of two days of meetings in Washington. Ivanov carried a letter from
acting Russian President Vladimir Putin, replying to one Clinton sent last
month. Hammer would not discuss contents of either letter except to say that
they dealt with ``substantive issues in the bilateral relationship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ivanov met several times with his U.S. counterpart, national security
adviser Sandy Berger, on topics ranging from Chechnya to nuclear disarmament,
and with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Attorney General Janet Reno and
other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Clinton pronounced Putin someone ``the United States can
do business with,'' although the United States is neutral in the upcoming
Russian elections.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow last month, Albright appealed to the Russians to open talks with
Chechen political figures, saying that otherwise Russia risked increased
diplomatic isolation around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The public disagreement over Chechnya underscored the ebb of U.S.-Russian
relations, marked also by disagreement over a potential U.S. program for
space-based weapons.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Gains Pared by Stock Selloff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar continued to climb against the Japanese yen
Friday, hitting a five-month high at one point, but gave up some of its gains as
interest rate concerns dragged stock prices sharply lower on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar managed to hold on to most of its ground, however, and was
trading at 110.96 yen in afternoon trading, up from 110.59 yen late Wednesday.
Earlier in the day, it went up to 111.25 yen, last reached in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Holding the dollar back was a drastic downdraft on Wall Street that took 295
points off the Dow Jones industrial average. Traders blamed cautionary remarks
from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan that suggested more interest rate
increases this year to cool off the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar has been moving higher against the yen over the past few weeks,
reversing a decline last year, thanks to favorable prospects for U.S. economic
growth coupled with low inflation and slightly higher interest rates -- all
positive factors for the dollar over time.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also edged higher against the euro, but those gains were less
pronounced. In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 98.49 cents, down
from 98.85 late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9858 German marks, up
from 1.9784; 6.6601 French francs, up from 6.6352; and 1,965.96 Italian lire, up
from 1,958.60.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, the dollar also was quoted at 1.6284 Swiss francs, up from
1.6228, and 1.4512 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4511. The British pound fell to
$1.6000 from $1.6088.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani sticks with Bush, answers 'quid pro quo' charges by  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bouncing around the political game board from one
accusation to the next, New Yorkers embroiled in the Senate race between Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani focused Friday on what motivates campaign
contributors and where political loyalties lie.
<P>
	   Democratic State Committee Chairwoman Judith Hope accused Giuliani of taking
money from developers in exchange for allowing them to build over a community
garden. While the mayor's campaign spokesman denied that charge, Giuliani
himself fended off scuttlebutt that his support for presidential hopeful George
W. Bush may be waning.
</P>
<P>
	   "I endorsed Governor Bush and I continue to endorse Governor Bush," Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
	   While calling presidential challenger John McCain "a good friend," Giuliani
said Bush's executive experience tips the balance in his favor.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the U.S. senator and Arizona Republican giving Bush fits in the
polls since sweeping to victory in the New Hampshire primary, is winning support
from some politicians who previously backed Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Some, like former U.S. Rep. Guy Molinari, have switched their support
outright. Others, like former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, are technically
sticking by Bush while offering words of praise for McCain. D'Amato has called
McCain's surge in the polls "wonderful" and "incredible," and predicted he will
carry the primaries in both South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Just this past week Giuliani himself said Bush made a mistake by courting
voters at the racially restrictive Bob Jones University. But the mayor also said
he would campaign for Bush personally if the Texas governor thought it would
help.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani relied on his campaign spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum, to clear up
other contentious matters.
</P>
<P>
	   During a news conference at Democratic State Committee headquarters in
Manhattan, Hope, the state party chairwoman, called for Giuliani to return
$32,799 in campaign contributions from a company and its executives benefitting
from the city's decision to bulldoze and build on a community garden site in the
East Village.
</P>
<P>
	   BFC Construction is set to erect a 79-unit building on the site. That
corporation and associated entities, along with four of its executives,
contributed enough money to Giuliani-related campaign committees in recent years
to make it look like BFC got a sweetheart deal from the city in return, Hope
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm saying there is a quid pro quo, or there certainly appears to be," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Donald Capoccia, one of the BFC Construction Corp. executives, issued a
statement saying that he supported Giuliani long before the East Village
apartment building project was on the table and that he does so because of the
mayor's policies.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor has been a strong and consistent advocate for the gay and lesbian
community; and during his tenure, New York City has experience unprecedented
economic growth and reductions in crime, as well as successful development of
much-needed affordable housing," said Stephen Mangione, spokesman for Capoccia
and his company.
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum said the Clinton campaign was trying to create "phony issues."
Not only did he brush off the suggestion that the money be returned, but he said
the campaign "will continue to get support from Mr. Capoccia. We welcome it."
</P>
<P>
	   As for the other donations from BFC and its managers - and the whiff of
cronyism Hope said the building deal suggests - Teitelbaum said: "We are not
going to be played for suckers. We are not going to respond to every phony
attack."

<HEADLINE> FBI Traps Suspected Cuban Spy  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official charged with spying for Cuba was
arrested after falling straight into a trap set by the FBI, investigators said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI said it fed Mariano Faget phony information about an impending
defection and then caught him passing it on just 12 minutes later to a contact
with ties to the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, 54, a Cuban-born supervisor in the Miami office of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, may have been passing on classified information
about Cuban defectors for some time, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, Faget met with Cuban intelligence officials in
Miami on at least two occasions, contacted officials with the agency that
represents Cuba in Washington and had regular contact with the man he called
last week in the sting -- a New York businessman with ties to the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they had been investigating Faget for a year but wouldn't
say how long they believe he may had been passing on classified information.
They also said they were uncertain about the effects of his alleged espionage --
whether any Cubans were prevented from defecting, for example.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget (pronounced fah-HAY), who was arrested Thursday, is charged with
violating the federal Espionage Act and making false statements to a federal
officer. The first charge carries up to 10 years in prison; the second could
bring five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing in court Friday, the paunchy, balding Faget was ordered held until
a bail hearing Thursday. He caught the eyes of relatives and friends as he
walked into court and held his left hand to his heart.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Joel Kaplan would not comment. Nor would Faget's family
members and friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors said they will ask that Faget be held as a flight risk
and a danger to the community.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget and his father came to the United States and claimed political asylum
in 1960, the year after Fidel Castro came to power. Faget became a U.S. citizen
in 1963.
</P>
<P>
	   He began working for the INS as a clerk in 1966, INS district director Bob
Wallis said. Faget would have been eligible for retirement next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, who is married, lives in the Miami suburb of Kendall. Neighbor
Beatrice Vallenilla said she believes Faget has three adult children.
</P>
<P>
	   As a supervisory district adjudication officer for the INS, Faget had
``secret'' security clearance and oversaw decisions that affected the residency
status of immigrants, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI spokesman Paul Mallett said Faget waited only 12 minutes Feb. 11 before
he passed on the phony information that a Cuban official was about to defect.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, INS and FBI officials showed Faget pictures of a
Cuban intelligence official he knew, and told Faget that the man wanted to
defect and that the information was secret and very sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, Faget returned to his office and used his personal cell
phone to call the New York businessman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faget told the businessman that `a person we both know' was `one of the
ones working with the Americans,''' U.S. Attorney Thomas Scott said in a
statement. ``Faget then identified the Cuban intelligence officer by name.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Faget called the man from home and discussed the case in more detail,
the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, Faget and the New York businessman are officers
of a Florida company whose stated purpose is to engage in future business
transactions with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   State records show Faget is vice president and secretary of America-Cuba
Inc., a company created in 1994. The company's president and chief executive is
listed as Pedro Font of Greenwich, Conn. A source close to the investigation
confirmed for The Associated Press that Font was the businessman named in the
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
	   A number listed for Font in Greenwich, Conn., was disconnected. The
afffidavit said Font was in China on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Goyanes, listed in state records as a Miami-based executive of
America-Cuba, said Friday he was surprised by the charges against Faget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am shocked. The guy is a family man. He works for the government,''
Goyanes said. ``This is the last thing I ever thought. The courts will prove him
innocent when it is all over.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities said that in addition to the New York contact, Faget
placed calls to the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, which represents Cuba
in the United States, and met with two Cuban intelligence officers.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Cuban Interests Section declined comment. The White House
also had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallis said all of the cases that had crossed Faget's desk would be closely
reviewed. Early Friday, authorities searched Faget's office and his home and
seized two computers and his automobile.
</P>
<P>
	   His arrest comes amid already strained relations with the communist island
over Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy found clinging to an inner tube
off the Florida coast Nov. 25. His mother and 10 others died when their boat
sank in an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's Miami relatives are fighting to keep him in the United States,
despite an order by the INS to reunite Elian with his father in Cuba. Faget had
nothing to do with Elian's case, Wallis said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities also said Faget had no connection to a large Cuban spy ring
broken up in 1998. Fourteen people were accused of trying to penetrate U.S.
military bases, infiltrate anti-Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media
and political organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Five people have pleaded guilty. Others go on trial in May.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING: ADDS Bjt designation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Residents living in the shadow of the Cayuga
Indian Nation land claim for the past two decades were more relieved than angry
over a federal court jury's decision to award the tribe nearly $37 million for
its lost homeland.
<P>
	   After 11 days of testimony and evidence and two days of deliberations, a
nine-member U.S. District Court jury on Thursday recommended that the Cayugas
receive $35 million for the current value of the 64,015-acre claim area and
another $1.9 million as rent for its use and occupancy for a 204-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount was significantly less than the $335 million a federal government
appraiser said the 100-square-mile tract was worth, less even the $51 million
evaluation made by a state appraiser.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the trial, a court-appointed mediator offered a settlement of $120
million.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an I-told-you-so kind of a verdict," said Mel Russo, a cochairman
of United Citizens for Equality, a grassroots group that opposed the land claim
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   "It shows we were right when we wanted the case to go to trial and not to
settle like everybody else wanted to do," Russo said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're hoping that the whole thing is appealed so that these people cannot
establish a reservation," Russo added. "All they have to do is go in and buy a
couple of acres, get it annexed, open up a casino and bye-bye taxpayer land."
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas' attorneys said they would ask the judgment be set aside,
calling it a "ridiculous" amount.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury's decision is only a recommendation to Judge Neal McCurn, who will
hold another non-jury trial sometime this summer to consider so-called
"equitable factors," such as interest on the back rent and deductions for public
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominic Sinicropi, 58, of Seneca Falls, said the Cayugas don't deserve a
penny.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was all about money in the first place. I feel if they got a nickel,
it was too much," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Becky Maltzan, a 36-year-old deli clerk, also said the verdict was unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a lot of money. But I'm really glad they didn't get any land," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the trial started, McCurn limited jurors to considering a
monetary award only. Also, the Cayugas previously agreed that they would not
seek to evict anyone but said they would use any money to buy land from willing
sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki called the award "a fair and reasonable verdict" that
"fairly compensated the Cayuga Indian Nation."
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas felt otherwise, especially about the jury's decision on the
land's rental value.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a low blow," said Marty Wheeler, 56, a nurse from the Cattaraugus
Reservation near Buffalo, who attended the trial. "It's unbelievable that they
think that's what 200 years are worth ... Two hundred years - that's amazing."
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to the start of the trial, the Cayugas' lawyers had asked for a change
of venue, saying they feared bias and misinformation would taint the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "This decision is proof that our motion should have been granted," said
attorney Martin Gold.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine jury members came from Onondaga and Oswego counties, which are not
in the Cayuga claim area. However, four live in an area that will be part of a
land claim that will be brought later this year by the Onondaga Nation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The jury never got to hear the most important voices in this case - those
of the Cayuga people," said Onondaga Nation Chief Irving Powless.
</P>
<P>
	   McCurn barred testimony regarding any alleged pain and suffering endured by
the Cayugas as a result of being dispossessed of their land.

<HEADLINE> Execs Quit Aurora Foods Amid Probe  </HEADLINE>
    By KIM CURTIS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Four senior management officials at struggling Aurora
Foods Inc., owner of such well-known brands as Duncan Hines and Aunt Jemima,
resigned Friday as the company launched an investigation into its internal
accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman and chief executive Ian R. Wilson, vice chairman James B. Ardrey,
executive vice president Ray Chung and chief financial officer M. Laurie
Cummings all stepped down, the company said in a statement. Wilson and Ardrey
also resigned from the company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora Food's board said it has formed a special committee with its New
York-based auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers to investigate Aurora's accounting
practices that it expects will result in a charge against 1999 earnings and
could affect earnings projections for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Board member Richard C. Dresdale, president of investment firm Fenway
Partners was appointed acting chairman while Peter Lamm, chairman and CEO of
Fenway, was appointed acting president and CEO of Aurora Foods. Fenway and
fellow investment firm McCown De Leeuw &AMP; Co. own 46 percent of Aurora Food's
outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading in Aurora stock was halted on the New York Stock Exchange on the
news, but the company's shares have been steadily declining since the summer as
its sales and profits have been weakening.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora shares closed Thursday at $7.31 1/4, well off their 52-week high of
$19.50 in July.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past few years, the San Francisco-based company has grown by
acquiring well-known, but weak brands and revitalizing them with marketing
support, expanded distribution, and new product development. Among the brands
under the Aurora Foods umbrella are Mrs. Butterworth's pancake mix, Log Cabin
syrup, Chef's Choice frozen meals, Celeste frozen pizza and Van de Kamp's frozen
seafood.
</P>
<P>
	   It is currently integrating Lender's Bagels into its stable of products.
Lenders was an unprofitable division of Kellogg's, which the cereal company sold
to Aurora in September in an effort to boost its own sagging share price.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora sales began weakening in the third quarter due partly to weakness in
its Duncan Hines line stemming from stiff competition. It shocked Wall Street in
November by saying it expected its fourth-quarter earnings to badly miss analyst
expectations. It blamed slower sales of Aunt Jemima frozen waffles. The company
was also facing higher interest expenses needed to finance unusually large
inventories, usually a sign of weakening sales, Bank of America Securities
reported at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The securities firm yanked its "buy" rating after the warning, helping send
the shares down further.
</P>
<P>
	   The accounting practices immediately under investigation relate primarily to
the accrual of trade promotion expenses in 1999. The committee has also hired
the law firm Ropes &AMP; Gray and auditor Deloitte &AMP; Touche to investigate the
practice and see if it also affects prior earnings statements.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora Foods spokesman Tom Franco refused to elaborate on the statement.
PricewaterhouseCoopers also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's pretty apparent that there's a difference opinion between the auditors
and management," said David Goldman, a Bank of America analyst who follows the
company. "Management believes that the retail promotion expense should be
deferred into future periods; auditors believe that it should be recognized in
the current period ... There's no hard and fast rule and the auditors are
demanding a conservative approach."
</P>
<P>
	   Goldman said he didn't know what was the precise reason behind the dispute,
but was hoping to obtain more information from the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no evidence of wrongdoing that's available to the public, but there
was enough evidence that the management resigned," Goldman said. It's unlikely
the accounting practice in question goes back further than the last fiscal year,
he added.
</P>
<P>
	   SEC spokesman John Heine declined comment on whether the agency was looking
into Aurora Foods. The agency, as a rule, does not comment when asked about
possible investigations of companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora Foods has not yet reported full-year earnings for 1999, but expects
to by the end of March. It also said the accounting investigation should not
affect the company's ability to operate.

<HEADLINE> Friday's Commodity Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Platinum prices sank 5 percent Friday on the Comex division of the New York
Mercantile Exchange as investors took profits in a volatile market ahead of the
three-day U.S. holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, soybeans surged and crude oil remained under $30 a barrel
as investors reacted cautiously to the latest comments about a possible increase
in OPEC production.
</P>
<P>
	   Uneasiness over Russia's impending return to the market after a long absence
had much to do with platinum's plunge after the metal had risen to an 11-year
high on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia typically accounts for 25 percent to 30 percent of world sales of the
metal, currently in big demand to make jewelry, and it has driven prices sky
high by sitting out the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's finance minister and first deputy prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov,
said Friday that acting President Vladimir Putin would sign the export quotas
for platinum and related metals in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's frequent statements that it's about to resume exports aren't
necessarily believed by investors. But metals analyst Jeffrey Christian said
that since European markets will be open Monday while U.S. markets are closed
for Presidents Day, many investors decided to play it safe and take profits
rather than be left "naked" and vulnerable to a price dive.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Russia started shipping metal tomorrow, you could see the price lose
$100 overnight," said Christian, managing director of CPM Group, a New York
research and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
	   In a shortened trading session, platinum for April delivery settled down
$26.20 at $503.20 an ounce after falling as low as $489.40.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybean prices rose sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade on news that
Brazil's main port for soybean exports may experience a two-week delay in
loading new crops. That effectively would add two weeks to the period in which
U.S. crops dominate the export market.
</P>
<P>
	   China's aggressive buying of soybeans also underpinned the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   March soybeans rose 6 1/2 cents to $5.14 1/2 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   A day after plunging below $30 a barrel, crude prices halted their slide.
But there was little movement despite renewed speculation about what world oil
producers will do when an agreement on production limits expires March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexican Energy Minister Luis Tellez indicated Friday that producers, led by
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, may resume higher output
as soon as April. But analysts and investors appeared to have already built
higher production into their assumptions, and there was no big reaction such as
the price slide that greeted similar remarks by the Saudi oil minister the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
	   West Texas intermediate crude for March delivery, a contract which expires
on Tuesday, rose 5 cents to $29.51 a barrel on the New York Merc. Some other
crude contracts were lower, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other energy commodities, March heating oil rose 3.9 cents to 75.45
cents a gallon, March unleaded gasoline fell 0.82 cent to 82.67 cents a gallon,
and March natural gas fell 3.4 cents to $2.633 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, April Brent crude from the North Sea fell 45 cents to $26.22 a
barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Judge denies house arrest for Eagles executive's wife  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - The wife of a Philadelphia Eagles executive must
remain in jail for the rest of her one-year sentence for hitting and killing a
man who was changing a flat tire, then leaving the scene and trying to hide
evidence, a judge ruled Friday.
<P>
	   Lawyers for Karen Jill Howard asked state Superior Court Judge Louis F.
Hornstine to allow her to spend the remaining eight months of her sentence under
house arrest. He declined.
</P>
<P>
	   The state parole board's recent finding that Howard violated work release
rules "makes it very easy for me to make this decision," Hornstine said.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard, who was not in court for the decision, was seen walking with a male
inmate at the Camden County Jail in January and received personal telephone
calls at her work release job site in February, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   WPVI-TV in Philadelphia reported that the calls Howard received were from
the same prisoner with whom she was seen walking.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard's supervisor at her work release job told the television station that
Howard had a "lengthy conversation" with the inmate.
</P>
<P>
	   The parole board cited those work release violations in turning down
Howard's parole request earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ""What is frustrating to me is the fact that there were violations on two
occasions," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hornstine also noted Howard's lack of remorse over the accident that killed
Robert Hoagland, 29, of Atco, as he changed a tire on the side of a highway on
Oct. 11, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Her silence speaks volumes," Hornstine said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoagland was changing a tire on Interstate 76 in Gloucester City when he was
struck. Howard, the wife of Philadelphia Eagles public relations director Ron
Howard, fled after stopping briefly to inquire if he was all right and learning
that he was not.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoagland and his wife Maureen were returning home from celebrating their
first wedding anniversary at an Eagles' game.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard, 36, of Evesham, was also returning home from the football game. She
has said she swerved while turning around to look at her crying 4-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
	   She pleaded guilty to trying to cover up the accident by washing away
evidence and returning her sports utility vehicle to a Vineland dealership.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard began serving her 360-day jail term in October after pleading guilty.
When she is released from jail she must serve five years' probation. Hornstine
said if she violates any of the terms of probation she will be sent to a state
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard's defense lawyer, Carl Poplar, argued that Hornstine's sentence was
excessive and was partly the product of extensive media attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case got out of control," he said. "The sentence further complicates
the tragedy. I'm asking the court not to compound the tragedy."
</P>
<P>
	   Camden County Prosecutor Lee Solomon agreed that the case has attracted a
"media frenzy," but argued that Howard has been treated fairly by the court.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoagland's parents said after the hearing they were pleased that Howard
remains behind bars. Hoaglands' father bristled at Poplar's suggestion that she
go unpunished for the work release violations.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not the media. It's not the justice system. It's not the judge," he
said. "She screwed up."

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Vatican Support Helps Cause  </HEADLINE>
   By DANA BUDEIRI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday
that his agreement with the Vatican on establishing religious safeguards in
Jerusalem strengthened the Palestinian claim to parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The strongly worded Vatican-PLO agreement, which implicitly criticized
Israeli actions in Jerusalem, has been met with harsh disapproval by the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(The agreement) rejects all Israeli attempts to annex and Judaize
Jerusalem,'' Arafat said in a statement released after the weekly Palestinian
Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians seek traditionally Arab eastern Jerusalem as the capital of
a future state. The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest issues scheduled
for discussion in negotiations for a final peace deal between the sides.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican-PLO agreement covered the status of churches and the freedom of
worship in the Palestinian territories. The preamble declared that an
``equitable solution'' for Jerusalem, based on international resolutions, was
``fundamental for a just and lasting peace.'' It also called for international
safeguards of freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
	   Without mentioning Israel by name, the agreement said ``unilateral decisions
and actions altering the specific character and status of Jerusalem are morally
and legally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian Cabinet praised the agreement, saying it boosted Palestinian
claims to the area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agreement constitutes a historic turning point in the benefit of peace
... and as a guarantor of Palestinian national rights,'' the Cabinet statement
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and
annexed it into its capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli officials criticized the Vatican not only for the content of the
agreement, but also for its timing. Pope John Paul II is scheduled to make a
historic visit to the Holy Land next month -- a trip officials hoped would mend
the sometimes strained Israeli-Vatican relationship.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, talks between Israel and the Palestinians remain frozen. The
talks broke down earlier this month when Israeli Premier Ehud Barak refused to
budge on the terms of a West Bank troop withdrawal that was to have taken place
by Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Arafat, President Clinton called Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations the ``cornerstone'' in Mideast peace efforts, the Cabinet statement
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's letter was sent after a key deadline was missed on Feb. 13 for a
peace treaty framework.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat complained Friday about the stagnation of talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The negotiations are going in empty circles, and no progress has been made
over the last six months,'' Arafat said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Gore Temple Video Off Limits  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A videotape of Vice President Al Gore's controversial
visit to a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple won't be available for his political
opponents' campaign commercials for another week or so.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman ruled Friday that the Gore video will be
off limits to the public until a jury reaches a verdict in the criminal trial of
former Democratic fund-raiser Maria Hsia. Justice Department prosecutors plan to
wrap up their case Tuesday, followed by a defense from Hsia's lawyers and jury
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsia lawyer Nancy Luque played the video for the jury, making it vulnerable
to public dissemination.
</P>
<P>
	   In a three-page ruling, Friedman made all trial exhibits available
immediately, except for the tape, saying he wanted ``to avoid the possibility
that the jury will be influenced by the coverage of the videotape by the
media.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, the media already has videotape of Gore at the Buddhist temple,
with CNN airing segments on Jan. 31. CNN spokeswoman Danielle Gorash, said the
network bought its tape in 1996 at the temple's gift shop.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional investigators looking into Gore's role in the fund-raising
scandal of 1996 never were able to find video of him at the temple. Luque did
not give the source of the tape, which carried a commentary in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday in court, Luque referred to the Republican National Committee in
saying she'd like the judge to keep the Gore tape under wraps until the case
ends so it doesn't prejudice the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said he'd gotten a few inquiries about the video from
congressional offices. The video shows the vice president walking into the
temple and making remarks, which were translated by Hsia for the largely
non-English-speaking audience. The absence of fund-raising scenes from the Gore
video made it useful to Hsia's defense that she knew nothing about illegal
reimbursements to political donors to the event.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department did not oppose Luque's request. Friedman, who made no
mention of political opponents or campaign commercials, relied on a Supreme
Court ruling that says courts may restrict access to trial documents when they
become ``a vehicle for improper purposes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department prosecutors allege Hsia engaged in an illegal scheme to
reimburse contributors, causing false statements to be filed with the Federal
Election Commission. One of the five felony charges against Hsia revolves around
the temple event Gore attended.

<HEADLINE> Waitress Needn't Share Lotto Win  </HEADLINE>
   By BILL POOVEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A Waffle House waitress who received a lottery
ticket worth $10 million as a tip does not have to share the jackpot with her
co-workers, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices threw out a Mobile judge's order that divided the winnings
equally among Tonda Dickerson and four other employees who claimed they all had
a verbal agreement to split any winnings.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 5-2 decision, Justice Hugh Maddox said the verbal agreement amounted
to a contract founded on ``a gambling consideration'' and was not enforceable.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson, who now works at a different Waffle House, had already started
collecting her 20 percent share of the pot while the court held the rest of the
money in an escrow account.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are absolutely thrilled,'' said her attorney, Gary Holder.
</P>
<P>
	   Tristan Armer, an attorney for the four other employees, said he had not
seen the decision and declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson was given the lottery ticket in March by a breakfast regular,
Edward Seward Jr., who testified that he frequently gave the employees lottery
tickets.
</P>
<P>
	   Seward said that the workers had a standing agreement to share the proceeds,
with the understanding they would buy him a new pickup truck if they hit the
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
	   Justices Douglas Johnstone and John England dissented, saying it was not an
agreement over a gambling consideration but instead an agreement to
``acknowledge the joint ownership'' of each of their tickets regardless of what
happened.

<HEADLINE> Yale professor pleads guilty to child pornography charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Yale University professor pleaded guilty Friday
to charges he downloaded tens of thousands of child pornography images from the
Internet and made two pornographic videos of a preteen boy on the Yale campus.
<P>
	   Antonio Lasaga, 50, accepted a plea bargain where he admitted to federal
charges of possessing and receiving child pornography.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why his client did it, Lasaga's attorney William Dow said "everyone
has flaws and shortcomings."
</P>
<P>
	   Lasaga could get up to 20 years in prison, three years of probation and
$500,000 in fines when he is sentenced May 8. He also must make restitution to
the 13-year-old boy featured in his videotapes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lasaga still faces a civil lawsuit and state charges, including sexual
assault, risk of injury to a minor and promoting a minor in an obscene
performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Alvin Thompson allowed Lasaga to remain under house arrest in his
Cheshire home until the sentencing. He wears an electronic monitoring bracelet
when he leaves his home to get religious and psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
	   Lasaga, a geology professor, has been on leave from Yale since the charges
surfaced in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said the university "will take the appropriate
action at the appropriate time," regarding Lasaga's future at the school.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has accepted responsibility for his criminal offenses. It is disturbing
to Yale that this crime has been committed by a member of the community," Conroy
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lasaga spoke little in U.S. District Court, except to answer the judge's
questions and read a brief statement to his guilt.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow said in a written statement that the plea "spares all involved -
witnesses, jurors and the court - the pain of an intense, unpleasant trial which
could only further damage the private and public lives of those most directly
involved."
</P>
<P>
	   "He prays for forgiveness and is gratified for all who have supported those
closest to him throughout this ordeal," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement between Dow and federal prosecutors includes a sentencing
range of 11 1/4 years to 14 years in prison. The judge may choose a sentence in
that range or exceed it, to the maximum of 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the plea deal, other charges of possession and receipt of child
pornography were dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   Lasaga was arrested after a graduate student noticed that someone using
Lasaga's computer password had downloaded child pornography from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   To prove the charges, prosecutors had to show the images were child
pornography and had been transported across state lines, from foreign countries
or had not been manufactured in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kari Dooley said Lasaga had "tens of thousands" of
images of children engaging in sexual acts with other children, adults and
animals. The images were stored on disks and the hard drive of his computer and
had been downloaded since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The images passed on the Internet through other states and foreign
countries, such as Russia, Canada and Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   The videotapes Lasaga made featured a New Haven boy who met the professor
through a school mentoring program.
</P>
<P>
	   One videotape was filmed at the Yale geology department when the boy was 11
years old.
</P>
<P>
	   The other tape was filmed in Lasaga's home on the Yale campus when the boy
was 12. Lasaga was the master of Saybrook College, one of the residential
communities at Yale.
</P>
<P>
	   The actual videotapes were not manufactured in Connecticut, satisfying the
federal law's requirement for the crime to include interstate or international
commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   The family of the boy has sued Lasaga, Yale and the New Haven public schools
for negligence.
</P>
<P>
	   After Lasaga's arrest, he was free on bond. He was ordered under house
arrest after being spotted in his car near the boy's school bus stop.
</P>
<P>
	   Lasaga taught chemistry at Harvard in the 1970s and became a lecturer in
1976. The following year, he joined Penn State as an assistant professor,
becoming a full professor in 1983. He came to Yale in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Continental Ups Domestic Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- For the second time this year, Houston-based Continental
Airlines has raised prices, citing the high cost of jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   Other airlines are expected to match the fare, but there was no immediate
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've not done so yet," said Mark Kienzle, spokesman for the Fort
Worth-based AMR, parent company of American Airlines. "At this point, we're
evaluating what to do."
</P>
<P>
	   An official with Chicago-based United Airlines declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental's price hikes on base domestic fares took effect Friday, ranging
from $5 to $15 one way.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is to offset rising fuel costs, which have more than doubled in the last
year," Continental spokesman Dave Messing said.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, Continental boosted domestic fares $10 on one-way fares, or $20
on round trip fares, calling it a fuel surcharge rather than a raise in fares.
That brought criticism from travel agents, who said it was a price hike that
didn't always show up when consumers shopped around.
</P>
<P>
	   That move spurred other airlines to raise prices, including American and
low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   "We noticed it," said Beth Harbin, a spokeswoman for the Dallas airline. "We
didn't make any fare moves today."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she couldn't comment on the company's future rate plans.

<HEADLINE> FDA Has Questions for RU-486 Makers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- American women will wait a while longer for the abortion
pill RU-486.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration declared in 1996 that RU-486 was safe and
effective for American women to use, saying it would approve the drug's sale as
soon as it received some final information about manufacturing and labeling.
</P>
<P>
	   For three years, there was no further word.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the FDA wrote the pill's marketing agent, Washington-based Danco
Group, to say again that it will approve the pill once final questions are
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
	   Danco officials refused Friday to say what information the FDA still needs.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug manufacturers typically reveal that information when the government has
only a few last-minute questions. So Friday's development confused advocates of
the early-abortion option, who had expected the drug's approval this month.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're extremely disappointed at this holdup," Planned Parenthood said in a
statement. But, it added, "we're remaining optimistic that we will get FDA
approval and that it will come soon."
</P>
<P>
	   RU-486 has been sold in France since 1988, and studies show it is 95.5
percent effective in causing abortion when taken within the first 49 days of
pregnancy. The French manufacturer, fearing an antiabortion boycott, donated
U.S. marketing rights to the nonprofit Population Council, which licensed Danco
to bring the drug to market.

<HEADLINE> Boy Said Mauled To Death by Dog  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- An 8-year-old boy was mauled to death in the back yard
of his home Friday, apparently by his family's German shepherd.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were called to the scene after a resident of a nearby duplex realized
the boy had been attacked, said police Sgt. Jeff Walden.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A man saw the boy lying in the yard with a German shepherd dog standing
over him,'' Walden said. ``This man and another individual were able to pull the
boy away from the dog and the dog was later chained.''
</P>
<P>
	   Paramedics arrived within minutes, but the child was pronounced dead at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Information about what sparked the attack was unclear. There were no
witnesses, Walden said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Peninsula Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was called in
to take possession of the dog.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Tough Date Rape Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a bill Friday that would toughen
federal laws for possession and distribution of a powerful ``date rape'' drug.
</P>
<P>
	   GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate, has been linked to at least 58 deaths since
1990 and more than 5,700 recorded overdoses, according to the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   A few drops of the colorless, odorless drug are usually slipped into a
drink. A victim who drinks it can lose consciousness within 20 minutes and often
have no memory of what happened. The drug is difficult to trace, often leaving
the body within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the legislation, GHB would be placed in a category of drugs that are
the most strictly regulated by the federal Controlled Substances Act. Anyone who
possesses, manufactures or distributes GHB could face a prison term of up to 20
years.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation would give the DEA authority for the first time to seek
federal criminal prosecutions against those possessing and distributing the
drug, DEA officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Exceptions would be made for GHB clinical studies approved by the Food and
Drug Administration to determine whether the drug helps with medical problems
such as narcolepsy, a sleeping disorder.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation also places tougher monitoring controls on the distribution
of GBL, a component of GHB, to try to prevent its diversion for illegal uses.
</P>
<P>
	   GBL has commercial applications including being used as a paint remover and
dietary supplement. Some products containing GBL have been promoted with
unsubstantiated claims to build muscles, enhance sex, reduce stress or induce
sleep.
</P>
<P>
	   GHB, which can give users a high, also has been mixed in bathtubs at
parties, and instructions on how to make it can be easily obtained over the
Internet, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
	   GHB already is a controlled substance in 20 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill is named for two teen-agers who died after GHB was slipped into
their soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the girls, 15-year-old Samantha Reid, died last year after the drug
was put in her soda at a party in Grosse Ile, Mich. Trial is under way in
Detroit for four men charged with manslaughter in her death.
</P>
<P>
	   The other girl, 17-year-old Hillory J. Farias of La Porte, Texas, died in
1996 after having a soft drink laced with GHB at a nightclub.

<HEADLINE> Gore Finesses Way Around Picket  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore straddled a picket line problem
Friday, trying to bridge a gap between two major Democratic constituencies
gathered on opposite sides of a hotel's walls.
</P>
<P>
	   With striking union workers picketing outside the Grand Hyatt here, and the
National Summit on Africa waiting indoors, Gore was torn. Ahead of him on
Monday: a sure showdown over race relations with opponent Bill Bradley when the
two debate at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore avoided crossing the picket line by addressing the summit across a
telephone line.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hello? Can you hear me?'' Gore's voice called into the cavernous ballroom
over the clanking of silverware and china as 1,400 summit delegates dug into
their lunch of salmon and avocado salad. Huge television screens at the front of
the room stayed focused on an empty podium.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The hotel workers' union local 25 is picketing, and in solidarity with
these workers, I will not cross that picket line,'' Gore told audience members,
some of whom applauded. ``At the same time, I did not want to miss the chance to
share some words with you about the importance of our protecting the world
today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore followed President Clinton, who spoke to the group a day earlier -- at
a convention center with no picket line. Both talked about helping Africa's
developing nations by forgiving some of their debt, enacting favorable trade
policies and improving public health by fighting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit organizers gave no such pulpit to Bradley, one of his campaign aides
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke said Bradley offered to appear before the summit
via satellite, but organizers told him they preferred a personal appearance.
Ambassador Walter C. Carrington, the former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, spoke to
the group on behalf of Bradley who ``cares deeply about the connection between
the United States and Africa,'' Ludecke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit spokesman Sunni Khalid said that Gore spoke Friday as part of the
event's focus on the Clinton administration, following the president and various
White House officials. Unlike Bradley, Gore had not been invited to a separate
candidates' forum, which was canceled when only Bradley and Republican contender
George W. Bush declined to appear personally, Khalid said.
</P>
<P>
	   In another bid for minority votes, Gore on Friday released an ad in which he
speaks Spanish and pledges to improve schools, Medicare and the fight against
crime. A second ad released on Friday revises an ad from just two days ago to
add abortion rights to a list of issues he has fought for. The retooling comes a
day after Bradley began airing an ad across the country hitting Gore for his
early, anti-abortion votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also came out with a new ad on Friday, emphasizing highlights from
his life story, as he attempts to introduce himself to voters in states with
upcoming primaries. The ad says that Bradley has won a Rhodes scholarship,
Olympic gold and two basketball championships for the New York Knicks. It also
mentions some of his legislative victories and goals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When Bill Bradley wins, you win,'' the ad says. ``But first you've gotta
give him the ball.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the African summit, Gore's participation got a mixed reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   Union members, who picketed on the sidewalk in steady sleet, appreciated
Gore's gesture.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't count'' as crossing the picket line, said Nancy Wallace, a
member of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're thrilled,'' said Ron Richardson, general vice president of the
group.
</P>
<P>
	   But delegates to the summit were less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm offended,'' said Christian Ibenacho, of Ontario, Calif., who
nonetheless said he would vote for Gore. ``We're also his constituency. He
should have come.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a politician,'' said James Alexander, a delegate from Rhode Island
who was undecided how to vote. ``They have to be sensitive, but they have their
agendas.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, campaigning Friday at a school in Harlem, invoked a bit of his past
by talking about dreaming big. He recalled his efforts, while a New York Knick,
to mentor Harlem youngsters during basketball's off-season.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm coming here today as someone who has been in this kind of setting a
lot of times,'' Bradley told 25 students, most 13 or 14 years old, who are part
of a business and computer technology ``mini-school'' within Adam Clayton Powell
Jr. Middle School Academy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look in your eyes and I see incredible excitement. I want to make sure
those eyes will have the chance to fulfill the potential that each of you
possesses,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said his education plan would double money for urban schools to $88
billion a year, with the condition that schools accepting the money ensure all
their teachers are fully qualified.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Co. Accused of Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal grand jury accused Yugoslav Airlines of
conspiring with a California company and its president to smuggle aircraft parts
and supplies into Yugoslavia in violation of a U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   A 40-count indictment unsealed Friday names Yugoslav Airlines, Yugoslavia's
largest carrier, Irvine-based exporter D.C. Precision and its president, Dusko
Cavic, of smuggling $1.4 million worth of parts into Yugoslavia by way of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   Cavic, 47, of Tustin, was arrested by federal agents Friday morning, said
Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants are accused of violating a trade embargo imposed from 1992 to
1995 in response to the Bosnian war. The U.S. sanctions were imposed in
conjunction with a United Nations embargo that banned the export of a wide range
of goods and technologies to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Messages left at D.C. Precision's headquarters and with Cavic's attorney
were not returned. Yugoslav Airlines offices in the United States were closed
because of an embargo imposed by the European Union, according to the airline's
Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reality is that the imposition of economic sanctions is an important
tool of U.S. foreign policy and the resolution of armed conflicts," said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Johns. "Sanctions are only effective if the
target suffers the effect of the sanction."

<HEADLINE> Mexican Judicial Failings Criticized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A U.N. human rights expert on Friday called on Mexico to do
more to protect civilians from violence, reduce the military's role in
maintaining order and improve the justice system to make everyone equal before
the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Asma Jahangir, the U.N. expert on summary and arbitrary executions,
highlighted ``serious omissions and neglect'' by authorities in the case of the
1997 massacre of 45 residents of the town of Acteal.
</P>
<P>
	   In her conclusions on an 11-day visit last July to investigate political
killings and extrajudicial executions in Mexico, the Pakistani lawyer said
violence and killings remained widespread, though discernibly decreased in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Urgent preventive steps need to be taken to defuse tensions and bring down
the level of violence,'' and to protect people from suffering ``at the hands of
the police, the armed forces, the paramilitary and armed opposition groups,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ineffectiveness of the justice system has given rise to violations of
human rights,'' Jahangir asserted. Its lack of jurisdiction to try members of
the armed forces for violations against civilians erodes ordinary courts'
independence, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jahangir said she noted ``reluctance on the part of the competent Mexican
authorities'' to hold armed forces members to account.
</P>
<P>
	   There were strong indications that government forces ``used excessive and
disproportionate force in a deliberate and planned manner'' in a number of
cases.
</P>
<P>
	   She called on the government to ``end the impunity enjoyed by certain
privileged categories and classes of people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mexican Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the report lacked
balance and objectivity.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the report, the ministry said, ``wide-ranging and detailed
information provided to the expert was omitted.''
</P>
<P>
	   The expert makes recommendations for measures that are (either) already in
practice, or go beyond her mandate, such as suggesting that the armed forces
should not be used to combat organized crime,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the report, Jahangir acknowledged that Mexico has made a start on
improving the judicial system, and encouraged it to pursue the reform.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said state authorities failed to live up to obligations to provide
effective protection to people facing death threats before, during and after the
December 1997 Acteal massacre.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those responsible for serious omissions and neglect were not held
accountable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those killed in the pro-rebel village in Chiapas included 15 children. They
were gunned down by Indians from neighboring villages who supported the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party. The gunmen allegedly received their weapons
from the Mexican army and police.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year 20 government supporters were convicted and sentenced to 35 years
each in prison for their role in the massacre.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Accuses Exile Group on Doctors  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Cuba's ambassador to Venezuela charged Friday
that a group in Miami is working behind the scenes to encourage Cuban doctors on
a disaster relief mission to defect.
</P>
<P>
	   The ambassador, German Sanchez, said at a press conference that the
Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation has funneled money to Cuban exile
groups in Venezuela who are urging Cuban doctors in the South American country
to remain there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are in the presence of an action directed with evil intentions by
certain persons with a large amount of money that comes from Miami,'' Sanchez
said. ``This money comes from the Cuban American National Foundation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez charged that the plan was part of an effort by the group to create
tensions between Venezuela and Cuba, whose presidents, Hugo Chavez and Fidel
Castro, are close allies.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Ferretti, a spokeswoman for the foundation, denied it had anything
to do with recent defections by doctors and said they were simply cases of
Cubans fleeing political repression on the island.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Apparently Castro has an obsession with the Cuban American National
Foundation. He points a finger at us every time something goes wrong for him,''
she said. ``There's no question this is an embarrassment for him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Three Cuban doctors have requested political asylum in Venezuela in the past
two weeks. The request by the first two was denied by Venezuelan authorities,
who said the doctors did not face political persecution in Cuba and wanted to
emigrate for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Venezuela said it would allow them to stay in the country for one
year for unspecified ``humanitarian reasons.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel announced that the same
decision had been made for the third doctor, who requested asylum this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor, Gliselia Alonso, said she wanted to leave Cuba because she had
suffered discrimination there since she is not a fervent supporter of the Castro
government.
</P>
<P>
	   She said that now that she had publicly requested political asylum, she
would almost certainly face harassment or prison if she returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm risking my life,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez criticized the doctors, saying they were ``disloyal'' and lacked
ethics since they had deserted their mission of helping victims of landslides
that killed thousands of people in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The request for political asylum has presented a delicate political problem
for Chavez, who often praises the 40-year-old Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez said that the alleged efforts by the Cuban exile group in Miami to
divide Cuba and Venezuela would fail.
</P>
<P>
	   He said about 450 Cuban medical personnel had been sent to Venezuela to
assist in the relief efforts. Most are still in the country with the Cuban
government's approval.

<HEADLINE> DuPont Plans To Set up Shop Online  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRISTOPHER THORNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- The DuPont Co. is entering a joint venture with Internet
Capital Group to form a company that will oversee online sales of nylon, paint
and other industrial goods to manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   DuPont officials said Friday they are positioning themselves early in an
online business-to-business marketplace that has yet to fully develop. The new
company, called CapSpan, is to be based in Wayne, Pa., where Internet Capital
Group, has its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   CapSpan will actually be a holding company that will develop other Web
companies to do the actual trading over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Many retailers have embraced the Web for its huge consumer marketplace, with
people surfing the Internet for boots, gloves and books. But manufacturers have
been slower to go online for the materials they need to make those retail goods.
</P>
<P>
	   However, online business-to-business marketplace of goods and services has
the potential to reach $7.3 trillion within four years, according to DuPont
analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We selected Internet Capital Group because they can most readily help us
capitalize on opportunities in the rapidly emerging Internet economy," said
Charles O. Holliday Jr., DuPont chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
	   DuPont is already a leader in providing goods to the traditional
manufacturing marketplace. When the buyers of industrial goods move online,
CapSpan will be armed with DuPont's recognized experience and the Internet savvy
of its partner, Internet Capital Group, DuPont executives said.
</P>
<P>
	   CapSpan will specifically target construction, apparel and chemical
manufacturers, selling the material that ends up in home insulation, carpet and
clothing, for instance.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet Capital Group is an Internet holding company focused on
business-to-business Internet sales. It has a trading network of 55 partner
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   DuPont, headquartered in Wilmington, Del., is one of the world's leading
chemical companies. It operates in 65 countries.

<HEADLINE> Ad Shows Gore As Abortion Defender  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   An analysis of Al Gore's latest television commercial:
</P>
<P>
	   TITLE: ``Committed.''
</P>
<P>
	   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   PRODUCER: Century Media.
</P>
<P>
	   AIRING: In states with March 7 primaries; campaign would not say which.
</P>
<P>
	   SCRIPT: (Narrator:) He's taken on the worst polluters in America and become
a leading voice for clean air, clean water and the environment. Al Gore. He's
taken on the HMOs and big drug companies -- fighting for a patients' bill of
rights. He's the only candidate committed to protecting Medicare and preserving
Medicaid. He's stood up to the extreme right wing -- defending a woman's right
to choose. Endorsed by NARAL, America's leading pro-choice group. The experience
to do the job. Al Gore. Fighting for us.''
</P>
<P>
	   KEY IMAGES: Gore, in casual clothing, talking to a crowd. Dark smoke
billowing out of smokestacks during talk of polluters, then green leaves, a
beautiful lake and a sunset during talk of clear air and water. Medical offices,
Gore walking a corridor with doctors. Gore hugging an older person. Women
talking with each other and then the NARAL logo during abortion section. Ends
with Gore and his wife, Tipper, shaking hands along a rope line.
</P>
<P>
	   ANALYSIS: This is a slight revision to an ad from just two days ago, adding
the section on abortion a day after Bill Bradley released an abortion ad.
Bradley has been hammering Gore for his early, mixed record on abortion rights,
including opposition to Medicaid funding, and Bradley began airing an ad Friday
saying that he is the only candidate who has been ``pro-choice for everyone all
the time.'' This is Gore's response, as he works to maintain his edge nationally
and among women.
</P>
<P>
	   ACCURACY: The ad never mentions Gore's early record on abortion, but it
doesn't distort it either. Gore has been solidly pro-choice for years and he was
endorsed by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
Throughout his career, Gore has focused on the environment, and the Clinton-Gore
administration has fought hard for a patients' bill of rights. Gore says he's
the only candidate who is committed to preserving Medicaid -- a reference to
Bradley's plan to eliminate the program. But the ad never mentions that Bradley
would move poor people into the federal insurance program for government workers
and give many more people access to insurance.

<HEADLINE> Last holdout New Jersey may allow cancer insurance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - For the last few years, New Jersey has been the
lone holdout in the national lobbying effort to market insurance policies
specified for "dread diseases" such as AIDS and cancer.
<P>
	   When New York regulators in 1997 allowed such policies, New Jersey was left
as the only state in the nation to ban them. As recently as late 1998, state
officials said they opposed these policies.
</P>
<P>
	   All that may change.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Banking and Insurance is entertaining draft regulations
that would allow specific-disease policies, as long as there are consumer
protections. The issue will be aired in a public hearing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say the supplemental policies would help residents pay bills that
may not otherwise be covered. Consumer groups, however, say the policies could
dupe residents into a false sense of security. They say improvements should be
made to make sure regular health insurance policies cover more items.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant insurance commissioner Donald Bryan said regulators remain wary
about allowing cancer insurance, but that the issue will be aired to see if
there is public support.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are the only state that doesn't offer it, and there continues to be an
interest from insurers to sell it, and there are indications there may be a
demand from the public for this," said Bryan. "It's worthy of a public
discussion."
</P>
<P>
	   The national lobbying effort to allow specific disease insurance has been
led by the American Family Life Assurance Company (AFLAC), which has pushed for
change in New Jersey. Supporters of this type of insurance say it covers things
that health insurers don't, including transportation and baby-sitting costs for
cancer patients while they have chemotherapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumers deserve choice," said Richard Coorsh, spokesman for the Health
Insurance Association of America. "There are often areas that are not paid for
by medical coverage in traditional health plans. There are travel expenses,
there may be hotel stays at regional cancer treatment centers. Specified disease
coverage can help to pay for these specified costs."
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer groups, however, worry that consumers could be misled by having
something called "cancer insurance." They say the state should focus on widening
coverage in existing health policies rather than allowing this kind of
supplemental coverage. They say such policies prey upon consumers' fears.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the public is going to feel a false sense of security," said
Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, director of New Jersey Citizen Action. "What if they get
something else that's not that specified disease?"
</P>
<P>
	   Coorsh said health insurers oppose attempts to force more coverage in
traditional policies. He said that would raise the price tag for such policies,
which could force some consumers to drop health insurance altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   Coorsh said people may take out a cancer insurance policy "if, for example,
they have a family history of cancer. It is insurance. It is designed to
safeguard against the potential of getting a disease."
</P>
<P>
	   Insurance department officials say the draft proposal includes consumer
safeguards limiting how much profit companies can make on these policies, having
the state give prior approval of marketing and advertising efforts, and having
all policies reviewed by state regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan said the regulations are patterned after New York's protections, "but
offer a bit more."

<HEADLINE> Press Denied Diallo Evidence Access  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The judge in the Amadou Diallo case on Friday denied a
motion by news organizations to make trial evidence available to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Four white police officers are accused of murdering the unarmed West African
immigrant in a barrage of 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi called the media request too broad and
poorly timed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The making of this motion in the middle of this trial is an unnecessary
distraction of this court from its duties and responsibilities,'' the judge
wrote in the five-page ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Added Teresi: ``If the request were to be granted, it would expose the
evidence to endless requests, and risks.''
</P>
<P>
	   The motion -- filed on behalf of the Daily News, Newsday, the New York Post,
The New York Times, The Associated Press, the Albany Times Union and the New
York Law Journal -- sought ``public access to the materials received in evidence
during trial'' on First Amendment grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi took over the trial after an appeals court -- citing pretrial
publicity -- moved the case out of New York City. Last month, he ruled the
state's ban on cameras in court was unconstitutional, allowing the trial to be
televised and photographed.
</P>
<P>
	   Closing arguments are set for Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Professor Guilty in Child Porn Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A Yale University professor pleaded guilty Friday to
charges he downloaded tens of thousands of child pornography images from the
Internet and made two pornographic videos of a preteen boy on the Yale campus.
</P>
<P>
	   Antonio Lasaga, 50, accepted a plea bargain in which he admitted to federal
charges of possessing and receiving child pornography.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why his client did it, Lasaga's attorney, William Dow, said ``everyone
has flaws and shortcomings.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lasaga could get up to 20 years in prison and three years of probation and
be fined $500,000 he is sentenced May 8. He also must make restitution to the
13-year-old boy featured in his videotapes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lasaga still faces a civil lawsuit and state charges, including sexual
assault, risk of injury to a minor and promoting a minor in an obscene
performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Alvin Thompson allowed Lasaga to remain under house until the
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
	   Lasaga, a geology professor, has been on leave from Yale since the charges
surfaced in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said the university ``will take the appropriate
action at the appropriate time,'' regarding Lasaga's future.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING: ADDS Bjt designation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Residents living in the shadow of the Cayuga
Indian Nation land claim for the past two decades were more relieved than angry
over a federal court jury's decision to award the tribe nearly $37 million for
its lost homeland.
<P>
	   After 11 days of testimony and evidence and two days of deliberations, a
nine-member U.S. District Court jury on Thursday recommended that the Cayugas
receive $35 million for the current value of the 64,015-acre claim area and
another $1.9 million as rent for its use and occupancy for a 204-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount was significantly less than the $335 million a federal government
appraiser said the 100-square-mile tract was worth, less even the $51 million
evaluation made by a state appraiser.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the trial, a court-appointed mediator offered a settlement of $120
million.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an I-told-you-so kind of a verdict," said Mel Russo, a cochairman
of United Citizens for Equality, a grassroots group that opposed the land claim
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   "It shows we were right when we wanted the case to go to trial and not to
settle like everybody else wanted to do," Russo said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're hoping that the whole thing is appealed so that these people cannot
establish a reservation," Russo added. "All they have to do is go in and buy a
couple of acres, get it annexed, open up a casino and bye-bye taxpayer land."
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas' attorneys said they would ask the judgment be set aside,
calling it a "ridiculous" amount.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury's decision is only a recommendation to Judge Neal McCurn, who will
hold another non-jury trial sometime this summer to consider so-called
"equitable factors," such as interest on the back rent and deductions for public
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominic Sinicropi, 58, of Seneca Falls, said the Cayugas don't deserve a
penny.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was all about money in the first place. I feel if they got a nickel,
it was too much," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Becky Maltzan, a 36-year-old deli clerk, also said the verdict was unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a lot of money. But I'm really glad they didn't get any land," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the trial started, McCurn limited jurors to considering a
monetary award only. Also, the Cayugas previously agreed that they would not
seek to evict anyone but said they would use any money to buy land from willing
sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki called the award "a fair and reasonable verdict" that
"fairly compensated the Cayuga Indian Nation."
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas felt otherwise, especially about the jury's decision on the
land's rental value.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a low blow," said Marty Wheeler, 56, a nurse from the Cattaraugus
Reservation near Buffalo, who attended the trial. "It's unbelievable that they
think that's what 200 years are worth ... Two hundred years - that's amazing."
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to the start of the trial, the Cayugas' lawyers had asked for a change
of venue, saying they feared bias and misinformation would taint the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "This decision is proof that our motion should have been granted," said
attorney Martin Gold.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine jury members came from Onondaga and Oswego counties, which are not
in the Cayuga claim area. However, four live in an area that will be part of a
land claim that will be brought later this year by the Onondaga Nation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The jury never got to hear the most important voices in this case - those
of the Cayuga people," said Onondaga Nation Chief Irving Powless.
</P>
<P>
	   McCurn barred testimony regarding any alleged pain and suffering endured by
the Cayugas as a result of being dispossessed of their land.

<HEADLINE> Annan Doubtful on Sahara Referendum  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned Friday that a
nearly decade-old U.N. effort to hold an independence referendum in the Western
Sahara may never succeed because of disputes over who can vote.
</P>
<P>
	   In an unusually blunt report, Annan said the referendum on whether the
mineral-rich north African territory should become independent from Morocco
could no longer be held in July, as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, dispute over who should be able vote meant no new date could be
set, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   War broke out in the Western Sahara in 1976 after Spain abandoned the
Atlantic coast territory and Morocco annexed it and moved in settlers. The
fighting -- which pitted 15,000 guerrilla fighters from the Polisario Front
against Morocco's U.S.-equipped army -- ended in 1991 with a U.N.-negotiated
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, the United Nations has been working to identify who is eligible
to cast ballots for a referendum. Morocco and the Polisario Front have accused
each other of trying to pad voter rolls.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N.-monitored process of identifying voters was to be completed in
February, and the referendum was scheduled for July 31.
</P>
<P>
	   But the core problem of determining the electorate ``could eventually
prevent the holding of the referendum as provided by the plan,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 79,000 appeals were submitted following publication of a first
provisional voter list, and a second provisional voter list could add another
60,000 appeals, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the delays in the voter registration process, and because there
is no way to ensure that either side would respect the outcome of the vote
anyway, Annan recommended the Security Council review the entire question of
Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would ask his personal envoy, former U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker III, to try to salvage the process by meeting with both sides.

<HEADLINE> FBI Traps Suspected Cuban Spy  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official charged with spying for Cuba was
arrested after falling straight into a trap set by the FBI, investigators said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI said it fed him phony information about a pending defection and then
caught him passing it on just 12 minutes later to a contact with ties to the
Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariano Faget, 54, a Cuban-born supervisor in the Miami office of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, may have been passing on classified
information about Cuban defectors for some time, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, Faget met with Cuban intelligence officials in
Miami on at least two occasions, contacted officials with the agency that
represents Cuba in Washington and had regular contact with the man he called
last week in the sting -- a New York businessman with ties to the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they had been investigating Faget for a year but wouldn't
say how long they believe he had been passing on classified information. They
also said they were uncertain about the effects of his alleged espionage --
whether any Cubans were prevented from defecting, for example.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget (pronounced fah-HAY), who was arrested Thursday, is charged with
violating the federal Espionage Act and making false statements to a federal
officer. The first charge carries up to 10 years in prison; the second could
bring five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing in court Friday, the paunchy, balding Faget was ordered held until
a bail hearing Thursday. He caught the eyes of relatives and friends as he
walked into court and held his left hand to his heart.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Joel Kaplan would not comment. Nor would Faget's family
members and friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors said they will ask that Faget be held as a flight risk
and a danger to the community.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget and his father came to the United States and claimed political asylum
in 1960, the year after Fidel Castro came to power. Faget became a U.S. citizen
in 1963.
</P>
<P>
	   He began working for the INS as a clerk in 1966, INS district director Bob
Wallis said. Faget would have been eligible for retirement next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, who is married, lives in the Miami suburb of Kendall. Neighbor
Beatrice Vallenilla said she believes Faget has three adult children.
</P>
<P>
	   As a supervisory district adjudication officer for the INS, Faget had
``secret'' security clearance and oversaw decisions that affected the residency
status of immigrants, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI spokesman Paul Mallett said Faget waited only 12 minutes Feb. 11 before
he passed on the phony information that a Cuban official was about to defect.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, INS and FBI officials showed Faget pictures of a
Cuban intelligence official he knew, and told Faget that the man wanted to
defect and that the information was secret and very sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, Faget returned to his office and used his personal cell
phone to call the New York businessman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faget told the businessman that `a person we both know' was `one of the
ones working with the Americans,''' U.S. Attorney Thomas Scott said in a
statement. ``Faget then identified the Cuban intelligence officer by name.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Faget called the man from home and discussed the case in more detail,
the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, Faget and the New York businessman are officers
of a Florida company whose stated purpose is to engage in future business
transactions with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   State records show Faget is vice president and secretary of America-Cuba
Inc., a company created in 1994. The company's president and chief executive is
listed as Pedro Font of Greenwich, Conn. A source close to the investigation
confirmed for The Associated Press that Font was the businessman referred to in
the affidavit.	   A number listed for Font in Greenwich, Conn., was
disconnected. The affidavit said Font was in China on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Goyanes, listed in state records as a Miami-based executive of
America-Cuba, said Friday he was surprised by the charges against Faget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The guy is a family man. He works for the government,'' Goyanes said.
``This is the last thing I ever thought. The courts will prove him innocent when
it is all over.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities said that in addition to the New York contact, Faget
placed calls to the Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington, which is known as
the Cuban Interests Section, and met with two Cuban intelligence officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI has recommended to the State Department that a contact of Faget's at
the Cuban diplomatic mission be asked to leave the country, a Clinton
administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section declined comment. The White
House also had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallis said all of the cases that had crossed Faget's desk would be closely
reviewed. Early Friday, authorities searched Faget's office and his home and
seized two computers and his automobile.
</P>
<P>
	   His arrest comes amid already strained relations with the communist island
over Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy found clinging to an inner tube
off the Florida coast Nov. 25. His mother and 10 others died when their boat
sank in an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's Miami relatives are fighting to keep him in the United States,
despite an order by the INS to reunite Elian with his father in Cuba. Faget had
nothing to do with Elian's case, Wallis said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities also said Faget had no connection to a large Cuban spy ring
broken up in 1998. Fourteen people were accused of trying to penetrate U.S.
military bases, infiltrate anti-Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media
and political organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Five people have pleaded guilty. Others go on trial in May.

<HEADLINE> Letterman Returns to Work  </HEADLINE>
    By KATHERINE ROTH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Letterman returned to work Friday, taping his first
"Late Show" since undergoing heart surgery a month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Late Show with David Letterman" taped Friday airs on CBS on Monday. The
guests include Jerry Seinfeld and Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   The taping was closed to the media. Audience members who braved cold
temperatures and rain to be among the first to welcome Letterman back said the
comedian was in fine form.
</P>
<P>
	   "He didn't look sick, he looked great," said Donna Mecca, 43, of Stamford,
Conn. "In his monologue he said, 'How many of you came here to see if I was
going to drop dead?' It was hysterical."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman gave the audience white T-shirts with a red scar running down the
chest and the date of his surgery on the sleeve. He underwent an emergency
quintuple bypass operation on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was awesome. He looked great, looks like he lost a little weight," said
Johnny Jones, 36, of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's thin, he went through something very taxing," Jones said. "He's back,
he's in rare form."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman brought out some of the doctors and nurses who took care of him
during his hospital stay, and almost came to tears when talking about them,
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   The comedian will be pacing his return at first. He will also work
Wednesday, but Bill Cosby and Kathie Lee Gifford will also be guest hosts next
week -- the first time Letterman has let someone else take over.
</P>
<P>
	   Regis Philbin, who was originally supposed to be a guest host instead of
Gifford, is one of Letterman's guests on his first night back. Philbin was
Letterman's on-air conversation partner when he revealed his health problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Philbin was forced to back out as substitute host due to increased demands
from "Who Wants to be a Millionaire," the hit ABC game show he emcees.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Church in Zoning Battle  </HEADLINE>
   By AMALIE YOUNG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Officials in a southwestern Oregon community have
given their blessing to a new Presbyterian church. But there's a catch: no
weddings or funerals allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastor Larry Jung said Friday that the city of Jacksonville is interfering
in the practice of religion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Weddings and funerals are central to what we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the City Council says this is a zoning matter, not a spiritual one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You think you've got God on your side, you are exempt from zoning?'' said
council member John Dodero.
</P>
<P>
	   Jung's congregation has been meeting in a building that seats 125.
Membership has swelled, however, and there are plans to build a 400-seat
sanctuary and an education building on a 10-acre site.
</P>
<P>
	   The City Council granted a permit for the new church on the conditions there
be no alcohol, no funerals and no weddings.
</P>
<P>
	   The conditions were imposed to keep increased traffic in the neighborhood at
a minimum.
</P>
<P>
	   Jung, who is considering taking his case to the state's Land Use Board of
Appeals, said Oregon is ``one of the most un-churched states in the country.
We're definitely not in the Bible Belt.''
</P>
<P>
	   This is the second time within a month that an Oregon church has gotten into
a battle with city officials.
</P>
<P>
	   A Portland United Methodist Church was told by a city official to limit the
number of people that can gather for worship services. The officer meant to
alleviate neighborhood complaints that people leaving a meals program sometimes
created a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Portland city attorney's office last week recommended dropping the
attendance limits while keeping restrictions on other church activities, such as
a daycare and the meals program. Religious leaders have filed an appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   John Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute, a Charlottesville,
Va.-based advocacy group, said churches should be treated differently that other
land-use applicants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you are dealing with a church's religious mission, the government
doesn't want to mess with that,'' he said. ``They should be hands-off.''

<HEADLINE> English Musical Wins Olivier Award  </HEADLINE>
    By MATT WOLF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- "Honk! The Ugly Duckling," a modest musical reworking of the
Hans Christian Andersen tale, and American writer Richard Nelson's low-key play
"Goodnight Children Everywhere" were the unexpected winners of best musical and
best play at the Olivier Awards on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oliviers, London's equivalent to Broadway's Tony awards, honor theater,
opera and dance.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson, a resident of Rhinebeck, N.Y., sounded as surprised as the audience
when he stepped to the podium to accept his prize for the play, a family drama
about separation, loss and renewal: "Are you sure you got that right?" he asked
presenter Mal Young. "I'm amazed."
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Drewe, author of the book and lyrics for the prize-winning musical
"Honk!", sounded a similar theme. "I guess the judges couldn't get tickets for
'The Lion King,"' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   The Disney hit had been the frontrunner for that award, along with critics'
darling "Spend Spend Spend," about a real-life woman, Viv Nicholson, who won a
fortune in the early '60s and then lost it all.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbara Dickson won best actress her portrayal of Nicholson. In 1983,
Dickson won an Olivier for playing a similarly gritty northern English woman in
the musical "Blood Brothers," which is still running.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously, I've cornered the market in downtrodden northern women," Dickson
told the celebrity audience. "Don't bother going up for any of (those roles);
they're mine."
</P>
<P>
	   Audience favorite "Mamma Mia!" got a supporting actress nod for the feisty
Jenny Galloway, while "The Lion King" itself snared two prizes -- for Garth
Fagan's choreography and Julie Taymor's costumes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Royal National Theater's remounting of the classic American musical,
"Candide," was named best musical production and won a musical actor prize for
Simon Russell Beale.
</P>
<P>
	   The state-funded National was the day's pre-eminent prize-winner, taking
nine awards in 21 categories.
</P>
<P>
	   A revival of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" won the best actor prize
for Henry Goodman, and Trevor Nunn, who directed that and two other shows, won
best director. The revival of the Victorian-era comedy "Money" won prizes for
best supporting actor and actress in a play for Roger Allam and Patricia Hodge.
</P>
<P>
	   Best actress went to Janie Dee for Sir Alan Ayckbourn's West End comedy,
"Comic Potential," in which Dee plays a robotic performer in cheesy TV soaps.
This was Dee's second Olivier following a 1993 supporting award for playing
Carrie Pipperidge in the American musical, "Carousel."
</P>
<P>
	   The prize constituted a hat trick for Dee, whose performance in the
Ayckbourn play was already lauded at the Drama Critics' Circle earlier this
month and, in November, at the Evening Standard Drama Awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Both top actress winners, Dee and Dickson, were given their prizes during
the curtain calls of their respective shows Thursday night, the evening before
the ceremonies. The feeling was that an element of occasion would enhance the
Olivier program when an edited version of the ceremony is televised Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Joan Plowright, Lord Olivier's widow, presented the outstanding achievement
award to Peter O'Toole for his return to the London stage last fall playing a
famously bibulous magazine columnist in "Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell." Bernard has
died since O'Toole first played the role a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Plowright, presenters included Elaine Paige, Alan Bates, Zoe
Wanamaker, and American TV and film star Jason Priestley, who makes his British
stage debut Feb. 28 in the Broadway play, "Side Man."

<HEADLINE> Gore Stands Behind China Trade Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore sought to assure the business
community on Friday that he stands behind a landmark trade agreement the Clinton
administration negotiated with China.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's assurance was prompted by a controversy triggered when labor leaders
this week claimed that the vice president had pledged that if elected president
he would negotiate a tougher pact with China with more protections for labor and
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I have said publicly and privately, I support the agreement reached by
our administration on the terms under which China will be permitted to accede to
the World Trade Organization,'' Gore said in a letter Friday to the National
Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he supported the agreement because it would ``provide meaningful
benefits'' for both American workers and companies by further opening the
Chinese markets as well as exposing China to the world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that Congress should enact legislation to secure these goals --
in the form they have been negotiated -- this year,'' Gore said in the letter to
NAM president Jerry Jasinowski.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore in his one-page letter did say that as president he would insist that
labor and environmental safeguards be included in trade agreements negotiated by
his administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore sent the letter to quell a controversy started by AFL-CIO President
John Sweeney at the labor movement's winter meeting in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweeney was quoted in USA Today as saying that Gore had assured organized
labor that a Gore administration would seek additional labor and environmental
concessions from China before asking Congress to vote on China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
	   NAM and other business groups complained to the White House about Gore's
reported comments, saying it seriously jeopardized the lobbying campaign the
administration wants them to mount in Congress on behalf of China.
</P>
<P>
	   After receiving Gore's letter, NAM officials said they were satisfied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are pleased to see Vice President Gore's reiteration of strong support
for the excellent trade agreement President Clinton negotiated with China,''
Jasinowski said in a statement. ``We hope that those members of Congress who are
wavering on this vote will take note of the vice president's strong support,
follow his leadership and line up behind the president to get this thing done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last November, the administration struck a deal with China in which the
Chinese agreed to lower trade barriers that American farmers and businesses
claim are costing them billions of dollars annually in lost sales. In return,
the United States agreed to support China's bid to join the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   However, U.S. exporters won't receive the full benefits China is offering
unless Congress votes to grant China normal trade relations with the United
States and end the annual congressional vote on China's tariff rates.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Rampage Colombian Village  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Suspected right-wing gunmen rampaged through an
isolated northern region this week, killing at least nine unarmed villagers but
possibly many more, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Local civilians reported 11 additional bodies found. But Col. Mario Flores,
acting police commander in Sucre state, could not confirm those accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Flores said authorities recovered nine bodies after fleeing peasants
reported as many as 20 people had been dragged from their homes and executed by
men in camouflage uniforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Some victims had been stabbed, and others had their throats slit, Flores
said by telephone from the state capital, Sincelejo.
</P>
<P>
	   The killings reportedly began Wednesday and ended early Friday in several
mountain hamlets outside the town of Ovejas, 330 miles northeast of the capital,
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
	   Both paramilitary groups and rival leftist guerrillas are active in the
area, Flores said.
</P>
<P>
	   Television images from one village showed vultures perched in a tree near to
where several corpses lay on the ground, covered by dried leaves. Villagers were
seen walking down a dirt road away from town, fleeing with what possessions they
could carry.
</P>
<P>
	   Villagers who arrived Friday in Ovejas said many of the victims were
beheaded, town secretary Alejandro de la Rosa told Radionet Radio. He said 80
people had arrived in the town.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Rosa said 20 bodies had been found, and that town officials and Red
Cross workers would begin a search of the most remote villages on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence follows this week's opening of a debate in the U.S. Congress
over a massive increase in military aid to Colombia as part of a proposed $1.6
billion package for fighting narcotics.
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights organizations have opposed the plan, saying the United States
should not be giving more aid to the Colombian military, which has been accused
of tacitly supporting the paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of peasants, accused by rightists of collaborating with
guerrillas, have died in paramilitary massacres in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Davidians Seek Classifed Documents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- An attorney for Branch Davidians suing the government
asked the Department of Defense on Friday to declassify 5,000 pages of documents
that he says could help show whether soldiers fired at the burning compound.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Public interest demands the public be informed of the military activities
undertaken against U.S. citizens on U.S. soil,'' Jim Brannon wrote Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   Brannon said he will ask a federal judge to grant access to the documents if
Cohen declines his request. The Defense Department did not return telephone
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The plaintiffs, whose wrongful-death lawsuit goes to trial in May, contend
that infrared surveillance footage taken by the FBI proves that someone fired on
the Davidians' compound as it burned on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   About 80 Branch Davidians died, some from gunshots and others from fire. The
government long has maintained that the Davidians died by their own hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the Defense Department, which acknowledges members of its elite
Delta Force were on the scene during the siege in an observational role, denied
gunfire by personnel in their agencies -- ``based on currently available
information.''
</P>
<P>
	   In another development Friday, Special Counsel John Danforth filed a motion
in federal court opposing media access to a re-enactment next month at Fort
Hood. The re-enactment is aimed at determining if an infrared camera could have
detected gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dallas Morning News and The Associated Press have filed a motion,
asserting that the public's interest trumps any secrecy claims that the
government could assert.
</P>
<P>
	   But Danforth told U.S. District Judge Walter Smith that ``the quickest way
to discredit an investigation is to provide the media with selective information
during its course.''
</P>
<P>
	   Danforth, a former U.S. senator from Missouri, was appointed in September by
Attorney General Janet Reno to resolve unanswered questions about the final
hours of the siege.

<HEADLINE> TV's Wealthy Groom Surprises Friends  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN FOX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?" captured the
attention of millions of TV viewers, provoked disgust from women's groups and
spawned office chatter around the country this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in San Diego, people who know the millionaire groom, Rick Rockwell,
were howling with laughter and surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought, 'That's your millionaire? You've got to be joking,"' said
Barbara Summers, the owner of a San Diego-area dating service who has known
Rockwell since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a likable guy and he's funny, but we're all wondering, when did he
become a millionaire? How did we miss that?"
</P>
<P>
	   Summers and her husband, Bob Horn, invited Rockwell to their wedding in 1995
and recalled that his present was a $25 gift certificate.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's known as one of these guys who has 50 cents left from his first
communion dollar," said Horn, an Internet consultant and former San Diego
Chargers linebacker.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Rockwell's mother said she didn't know he was so rich.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell, 42, is on his Caribbean honeymoon with his new bride, Darva
Conger, a 34-year-old nurse and Gulf War veteran from Santa Monica, and couldn't
be reached for comment. Fox TV checked out his finances and confirmed that he's
worth "at least $2 million," and had $750,000 in the bank, a spokeswoman said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell, who was born Richard Balkey in Pittsburgh, told Fox he is a real
estate developer.
</P>
<P>
	   From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, he was a regular on the Southern
California comedy club circuit and appeared on a comedy show on KFMB-TV as a
geeky beach bum.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Kelley, a comic and editorial cartoonist for The San Diego
Union-Tribune, said Rockwell was not particularly popular with his colleagues on
the circuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The word on the street was that there was a little bit of everybody's act
in Rick's act," Kelley said. "He would ... use jokes without attribution."
</P>
<P>
	   He also performed in a straight-to-video sequel to the movie "Attack of the
Killer Tomatoes" and was a finalist on the variety show "Star Search," according
to Larry Himmel, a friend and reporter for KFMB-TV who cast Rockwell in the
local comedy program.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was always on the fringe but was never on that level where you get on
the 'Tonight Show,"' Himmel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox TV executives said they knew about his entertainment background and
chose him in part because he was able to handle himself well on camera.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell has bought and sold several Southern California properties in
recent years. The Union-Tribune reported Friday that he bought a home in La
Jolla in 1993 for $270,000 and sold it last June for $580,000.
</P>
<P>
	   His house in Encinitas, outside San Diego, is no mansion -- it's one story
and 1,200 square feet.
</P>
<P>
	   Deborah Quilla, an art director for an advertising agency, said she dated
Rockwell's roommate at the La Jolla house about four years ago. She recalls the
house had a great view of the ocean but was spartan inside and outfitted with
patio furniture.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was real, real stingy about everything," Quilla said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell's mother, Joanne Balkey, said she had no idea her son was a
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
	   "He doesn't live like a flamboyant millionaire," Balkey told the Canadian
Press. "The last car I saw him drive was a Volkswagen."
</P>
<P>
	   Most of those interviewed said they are skeptical about Rockwell's motives
for appearing on the show, saying it was probably a publicity stunt. But
Rockwell's mother believes he was serious about the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
	   "From what he told me before the show," she told the Canadian Press, "he was
of an age and ready (to marry) and maybe wanted to have a family."

<HEADLINE> Letterman returns from heart surgery, taping show to air Feb. 21  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - David Letterman has returned to work, taping his first
"Late Show" since undergoing heart surgery a month ago.
<P>
	   The "Late Show with David Letterman" taped Friday airs on CBS on Monday. The
guests include Jerry Seinfeld and Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   Audience members who braved cold temperatures and precipitation to be among
the first to welcome Letterman back said the comedian was in fine form.
</P>
<P>
	   "He didn't look sick, he looked great," said Donna Mecca, 43, of Stamford,
Conn. "In his monologue he said, 'How many of you came here to see if I was
going to drop dead?' It was hysterical."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman gave the audience white T-shirts with a red scar running down the
chest and the date of his surgery on the sleeve. He underwent an emergency
quintuple bypass operation on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was awesome. He looked great, looks like he lost a little weight," said
Johnny Jones, 36, of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's thin, he went through something very taxing," Jones said. "He's back,
he's in rare form."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman brought out some of the doctors and nurses who took care of him
during his hospital stay, and almost came to tears when talking about them,
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's bandleader Paul Shaffer said the show was one of his boss's most
memorable.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was so wonderful on so many levels," Shaffer said. "He looks just the
same, very focused, very much wanted this to be a special show. And it really
was. ... He was bowling strike after strike after strike."
</P>
<P>
	   The comedian will be pacing his return at first. He will also work
Wednesday, but Bill Cosby and Kathie Lee Gifford will also be guest hosts next
week - the first time Letterman has let someone else take over.
</P>
<P>
	   Regis Philbin, who was originally supposed to be a guest host instead of
Gifford, is one of Letterman's guests on his first night back. The hard-working
emcee of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" was Letterman's on-air conversation
partner when he revealed his health problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's return is likely to draw a big audience and the timing, in the
midst of a ratings sweeps month, couldn't be better for CBS. His ratings have
been up this season and late-night competitor Jay Leno is down, but Leno's
average audience each night on NBC is still 35 percent bigger.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, when a series of celebrities were interviewed reminiscing about
their appearances with Letterman for "Late Show Backstage" specials, it was the
third highest-rated week of the year for "Late Show."
</P>
<P>
	   "Backstage" was continuing this week with Kathie Lee Gifford, Robin Williams
and Mike Myers among the guests. Tom Snyder came out of retirement Wednesday to
interview Don Rickles and Norm McDonald.
</P>
<P>
	   Subsequent weeks will likely be a combination of guest hosts and Letterman
appearances. Ever since he began his late-night show in 1982, Letterman hasn't
brought in guest hosts.
</P>
<P>
	   No plans have been made beyond Thursday, according to a "Late Show"
publicist.
</P>
<P>
	   Philbin was forced to back out as substitute host due to increased demands
from "Who Wants to be a Millionaire," the hit ABC game show he emcees.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy Seeks Better Vieques Ties  </HEADLINE>
   By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A top U.S. Navy official on Friday said the
Navy could build a relationship with the residents of Puerto Rico's Vieques
Island, whose protests at a military base have halted bombing exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   Rear Adm. Kevin Green is the U.S. government's main liaison with Puerto Rico
on the issue of resuming the Vieques bombing exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of my goals is to work closely with the people and improve the
relationship between the Navy and the people of Vieques,'' Green told reporters
Friday in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
	   Green is head of a new U.S. Naval Forces South Command in Puerto Rico,
established to consolidate Atlantic and hemispheric commands, the U.S. Atlantic
Fleet announced in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   For about 60 years, the Navy has bombed and shelled Vieques as a military
training ground. The island's 9,400 residents are sandwiched between a western
zone where the military stores weapons in bunkers and an eastern training
ground, where bombings, shellings and mock invasions are staged.
</P>
<P>
	   After an errant bomb killed a civilian security guard and injured four
others in April, protesters moved in, camping on the bombing range to thwart
further exercises. The exercises were temporarily suspended, and Puerto Rico
demanded the bombing range be shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   However, President Clinton and Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello reached an
agreement last month that allows the Navy to continue training on Vieques for
now, but only using inert bombs.

<HEADLINE> Young couple arrested after body of missing woman found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COLONIE, N.Y. (AP) - A young couple is accused of stealing from and
killing the girlfriend's 91-year-old relative for cash and kicks, police said
Friday.
<P>
	   Katherine Marie Seeber, 18, of the Town of Saratoga and Jeffrey T.
Hampshire, 19, of nearby Saratoga Springs are charged with second-degree murder
in the death of 91-year-old Ruth Witter. Witter's body was found Friday morning
over a snow embankment in rural Saratoga County about 30 miles from her home in
Colonie, an Albany suburb.
</P>
<P>
	   Witter is the step-great-gandmother of Seeber, who had lived in a small town
in Idaho with her mother until a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The unemployed suspects spent three nights last weekend in motels, allegedly
partying with alcohol and drugs, according to Colonie Police Lt. Steve Heider.
Drugs may have been involved but were not believed to be central to the slaying,
he said. Witter had been missing since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   No motive other than the alleged larceny is known, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a single case of greed, of a lack of self-control, a lack of
empathy for others and a commitment on their part to continue their lifestyle,"
Heider said. "It was a general partying thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Heider said Seeber and the victim were not close, but apparently knew each
other well enough for the victim to have allowed the suspects into her home.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that Seeber comes from a middle-class suburban family and neither
suspect is from what he would consider a poor or underprivileged background.
</P>
<P>
	   Heider said there was no sign of a struggle in Witter's home. Police believe
she either died there or during the two to three hours of traveling before her
body was dumped over the embankment, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As with an awful lot of things like this with young people, it's based on
greed," Heider said, emphasizing that he referred to a small segment of young
people. "A portion of that could be drug use and as with an awful lot of cases
involving young people (and crime), they don't have a lot of respect for
property ... they don't have a lot of respect for life."
</P>
<P>
	   Heider added that "homicide involving relatives is very frequent," citing
that 80 percent of homicides in the United States are committed by relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Witter's body was found without a coat, partly covered with snow, at the
Saratoga National Historical Park - the site of the American Revolution's Battle
of Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said a big break in the case came late Thursday night. After she was
questioned by police and released on Wednesday and earlier Thursday, police said
she spoke to an "uninvolved third party" whom they wouldn't identify. This
person then told another unnamed person, who passed the information onto the
Mechanicville Police Department just south of the national park.
</P>
<P>
	   Information was released to the media on Tuesday about a red car. On Tuesday
night police received a call from a gas station attendant who said that, days
before, he gave directions to a young couple asking for the way to Witter's
home.
</P>
<P>
	   Police then spoke to the Witter family about a red car and the investigation
moved quickly, Heider said.
</P>
<P>
	   No further arrests are expected in the slaying, Heider said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hampshire was in the Saratoga County Jail on an unrelated burglary charge
lodged from evidence gathered in the murder investigation, Heider said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seeber was scheduled to be arraigned and sent to the Saratoga County Jail to
await further action, Heider said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they didn't know the names of the suspects' attorneys.

<HEADLINE> Letterman Returns to Work  </HEADLINE>
    By KATHERINE ROTH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Letterman returned to work Friday, taping his first
"Late Show" since undergoing heart surgery a month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Late Show with David Letterman" taped Friday airs on CBS on Monday. The
guests include Jerry Seinfeld and Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   The taping was closed to the media. Audience members who braved cold
temperatures and rain to be among the first to welcome Letterman back said the
comedian was in fine form.
</P>
<P>
	   "He didn't look sick, he looked great," said Donna Mecca, 43, of Stamford,
Conn. "In his monologue he said, 'How many of you came here to see if I was
going to drop dead?' It was hysterical."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman gave the audience white T-shirts with a red scar running down the
chest and the date of his surgery on the sleeve. He underwent an emergency
quintuple bypass operation on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was awesome. He looked great, looks like he lost a little weight," said
Johnny Jones, 36, of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's thin, he went through something very taxing," Jones said. "He's back,
he's in rare form."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman brought out some of the doctors and nurses who took care of him
during his hospital stay, and almost came to tears when talking about them,
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's bandleader Paul Shaffer said the show was one of his boss' most
memorable.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was so wonderful on so many levels," Shaffer said in an interview
backstage. "He looks just the same, very focused, very much wanted this to be a
special show. And it really was. ... He was bowling strike after strike after
strike."
</P>
<P>
	   The comedian will be pacing his return at first. He will also work
Wednesday, but Bill Cosby and Kathie Lee Gifford will also be guest hosts next
week -- the first time Letterman has let someone else take over.
</P>
<P>
	   Regis Philbin, who was originally supposed to be a guest host instead of
Gifford, is one of Letterman's guests on his first night back. Philbin was
Letterman's on-air conversation partner when he revealed his health problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Philbin was forced to back out as substitute host due to increased demands
from "Who Wants to be a Millionaire," the hit ABC game show he emcees.

<HEADLINE> Russia Lashes at U.S. on Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM HEINTZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia directed more harsh criticism at the United States on
Friday over the war in Chechnya, while acting President Vladimir Putin sent the
White House a message stressing the countries' mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
	   A Foreign Ministry statement lashed out at comments made Thursday by U.S.
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, in which he said ``Russia has a clear
obligation to investigate the numerous credible reports of civilian killings and
alleged misconduct by its soldiers'' in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Ministry said Rubin was ``operating with clearly tendentious
data and even outright bias supplied by the terrorists themselves ... In fact,
this amounts to assistance in information-terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin's comments were ``absolutely inadmissible both in essence and in form,
resembling the unfortunate NATO statements during the period of aggression
against Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russia vehemently opposed the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia last year, and has
said countries that participated in the bombing have no justification for
criticizing the offensive in Chechnya, which Russia says is necessary to wipe
out rebels it classifies as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Russia angrily objected to a Chechen envoy's visit to the State
Department this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The conflicts in both Yugoslavia and Chechnya have sparked substantial
tension between Washington and Moscow, along with Russia's objections to U.S.
proposals to modify the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and Russian worries about
NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia and NATO agreed this week to resume bilateral contacts, which had
been virtually frozen since last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington on Friday, President Clinton told visiting Security Council
Secretary Sergey Ivanov that Russia must look for a peaceful end to its conflict
with Chechnya. Clinton also expressed concern over the humanitarian impact of
the conflict, said Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the White House National
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, apparently aiming to improve relations, said in a message to Clinton
on Friday that U.S.-Russian relations were a top foreign policy priority,
Russian news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The strategic goals of Russia and the United States coincide, for the most
part,'' the message said, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A great deal of irritability and mutual criticism has cropped up lately in
the Russian-American dialogue,'' the report quoted Putin's message as saying.
``And yet, the most vital thing has been preserved -- understanding the
strategic importance of the two countries' cooperation for the world's fate in
the 21st century.''

<HEADLINE> Machu Picchu Cable Car Plan Opposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A special U.N. mission has come out against a proposal to
run cable car service through the remote, ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu.
</P>
<P>
	   The government-endorsed plan has faced international opposition from
scientists and conservationists who say overdevelopment of the 15th century
ruins could destroy its serene, isolated quality.
</P>
<P>
	   A special team of experts from the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization went last fall to inspect Machu Picchu, which sits atop a craggy
peak high in Peru's jungle-covered southern Andes, 310 miles southeast of the
capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
	   Their report, released to The Associated Press on Friday, said that ``no new
construction'' should be added to the 500-year-old stone city. It also
recommended reducing the scope of tourist services now available at the site,
which include the Machu Picchu Hotel, public bathrooms, a ticket office, and a
terrace bar.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from Peru's National Institute of Culture could not be reached for
comment, and telephone calls to Peru Cable Car S.A., which won the contract to
build and maintain the project, were not returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal to run cable cars from the village of Aguas Calientes to the
ruins atop the peak has been discussed since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   President Alberto Fujimori's government revived the plan as part of its push
to privatize the development and management of its most important tourist
destination.
</P>
<P>
	   Peru Cable Car S.A., part of a consortium that runs the hotel, was set to
build the 1.2-mile cable car two years ago. But construction was postponed under
pressure from UNESCO, which hinted it might remove the site from its World
Heritage list if the project went forward unchecked.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the 300,000 tourists who visit the ruins annually now take buses or
hike up a long, winding road to the peak, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Machu Picchu is believed to have been a center of religious ceremonies for
the Incas in the 15th and 16th centuries.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan: Ventura Should Fight  </HEADLINE>
   By ROCHELLE OLSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) -- Reform Party presidential contender Pat Buchanan
landed briefly in Minnesota on Friday to say Gov. Jesse Ventura should have
stayed and fought for the party's future rather than quit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe he has run away from a fight that would have been a good fight
for the people of Minnesota, a good fight on ideas and issues,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
	   He spoke at an airport hotel news conference during a short stop on his way
to North Dakota. In front of a dozen supporters, Buchanan said he had planned to
spend a lot of time in Minnesota, drawing national media, in a battle with
Ventura over the future and direction of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ventura severed ties to the national party a week before Buchanan's
visit and urged the state chapter to follow him and reclaim the Independence
Party label. In his parting shots, Ventura expressed dismay that Buchanan could
receive David Duke's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan called that an ``unjustified smear'' and dismissed Duke, a former
Ku Klux Klan leader, as an ``inconsequential figure in American politics
today.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have not sought his endorsement. We do not seek his endorsement and if
he gives us his endorsement, we do not want it,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Denver Friday for a speech, Ventura, a former Navy SEAL, said Buchanan
had no right to ask why he did not stay and fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To my best knowledge, he never served his country,'' Ventura said. ``If he
wants to talk about fighting ... has he ever stood a post, put his life in
another man's hands? How dare he talk to me about fighting in any way, shape, or
form.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last Saturday, national committee members ousted Chairman Jack Gargan, a
Ventura ally, and replaced him with Pat Choate, who was Perot's 1996 running
mate.
</P>
<P>
	   Choate this week informed the party's executive committee of plans to raise
more money and to convene a national issues meeting in an effort to rebuild the
Reform Party's image after the raucous, nationally televised meeting last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Lynchburg, Va., on Friday ordered Gargan to give the
court control of $2.5 million in Federal Election Commission funds until
arguments about who controls the party and its money can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Norman K. Moon, who has jurisdiction because the money
disappeared from a bank in Martinsville, said it is reasonable to believe that
Gargan and former party treasurer Ronn Young were illegally holding the funds,
and that Choate, would likely prevail as the head of the Reform Party. ``They
seem to be in the catbird's seat right now,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moon's order blocked Gargan from attempting to return the $2.5 million to
the FEC, saying money turned over to a government agency would be tough to get
back in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
	   Moon said he will decide who should control the FEC funds in March, when
hearings also are set in Lynchburg to decide who represents the party. The
hearings are slated for March 22-24.
</P>
<P>
	   The Minnesota Reform Party is likely to vote March 4 to break from the
national party. But Buchanan said he would return and fight to get on the ballot
as the Reform Party presidential candidate in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot understand the timing of the governor's decision to pull out at
this point,'' Buchanan said. ``I think the governor's voluntarily taken himself
out as a player.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for Ventura's assertion that the Reform Party is dysfunctional, Buchanan
said, ``Well, it's been functioning pretty well since Monday.''

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Sought in LA Killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors filed notice Friday that they will seek the
death penalty against a white supremacist charged with firing on a Jewish
community center and then killing a postman.
</P>
<P>
	   With Attorney General Janet Reno's permission, U.S. Attorney Alejandro
Mayorkas filed the notice under seal.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense is expected to argue that diminished mental capacity makes
Buford O. Furrow ineligible for execution. His trial is set for Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Furrow was indicted on hate crimes in the wounding of three boys, a teen-age
girl and a receptionist at the North Valley Jewish Community Center and the
killing of Filipino-American letter carrier Joseph Ileto several miles away on
Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   When Furrow was arraigned Monday, innocent pleas were entered by the judge.
Prosecutors then said a decision about the death penalty would be left to Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's her decision alone,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Gennaco.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Public Defender Sean Kennedy, one of Furrow's lawyers, didn't
immediately return telephone messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Court Judge Richard Paez earlier refused a request from
Furrow's lawyers seeking access to internal documents the government used to
decide the death penalty issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those documents were reports on Furrow's alleged history of mental
illness. The defense is expected to include a claim that Furrow, of Olympia,
Wash., has a long history of mental illness and was not in his right mind at the
time of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   The deadline for filing motions challenging death penalty statutes is April
24.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   A storm spread snow, sleet and thunderstorms across the Midwest and
Northeast on Friday, giving many students a day off from school and frustrating
travelers with flight delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
	   Many students across the region enjoyed a longer than expected Presidents
Day holiday weekend as schools closed or dismissed early.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm brought 9 inches of snow to parts of Iowa, Nebraska and northern
Illinois, where 54,000 customers temporarily lost power. More than 8 inches fell
on southern Wisconsin and up to 6 inches in parts of Michigan. A snow emergency
was declared in Milwaukee and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   As the storm stretched east to New England, some areas of Massachusetts had
nearly 6 inches of snow, and up to 4 inches fell in southern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was blamed for the deaths of a Virginia couple killed in a
multivehicle accident in Harrisburg, Pa., where 3 inches fell early in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow was coming down, visibility was bad and it was slippery,''
Pennsylvania state Trooper Linette Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm was over southern Indiana and Ohio Friday night and moving east.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wisconsin, Greg Olson was shoveling the sidewalk outside the Tenney Plaza
on Madison's Capitol Square. He said the snow was a nice change of pace -- if
only he could enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I was a kid I would have a ball in it, but seeing that I have to work
in it, I'm going to be one sore puppy tonight,'' said Olson, 49.
</P>
<P>
	   In Detroit, Mayor Dennis Archer said the city was prepared to plow all
neighborhood streets for the first time in decades. His administration came
under sharp criticism when a winter storm created citywide gridlock in January
1999. Since then, Detroit has significantly boosted its snow-removal budget and
brought in dozens of new plows.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the Midwest and Northeast, American Airlines and American Eagle
canceled more than 900 flights. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport,
United Airlines canceled 250 flights. Northwest Airlines canceled 216 flights
scheduled to arrive or depart from its Detroit-area hub.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, there were scattered cancellations at New York's JFK
International Airport, and numerous cancellations and delays at LaGuardia
Airport. New York City picked up at least 3 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty flights were canceled at Newark International Airport, said Alan
Hicks, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. At Boston's
Logan International Airport, 125 flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   Other airports, such as Philadelphia International, felt the ripple of
delays and cancellations because of the problems elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy rain showers were seen south of the snow showers across portions of
Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Thunderstorms rolled through West Virginia's Kanawha Valley, while freezing
rain pelted the Eastern Panhandle. Toni McCarty, owner of D&AMP;D Cleaners in
Keyser, W.Va., said roads were ice-covered and treacherous.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a solid sheet of ice,'' McCarty said. ``It's nasty out. I haven't
seen any street cleaners going by. ... The side streets haven't been touched.
</P>
<P>
	   Tornadoes were reported in Arkansas, in Benton and near Owensville, but only
minor injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   High winds and rain in Tennessee destroyed a mobile home and downed some
power lines and trees, but no injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Foreign Deficit Shrinking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's deficit in current accounts plunged to a
three-year low in January, as a currency devaluation continued to benefit
foreign trade, the country's Central Bank said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   A country's current account reflects its trade with other countries along
with financial flows such as tourism and investment. Ideally, the account would
be positive, or at least in balance.
</P>
<P>
	   The January deficit dropped to $929 million, cutting the deficit for the
previous 12 months to $23 billion, the lowest since February, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   A 30 percent devaluation of the Brazilian currency, the real, since January
1999 has helped boost Brazilian exports, improving the country's trade balance.
</P>
<P>
	   The economic recovery has brought foreign investors back, and the Central
Bank said that foreign direct investment in January totaled $3.01 billion,
nearly triple the $1.01 billion in the same month last year.

<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A court on Friday sentenced 124 members of an Islamic
brotherhood to between two and four years in prison for calling for an Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were arrested in 1996 after holding a demonstration outside
of Ankara's main mosque, where they shouted insults against Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk, the founder of secular Turkey, and called for an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
	   The men, all members of the Aczmendi group, were initially sentenced to up
to four years in prison in April 1997. An appeals court ordered a new trial in
1998 because a judge who had earlier withdrawn from the case later took part in
deliberations on the verdict. It wasn't clear why he had withdrawn from the case
to start with.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the brotherhood wear religious dress and turbans in violation of
a 1925 ban on Islamic attire.

rescue effort along a swollen creek outside Charleston, W.Va., leaving one
person dead and two missing. Four others were rescued.
</P>
<P>
	   The winter storm stretched from the Midwest to the Northeast, giving
students a longer than expected Presidents Day holiday weekend as schools closed
or dismissed early.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm brought 9 inches of snow to parts of Iowa, Nebraska and northern
Illinois, where 54,000 customers temporarily lost power. More than 8 inches fell
on southern Wisconsin and up to 6 inches in parts of Michigan and Pennsylvania.
A snow emergency was declared in Milwaukee and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Some areas of Massachusetts had nearly 6 inches of snow, and up to 4 inches
fell in southern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was blamed for the deaths of a Virginia couple killed in a
multivehicle accident in Harrisburg, Pa., where 3 inches fell early in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow was coming down, visibility was bad and it was slippery,''
Pennsylvania state Trooper Linette Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm was over southern Indiana and Ohio Friday night. It was expected
to continue to push eastward, with snow continuing Saturday in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wisconsin, Greg Olson was shoveling the sidewalk outside the Tenney Plaza
on Madison's Capitol Square. He said the snow was a nice change of pace -- if
only he could enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I was a kid I would have a ball in it, but seeing that I have to work
in it, I'm going to be one sore puppy tonight,'' said Olson, 49.
</P>
<P>
	   In Detroit, Mayor Dennis Archer said the city was prepared to plow all
neighborhood streets for the first time in decades. His administration came
under sharp criticism when a winter storm created citywide gridlock in January
1999. Since then, Detroit has significantly boosted its snow-removal budget and
brought in dozens of new plows.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the Midwest and Northeast, American Airlines and American Eagle
canceled more than 900 flights. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport,
United Airlines canceled 250 flights. Northwest Airlines canceled 216 flights
scheduled to arrive or depart from its Detroit-area hub.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, there were scattered cancellations at New York's JFK
International Airport, and numerous cancellations and delays at LaGuardia
Airport. New York City picked up at least 3 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty flights were canceled at Newark International Airport, said Alan
Hicks, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. At Boston's
Logan International Airport, 125 flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   Other airports, such as Philadelphia International, felt the ripple of
delays and cancellations because of the problems elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Thunderstorms brought more than 2 inches of rain to parts of West Virginia
while freezing rain pelted the state's Eastern Panhandle. Toni McCarty, owner of
D&AMP;D Cleaners in Keyser, W.Va., said roads were ice-covered and treacherous.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a solid sheet of ice,'' McCarty said. ``It's nasty out. I haven't
seen any street cleaners going by. ... The side streets haven't been touched.
</P>
<P>
	   Tornadoes were reported in Arkansas, in Benton and near Owensville, but only
minor injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   High winds and rain in Tennessee destroyed a mobile home and downed some
power lines and trees, but no injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Loses $1.3B Air Force Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Boeing Co. lost options to complete a $1.3 billion
project to build 33 global positioning satellites for the Air Force in a
decision that could cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing will be allowed to build as many as 12 of the satellites, but others
will be put out for competitive bidding, the Air Force said in a statement
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the terms of the 1997 deal, the Air Force agreed to buy six satellites
from Boeing and held options for another 27.
</P>
<P>
	   The satellite system is used for navigation by military aircraft, ships,
land forces and smart weapons. Signals from the satellites also are used by
civilians to determine location.
</P>
<P>
	   The Air Force decided to re-bid the contract because of a need to update the
satellites with new technologies that have emerged since Boeing was hired to do
the work, according to a statement released through the Space and Missile
Systems Center at Los Angeles Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
	   Those new technologies would include the capability to override enemy
jamming signals.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not trying to save money, we're just trying to make sure the most
advanced method for global positioning is utilized," said Lt. Colleen Lehne, a
spokeswoman for the center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Air Force was pleased with Boeing's work to date. "Boeing's performance
has been exceptional," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing is expected to bid on the project again, along with Lockheed Martin
and Loral Space &AMP; Communications.
</P>
<P>
	   An analyst said the Air Force's decision may have been prompted not by
technology, but by a desire to shore up Lockheed Martin's satellite business. A
call to the company's Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Missiles &AMP; Space Division after
business hours Friday rang unanswered.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's really no reason to re-compete this project because you want to put
an anti-jamming capability on it," said Stuart McCutchen, publisher of Defense
Mergers &AMP; Acquisitions newsletter.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Air Force has said they're delighted with Boeing's work to date, and I
believe them, so what does it come down to?" he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing executives declined to comment beyond issuing a brief statement that
suggested it intends to be among the bidders for the remainder of the
project.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) -- A man wanted on U.S. drug trafficking charges
was jailed Friday in his native St. Kitts and denied bail on charges of
possessing drugs and firearms.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles ``Little Nut'' Miller is wanted by the United States on a 1995
indictment charging him with smuggling more than 1,000 tons of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Police and soldiers stopped and searched a car driven by Miller, and found
two firearms, 100 rounds of ammunition and a small amount of marijuana, police
said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller and two others in the car were charged with possession of firearms
and drugs. They were refused bail.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, U.S. officials accused Miller of threatening to kill U.S. students
at St. Kitts' Ross University if he was ordered extradited. A magistrate has
twice blocked his extradition, but the country's High Court recently ordered the
case reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller, whose former name is Cecil Connor, was already out on $40,000 bail
in another case, in which he was charged with shooting at a local farmer during
an argument. The farmer was not hit.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two new South Carolina polls say GOP presidential
campaigner George W. Bush has an advantage over John McCain, based largely on
strength among the core Republicans he has been pursuing. Bush was ahead of
McCain by 52 percent to 40 percent in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll and had a 44

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Balloons to New High  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit widened by more than $100 billion
last year, reaching a record of $271.3 billion, the government said Friday. The
booming U.S. economy pushed up demand for foreign goods, and the cost of
imported oil more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department also reported trade deficits with Japan, China,
Canada, Mexico and the 15-nation European Union all set records in 1999. The
overall deficit rose by 65 percent from the previous record, 1998's imbalance of
$164.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade deficit narrowed a slight 5.7 percent to $25.5 billion in December
as exports climbed by a solid 3.2 percent to outpace a 1 percent gain in
imports.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, U.S. exports were up 2.7 percent to $958.5 billion, an
improvement from an export decline of 0.5 percent in 1998. But this small gain
was swamped by a 12 percent rise in imports, which soared to $1.23 trillion last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration drew comfort from the fact that export sales are
beginning to bounce back as overseas nations recover from the steep recessions
brought on by the 1997-98 global currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   "Continued economic recovery abroad has spurred our exports in late 1999,
particularly in December. If this trend continues, it bodes well for our trade
balance," said Commerce Department chief economist Lee Price.
</P>
<P>
	   But opponents of President Clinton's trade policy pointed to the
back-to-back record annual deficits as evidence that the administration's trade
strategies are not working to open export markets or protect U.S. workers from a
flood of cheap imports. Critics pointed out that despite the overall economic
boom, manufacturing lost 341,000 jobs in 1999 alone.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we let our trade deficit continue to skyrocket in 2000, we're likely to
see more job losses," warned Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   America's trade gap is certain to be a debating point when Congress takes up
Clinton's request to grant China normal trade relations on a permanent basis in
exchange for China's pledge to lower its high barriers to U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the big rise in the deficit was led by a 33.7 percent jump
in oil import costs from $49.1 billion in 1988 to $65.7 billion in 1999, a
reflection of the nearly tripling of world oil prices during the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase was totally reflected in a huge jump in domestic oil prices.
After a big drop in world oil prices in 1998, a reflection of slumping demand,
crude oil rose from $9.19 per barrel last January to $22.67 per barrel in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts predicted more bad news on this front as the spot crude oil price
topped $30 this week for the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   As U.S. farmers and manufacturers suffered from the loss of overseas markets
brought on by 1997-98 global financial crisis, U.S. consumers reaped the benefit
of a flood of cheaper goods coming into this market, which has helped hold down
inflation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers,
declared that the "worst should be over by midyear" in terms of widening
deficits.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the world economy picking up speed, ... it will actually be possible
to achieve an export boom in 2001 and beyond," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   By country, the United States suffered its largest deficit with the
perennial front-runner, Japan, a record imbalance of $73.9 billion, up 15.5
percent from a $64 billion deficit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The deficit with China was close behind at $68.7 billion, an increase of
14.6 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other record deficits were with Canada, at $32.1 billion; Mexico, $22.8
billion; and the 15-nation European Union, $43.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the higher oil bill, America's rising trade deficit reflected
an increase in the imbalance of imports over exports for cars and trucks, up $25
billion, and computers and office machines, up $7.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Reformists Favored in Iranian Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranians' frustration with restrictions on everything
from what they wear to what they can say has been building, and they had a
chance to express it at the ballot box Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Reformists were expected to take the edge away from conservatives in
Friday's parliamentary elections, opening the way for a more liberal society and
more personal freedoms after two decades of hard-line Islamic rule. First
results were expected Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran has little capacity for compiling voter turnout figures. But state-run
Tehran radio said turnout was high, which analysts had said would favor
reformists. Long lines began forming outside polling booths in mosques and
schools within an hour after polls opened Friday morning, and voting was
extended two extra hours in the evening to deal with the crowds.
</P>
<P>
	   As lines of voters snaked down Iran's streets, the deep divisions between
the nation's Islamic traditionalists and pro-Western reformers were evident in
the very clothes the voters wore.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionalists appeared wrapped in turbans or -- for women -- draped in the
traditional black head-to-toe covering. But neckties were also in evidence, and
more than a few women sported more modern dress and had hair poking out from
under their head scarves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, anybody will know who we are voting for. We are of course voting for
candidates who support (President Mohammad) Khatami,'' said Barbod Babak, 23,
one of five friends who wore neckties to cast their votes in a wealthy Tehran
neighborhood. ``These are very important elections for us. We are fighting for
our future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ties and other Western dress were declared un-Islamic after the 1979 Islamic
Revolution, but they started to reappear after Khatami started his campaign in
1997 to grant social freedoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami's landslide presidential victory that year shook the hard-line
clergy. But his reform campaign was blocked by a recalcitrant parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope today's election will be one of the most glorious, historical
moments of our nation,'' Khatami said after casting his ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if they win in parliament, though, reformers would face the
hard-liners' domination of many of the most powerful government bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative Guardians Council must approve all legislation passed by
parliament, and Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has final say in
all matters. The hard-liners also control the judiciary and other key
institutions like the radio and television and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   About 5,800 candidates, including 424 women, are vying for the 290 seats in
the Majlis, or parliament. About 38.7 million of Iran's 62 million people were
eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency said Friday that final results could take
up to three weeks. The vote counting will be done by hand across the country --
a cumbersome process, especially in the capital, where there are 7 million
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Khamenei is the hard-liners' main backer. In a message broadcast over state
radio Friday, he said: ``This is a significant election and I want you to be
careful. Elect those who will be helpful to you and to Islam.''
</P>
<P>
	   But to the youth, most of them born after the Islamic revolution, its ideals
are no longer relevant. Even the staunch stance against ties with the United
States has its critics now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Revolution? I don't remember it, but I can see the consequences of it,''
said Naveed Saodati, a 23-year-old computer engineering student.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners have alienated many Iranians by trying to muzzle the press,
jailing those who criticize the ruling clergy, using the judiciary for political
vendettas and refusing to ease personal laws that dictate nearly every aspect of
life in Iran. Women must not show any part of the body except the face and hands
in public, they cannot sing in public, mixing of the sexes is illegal and
foreign television broadcasts are banned.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters are also concerned that jobs are scarce and the cost of living is
mounting.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of Iran's 62 million people are under the age of 25, and they
are the loudest voices for change. After a reformist newspaper was closed by
hard-liners last summer, tens of thousands of Tehran University students flooded
the streets for three days.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Iranians have expressed desire for change simply by supporting
reformist newspapers or turning out for peaceful campaign rallies.

	   A few eggs were thrown at police, but there were no major incidents reported
before the demonstration ended.
</P>
<P>
	   A new demonstration, supported by the Socialist and Green parties, as well
as Austrian unions and leftist youth organizations, is planned for Saturday.
Police expect about 100,000 participants, while organizers hope for as many as
250,000.

	   Since the Feb. 4 inauguration of the new Austrian government, which includes
the Freedom Party, there have been dozens of protests across Austria and Europe
to express opposition to both Haider's past praise of the Nazi era and his
party's anti-foreigner stance.

<P>
	   Austria's fellow European Union countries have reduced their ties it, and
Israel has withdrawn its ambassador.

<P>
	   In Greece, about 500 demonstrators gathered outside the Austrian embassy in
central Athens late Friday to protest the inclusion of Haider's party in
Austria's government.

	   Demonstrators chanted ``Keep fascism out of Europe,'' during the protest
organized by leftist groups. The rally ended peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Storm Dumps Snow, Causes Flooding  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA RAFFAELE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A storm spread snow and sleet across the Midwest and Northeast on Friday,
giving many students a day off from school and frustrating thousands of
travelers with flight delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
	   South of the snow showers, heavy rain fell across portions of Kentucky,
southern Indiana, southern Ohio, and West Virginia. A boat capsized during a
rescue effort along a swollen creek outside Charleston, W.Va., leaving one
person dead and two presumed dead. Four others were rescued.
</P>
<P>
	   The winter storm gave students a longer than expected Presidents Day holiday
weekend as schools closed or dismissed early.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm brought 9 inches of snow to parts of Iowa, Nebraska and northern
Illinois, where 54,000 customers temporarily lost power. More than 8 inches fell
on southern Wisconsin and up to 6 inches in parts of Michigan and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Four inches of snow fell in some parts of northern Ohio while the southern
end of the state was pounded with heavy rains, forcing the closure of roads in
at least 10 counties.
</P>
<P>
	   As the storm moved east, New York's Adirondacks got a foot of snow. Some
areas of Massachusetts had nearly 6 inches of snow, and up to 4 inches fell in
southern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was blamed for the deaths of a Virginia couple killed in a
multivehicle accident in Harrisburg, Pa., where 3 inches fell early in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow was coming down, visibility was bad and it was slippery,''
Pennsylvania state Trooper Linette Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm was over southern Indiana and Ohio Friday night and expected to
continue to push eastward, with snow continuing Saturday in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wisconsin, Greg Olson was shoveling the sidewalk outside the Tenney Plaza
on Madison's Capitol Square. He said the snow was a nice change of pace -- if
only he could enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I was a kid I would have a ball in it, but seeing that I have to work
in it, I'm going to be one sore puppy tonight,'' said Olson, 49.
</P>
<P>
	   In Detroit, Mayor Dennis Archer said the city was prepared to plow all
neighborhood streets for the first time in decades. His administration came
under sharp criticism when a winter storm created citywide gridlock in January
1999. Since then, Detroit has significantly boosted its snow-removal budget and
brought in dozens of new plows.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the Midwest and Northeast, American Airlines and American Eagle
canceled more than 900 flights. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport,
United Airlines canceled 250 flights. Northwest Airlines canceled 216 flights
scheduled to arrive or depart from its Detroit-area hub.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, there were scattered cancellations at New York's JFK
International Airport, and numerous cancellations and delays at LaGuardia
Airport. New York City picked up at least 3 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Flights were also canceled at airports in Newark, N.J., Philadelphia and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Thunderstorms brought more than 2 inches of rain to parts of West Virginia
while freezing rain pelted the state's Eastern Panhandle. Toni McCarty, owner of
D&AMP;D Cleaners in Keyser, W.Va., said roads were ice-covered and treacherous.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a solid sheet of ice,'' McCarty said. ``It's nasty out. I haven't
seen any street cleaners going by. ... The side streets haven't been touched.
</P>
<P>
	   Tornadoes were reported in Arkansas, in Benton and near Owensville. At least
eight people were injured and homes in a path from central Arkansas to the
Mississippi Delta were damaged. Golf-bowl sized hail was reported in the Little
Rock area.
</P>
<P>
	   High winds and rain in Tennessee destroyed a mobile home and downed some
power lines and trees, but no injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> P.G. Wodehouse Books Fetch $110,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A rare library of first-edition books by the late writer P.G.
Wodehouse sold for the equivalent of $110,000 at auction Friday, exceeding the
predicted total of $66,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans purchased four of the top 10 items in the sale, which included 67
lots, the auction house Christie's said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those sold to the unidentified U.S. buyers was ``Not George
Washington,'' a novel Wodehouse co-wrote in 1907. The novel sold for $4,550. A
pair of books -- ``Leave it to Psmith'' and ``Enter Psmith'' -- were sold for
the same amount to another U.S. collector.
</P>
<P>
	   Wodehouse's first adult novel, ``Love Among the Chickens,'' published in
1906, was sold for the equivalent of $5,000 -- the highest price paid for any
item in the sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his most well-known creations were the butler character Jeeves and his
master, Wooster. The collection was amassed over 25 years by private a
collector, said Nicholas Worskett, head of books at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
	   The collection included a 1930 edition of ``Right Ho, Jeeves,'' and a 1934
copy of ``Very Good, Jeeves,'' which was auctioned for $2,800.
</P>
<P>
	   Wodehouse was born in Britain, but set up home in United States after World
War II and became an American citizen in 1955. He died in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 107, Magic 99 OT  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal's steal and dunk tied the score in
the closing seconds of regulation and the All-Star center scored seven of his 39
points in overtime to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 107-99 victory over the
Orlando Magic on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal went 15-for-22 from the field and was 9-for-13 from the foul line,
while grabbing 16 rebounds and blocking three shots against his former team,
which led 88-86 before O'Neal made the defensive play of the night to send the
game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was the sixth straight for the Lakers, who improved the NBA's
best road record to 17-7. Orlando, which had won nine of 11 to pull within one
game of .500 for the first time in six weeks, had its winning streak stopped at
five.
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Rice had 26 points for the Lakers. Kobe Bryant was limited to 11 points
on 4-for-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Darrell Armstrong led Orlando with 24 points, Michael Doleac had 16 and Pat
Garrity 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers turned the ball over twice in the final minute of regulation
before O'Neal knocked away Ron Mercer's inbounds pass intended for Doleac near
midcourt, chased down the loose ball and scored on a dunk to tie the game at 88
with 14.5 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Doleac's shot bounced off the rim at the buzzer, sending it into overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal's three-point play gave the Lakers a 93-92, and his turnaround
jumpers on consecutive possessions put Los Angeles ahead for good midway through
the extra period.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers showed no adverse effects from playing for the third time in four
nights, shooting 60 percent in the opening quarter en route to a 53-46 halftime
lead. O'Neal led the way with 22 points, making 9-of-14 from the field and
4-for-6 from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic did a better job defensively against the league's No. 2 scorer in
the third quarter, using double teams to force him to look for open teammates.
O'Neal took only two shots in the period, scoring three points, as the Lakers'
lead shrank to 68-66 going into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando pulled even for the first time since midway through the first
quarter when Garrity's 3-pointer made it 86-86 with 45 seconds left in
regulation. Armstrong's layup gave the Magic their first lead since 10-9 before
O'Neal regained control of the game.

Officials said they fed Mariano Faget phony information about a pending
defection and then caught him passing it on just 12 minutes later to a contact

Miami office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, may have been

boy to a new temporary custodian in Miami on grounds that would be too
disruptive. The INS said that it was continuing to press in federal court for
Elian's return to his father in Cuba. But the agency said "transferring Elian
temporarily to a new and unfamiliar environment would not be advisable for the
child after already experiencing the trauma of leaving his home in Cuba and
losing his mother."

<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Rookie Jochen Hecht scored the go-ahead goal as the
St. Louis Blues beat the Nashville Predators 2-1 and set a team record with
their seventh straight road win Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Hecht, who missed 13 games with a sprained ankle, added an assist for St.
Louis, which has won nine of 10 overall. The Blues, the NHL's top road team at
19-8-2, outshot Nashville 33-17.
</P>
<P>
	   Blues goalie Roman Turek, who made 16 saves for his 30th win, stopped Drake
Berehowsky on a slap shot with 5.6 seconds left as the Predators lost their six
straight.
</P>
<P>
	   Hecht snapped a 1-1 tie with 3:02 left in the second period. Stephane Richer
took advantage of a giveaway by Nashville defenseman Bob Boughner and set up
Hecht, who was wide open in the left circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville's Cliff Ronning got the only goal of the first period on a
give-and-go with Kimmo Timonen. Ronning skated up the middle and dished to
Timonen, who fed back to Ronning in the slot for a one-timer that whistled by
Turek.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal was the 20th of the season for Ronning, marking the eighth time in
his NHL career that he has reached that plateau.
</P>
<P>
	   Marty Reasoner's power-play goal tied the game 10:53 into the second.
Reasoner fired the puck over Tomas Vokoun after Chris Pronger's slap shot went
wide and Hecht found Reasoner in front.
</P>
<P>
	   Blues defenseman Al MacInnis, last year's Norris Trophy winner, missed his
third straight game with a back injury. Timonen, Nashville's All-Star
defenseman, returned after missing 15 games due to a broken wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis has not lost on the road since a 3-1 loss in Pittsburgh on Jan.

<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Luc Robitaille's tiebreaking goal early in the third period
lifted the Los Angeles Kings to their fifth straight win Friday night, 3-2 over
the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kings ended Detroit's four-game winning streak. Red Wings star Sergei
Fedorov injured his right hand and bruised a knee when he was checked into the
boards by Bob Corkum in the second period and did not return to the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Robitaille scored his 30th goal 1:44 into the third period by wristing a
shot from the left circle through the legs of Chris Osgood, breaking a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
	   Ian Laperriere and Glen Murray also scored for the Kings, who have won the
first two games of a seven-city road trip. Los Angeles has won seven of its last
eight and eight of 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Yzerman and Vyacheslav Kozlov scored for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Robitaille has five goals in his last four games and at least one point in
eight straight. Zigmund Palffy and Jozef Stumpel had assists on Robitaille's
goal, giving their line 45 points in the Kings' last eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephane Fiset made 33 saves in the Kings goal and Osgood stopped 20 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Yzerman scored the only goal of the first period. With the Red Wings skating
5-on-3, Yzerman, who went 11 games without a goal before scoring two Wednesday
against Vancouver, shot through traffic from the right circle and beat Fiset.
</P>
<P>
	   Laperriere and Murray scored goals 54 seconds apart to give the Kings a 2-1
lead early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   Laperriere broke in with a pass Donald Audette and beat Osgood from
point-blank range at 4:01, then Murray scored on a breakaway at 4:55.
</P>
<P>
	   Kozlov scored to make it 2-all at the 9:25 mark.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Rod Grams' Son Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANOKA, Minn. (AP) -- The son of Sen. Rod Grams pleaded guilty Friday to a
misdemeanor marijuana charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Morgan Grams was stopped in July in a borrowed rental vehicle after his
father called the Anoka County sheriff for help finding his son. A deputy found
10 bags of marijuana and several beer cans in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   But Grams, 21, was not initially questioned about the items, leading to
questions about whether he had received special treatment because of his
father's position.
</P>
<P>
	   Grams was sentenced to four days he had already served and remains in
custody on a separate felony charge.
</P>
<P>
	   He is awaiting the chance to post $50,000 bail for testing positive for
cocaine and marijuana. He was charged last year with car theft, check fraud and
transaction card fraud. Under the terms of his release on those charges, he was
supposed to remain drug-free.
</P>
<P>
	   Grams was also charged in a vandalism incident at a convenience store last
month.

<HEADLINE> Feds OK DNA Test of Oldest Skeleton  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK JEWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Despite the objections of Indian tribes, the federal
government said Friday that DNA testing of one of the oldest skeletons found on
the North American continent will go forward.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 31, the Interior Department announced a preliminary decision to
conduct the tests to try to pinpoint the origin of Kennewick Man, who is more
than 9,000 years old and an early Native American.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's final decision follows days of discussions involving
representatives from five tribes and officials from the Interior Department, the
Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Experts we have consulted on ancient DNA analysis have pointed out that
the procedures will be complex and time-consuming and may not provide conclusive
data,'' said Francis McManamon, chief consulting archaeologist for the Interior
Department. ``We feel, however, that it is worth the effort in this case because
of its peculiar circumstances to try to obtain genetic information.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, one of the tribes that
claims Kennewick Man is an ancestor, criticized the decision. The tribes want
the bones reburied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The repercussions of this decision ripple beyond Native Americans and
affect any group or individual hoping to achieve justice in the face of
political pressure or tantalizing hype,'' said Colleen Cawston, chairwoman for
the Colvilles.
</P>
<P>
	   The Eastern Washington tribe maintains DNA testing would fail to shed any
new light on Kennewick Man's ancestry.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Interior Department recently classified the bones as American
Indian, the agency says DNA tests might help conclusively bury theories that the
bones are of European or African ancestry.
</P>
<P>
	   The collection of 380 bones and skeletal fragments known as Kennewick Man
was found in the shallows of the Columbia River in 1996. Radiocarbon analysis
determined that the bones are between 9,320 and 9,510 years old.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sam Osman, the founder of Job Lot Trading, an emporium with
an unpredictable mix of ultracheap merchandise, died Tuesday. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
	   Once a pushcart salesman on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Osman went on to
found a business on what he once called ``other people's mistakes.'' Those
mistakes were then transformed into potentially attractive merchandise by
tagging them with low prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Opened in 1950, the shrine to impulsive shopping offered customers the
attraction of mystery. On any given day, bargains might range from fishing poles
to perfume, toboggan wax to musical piggy banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on Vesey Street near City Hall in lower Manhattan, Osman then opened
The Pushcart store next door. In 1967, he moved the two stores to a nearby
corner where he had connected four buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   He sold his business in the early 1980s. In 1993, the store was closed.

<P>
	   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Gary Swan, a sports writer for the San Francisco
Chronicle, died Thursday while on assigment to report on the Daytona 500 car
race. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
	   Swan was found dead in his hotel room, apparently of natural causes. The
medical examiner's office in Daytona Beach said it would investigate the cause
of death.
</P>
<P>
	   Swan covered the San Francisco 49ers football team for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   He joined the Chronicle in 1981 as a news reporter, then switched to sports
writing in 1989. He wrote more than 2,500 articles for the Chronicle, including
ones about women's college basketball, professional hockey and San Francisco
Giants baseball games.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the Chronicle, Swan worked as a news reporter for four years at the
San Jose Mercury News. He also worked at the Worcester (Mass.) Telegram &AMP;
Gazette and the New Haven (Conn.) Journal Courier.
</P>
<P>
	   Swan is survived by his wife, Lenora; and two sons.

<HEADLINE> China Adjusts to New Market Rules  </HEADLINE>
    By ELAINE KURTENBACH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- The Year of the Dragon got off to a roaring start as China's
securities regulators feted the Lunar New Year with new rules intended to boost
the markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Share prices hit record highs Monday, the first trading day after the new
year holiday, on news that brokerages would be allowed to borrow from banks
using stocks as collateral and that investors in secondary markets would be
given the right to buy initial offerings of stock before they begin to trade.
</P>
<P>
	   The initial euphoria was punctured, however, by reports this week of plans
for several new share offerings -- news that revived fears the government might
allow a flood of stocks to swamp the market as it tries to raise capital to pay
for reforms of state-owned industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Share prices ended sharply lower Thursday and market indicators for foreign
investors stumbled, with the Shanghai index down 3.91 percent at 39.32 and the
Shenzhen B-share index off 1.60 percent at 87.85. They rose slightly Friday, but
the week's earlier gains had for the most part vanished.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators "are ignoring the rules and laws of the market because they think
they can rule the market. They cannot," said Shawn Xu, an economist with the
investment house China International Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have very good intentions, but unfortunately this is not the right
thing to do."
</P>
<P>
	   For several years now, every time the government has sought to build up the
market in hopes of making it easier for cash-starved, state-owned firms to raise
capital, the attempts have backfired.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators have tended to follow cycles, moving to curb volatility when
prices surge, fearing a speculative bubble, and then struggling to encourage
investment when trading lags. Average share prices have soared more than 24
percent since the beginning of this year, aided by market-bolstering moves over
the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, more than half of the 900-odd listed companies traded by domestic
investors rose as much as regulations allowed while trading volume soared.
</P>
<P>
	   The government then relaxed previous limits that had required a half-day
trading halt after a stock had risen the maximum amount allowed for three
consecutive days. The latest changes permit continued trading of hot stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Under rules set in 1996, local shares were not allowed to fluctuate more
than 10 percent from their previous day's close while shares of companies that
had two consecutive years of losses were limited to 5 percent fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
	   This week's change did not apply to shares that have hit their daily loss
limits. Also exempted were companies with two consecutive years of losses and
firms that have issued loss warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the measures appear likely to ensure the market gyrates with the
unpredictability the Chinese zodiac says is typical of the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
	   "The volatility will still be there. It is really a speculative market,"
said Charles M.L. Cheung, vice president for Asia Pacific Equity Research for
Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheung said he expects the government to continue to introduce reforms to
stimulate the market. Enthusiasm over fast-growing Internet and other high-tech
companies also may help boost prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, the outlook for China's stock markets is overshadowed by poor earnings
and expectations of a steady stream of new share offerings that could soak up
all liquidity, the official newspaper China Economic Times cautioned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given both favorable factors and unfavorable factors, our verdict is that
the foundation isn't stable for a full year bull market," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This year, as long as regulators don't change their thinking, the pressure
from share expansion will be like a sword hanging constantly over the markets."
</P>
<P>
	   The key problem for China's unruly markets is a lack of good investments,
said Xu of China International Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   China's publicly traded companies are in the process of announcing full-year
results for 1999 and the number of businesses with losses for the entire year is
expected to be well above the 89 out of some 900 that posted losses in their
mid-term reports last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's exactly because people are not sure of the quality of the companies
being listed that they worry. The core issue is how to change the management of
state-owned enterprises and improve their efficiency," Xu said.

<HEADLINE> Gold Miner Told Not to Use Cyanide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- The Guyanese government has ordered a gold miner
to stop using cyanide on a test project until officials are convinced he can use
the chemical safely.
</P>
<P>
	   Willmot Chan, a prominent local miner, has been running a project for two
months at his mine in western Guyana to extract gold from ore using cyanide,
officials said. The local Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday it had
ordered him to stop until a permit is issued.
</P>
<P>
	   Chan said he has resumed his mining operations using mercury instead.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision by the South American country's government had no apparent link
to a cyanide spill two weeks ago at a Romanian gold mine. That spill flowed into
the Tisza and Danube rivers, spreading into Hungary, Yugoslavia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
	   In August 1995 in Guyana, an Omai Gold Mines holding pond for
cyanide-treated mining waste broke. More than 800 million gallons of waste
spilled into the nearby Omai and Essequibo rivers, killing much of the marine
life.
</P>
<P>
	   The government declared the area in western Guyana an environmental disaster
zone and banned about 20,000 people from using the river water for several
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Luge Controversial at Goodwill Games  </HEADLINE>
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- They were supposed to make the luge huge in the
Winter Goodwill Games. Instead, Georg Hackl, Markus Prock and Jens Mueller chose
not to slide in order to save their hide.
</P>
<P>
	So, what promised to be one of the premier events of these games instead became
something of a bust on Friday as five men withdrew from the race.
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're disappointed,'' Goodwill Games spokesman Jeff Pomeroy said.
``They're athletes that we featured in promotions. In a perfect world, the
competition would have gone on without incident.''
</P>
<P>
	The decision by three of the greatest sliders in history opened the door for
current World Cup champion Armin Zoeggeler of Italy, and he easily beat Jaroslav
Slavik of Slovakia for the gold. Gerhard Gleirscher of Austria edged Adam Heidt
of the United States for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel my colleagues not racing diminishes my win,'' Zoeggeler said.
``I really like the track. It was up to every individual whether to start or
not. I decided to do the two runs, and I feel very good about it.''
</P>
<P>
	The three European stars said they didn't compete because of limited training
and safety concerns about the new track at Mount Van Hoevenberg, which was
completed in mid-January and officially opened only a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	``The decision not to race was an individual one,'' said Germany's Hackl, 33,
who has won the last three Olympic gold medals and plans to try for an
unprecedented fourth at Salt Lake City in 2002. ``During training, you can go
down the track heavily protected. Based on training, the equipment I brought
with me was not the right equipment to go down safely.''
</P>
<P>
	``I came with great expectations of sliding on this track,'' added Mueller, 34,
the current world champion who also won Olympic gold at Calgary in 1988. ``I had
problems maneuvering down the track and I could not envision bringing my sled
down with the runners and equipment I brought.''
</P>
<P>
	The track, which is nearly one mile long and cost $24 million, descends more
than 40 stories through its 20 curves. And it's no different than any other new
facility.
</P>
<P>
	``This is traditional. For every new track there are problems,'' said the
35-year-old Prock, an eight-time World Cup champion from Austria. ``I'm
convinced that changes need to take place for safety.''
</P>
<P>
	Those changes were mostly ice-related and easily remedied, officials said after
a meeting with the athletes.
</P>
<P>
	Friday's race was filled with plenty of spills -- three of the 15 sliders
competing fell off their sleds on the men's opening run -- but that sort of
thing happens in the sport and none of the mishaps was serious.
</P>
<P>
	``They made a decision, and I'm not going to debate what they did for their own
personal level,'' said Ron Rossi, director of USA Luge. ``If they thought it
wasn't safe, so be it. But I don't agree with it.''
</P>
<P>
	There was no quitting among the German women, and Sylke Otto, current World Cup
champion, won gold over Olympic champion Silke Kraushaar. But Otto, who won by
nearly a half-second, said there also had been talk of a pullout among the
women.
</P>
<P>
	``It was discussed, but there was no real consensus on whether to strike like
the men,'' Otto said. ``In the end, we decided to do the race, even though
conditions were a little difficult.''
</P>
<P>
	Conditions on Whiteface Mountain proved ideal for Ed Podivinsky. He won gold
for Canada in the second men's downhill, again spoiling the aspirations of the
vaunted Austrians.
</P>
<P>
	``I had the right combination today,'' said Podivinsky, who was sixth in
Thursday's race. ``I felt smoother. My skis weren't chattering.''
</P>
<P>
	The oft-injured Podivinsky, who missed last season with a knee injury, finished
in 1 minute, 49.21 seconds. Vincent Blanc of France, winner of the first
downhill, finished ninth, while Chris Puckett of the United States collected his
second straight silver.
</P>
<P>
	Among the five Austrians who made the trip, only Fritz Strobl made the podium,
copping bronze on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	Weather didn't affect the race, but snow began falling in mid-afternoon and
forecasters were calling for up to 10 inches by midday Saturday. However, with
the downhills completed, organizers were able to breathe a sigh of relief
because most of the remaining competition would not be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
	``Good will extends from the sky down,'' said Sandy Caligiore, spokesman for
the host Olympic Regional Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
	Two world records in short track speedskating fell at the swift feet of Evgenia
Radanova of Bulgaria. The 22-year-old Radanova, who won silver in the 1,000
meters on Thursday, skated Friday's 500-meter semifinal in 44.415 seconds to
break the world record held by Katia Zini of Italy. Radanova then became the
first woman to skate the 500 in less than 44 seconds, finishing in 43.875 to win
gold.
</P>
<P>
	In men's races, Francois-Louis Tremblay of Canada won his second and third
golds of the games, capturing the 1,000 meters and helping Canada to victory in
the 5,000-meter relay. The Chinese women won the 3,000-meter relay over Canada.
</P>
<P>
	And in men's halfpipe, Ross Powers beat out teammates Tommy Czeschin and Rob
Kingwill as the U.S. copped the top four spots.

</P>
<P>
	``Good will extends from the sky down,'' said Sandy Caligiore, spokesman for

</P>
<P>
	In ice dancing, Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev rallied to win the gold
medal over Mandy Woetzel and Ingo Steuer of Germany. Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd
Eisler, two-time Olympic bronze medalists from Canada, won bronze.
</P>
<P>
	The Russians, second to start the evening, completed a throw triple salchow and
a throw double salchow, with Woetzel ending the romantic number on the ice
looking up at him. They scored two 10s for artistry and had 9.9s across the
board for technique to win it with a score of 197.2.
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the program and I would have given them the same marks,'' Steuer said.
``It was incredible. After our marks, I said to Mandy, `We lost again, but we
lost on a very high level.'''
</P>
<P>
	In women's singles, France's Surya Bonaly gained the lead with a mistake-free
program that included five triple jumps and her signature backflip. She finished
tied with Yuka Sato of Japan with a score of 98.6, but won on her technical
total.
</P>
<P>
	Oksana Baiul, the 1994 Olympic champion from Ukraine, skated first and was
followed by Nancy Kerrigan, runnerup to Baiul at Lillehammer. Coincidentally,
each missed a triple lutz, but Baiul edged Kerrigan for third place with a score
of 97.3.
</P>
<P>
	Skating third, Katarina Witt seemed to steal the show at first. Moving to a
slow-paced, seductive song entitled ``Heart of Berlin'' that was written for
her, the two-time Olympic gold medalist from Germany hit a triple toe loop and
double axel and left to raucous applause, pausing to kiss the ice where she
landed the triple. But the judges gave her a mark of only 96.7, placing her in
sixth and eliciting a chorus of boos.
</P>
<P>
	Ageless Dorothy Hamill, her infectious smile lighting up the ice, performed a
smooth program. Hamill, gold medalist in 1976 at Innsbruck, hit two double jumps
and a delayed axel and was fifth.
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Elizabeth Manley, silver medalist at Calgary in 1988, slipped twice
and was seventh at 96.7.
</P>

	Two world records in short track speedskating fell at the swift feet of Evgenia
Radanova of Bulgaria. The 22-year-old Radanova, who won silver in the 1,000
meters on Thursday, skated Friday's 500-meter semifinal in 44.415 seconds to
break the world record held by Katia Zini of Italy. Radanova then became the

    DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Drake scored twice, including the go-ahead goal with
2:55 remaining, to lift the Phoenix Coyotes to a 4-3 victory over the Dallas
Stars on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Shane Doan also had two goals for the Coyotes, who moved two points behind
the first-place Stars in the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Modano's 25th goal tied it 3-3 for Dallas with 10:38 left, but Drake's
10th of the season beat Stars goalie Ed Belfour from the left circle for the
win.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix, avenging a 2-0 loss to Dallas on Feb. 3, is 2-3 in its last five,
while the Stars are 9-3 in their last 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Doan gave the Coyotes a 1-0 lead at 8:26 of the first period, as he stopped
a 10-game goal drought. Darryl Sydor tied it 1:07 later on a back-hander from
the slot.
</P>
<P>
	   Drake gave Phoenix a 2-1 advantage with his ninth goal at 17:29 of the
first.
</P>
<P>
	   Roman Lyashenko tied it at 2 for the Stars at 6:37 of the second on a
rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes took a 3-2 advantage with 5:13 left in the second when Doan
fired a wrist shot from the right circle into the top right corner.
</P>
<P>
	   Stars captain and top defenseman Derian Hatcher returned to the lineup after
missing 24 games with a calf injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas' league-leading penalty-killing unit shut out Phoenix on four
second-period power plays, including a two-man disadvantage for 1:25.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars were without Joe Nieuwendyk, Jere Lehtinen, Brian Skrudland and
Shawn Chambers, all sidelined by injuries. Jamie Langenbrunner also was
scratched due to neck soreness, and is day-to-day.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Reports to Release Services  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis reported to Maryland
correctional officials Friday and signed off on the conditions of his release
from a jail in Atlanta where he is charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, who left a Georgia jail Tuesday on $1 million bond, is under
indictment for the stabbing deaths of two men following a Super Bowl party in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland's corrections department has agreed to monitor Lewis' compliance
with the requirements of his release for Atlanta Judicial Circuit Pretrial
Services Division.
</P>
<P>
	   The All-Pro linebacker spent 45 minutes in Baltimore Circuit Court on
Friday, where he agreed to a number of conditions, including a curfew, travel
restrictions, random home visits and drug testing. Lewis also agreed to submit a
daily itinerary to corrections officials.
</P>
<P>
	   He was escorted by Baltimore Sheriff's deputies and went into the courthouse
through an employees-only entrance.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis' bond requires him to stay in Maryland unless he is traveling to
Georgia for court appearances or to meet with his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis returned to Maryland Thursday, and made a brief statement proclaiming
his innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   In Atlanta, defense lawyers requested a speedy trial, forcing prosecutors to
prepare for a trial that would start by June.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's automatic," Lewis lawyer Don Samuel said of the motion. "If we file it
and it's not tried by then, it's an acquittal."
</P>
<P>
	   With a quick trial, and an acquittal, Lewis could join the Ravens for the
start of football training camp in late July with no restrictions.
</P>
<P>
	   Legal experts said the motion reflected the defense team's confidence in its
case.
</P>
<P>
	   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he was considering asking a
judge to revoke Lewis' bond. He thinks Lewis violated the terms of his bond by
proclaiming his innocence at Thursday's news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel said a gag order imposed by the judge applies to lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that ever applies to a defendant, I'd be shocked," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 107, Magic 99 OT  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal wouldn't let the Los Angeles Lakers
lose.
</P>
<P>
	   The All-Star center's steal and dunk tied the score in the closing seconds
of regulation, then his seven points in overtime propelled the NBA's best road
team to a 107-99 victory over the Orlando Magic on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal went 15-for-22 from the field and was 9-for-13 from the foul line to
finish with 39 points. He also grabbed 16 rebounds and blocked three shots
against his former team, which led 88-86 before the NBA's second-leading scorer
made the defensive play of the night to send the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   "My new nickname is the Big Felon because of my stealing ability," O'Neal
said. "It was a sweet moment because we threw the ball away two times in a row.
Luckily, I got the steal and we won it in overtime."
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was the sixth straight for Los Angeles, which improved the NBA's
best road record to 17-7. Orlando, which had won nine of 11 to pull within one
game of .500 for the first time in six weeks, had its winning streak stopped at
five.
</P>
<P>
	   Magic coach Doc Rivers thought his team deserved a better fate after
spending much of the last three quarters fighting back from an 11-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Rice had 26 points for the Lakers. Kobe Bryant was limited to 11 points
on 4-for-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Darrell Armstrong led Orlando with 24 points, Michael Doleac had 16 and Pat
Garrity 13.
</P>
<P>
	   "They played so hard, and you just wanted them to win the game and not have
a moral victory. We had the moral victory with six minutes left (in
regulation)," Rivers said. "But you have to play 48 minutes. It came down to bad
execution of one play."
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers turned the ball over twice in the final minute of regulation
before O'Neal knocked away Ron Mercer's inbounds pass intended for Doleac near
midcourt, chased down the loose ball and scored on a dunk to tie the game at 88
with 14.5 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Doleac's shot bounced off the rim at the buzzer, sending it into overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew the other guys were going to pressure, and (Orlando) probably
figured I wasn't going to pressure," O'Neal said of the steal. "I knew he was
going to throw it and I went for it. I knocked it loose and just ran it down."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal's three-point play gave the Lakers a 93-92 lead, and his turnaround
jumpers on consecutive possessions put Los Angeles ahead for good midway through
the extra period.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers showed no adverse effects from playing for the third time in four
nights, shooting 60 percent in the opening quarter en route to a 53-46 halftime
lead. O'Neal led the way with 22 points, making 9-of-14 from the field and
4-for-6 from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic did a better job defensively against him in the third quarter,
using double teams to force him to look for open teammates. O'Neal took only two
shots in the period, scoring three points, and the Lakers led 68-66 going into
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando pulled even for the first time since midway through the first
quarter when Pat Garrity's 3-pointer made it 86-86 with 45 seconds left in
regulation. Armstrong's layup gave the Magic their first lead since 10-9 before
O'Neal regained control of the game.

<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Terry Yake's wraparound goal with 4:12 left led the
Washington Capitals to a 5-4 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Bondra scored twice, including the game-tying goal at 9:58 of the
third, and had an assist for Washington, which blew a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Simon had a goal and two assists for Washington, which is 5-1-1 in its
last seven and 15-2-2 in its last 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Gilmour, reported to be on the trading block, had a goal and two
assists for the Blackhawks, who have lost three straight and are 1-4-1 in their
last six.
</P>
<P>
	   After Bondra tied it 4-4 on a breakaway from center ice, Yake got the
game-winner when he circled the net and slid in a low shot that banked in off
Chicago goalie Jocelyn Thibault.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexei Zhamnov, Tony Amonte and Michael Nylander scored in a 4:10 span in
the third period to give Chicago a brief 4-3 lead. All three also had assists in
the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Simon opened the scoring 20 seconds into the game when he was left open at
the edge of the crease and converted his own rebound past Thibault.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilmour tied it at 1 on a power play with 3:28 left in the first. Olaf
Kolzig got a piece of Gilmour's one-timer with his glove, but the puck slipped
into the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Zednik and Bondra scored 1:20 apart midway through the second to
give the Capitals a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Zednik connected from the edge of the crease at 11:16 of the third to make
it 2-1 after Jan Bulis threaded a pass from behind the goal line. Bondra
extended Washington's lead to 3-1 at 12:36 on a low shot from the left circle
that fooled Thibault.
</P>
<P>
	   After a Washington turnover, Zhamnov slid his own rebound past Kolzig at
3:51 to make it 3-2. Amonte tied it 3-3 from the edge of the crease at 6:01,
just four seconds into a power play.
</P>
<P>
	   Nylander gave the Blackhawks a 4-3 lead at 8:01 from between the circles by
firing in a loose puck.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Make Last Push in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWBERRY, S.C. (AP) -- On the eve of their Southern showdown, George W. Bush
sought Friday to steady ``weak-kneed'' supporters and John McCain declared ``the
establishment can't stop us.'' Both looked ahead to the next batch of
presidential primaries even as they rallied last-minute support in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to win here. You mark my words,'' Bush said, buoyed by polls
showing him ahead or tied in the state's Republican primary. Holding out hope
for a record turnout of Democrats and independents, McCain said Bush should
apologize to voters for running ``a low campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's team was considering increasing its resources in Virginia, site of
a Feb. 29 primary, the last stop before March 7, when a dozen states conduct GOP
contests that could determine the nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   After two weeks of intense campaigning, the South Carolina race boiled down
to whether McCain's populist appeal and political momentum could survive the
sheer force of Bush's organization. McCain won New Hampshire's leadoff primary,
staggering the Texas governor's front-running campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Both camps braced for primaries Tuesday in Michigan and Arizona, believing
that the winner of South Carolina's 37-delegate primary would get a boost
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who trails McCain in surveys in Michigan and the senator's home state
of Arizona, is supported by the Republican governors in both states. Michigan
Gov. John Engler had promised a secure ``firewall'' for the Texas governor, but
he acknowledged that his own political enemies in both parties are taking out
their anger on Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican ``governors are a big help to him,'' Engler said in an interview.
``But he also gets our baggage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said a victory in South Carolina would quell doubts about his candidacy
amid defections by a handful of supporters and rumors that many more will jump
ship if he loses here. In tough times, Bush said he was learning ``who my
friends are'' and would take note of ``people who are playing their cards a
little early.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there are some people getting weak-kneed, we need to know who they are
in the heat of battle,'' he told ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain continued to portray Bush as a negative campaigner, though the
senator ran attack ads himself until last week and never has stopped upbraiding
Bush on the stump.
</P>
<P>
	   At a noisy college rally, McCain said Bush owes ``an apology to the people
of South Carolina for running such a low campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a last-ditch drive to get supporters to vote, McCain held rallies along
the Atlantic Coast, which is considered a strong area for him. Bush scoured the
GOP strongholds north of the capital of Columbia. Conservative Alan Keyes, the
third major GOP candidate, barely registers in polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The establishment can't stop us,'' McCain said at a rally of 1,000
supporters in Hilton Head.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollsters said the race was too close to call in an environment ripe for
surprise. Absentee ballots were cast in record numbers, suggesting a large
turnout which most analysts suspected would favor McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet two new polls suggested that McCain is no longer considered the race's
top reformer, a sign that Bush has made gains in questioning his rival's
integrity.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Michigan and Virginia, this state allows non-Republicans to vote in GOP
primaries. McCain is courting Democrats, independents and habitual
party-switchers, while Bush is focused on party regulars.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Bush have built mirror-image coalitions: The Texas governor is
supported by six out of 10 Republican voters; McCain is backed by six out of 10
Democrats and independents, public and private polls show.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures suggest that McCain must persuade more non-Republicans than
party regulars to vote in the GOP primary, swelling turnout in numbers that
would exceed his stunning New Hampshire showing.
</P>
<P>
	   He is getting help from Democratic leaders here. State senator Phil Leventis
taped telephone messages that were delivered Friday night to Democratic
households, urging voters to support McCain. ``This is your one chance to be
heard,'' the lawmaker says, though South Carolina Democrats hold their own
presidential contest in June.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has warned that Democrats want to intrude on the GOP primary to make
political trouble. Leventis, a Gulf War veteran, said in an interview he made
the tape for the former Vietnam POW's campaign because ``McCain is a good man.''
</P>
<P>
	   The election was the topic of discussion Friday at Mulligan's Restaurant and
Pub in this community of party-switchers northwest of Columbia. Nibbling on
their lunches, Jennifer Slight, Jamie Jefferies, Gail Hendricks and Frank Monroe
said they routinely cross party lines -- and they plan to vote Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The three women said they had anguished over their choices, but decided this
week to support Bush because of his record in Texas and their respect for his
father, the former president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He can tap into his Daddy's knowledge,'' said Slight, 26.
</P>
<P>
	   But Monroe, 61, a cabinetmaker, said McCain ``already has that knowledge in
his head.''
</P>
<P>
	   Along with swing voters like the Newberry diners, undecided voters could
determine the race. Polls indicate as many as one in 10 people haven't made
their choice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll make up my mind when I walk into the polling booth,'' said Tom Ervin
of Anderson, who attended a Bush rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking beyond Saturday, McCain's team was considering whether to begin
airing TV ads in northern Virginia -- a hotbed of Democratic and independent
voters. He is already on the air in the state's other markets, but can't make a
serious play for the state's 56 delegates without northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. James Gilmore is a Bush supporter and, like Engler, has promised to
stop McCain's momentum. McCain's political team concedes its Virginia
organization his thin, but aides believe that won't matter so much if he wins
South Carolina, Michigan and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   One state to the north, Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett is expected to endorse Bush
on Monday in what amounts to his third choice for the Republican presidential
nomination. Bartlett first endorsed former Vice President Dan Quayle, then
shifted to Steve Forbes after Quayle dropped out. Forbes quit the race Feb. 9.

<HEADLINE> FBI Traps Suspected Cuban Spy  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official charged with spying for Cuba was
arrested after falling straight into a trap set by the FBI, investigators said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI said it fed him phony information about a pending defection and then
caught him passing it on just 12 minutes later to a contact with ties to the
Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariano Faget, 54, a Cuban-born supervisor in the Miami office of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, may have been passing on classified
information about Cuban defectors for some time, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, Faget met with Cuban intelligence officials in
Miami on at least two occasions, contacted officials with the agency that
represents Cuba in Washington and had regular contact with the man he called
last week in the sting -- a New York businessman with ties to the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they had been investigating Faget for a year but wouldn't
say how long they believe he had been passing on classified information. They
also said they were uncertain about the effects of his alleged espionage --
whether any Cubans were prevented from defecting, for example.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget (pronounced fy-EHT'), who was arrested Thursday, is charged with
violating the federal Espionage Act and making false statements to a federal
officer. The first charge carries up to 10 years in prison; the second could
bring five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing in court Friday, the paunchy, balding Faget was ordered held until
a bail hearing Thursday. He caught the eyes of relatives and friends as he
walked into court and held his left hand to his heart.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Joel Kaplan would not comment. Nor would Faget's family
members and friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors said they will ask that Faget be held as a flight risk
and a danger to the community.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget and his father came to the United States and claimed political asylum
in 1960, the year after Fidel Castro came to power. Faget became a U.S. citizen
in 1963.
</P>
<P>
	   He began working for the INS as a clerk in 1966, INS district director Bob
Wallis said. Faget would have been eligible for retirement next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, who is married, lives in the Miami suburb of Kendall. Neighbor
Beatrice Vallenilla said she believes Faget has three adult children.
</P>
<P>
	   As a supervisory district adjudication officer for the INS, Faget had
``secret'' security clearance and oversaw decisions that affected the residency
status of immigrants, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI spokesman Paul Mallett said Faget waited only 12 minutes Feb. 11 before
he passed on the phony information that a Cuban official was about to defect.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, INS and FBI officials showed Faget pictures of a
Cuban intelligence official he knew, and told Faget that the man wanted to
defect and that the information was secret and very sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, Faget returned to his office and used his personal cell
phone to call the New York businessman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faget told the businessman that `a person we both know' was `one of the
ones working with the Americans,''' U.S. Attorney Thomas Scott said in a
statement. ``Faget then identified the Cuban intelligence officer by name.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Faget called the man from home and discussed the case in more detail,
the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, Faget and the New York businessman are officers
of a Florida company whose stated purpose is to engage in future business
transactions with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   State records show Faget is vice president and secretary of America-Cuba
Inc., a company created in 1994. The company's president and chief executive is
listed as Pedro Font of Greenwich, Conn. A source close to the investigation
confirmed for The Associated Press that Font was the businessman referred to in
the affidavit.	   A number listed for Font in Greenwich, Conn., was
disconnected. The affidavit said Font was in China on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Goyanes, listed in state records as a Miami-based executive of
America-Cuba, said Friday he was surprised by the charges against Faget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The guy is a family man. He works for the government,'' Goyanes said.
``This is the last thing I ever thought. The courts will prove him innocent when
it is all over.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities said that in addition to the New York contact, Faget
placed calls to the Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington, which is known as
the Cuban Interests Section, and met with two Cuban intelligence officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI has recommended to the State Department that a contact of Faget's at
the Cuban diplomatic mission be asked to leave the country, a Clinton
administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section declined comment. The White
House also had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallis said all of the cases that had crossed Faget's desk would be closely
reviewed. Early Friday, authorities searched Faget's office and his home and
seized two computers and his automobile.
</P>
<P>
	   His arrest comes amid already strained relations with the communist island
over Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy found clinging to an inner tube
off the Florida coast Nov. 25. His mother and 10 others died when their boat
sank in an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's Miami relatives are fighting to keep him in the United States,
despite an order by the INS to reunite Elian with his father in Cuba. Faget had
nothing to do with Elian's case, Wallis said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities also said Faget had no connection to a large Cuban spy ring
broken up in 1998. Fourteen people were accused of trying to penetrate U.S.
military bases, infiltrate anti-Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media
and political organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Five people have pleaded guilty. Others go on trial in May.

<P>
    MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Abbie Willenborg scored 21 points to become Marquette's
career scoring leader and the 23rd-ranked Golden Eagles won their seventh
straight, beating N.C.-Charlotte 65-40 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Willenborg's rebound basket with 9:25 to play gave her 1,760 points,
surpassing the 1,759 by Julie Sievers from 1979-83.
</P>
<P>
	   Marquette (21-4 overall, 13-1 Conference USA), ranked for the first time in
its history, already had clinched the league's American Division and can lock up
the overall championship by beating Saint Louis Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The 49ers (8-16, 3-10) stayed with Marquette until early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams shot poorly in the first half and Marquette led only 18-16. It
was 7-7 almost seven minutes into the game and Marquette didn't score in the
final 5:19 after an 8-0 run made it 18-14. Charlotte didn't score in the final
4:14.
</P>
<P>
	   After shooting 25 percent (7-of-28) in the first half, Marquette was
15-of-31 in the second half to finish at 37 percent. The 49ers finished at 26
percent (17-of-65).
</P>
<P>
	   Willenborg opened the second half with seven points to start a 10-2 run as
Marquette built a 28-18 lead. The 49ers closed within five only to be hit with
back-to-back 3-pointers by Kristi Johnson. Two 8-0 runs put it away.
</P>
<P>
	   Jameka Jones led the 49ers with 13 points, but had only five in the second
half. None of her teammates managed more than six points.

<HEADLINE> Accused Basque Man Extradited  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A Basque man was extradited from Mexico to Spain on
Friday to face accusations of attempted murder and membership in a violent
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Oscar Cadenas Lorente, 35, was wanted in Spain in connection with a bomb
attack in 1991 that left a Spanish businessman seriously wounded, and with the
kidnapping of another person in the same year.
</P>
<P>
	   Lorente was the first suspected member of the Basque separatist group ETA to
be officially extradited from Mexico to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico has deported at least 18 suspected ETA members to Spain in the last
four years, but mostly on charges of possessing false identification or living
illegally in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ETA's violent campaign for independence of the Basque region, which
straddles the border of France and Spain, has claimed the lives of some 800
people since 1968.
</P>
<P>
	   Lorente arrived in handcuffs at Madrid's airport Friday and was transferred
to prison immediately. He was scheduled to appear for an initial court hearing
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The extradition follows a visit to Spain last month by Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo, who discussed, among other things, increased bilateral
cooperation to crack down on ETA.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spanish state news agency Efe said Lorente fled Spain in 1992 after
National Police arrested several colleagues. He was arrested in Mexico in 1996
under charges of possessing false identification.
</P>
<P>
	   The extradition process began shortly afterward, at Spain's request.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Priest Arrested in Sex Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RACINE, Wis. (AP) -- A priest has been arrested for allegedly trying to
arrange a sexual encounter with an investigator posing as a minor over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. John M. Furdek, 47, of Villa Park, Ill., faces multiple charges,
including attempted second-degree sexual assault, child enticement, and
possession of marijuana. He was arrested Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Furdek, pastor of St. Alexander's Catholic Church in Villa Park, was jailed
on a $60,600 bond. A preliminary hearing was scheduled Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
	   Computer messages exchanged between Furdek and a state investigator posing
as a 14-year-old boy indicated the priest wanted to have sex with the child and
traveled to Racine for that purpose, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
	   A computer and videotapes were confiscated from his home on parish property
Friday. Racine County sheriff's deputies also found steroids and less than five
grams of marijuana in his car.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Sean Brown successfully argued that his client did not
intend to give the marijuana found in his car to ``the boy,'' and a charge of
marijuana with the intent to deliver was scaled down to marijuana possession.

<HEADLINE> Suns 85, Hawks 73  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Rodney Rogers scored 24 points Friday night and the Phoenix
Suns extended their winning streak to five with an 85-73 victory over the
Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
	   Luc Longley had 15 points and Tom Gugliotta scored 12 for the Suns.
Atlanta's 73 points marked the sixth-best defensive effort in Phoenix history.
</P>
<P>
	   Dikembe Mutombo, continuing his strong play in the face of trade rumors, had
25 rebounds and 12 points for the Hawks. The Suns held Atlanta to 36 percent
shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Until Anthony Johnson scored six points in the final 1:40, the Suns were
aiming to hold Atlanta below 65 points, the franchise's record-low game against
Chicago in March 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   The game had a backdrop of intrigue involving Mutombo, reportedly the target
of trade attempts by the Suns. He put on a show, getting 13 rebounds in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
	   But cheers at the outset turned to boos in the second half, and Phoenix's
balance offset Mutombo's individual brilliance.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was decided in the third quarter, when two 3-pointers by Isaiah
Rider and a technical free throw by Jim Jackson cut the Hawks' deficit to 54-45
with 4:43 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers later made two layups to start a 7-0 spurt that carried the Suns to a
63-48 lead entering the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta never challenged down the stretch.

<HEADLINE> Kings 3, Red Wings 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Los Angeles goalie Stephane Fiset has a simple explanation
for why the Kings have suddenly become one of the NHL's toughest teams to beat.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're playing good right now, and it's fun," Fiset said after he made 33
saves and the Kings won their fifth straight Friday night, 3-2 over the Detroit
Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
	   Luc Robitaille's tiebreaking goal early in the third period held up as the
Kings snapped the Red Wings' four-game winning streak. Detroit fell three points
behind St. Louis in their race for first place in the Central Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Red Wings star Sergei Fedorov injured his right hand and bruised a knee when
he was checked into the boards by Bob Corkum in the second period and did not
return.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to practice (Saturday) and see how he is then," Detroit coach
Scotty Bowman said. Fedorov has already missed nine games this season with other
injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Robitaille scored his 30th goal 1:44 into the third by wristing a shot from
the left circle through the legs of Chris Osgood, breaking a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
	   Ian Laperriere and Glen Murray also scored for the Kings, who have won the
first two games of a seven-city road trip. Los Angeles has won seven of its last
eight and eight of 11. The Kings are 2-1-1 against Detroit this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've battled the Red Wings hard all year," Kings coach Andy Murray said.
"We've had three good games here (going 1-1-1). They're a great team. We knew
we'd have to play a great game to beat them here and we got outstanding
goaltending.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one works harder than Stephane Fiset. It's nice to see him rewarded
tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   Fiset's best stop came on a shot from Yzerman in the second.
</P>
<P>
	   "You just have to be patient," Fiset said. "If you make the first move,
you're done because he's such a great player. If you're overaggressive, they're
going to make a pass to the other side."
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Yzerman and Vyacheslav Kozlov scored for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Robitaille has five goals in his last four games and at least one point in
eight straight. Zigmund Palffy and Jozef Stumpel had assists on Robitaille's
goal, giving their line 45 points in the Kings' last eight.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've got some good players," Detroit's Igor Larionov said. "Palffy's
playing great for them, they're playing disciplined hockey, so that's nice to
see. They've got a good coach, too."
</P>
<P>
	   Osgood stopped 20 shots as the Kings were 0-for-7 on the power play.
</P>
<P>
	   "We did a good job killing penalties, but when you're killing penalties
you're not on the offense," Detroit's Kirk Maltby said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yzerman scored the only goal of the first period. With the Red Wings skating
5-on-3, Yzerman, who went 11 games without a goal before scoring two Wednesday
against Vancouver, shot through traffic from the right circle and beat Fiset.
</P>
<P>
	   Laperriere and Glen Murray scored goals 54 seconds apart to give the Kings a
2-1 lead early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   Laperriere broke in with a pass from Donald Audette and beat Osgood from
point-blank range at 4:01, and Murray scored on a breakaway at 4:55.
</P>
<P>
	   Fedorov was hurt 25 seconds after Murray's goal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Of course it's a big loss," Larionov said. "Sergei's been playing great
hockey lately. I hope he'll be back next game. The game was on the line, I think
it was a 2-2 score, and to lose Sergei was a big, big loss."
</P>
<P>
	   Kozlov scored to make it 2-2 at the 9:25 mark.

<HEADLINE> Race 1 of America's Cup Must Wait  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- After waiting nearly five years to watch its
beloved Black Magic defend the America's Cup, Auckland held its breath.
Literally.
</P>
<P>
	Race 1 of the best-of-9 series between Black Magic and Italy's Luna Rossa was
postponed Saturday afternoon because the unpredictable wind on Hauraki Gulf
dropped to practically nothing.
</P>
<P>
	The race committee will try again Sunday to get in the first race, although the
forecast again calls for light wind. Monday is a scheduled day off, and race
committee chairman Harold Bennett said both teams would have to agree to race
that day if there's no breeze Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	``It's Auckland,'' Bennett said, shrugging his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
	Black Magic and Luna Rossa, as well as a huge spectator fleet, bobbed gently
under a blazing sun while the race committee waited 1 1/2 hours after the
scheduled start to see if the wind would fill in. It didn't even come close.
</P>
<P>
	Three Kiwi sailors took off their shoes and sat in Black Magic's scooped-out
transom, dangling their feet in the water and waving to passing powerboats.
Pre-race nerves turned to boredom for other crew members on both boats, as they
lounged on deck, stood with their arms crossed or ate lunch. At one point, Black
Magic skipper Russell Coutts sat in one of his team's tenders.
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the Kiwis were unflappable.
</P>
<P>
	``It is very frustrating but we have waited this long,'' tactician Brad
Butterworth said. ``One more day doesn't make any difference. The reality is we
would rather see a breeze in which both boats can get moving.''
</P>
<P>
	The forecast had called for 8-10 knots of wind, which would have been enough to
get the race going. But the breeze was just 2 knots at the scheduled starting
time of 1:15 p.m., and never got higher than 4-5 knots.
</P>
<P>
	``Starting a race in this breeze would have been a failure. Don't do it,''
Bennett said. The boats wouldn't have met the time limit for finishing the first
leg, and there was a chance the wind could shift 180 degrees, making the race a
farce.
</P>
<P>
	Bennett expects winds of 12-14 knots next week.
</P>
<P>
	Less than four weeks ago, the wind and waves were so wild that the opening race
of the challenger finals between Luna Rossa and AmericaOne was postponed a day
because the race committee feared that one of the carbon-fiber racers could be
severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
	It was an anticlimactic finish to a day New Zealanders had been looking forward
to with both pride and a touch of apprehension.
</P>
<P>
	Because New Zealand didn't hold defender trials, the Kiwis hadn't been in an
America's Cup race since May 13, 1995, when they completed one of the most
dominating performances in Cup history, a 5-0 whitewashing of Dennis Conner off
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	Eager to see these finals get started, tens of thousands of spectators crammed
Viaduct Basin Saturday morning to watch as the two yachts left their compounds.
</P>
<P>
	A Maori war canoe led the flotilla out of the harbor, and a blast of horns from
dozens of super yachts greeted the jet-black Kiwi boat, plastered with sponsor
logos, as it was towed out.
</P>
<P>
	The silver-and-red Luna Rossa (Red Moon) followed a few minutes later, to a
tamer reception.
</P>
<P>
	Luna Rossa, backed by the powerful Prada design house, beat AmericaOne in the
dramatic Louis Vuitton Cup finals to guarantee that an American yacht won't be
in the America's Cup final for the first time in its 149-year history.
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, organizers had been set to put one umpire on each boat, but changed
their minds late Friday. Officials were worried about the potential for exposure
to emissions from the variety of radio, telemetry and other antennae mounted on
the sterns of the yachts. Officials will revert to putting the umpires in power
boats that flank the yachts.

Snow Disrupts Midwest and East

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A powerful winter storm that spread snow and sleet across
the Midwest and Northeast Friday turned deadly. A boat capsized during a rescue
effort along a swollen creek outside Charleston, W.Va., leaving one person dead
and two presumed dead. The weather was also blamed for the deaths of a Virginia
couple killed in a car accident in Harrisburg, Pa. The snow frustrated travelers
with flight delays and cancellations, and gave many students a day off from

soldier was among the witnesses and investigating officers who testified at an
opening preliminary hearing for Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, who is accused of
assaulting and killing the 11-year-old girl in Kosovo. The hearing was to
determine if there is enough evidence to court-martial Ronghi on charges of

arrested Friday after falling straight into a trap set by the FBI, investigators
said. Officials said they fed Mariano Faget phony information about a pending
defection and then caught him passing it on just 12 minutes later to a contact
with ties to the Cuban government. Faget, 54, a Cuban-born supervisor in the
Miami office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, may have been
passing on classified information about Cuban defectors for some time,
authorities said.

INS Won't Change Elian's Custodian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rejecting a request from Elian Gonzalez' father in Cuba,
the Immigration and Naturalization Service refused Friday to shift the
6-year-old boy to a new temporary custodian in Miami on grounds that would be
too disruptive. The INS said that it was continuing to press in federal court
for Elian's return to his father in Cuba. But the agency said "transferring
Elian temporarily to a new and unfamiliar environment would not be advisable for
the child after already experiencing the trauma of leaving his home in Cuba and
losing his mother."

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 4, Stars 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes took a big step in reaching their goal of
finishing first in the Pacific Division: They beat the defending Stanley Cup
champion Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas Drake had two goals, including the go-ahead score with 2:55
remaining, and the Coyotes went on for a 4-3 win over the Stars on Friday night.
Shane Doan also had two goals for the Coyotes, who moved within two points of
the Pacific-leading Stars.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're putting a big premium on first place," Drake said. "To have that
advantage in the playoffs is huge and this is a major step."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Modano's 25th goal tied it 3-3 for Dallas with 10:38 left, but Drake's
10th of the season beat Stars goalie Ed Belfour high from the slot following a
pass from behind the net by Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
	   "I snuck into an opening and there was a lot of traffic in front," Drake
said. "I shot it high over his shoulder."
</P>
<P>
	   A defeat would have put the Coyotes six points behind the Stars, which would
have placed Phoenix in a tough spot.
</P>
<P>
	   "The difference between two points and six is huge," Doan said. "I hope the
message that we sent tonight is that we're not going to go away."
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix, avenging a 2-0 loss to Dallas on Feb. 3, is 2-3 in its last five
games, while the Stars are 9-3 in their last 12.
</P>
<P>
	   "They got in front that night and then just schooled us on defense," said
Doan. "I don't think we had one good scoring chance in the last two periods.
Tonight we played a lot better."
</P>
<P>
	   Belfour, who started the night with a 2.07 goals-against average and .920
save percentage, had one of his poorest efforts of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought my timing was a bit off tonight," Belfour said.
</P>
<P>
	   Doan gave the Coyotes a 1-0 lead at 8:26 of the first period. Darryl Sydor
tied it 1:07 later on a backhander from the slot.
</P>
<P>
	   Drake gave Phoenix a 2-1 advantage with his ninth goal at 17:29 of the
first. Roman Lyashenko tied it at 2 for the Stars at 6:37 of the second on a
rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes took a 3-2 advantage with 5:13 left in the second when Doan
fired a wrist shot from the right circle into the top right corner.
</P>
<P>
	   Stars captain and top defenseman Derian Hatcher returned to the lineup after
missing 24 games with a calf injury. Hatcher played 16:36 and 24 shifts.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt a little slow at times but overall it felt good," Hatcher said.
"It's going to take a while. The hardest part was losing. It's frustrating but I
don't think we were outplayed."
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas' league-leading penalty-killing unit shut out Phoenix on four
second-period power plays, including being down two skaters for 1:25.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars were without Joe Nieuwendyk, Jere Lehtinen, Brian Skrudland and
Shawn Chambers, all sidelined by injuries. Jamie Langenbrunner also was
scratched due to neck soreness, and is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Tkachuk missed his second consecutive game for the Coyotes with a
sprained ankle.

<HEADLINE> Blues 2, Predators 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- St. Louis rookie Jochen Hecht made an impressive
return to the Blues lineup.
</P>
<P>
	   Hecht, who had missed 13 games with a sprained ankle, scored the winning
goal and added an assist as the Blues beat the Nashville Predators 2-1 and set a
team record with their seventh straight road win Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were giving him a hard time, telling him not to bring us down now that
he's back in the lineup," teammate Scott Pellerin said. "Jochen's a talent. He's
a real plus to have back in the lineup."
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis, which has won nine of 10 overall and is the NHL's top road club
with a 19-8-2 record, outshot Nashville 33-17.
</P>
<P>
	   Blues goalie Roman Turek, who made 16 saves for his 30th win, stopped Drake
Berehowsky on a slap shot with 5.6 seconds left as the Predators lost their
sixth straight.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got to keep the faith, keep believing in one another, and keep
marching on," Predators captain Tom Fitzgerald said. "We've got to maybe be
concerned about the Nashville Predators, what we do, and then things will take
care of themselves."
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis has not lost a road game since a 3-1 loss at Pittsburgh on Jan.
19.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're able to keep our game simple, and team defense has allowed us the
opportunity to be around in the later parts of games," Blues forward Jamal
Mayers said. "Then we're able to capitalize on our opportunities."
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis is the best defensive team in the league -- 119 goals against in
58 games -- and the Blues have allowed the fewest shots, with an average of 22
per game.
</P>
<P>
	   Hecht snapped a 1-1 tie with 3:02 left in the second period. Stephane Richer
took advantage of a giveaway by Nashville defenseman Bob Boughner and set up
Hecht, who was wide open in the left circle.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a play that has to be made," Boughner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville's Cliff Ronning got the only goal of the first period on a
give-and-go with Kimmo Timonen. Ronning skated up the middle and dished to
Timonen, who fed back to Ronning in the slot for a one-timer that whistled by
Turek.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal was the 20th of the season for Ronning, the eighth time in his NHL
career that he has reached that mark.
</P>
<P>
	   Marty Reasoner's power-play goal tied the game 10:53 into the second.
Reasoner fired the puck over Tomas Vokoun after Chris Pronger's slap shot went
wide and Hecht found Reasoner in front.
</P>
<P>
	   Blues defenseman Al MacInnis, last year's Norris Trophy winner, missed his
third straight game with a back injury. Timonen, Nashville's All-Star
defenseman, returned after missing 15 games due to a broken wrist.
