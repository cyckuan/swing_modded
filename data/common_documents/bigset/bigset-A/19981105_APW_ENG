	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Attorneys for ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim resumed their cross-examination Thursday of
the country's intelligence chief, who accused Anwar of meddling
with the police investigation against him.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul temporarily adjourned the fourth
day of the dramatic corruption and sexual misconduct trial after
the prosecution's first witness complained the defense had
``twisted'' his testimony.
	   Mohamed Said Awang, former chief of Malaysia's top police
intelligence unit, the Special Branch, said Christopher Fernando,
one of Anwar's nine defense attorneys, had taken his testimony
Wednesday out of context.
	   ``My Lord, I couldn't remember the facts at that time. If you
start asking questions on the wrong facts, then I'm worried. It's
based on twisted evidence,'' said Mohamed.
	   ``Just relax and tell the truth,'' said Judge Paul, before he
called for a break and asked Mohamed to collect himself.
	   Anwar appeared pleased by the exchange.
	   ``In two minutes, he's already trembling,'' he said of Mohamed
to the whole courtroom. ``In detention they interrogate us for two
months and we had to go through it.''
	   Anwar, 51, sacked as deputy prime minister and finance minister
Sept. 2, faces 10 counts of abuse of power and sexual misconduct.
He denies the charges and says they were fabricated because Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad considered his popularity a threat to his
17-year rule.
	   The start of Thursday's hearing was delayed by one hour after
defense lawyers said they needed time to consult with Anwar. They
said Anwar was whisked away to prison immediately after Wednesday's
proceedings, leaving no time for consultations.
	   Police on Wednesday accused Anwar of trying to force police to
cover up his alleged sexual misdeeds.
	   Mohamed testified that Anwar demanded intelligence officers use
a secret method called ``Operation Turning Over'' to intimidate two
people who had accused the deputy prime minister of sodomy and
adultery.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar, also his finance minister, on Sept. 2,
saying he was morally unfit to lead the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Since Anwar's arrest on Sept. 20, tens of thousands of
Malaysians have participated in street protests demanding his
release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   During the trial, Anwar has been spending most of his time in
the dock taking notes on large sheets of paper and paying close
attention to the arguments.
	   During breaks, either for lunch or when the judge leaves the
courtroom, he talks to his family or diplomats from other countries
who have been attending the trial that is being closely watched by
human rights groups worldwide.
	   The case attracted international attention after Anwar showed up
at his arraignment Sept. 29 with a black eye and bruises. He
claimed police beat him after his arrest.
	   In another development, the national news agency Bernama
confirmed earlier reports that Mahathir is among the 52 people the
prosecution plans to call as witnesses.
	   Others in the list are Mahathir's chief economic advisor, Daim
Zainuddin, Malaysia's police chief, Abdul Rahim Noor, former
members of Anwar's staff and 20 police officers.

Mahathir, Goh meet amid frosty bilateral ties

conference. ADDS byline.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The prime ministers of Malaysia
and Singapore held private talks on the outskirts of the Malaysian
capital Thursday, indicating a thaw in frosty relations between the
Southeast Asian neighbors.
	   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore and Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad met in the VIP lounge of the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport.
	   Foreign media were barred from a joint news conference with the
two leaders. Mahathir's spokesman said they had not been invited
and that only local press could attend.
	   The surprise visit by Goh comes at a time when the two nations
have squabbled over a host of bilateral issues ranging from
airspace to the location of a railroad station.
	   It was the first top-level meeting between the two countries
since relations, testy even before the added pressure of the Asian
financial crisis, started to deteriorate rapidly in August. They
last met in April.
	   The one-day visit was initiated at Mahathir's invitation, Goh's
office said in a statement late Wednesday.
	   There had been no official comment ahead of the meeting.
	   In recent months, the neighbors have argued over the location of
a border post and a cancellation of automatic flyover rights for
Singaporean military aircraft using Malaysian airspace.
	   Malaysia's withdrawal from joint military exercises, and a halt
to trading of Malaysian stocks and currencies in Singapore have
also strained ties.
	   Derogatory comments about past Malaysian leaders in the
recently-released memoirs of former Singapore Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew also added to the tensions.
	   Last month, Mahathir said his country would find it difficult to
be friendly again with Singapore, saying the island republic had
not shown the sensitivity of a good neighbor.
	   Soon after, Goh urged the people of his small city-state to
remain mentally tough amid tensions with its larger neighbor.
	   But in recent days the two leaders have spoken of improving
ties.
	   The bilateral meeting comes ahead of a summit in Kuala Lumpur
later this month of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,
which Goh will attend along with 19 other Pacific-Rim leaders.

Three sentenced in scandal that tarnished Taiwan's military
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Two senior army officials caught taking
kickbacks after an angry contractor kidnapped and beat them were
sentenced to prison Thursday in a ruling that defense officials
hope will improve the military's tattered reputation.
	   Lt. Col. Lee Cheng was ordered jailed for 11 years for receiving
500,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 15,625) in bribes for fixing bids
on contracts for bunkers and a navy missile production site.
	   Maj. Gen. Woh Chi-kao, head of the combined services
construction division, was given four years for his conviction on
similar charges.
	   The officers got into trouble when two construction companies
were feuding over a 420 million Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 12.7
million) contract to build steel-reinforced ammunition storage
bunkers in Taitung, eastern Taiwan, in January 1997.
	   Two managers of the Sheng Pai company, which lost the bid,
kidnapped and beat Woh and Lee Cheng for allegedly reneging on a
promise to award them the tender. Details of the corruption then
emerged.
	   A third army official, commanding officer Lt. Gen. Liu Hsueh-ta,
was sentenced to two years and six months for lesser involvement in
the case.
	   Another officer, Maj. Lee Chun-lin, was acquitted.
	   The convicted men's families said they would appeal the
sentences.
	   The scandal dealt a body blow to the military's reputation just
as it was beginning to recover after the still unsolved murder of a
navy captain in 1993 that opened up revelations of greed and graft
in military procurement.
	   Defense Ministry spokesman Kung Fan-ding said the prison
sentences in the latest corruption case exemplified the military's
determination to root out corruption.
	   ``You will notice that this case was open to the public through
its entirety, showing that we will prosecute corruption cases to
the full extent of the law,'' Kung told a news conference.
	   Taiwan's military was sacrosanct during an era of martial law
that stretched from 1949, when Taiwan broke away from mainland
China in a civil war, until 1987.
	   But the military has since fallen under increasing legislative
supervision, along with criticism from the public, whose support is
needed for large military budgets and the obligatory two-year
military service for all men.
	   This kickback case pushed military leaders to guard against
further scandal.
	   For example, the procurements wing has been brought directly
under the supervision of Taiwan's Defense Ministry, rather than
functioning as a separate branch as in the past.
	   Also, top officers and those involved in procurement have been
ordered to declare their assets annually.
	   ``There will certainly be some repercussions for the military,
but (the case) also demonstrates its awareness of public demands
for close monitoring of its activities,'' said Andrew Yang, a
militay analyst at the semiofficial Chinese Council of Advanced
Policy Studies.

China aims for 100-plus golds, no drug scandals at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Anxious to head off any drug scandals, China
plans to subject athletes to unscheduled doping tests before they
compete at the next month's Asian Games in Thailand, sports
officials said Thursday.
	   Doping tests will focus particularly on ``important events like
swimming, athletics and cycling,'' said Li Furong, deputy head of a
822-member delegation that China will send to the games.
	   ``We will definitely carry out some unscheduled tests,'' he
said. ``Various people, in various events, will be selectively
tested at any time.''
	   China was the runaway champion at the last Asian Games four
years ago in Hiroshima, Japan. But its success was overshadowed by
11 athletes _ including seven swimmers _ who failed drug tests.
	   The positive results provoked an international outcry, with
athletes and coaches from other countries claiming them as proof
that China's phenomenal sporting success, particularly in events
such as women's swimming, was due to widespread drug use.
	   China has denied running a systematic doping program and has
stepped up efforts in recent years to weed out and punish drug
cheats.
	   Yuan Weimin, a vice minister for sports, said doping was an
international problem that spread from the West to China in the
1980s.
	   Fighting doping is a ``common, long-term unremitting struggle,''
he said at a news conference about China's participation at the
Dec. 6-20 games.
	   By the end of last month, China had conducted 2,412 doping tests
this year, including unscheduled out-of-competition tests, that
caught eight athletes who were subsequently punished, Yuan said,
without providing details.
	   Athletes who will be going to Thailand were among those tested,
and some were probably tested more than once, he said.
	   Before the games, athletes and coaches will also be called in
for classes about anti-doping efforts, Li said. He said none of the
eight athletes caught this year were well-known, although he did
not divulge their names. Most competed in swimming and athletics,
he said.
	   China, the overall gold medal leader at the past three games,
will send 596 athletes to Thailand and compete in 32 of the 36
sports. The only sports it will not compete in are squash, rugby,
karate and kabbadi, a tag-like game popular in South Asia.
	   Yuan said China again aims to capture the most golds and lay a
foundation for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
	   He estimated that China could get more than 100 golds. Japan
could capture 70 to 80 golds, South Korea 65 to 75, and Kazakstan
20 to 30, he added.
	   China won 137 _ or 41 percent _ of 337 gold medals at stake at
the last games in 1994. China also led in total medals with 289, to
207 for Japan and 179 for the South Koreans.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Three sets of remains believed to be from
American soldiers killed during the Vietnam War were repatriated to
the United States on Thursday.
	   On hand for the ceremony at Hanoi's Noibai Airport were U.S.
Ambassador Pete Peterson, a former prisoner of war here, and Bob
Jones, deputy assistant secretary of defense for prisoners of war
and missing personnel affairs.
	   The same plane that is taking the remains back to Hawaii for
positive identification at a military laboratory brought in some of
the 101 American service personnel who will take part in a 30-day
operation that could excavate up to 10 sites.
	   Meanwhile, torrential rains have prevented the excavation of a
graveyard of Vietnamese MIAs in central Quang Tri province, a local
government official said Thursday.
	   Nguyen Dang Cuong, deputy chief of the excavation team in Huong
Hoa district, said recovery of the estimated 15-20 remains of
missing North Vietnamese soldiers is expected next week when the
rain stops.
	   Cuong said his team has recovered an annual average of 20 sets
of remains of Vietnamese MIAs in recent years in the district, site
of fierce fighting during the war.
	   An estimated 300,000 Vietnamese remain listed as missing in
action a quarter-century after the war ended.
	   Altogether, 2,078 Americans are listed as missing in Southeast
Asia, including 1,549 in Vietnam.

Israeli and Palestinians settle disagreement, cabinet to meet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After several days of delay, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu decided to convene his cabinet Thursday to
ratify the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians, his
office said.
	   Settling a disagreement that had held up ratification, the
government said that it had received written guarantees from the
United States that 30 Palestinians wanted by Israel would be
arrested, a statement from Netanyahu's office said.
	   According to the statement, the guarantees stipulated that the
arrests would take place in stages, with a third of the suspects
being rounded up at a time over the course of the 12-week time
table set to carry out the agreement.
	   The cabinet vote helps insure that the Israelis and Palestinians
might be able stick to time schedule that was to begin Monday. As
part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank _ with the first pullback installment due Nov. 16 _ in
exchange for Palestinian security steps.

Honduras finds more victims, scope of disaster growing

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Hondurans buried more of their dead
and formed blocks-long lines for water and gasoline as officials
struggled to feed and shelter a population still in shock from
Hurricane Mitch.
	   An estimated 13,000 people were missing across Central America.
	   Medical workers buried 13 flood victims in a common grave
Wednesday in Tegucigalpa, making signs of the cross and placing two
wooden crosses among the plastic-shrouded bodies before a bulldozer
plowed earth over them. The bodies were too decomposed to identify,
officials said.
	   They were among the latest in a national death toll in Honduras
estimated at 6,500, with as many as 1 million homeless. All told,
Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated total of nearly 9,000 people in
its rampage through Central America.
	   ``We really don't know what the numbers are. There are places we
haven't reached yet,'' said Col. Rene Osorio of Honduras' national
emergency committee.
	   A revived Tropical Storm Mitch raced across the Gulf of Mexico
toward South Florida and the Florida Keys Wednesday, buffeting the
region with pelting rain, wind gusts up to 50 mph (80 kph) and
tornadoes.
	   Tornado touchdowns were reported in Key Largo and Plantation
Key, damaging a hotel roof and flipping a tractor trailer, local
police reported. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
	   While officials previously estimated 7,000 dead in Honduras,
President Carlos Flores said in a nationwide broadcast late
Wednesday that some 6,500 people were confirmed dead and more than
11,000 were missing. Mitch destroyed more than 60 percent of the
nation's infrastructure, he said, adding the government was seeking
aid from Europe and the United States.
	   ``We have receded many years'' in terms of national development,
Flores said. ``The capital of the republic is in a precarious
condition.''
	   Also Wednesday, the first foreign relief aid trickled into
Honduras. Hondurans in Texas sent 15,000 pounds (6,803 kilos) of
supplies Wednesday. The Mexican government and the U.S. military
joined an airlift to towns cut off by nationwide flooding. But the
obstacles to delivering that relief were daunting.
	   In northern Nicaragua, the grisly task of burying or burning
bodies continued in massive mudslides near the Casitas volcano,
where a crater lake collapsed Friday. About 200 more corpses were
found there Wednesday, boosting the confirmed death toll there to
1,568. As many as 2,000 are feared dead.
	   Nicaraguan military spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval warned that
mines planted by guerrillas in the 1980s could surface in flooded
areas. An estimated 100,000 mines were left behind.
	   More than 750,000 people lost their homes or possessions across
Nicaragua, and 1,804 are listed as missing nationwide.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman _ who turned aid distribution over to
the Roman Catholic Church on Wednesday after government relief
efforts were criticized _ said he would ``respect the will of local
residents'' in deciding whether to declare the Casitas area a
national cemetery.
	   A small magnitude-3.2 earthquake centered near the Casitas peak
was reported Wednesday, while lava flows from the nearby Cerro
Negro volcano appeared to have stopped Tuesday. No injuries or
damage were reported in either incident.
	   El Salvador declared three days of national mourning for the 239
dead there. In Guatemala, 194 were reported dead and at least
77,900 had evacuated their homes. At least six people were killed
in southern Mexico and seven people died in Costa Rica.
	   There was also no sign Wednesday of the 282-foot (85-meter)
Windjammer Barefoot Cruises yacht Fantome, which disappeared off
Honduras with a British captain and a Central American crew of 30
more than a week ago.
	   Mitch hit the Honduran coast last week and parked itself there,
dumping several feet of rain onto the poor nation before moving
across the Yucatan Peninsula and into the Gulf of Mexico.
	   It left behind a stunning wake of death and devastation across
Central America.
	   In Honduras, main highways connecting Tegucigalpa, a city of
800,000, to the rest of the country were cut, creating shortages of
gasoline, drinking water and food in the hard-hit capital. Without
gasoline, aid can't be delivered by truck. Nearly all aircraft are
being used in continuing searches for survivors.
	   ``The people's desperation is growing,'' said Andres Aguiriano
Duarte, deputy commissioner of the emergency committee. ``This
storm has broken the entire basic structure of our response
capabilities.''
	   Honduran roads sustained dlrs 2 billion in damage, nearly a
third of the country's gross domestic product and double the
government's budget, said Finance Minister Gabriela Nunez.
	   In Tegucigalpa's city morgue _ operating from a refrigerated
trailer after flooding swept through the morgue building _ anxious
residents awaited word of missing loved ones.
	   Along the banks of the Choluteca River, residents shoveled muck
from debris-packed homes and stores and sifted for whatever they
could salvage. Bulldozers cleared streets of mounds of rock, mud
and garbage.
	   All too often, there was nothing left to save.
	   ``How do we continue, without water, without food, without
sleep?'' said Yolanda Marvella Arraya, 35, who has spent nights
outside on a soggy mattress next to the river since flooding
destroyed her home.
	   Blocks-long lines formed at a few stations where gasoline was
available, but rationed to a gallon (3.8 liters) per person.
	   ``We've been waiting four hours,'' said Gladys Nunez, 50, two
plastic containers in hand. ``It's been all nerves and tension.''
	   Citing food and other shortages, the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa
authorized the voluntary departure of all dependents of embassy
personnel. The U.S. Peace Corps, with about 207 members in
Honduras, was pulling up stakes to Panama under a mandatory
departure order.
	   Aid was eagerly awaited by the 4,000 people crowded into a
shelter at a government-run trade school in Tegucigalpa, where many
stunned families waited out the day on mattresses. Some mothers
cried silently, trying to hide their grief from their children.
	   ``I'm fighting to control my nerves,'' said a tearful Santos
Antonio Perez, 57, whose family of 10 was uprooted by the storm.
``I lost all I have. This dress was given to me,'' she said,
pulling at the thin fabric.
	   At least 300 people have been arrested in Tegucigalpa for
violating the overnight curfew, police said. Officials say
residents in some neighborhoods have formed vigilante groups to
ward off looters.

Japanese drug company recalls blood products from U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese pharmaceutical firm is recalling blood
products it markets in the United States because samples have been
found to be contaminated with germs, the company said Thursday.
	   Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. on Monday began
recalling all plasma products made by its Los Angeles-based
subsidiary Alpha Therapeutic Corp. between Dec. 11, 1997 and June
25 this year, the company said in a statement.
	   The recall was ordered last month by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration after it learned that tests conducted by Alpha
Therapeutic had revealed traces of fungi in some of the products.
	   The contaminated drugs were not marketed, and all of the
products that went on sale had passed the company's quality tests,
Yoshitomi said.
	   The blood products are used by hemophiliacs and people with
immune deficiency disorders.

Israel and Palestinians settle disagreement, Cabinet to meet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After several days of delay, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu decided to convene his Cabinet Thursday to
ratify the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians, his
office said.
	   Settling a disagreement that had held up ratification, the
government said that it had received written guarantees from the
United States that 30 Palestinians wanted by Israel would be
arrested, a statement from Netanyahu's office said.
	   According to the statement, the guarantees stipulated that the
arrests would take place in stages, with a third of the suspects
being rounded up at a time over the course of the 12-week time
table set to carry out the agreement.
	   The Cabinet vote would help insure that the Israelis and
Palestinians might be able to stick to the time schedule for
implementing the agreement that was to begin Monday. As part of the
plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank _
with the first pullback installment due Nov. 16 _ in exchange for
Palestinian security steps.
	   The agreement was reached during last month's Mideast summit at
secluded Wye Plantation in Maryland.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan opened talks Thursday
on a water sharing dispute, part of an attempt to improve relations
between the nuclear rivals.
	   Talks over the next week in New Delhi on water sharing and a
range of other issues have been overshadowed by the main dispute
between the two neighbors: their competing claims to the Himalayan
border region of Kashmir.
	   India had hoped progress on other issues could improve the
atmosphere to the point where Kashmir could be tackled. But
Pakistan maintains that no progress can be made until Kashmir is
resolved.
	   Since their twin independence from Britain in 1947, India and
Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, a border region divided
between them that both claim in its entirety. Their enmity and
Kashmir's central role in the rivalry became an international
concern in May, when India and Pakistan conducted underground
nuclear tests, declared themselves nuclear powers and generated
global fears of a nuclear confrontation.
	   Hopes were raised when Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif met in July and
agreed to resume peace negotiations that had been suspended in
1997. But when Pakistan's top foreign office bureaucrat and his
Indian counterpart met last month in the Pakistani capital to
discuss Kashmir, their consultations yielded little more than
pledges to meet again in February.
	   In the interim, six days of talks were scheduled beginning with
Thursday's water sharing negotiations and ending Nov. 13 with a
meeting on improving cultural relations. Other issues on the agenda
include tension across Siachen, a glacier battlefield in Kashmir; a
proposal to start bus service between the Indian capital and the
Pakistani border city of Lahore; and a possible deal for Pakistan
to sell electricity to India. Officials from both sides have said
they expect few breakthroughs in New Delhi.
	   Thursday's talks resume negotiations last held in 1992 on the
use of the Jhelum River, which flows through Kashmir.
	   Under a 1960 agreement, Pakistan was to have unrestricted use of
the waters of the Jhelum. India wants to construct a dam to control
the Jhelum's flow to make the river navigable in the dry season.
India says the dam would not affect the water flow to Pakistan, but
Pakistan has questioned whether the plan conflicts with the 1960
agreement.
	   The dispute is all the more difficult to resolve because it
involves a river in Kashmir.

Fossil find suggests parrots coexisted with dinosaurs, researcher
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; By RICK CALLAHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ An inch-long (2.5-centimeter-long) jaw
fragment suggests parrots were keeping the dinosaurs company before
a cosmic collision killed off nearly three-quarters of life on
Earth, according to research published Thursday.
	   The fossil found in Wyoming is thought to be between 65 million
and 70 million years old. If it came from a parrot, it would be
more than 10 million years older than any parrot fossil found to
date and the earliest known fossil of any existing group of land
birds.
	   But the fragment described in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature quickly drew criticism from avian experts. They said more
evidence was needed to support the author's parrot claims.
	   ``This would be such an astounding discovery that you've got to
have more evidence than just a skimpy piece of a jawbone to
identify a bird from the Cretaceous,'' said Alan Feduccia, an
evolutionary biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel
Hill.
	   Feduccia said the fossil might be that of any number of
creatures, including an ancient turtle.
	   It was found in the late 1950s in eastern Wyoming. Graduate
student Thomas A. Stidham came across it three years ago in the
fossil collection at the University of California, Berkeley.
	   Stidham said the fossil, which is shaped like the hull of a
boat, is part of the lower jaw of an ancient parrot. It has the
same shape as a parrot jaw, and X-rays of the fossil reveal a
K-shaped impression that is characteristic of parrots.
	   He dated the fossil at between 65 million and 70 million years
of age, about the time scientists believe a comet or asteroid
collision killed off the dinosaurs and many other species.
	   Others aren't so convinced.
	   Storrs Olson, curator of birds at the National Museum of Natural
History at the Smithsonian Institution, said the oldest previous
parrot fossils date to about 53 million years ago. Olson said the
skulls of those birds bear little resemblance to those of
modern-day parrots.
	   ``This is highly contentious stuff. ... Until you can find some
other bones to prove it's a bird, it's all highly dubious,'' he
said.
	   Fossils from the earliest known bird, called Archaeopteryx, have
been dated at 140 million to 150 million years old.
	   Cecile Mourer-Chauvire, a director of research at the University
of Claude Bernard in Lyon, France, who specializes in ancient
birds, said many researchers believe parrots are among the earliest
examples of land birds.
	   ``It certainly looks like a parrot jaw, so I think this is quite
possibly that of a parrot and is a significant, very interesting
finding for the history of birds,'' she said of Stidham's bone.

Security Council resolution condemns Iraq, but doesn't threaten
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS. Timing of vote uncertain, consultations to resume at
1530 GMT Thursday. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A final draft of a Security Council
resolution condemns Iraq and demands that it resume cooperation
with U.N. arms inspectors, but threatens no force if Iraq ignores
the demand.
	   The United States says it doesn't need the council's
authorization to take military action over the latest crisis with
Iraq, and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen is touring Gulf
states to try to muster support for a united stand against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
	   The resolution, expected to be adopted Thursday, puts into
international law the council's statement Saturday that condemned
Iraq's decision to halt all cooperation with inspectors as a
``flagrant violation'' of U.N. demands.
	   The U.N. Special Commission must certify that Iraq has destroyed
its weapons of mass destruction before the council will lift
8-year-old sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded neighboring
Kuwait.
	   Council members on Wednesday added a new element to the draft
that appeared to address Iraqi concerns about the council's
willingness to consider lifting the oil embargo, once U.N.
inspectors have declared Iraq is disarmed.
	   It wasn't clear, however, if that vague reference would be
enough for Iraq, which has demanded a time frame for when sanctions
would be lifted.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, suggested Wednesday that
Baghdad could reconsider its Saturday decision to halt cooperation
with inspectors if it got some indication from the council that
sanctions could be eased.
	   ``I think that would give us enough assurances'' to reverse the
decision, Hamdoon said.
	   The United States has prevented the council from giving Baghdad
those explicit assurances. But U.S. officials said Wednesday they
could go along with the revised draft resolution, which reaffirmed
the council's willingness to take up the matter of the duration of
the embargo.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh praised the resolution as
good and strong in condemning Baghdad.
	   While it doesn't threaten any force, the resolution notes past
council resolutions that threatened Iraq with the ``severest
consequences'' if it failed to allow inspectors unfettered access
to suspected weapons sites.
	   Russia, which is against using force, noted that the resolution
doesn't give the United States or anyone else a green light for
military action.

Juventus winless; Galatasaray, Kaiserslautern with key wins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Finalists the last three years in this
competition, Italy's Juventus is still without a victory in four
Champions League matches _ four games and four draws.
	   Inter Milan, another Italian power and the defending UEFA Cup
champion, also settled for a draw Wednesday. Meanwhile, lightly
regarded Galatasaray of Turkey and Germany's Kaiserslautern took
big steps toward the final eight of the Champions League with key
victories.
	   Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Dynamo Kiev also picked up
important wins _ Dynamo beating English champion Arsenal 3-0.
	   With four of the six rotations completed, German champion
Kaiserslautern is the nearest of the 24 teams to clinching a place
with 10 points _ five ahead of its closest rival in Group F. One
more point will net a quarterfinal berth.
	   Real Madrid's match in Graz, Austria, was washed out and is to
be played Thursday.
	   Here's a look at each group:
 &UR; GROUP A &QC; 
	   In Amsterdam, Netherlands, Ajax Amsterdam drew level with
Olympiakos with a 2-0 win. They both have seven points to top the
group. Richard Witschge scored on a header in the 33rd and Dean
Gorre sealed the game two minutes from time with a 20-meter (yard)
chip over Greek keeper Dimitrios Eleftheropoulos.
	   In Zagreb, Croatia, Croatia Zagreb defeated Porto 3-1. Both
clubs have four points. Mihael Mikic, 18, scored in the 7th and
Tomislav Rukavina made it 2-0 in the 37th as his long shot went in
off a defender. Nuno Jardel scored for Porto in the 39th with the
final by Edin Mujcin in the 61st.
 &UR; GROUP B &QC; 
	   In Istanbul, Turkey, striker Hakan Sukur scored two goals (55th
and 74th) as Galatasaray beat Rosenborg 3-0. Galatasaray has seven
points from four games to lead the group. Rosenborg has five
points. Arif Erdem got the Turks' other goal as Galatasaray's
Romanian striker Gheorghe Hagi missed several other key chances.
	   In Turin, Italy, Juventus of Turin, a European Champions Cup
finalist three years running, needed the help of an own-goal to
salvage its fourth straight draw in this season's competition, 1-1
against Spain's Athletic Bilbao. Julen Guerrero gave Athletic a 1-0
lead in the 45th. Athletic defender Mikel Lasa accidentally knocked
in the equalizer 21 minutes later off a corner kick mixup. Juventus
has four points and the Basques three.
 &UR; GROUP C &QC; 
	   In Graz, Austria, the Sturm Graz-Real Madrid game was washed out
and was set for Thursday. That was good news for the Austrians.
Real Madrid has six points in three matches and the Austrians have
lost all three including a 6-1 drubbing last month in Madrid.
	   In Moscow, Russia, Spartak Moscow and Inter Milan played a 1-1
draw with Diego Simeone notching the equalizer in the 89th on a
header off a free kick. Andrei Tikhonov gave Spartak the lead in
the 68th on a shot that hit the post and then went in off Inter
goalie Gianluca Pagliuca. Both clubs have seven points in four
games to lead the group, pending Sturm Graz-Real Madrid's game
Thursday.
 &UR; GROUP D &QC; 
	   In Barcelona, Spain, Bayern Munich won 2-1 to improve to seven
points, one behind Manchester United. Bayern got the winner in the
87th on a breakaway by Hasan Salihamidzic. Giovanni gave Barca a
1-0 lead in the 29th but Bayern tied in the 48th when Alexander
Zickler capitalized on a Spanish defensive error. Barca has four
points.
	   In Manchester, England, United exploded for four first-half goal
to beat Denmark's Brondby 5-0 to lead the group with eight points.
The English side beat Brondby 6-2 two weeks ago in Denmark. David
Beckham scored in the 7th with subsequent goals by Andy Cole
(13th), Phil Neville (15th), Dwight Yorke (27th) and Paul Scholes
(63rd). The Dane's played without No. 1 keeper Mogens Krogh.
 &UR; GROUP E &QC; 
	   In Kiev, Ukraine, Serhiy Rebrov, Oleksandr Holovko and Andriy
Shevchenko scored on a wet pitch as Ukraine champions Dynamo Kiev
defeated their English counterparts Arsenal 3-1. The win gave
Dynamo five points in four games, the same as Arsenal and Lens.
Rebrov scored on a penalty in the 27th, Holovko made it 2-0 on a
header in the 62nd, and Shevchenko, regarded as the best striker in
Europe, showed why in the 72nd on a perfectly struck free kick.
	   In Athens, Leonidas Vokolos scored in the 52nd for a 1-0 win for
Panathinaikos over Lens and first place in the tightest of the six
groups. The Greeks have six points. Vokolos scored off a free kick
by Nikos Limberopoulos.
 &UR; GROUP F &QC; 
	   In Kasierslautern, Germany, the German champions rallied for a
3-1 win over PSV, which played two-thirds of the match a man down.
The Germans have 10 points atop the group with Heslinki No. 2 with
five. PSV has three in last place. Ruud van Nistelrooy gave PSV a
1-0 lead in the 18th, but Juergen Rische got the equalizer in the
68th, Marco Reich made it 2-1 in the 77th and Marian Hristov scored
another in injury time.
	   In Lisbon, Portugal, an equalizer four minutes from the end by
Brazilian striker Luiz Antonio secured a 2-2 tie for Finland's HJK
Helsinki against Benfica. Hannu Tihinen gave Helsinki a 1-0 lead in
the 4th. Nuno Gomes and Bruno Calado scored late goals for Benfica
before Anotio equalized. Benfica has four points.

Leading dissident prevented from leaving China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police have refused to allow a prominent
dissident to travel to the United States to attend a human rights
ceremony and pressured him to abandon plans to set up an opposition
party.
	   Ren Wanding said Thursday the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center
for Human Rights invited him to attend its annual awards ceremony
in Washington on Nov. 9.
	   Police in Beijing rejected his request for a passport on
Saturday, saying that as a former prisoner still under parole he
had no right to attend, Ren said.
	   The police told him ``they oppose this conference,'' Ren said in
a telephone interview. ``I protested, saying I did have the right
and that they were wrong not to let me go.''
	   Ren and fellow dissident Wei Jingsheng received the Robert F.
Kennedy Memorial Human Rights Award in 1994. Both were in prison at
the time. Wei was given a medical parole last year and went into
exile in the United States.
	   Ren finished a seven-year jail term in 1996 for making speeches
during the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989.
According to his sentence, however, he has been stripped of his
political rights until next June.
	   In defiance of those terms, Ren has recently joined efforts to
set up an opposition party and has been interrogated and placed
under police surveillance.
	   Ren, who has spent 11 of the last 19 years in prison, also said
that the police pressure had forced him to temporarily put off
trying to register a branch of the China Democracy Party in
Beijing.
	   Dissidents in at least nine provinces and major cities have
attempted, as required by law, to register the party since June. So
far, authorities have refused their requests and detained many of
its members, mostly for short periods.
	   A veteran activist, Ren advocated multi-party democracy during
the 1978-1979 Democracy Wall movement, when campaigners posted
impassioned manifestos on a brick wall in Beijing. He then spent
1979-1983 in prison, including two years in solitary confinement.
	   Meanwhile, another Beijing-based dissident, Gao Hongming, has
written a letter protesting the rejection of his candidacy for a
seat in the city legislature, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Gao, who spent two years in a labor camp after the 1989
crackdown on the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, was one of three
dissidents who had sought and failed to be approved to run for the
city legislature in elections this month.

Macau governor protests proposals to deny Macanese citizenship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ Macau's governor has protested a proposal by
Chinese officials that effectively would force Portuguese nationals
born in the colony to adopt Chinese nationality after it reverts to
Chinese rule next year.
	   Chinese officials have suggested that all Macanese _ Portuguese
nationals of Portuguese descent born in Macau _ should be regarded
as foreign residents unless they drop their Portuguese nationality
to become Chinese nationals.
	   That would strip them of their rights as Macau citizens,
including the ability to become principal government officials or
to run for certain public office.
	   Macau, a small territory of about 450,000 people south of
mainland China, returns to Chinese administration on Dec. 20, 1999,
after 442 years of Portuguese rule.
	   Under the latest proposal, Portuguese nationals who are ethnic
Chinese would automatically become Chinese nationals after the
handover, losing their right to Portuguese consular protection in
China, said Heidi Ho, a Macau government spokeswoman.
	   Governor Gen. Vasco Rocha Vieira described the proposal as a
``setback'' which failed to take into account the territory's
``specific reality,'' according to a statement issued by the Macau
government on Thursday.
	   Macanese ``have the right to claim Portuguese nationality,'' the
governor said.
	   The proposals still need approval by Beijing leaders, Ho said.
	   About a quarter of Macau's population is made up of Portuguese
nationals, most of them ethnic Chinese. About 10,000 are Macanese.
	   Portugal agreed to concede sovereignty to China in 1974, back
when remaining pieces of the once-vast Portuguese empire were being
dismantled. Negotiations so far have gone relatively smoothly.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of new shelling along Kashmir border. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan opened talks Thursday
on a water sharing dispute as part of an attempt to improve
relations between the nuclear rivals, even as they continued
skirmishing along the border in Kashmir.
	   Talks over the next week in New Delhi on water sharing and a
range of other issues have been overshadowed by the main dispute
between the two neighbors: their competing claims to the Himalayan
border region of Kashmir.
	   India had hoped progress on other issues could improve the
atmosphere to the point where Kashmir could be tackled. But
Pakistan maintains that no progress can be made until Kashmir is
resolved.
	   Since their twin independence from Britain in 1947, India and
Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, a border region divided
between them that both claim in its entirety.
	   The two sides regularly skirmish along the Kashmir border.
Indian police reported Thursday that three civilians were killed by
a Pakistani shell that landed in a northwestern region of the
Indian-held portion of Kashmir Wednesday night.
	   Their enmity and Kashmir's central role in the rivalry became an
international concern in May, when India and Pakistan conducted
underground nuclear tests, declared themselves nuclear powers and
generated global fears of a nuclear confrontation.
	   Hopes were raised when Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif met in July and
agreed to resume peace negotiations that had been suspended in
1997. But when Pakistan's top foreign office bureaucrat and his
Indian counterpart met last month in the Pakistani capital to
discuss Kashmir, their consultations yielded little more than
pledges to meet again in February.
	   In the interim, six days of talks were scheduled beginning with
Thursday's water sharing negotiations and ending Nov. 13 with a
meeting on improving cultural relations. Other issues on the agenda
include tension across Siachen, a glacier battlefield in Kashmir; a
proposal to start bus service between the Indian capital and the
Pakistani border city of Lahore; and a possible deal for Pakistan
to sell electricity to India. Officials from both sides have said
they expect few breakthroughs in New Delhi.
	   Thursday's talks resume negotiations last held in 1992 on the
use of the Jhelum River, which flows through Kashmir.
	   Under a 1960 agreement, Pakistan was to have unrestricted use of
the waters of the Jhelum. India wants to construct a dam to control
the Jhelum's flow to make the river navigable in the dry season.
India says the dam would not affect the water flow to Pakistan, but
Pakistan has questioned whether the plan conflicts with the 1960
agreement.
	   The dispute is all the more difficult to resolve because it
involves a river in Kashmir.

Mitch devastates agricultural economies across Central America

<TEXT>
	   EL PROGRESO, Honduras (AP) _ Bananas, one of the top sources of
income for this impoverished Central American country, rot in
fields flooded by the deadly Hurricane Mitch.
	   Children grab the few bunches of bananas undamaged by the
flooding at the Chiquita Brands plantation and try to sell them for
as much as dlrs 1.50 a bunch to the hungry. That's more than twice
the going rate and about a third of what the average unskilled
worker earns in a day.
	   ``We don't have anything to eat and no way of making money to
buy food,'' a teen-age boy who gave his name only as Angel said as
he scrambled out of a muddy field with bananas on his back.
	   Mitch's rampage has delivered a devastating blow to the
economies of Honduras and other Central American nations, which
were just beginning to thrive after the region's civil wars of the
1980s.
	   Hugo Noe-Pino, the Honduran ambassador to the United Nations,
estimates 70 percent of the nation's economic output has been lost.
Development efforts were put back at least 30 years, he said.
	   ``This is Honduras' worst disaster in more than 100 years,''
said Billy Handal, one of the country's three vice presidents.
``Ninety percent of the banana production was affected.''
	   The hardship here is expected to spread throughout Honduras and
neighboring countries deluged last week by Mitch as floodwaters
recede and the damage to crops _ and the roads needed to get them
to market _ becomes better known.
	   Coffee and banana crops _ the two most important sources of
export income for Honduras _ were hit especially hard. And rain
ripped apart about 70 percent of the infrastructure, essential for
export in Nicaragua and Honduras.
	   Costa Rica lost 112,000 130-pound (59-kilo) bags of its 1998-99
coffee crop to the storm, the Costa Rican Coffee Institute said. In
Guatemala, up to 25 percent of the harvest was lost, said the
Guatemalan Coffee Association.
	   ``Without roads, there is no coffee,'' said Ruben Pineda,
director of the Salvadoran Coffee Council, which is still assessing
crop and infrastructure damage there.
	   The roads to Santo Tomas, which handles 85 percent of the
Guatemala's coffee exports, are inaccessible. So is the road to
Puerto Quetzalcoatl, which handles the other 15 percent.
	   Central American countries account for nearly 8 percent of world
coffee supplies, and their quality arabicas, favored by American
coffee drinkers, are shipped in large part to the United States.
	   But because Mitch's torrential rain damaged crops and washed
away roads and bridges that farmers use to transport harvested
arabica beans to ports for shipping, coffee traders fear they
cannot make delivery. Coffee futures soared this week on the Board
of Trade in New York.
	   Sugar futures also soared in New York this week amid fears Mitch
may have wiped out much of Guatemala's cane sugar.
	   It will take years and billions of dollars for the regions'
economies years to recover, government officials say.
	   Fernando Sanchez, general manager here for Chiquita Brands,
estimated banana crop damage at dlrs 850 million at its operations
on the Atlantic coast, where Mitch first struck land after its
winds swelled to 180 mph (290 kph). ``And those are just the
preliminary estimates,'' he said.
	   At its headquarters in Cincinnati, Chiquita Brands International
Inc. said it was focusing more now on relief efforts for workers
and residents. Steven Warshaw, Chiquita's president, said he
expects little or no banana production from the storm-damaged
region into 1999.
	   Floodwaters on the main road leading from the Chiquita
plantation outside El Progreso began to recede this week. But
farther down the road, traffic is blocked by thick mud and
shattered bridges.
	   While the damage makes it extremely difficult to get coffee,
bananas and sugar to market, the government is now more worried
about getting food, water and medicine to isolated, flood-damaged
communities.
	   In the town of El Progreso, most homes were still covered with
thick layers of mud.
	   ``We are desperate here,'' said Gloria Marina Alvarado, who used
buckets to carry mud out of her modest wooden home.

Tokyo stocks finish lower, dollar rises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo share prices finished lower Thursday as
investors took profits following the previous day's sharp gains.
The U.S. dollar rose against the yen as midterm election results
eased concern over a possible impeachment of President Bill
Clinton.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 186.44 points,
or 1.28 percent, closing the day's trading at 14,341.37. On
Wednesday, the average surged 575.06 points, or 4.12 percent.
	   The dollar bought 117.78 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.14
yen from late in Tokyo on Wednesday and also above its late New
York level of 116.60 yen overnight.
	   Stocks bounced back as traders locked in profits after the
Nikkei soared Wednesday on comments by influential Morgan Stanley
strategist Barton Biggs, who said Tokyo shares were undervalued.
	   Reports in a major Japanese business daily on Thursday that the
government will delay debating income, corporate and housing tax
cuts until the regular Parliament session next year, rather than
during an extra session this year, also hurt sentiment.
	   ``The market's uncertain situation is continuing,'' said Sachio
Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 2.79 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,104.57. The
TOPIX closed up 41.52 points, or 3.90 percent Wednesday.
	   In currency trading, the dollar gained against the yen as
Japanese banks and investors bought the greenback following the
results of Tuesday's U.S. elections, in which the Democratic
Party's made a stronger-than-expected showing.
	   The results allayed worries over the increasing likelihood that
President Clinton would be impeached, and lifted the Dow Jones
Industrial Average up 76.99 points to 8,783.14 at Wednesday's
close.
	   Traders said investors who had held short, or oversold dollar
positions ahead of the midterm election were now buying back the
U.S. currency.
	   Also hurting the yen were news reports that Japanese banks are
having trouble raising funds overseas amid concern over the health
of major Japanese financial institutions, traders said.
	   ``Although people were fearful of the dollar dropping below 110
yen, the election results helped to ease the uncertainty,'' said
Shinji Imanishi, chief foreign exchange dealer at Sumitomo Trust
and Banking.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.845 percent from Wednesday's finish of
0.870 percent, driving its price up to 108.48 yen from 108.24 yen.

Swiss report says anti-Semitism revived by Holocaust controversy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Latent anti-Semitism in Switzerland has come into
the open in the wake of controversy over the country's role in
World War II, a government panel said Thursday.
	   But after 50 years in which anti-Semitism was dismissed as
marginal, the Swiss are at last coming to grips with the
phenomenon, the Federal Commission against Racism said in a 72-page
report.
	   The report, commissioned by the government in March 1997,
estimated that one-tenth of the population holds anti-Semitic
views, but more could be influenced by propaganda.
	   Switzerland is no exception to its European neighbors in having
a long tradition of underlying anti-Semitism, the panel said.
However, it found that prejudice against Jews is unorganized and
rarely has links to right-wing extremism.
	   Following prolonged international pressure, particularly from
Jewish groups, Switzerland's two biggest banks in August agreed to
pay Holocaust survivors dlrs 1.25 billion in compensation for
wartime losses.
	   Accusations that Switzerland acted as banker to Nazi Germany and
other criticism of its wartime record caused widespread resentment
in Switzerland itself.
	   ``Comments by various politicians and a few flame-fanning
newspaper headlines helped to heat up the situation,'' the
commission said.
	   In early 1997, then-President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz caused an
international outcry by labeling as ``blackmail'' Jewish demands
for a dlrs 250 million Holocaust compensation fund.
	   Delamuraz eventually apologized but his comments were supported
by a large number of Swiss, the report said.
	   ``(Last year) a wave of anti-Semitism manifested itself in
letters to newspapers, in threatening letters to prominent Jewish
figures and organizations, and in everyday situations in which Jews
were and continue to be insulted and ostracized,'' the report said.
	   Jewish organizations received hundreds of letters, many of them
sympathetic, it continued. But many writers of anti-Semitic letters
signed their names, it noted.
	   Work on the study was completed shortly before the settlement.
But it cautioned that the accord ``may arouse new signs of
anti-Semitism in Switzerland.''
	   Anti-Semitism in Switzerland this century has largely been
linked to its resistance to the ``encroachment of foreign
elements,'' the report said.
	   Detailing government, church and private initiatives to fight
anti-Semitism, the commission called on politicians to take a clear
position against it.
	   A planned dlrs 5 billion foundation to aid victims of genocide,
war and natural disasters should also promote projects to fight the
problem, the panel said, adding that the subject must also be dealt
with in schools, workplaces and the army.
	   Switzerland's 1995 anti-racism law outlaws the belittling of the
Holocaust. About 100 cases have so far made it to court, 55 of them
involving anti-Semitism charges.

Police witness at dissident trial says he would lie

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's top intelligence chief,
testifying Thursday in the corruption and sexual misconduct trial
of dissident Anwar Ibrahim, said he might lie under oath if ordered
to do so by his bosses.
	   Attorneys for the ousted deputy prime minister resumed their
cross-examination of Mohamed Said Awang, who on Wednesday accused
Anwar of meddling with the police investigation into his alleged
sexual misdeeds.
	   Christopher Fernando, one of Anwar's nine defense attorneys,
asked him: ``If someone higher than the deputy prime minister were
to instruct you to come and lie to the court here, would you do
it?''
	   Mohamed replied: ``Depends on the situation.''
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul interjected, looking somewhat
alarmed, ``So you may lie?''
	   ``I may or I may not,'' the witness replied.
	   Gasps erupted through the public gallery of the federal
courthouse filled with journalists, international human rights
activists and members of Anwar's family.
	   ``From your answer, you are a most unscrupulous man,'' said
Fernando.
	   Anwar, 51, sacked as deputy prime minister and finance minister
Sept. 2, faces 10 counts of abuse of power and sexual misconduct.
He denies the charges and says they were fabricated because Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad considered his popularity a threat to his
17-year rule.
	   Mohamed on Wednesday accused Anwar of trying to force police to
cover up his alleged sexual misconduct. He testified that Anwar
demanded intelligence officers to use a secret method called
``Operation Turning Over'' to intimidate two people who had accused
him of sexual misbehavior.
	   A statement by Anwar's personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, said
Anwar sodomized him 15 times. The other, by Ummi Hasilda Ali, the
sister of Anwar's private secretary, said her brother's wife had
sex with Anwar.
	   Mohamed testified Wednesday the cover-up method, a ``great
secret'' he declined to reveal in court, worked. The two gave him
retractions that Anwar demanded be forwarded to Mahathir.
	   On Thursday, Mohamed became flustered and dodged defense
questions about how the Special Branch ``neutralized'' suspects
they deemed uncooperative.
	   Mohamed said he agreed to get the retractions from Ummi and
Azizan despite believing the sexual allegations.
	   The 54-year-old Mohamed, on leave prior to his retirement,
denied he was afraid of losing his pension.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2, saying he was morally unfit to
lead the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Since Anwar's arrest Sept. 20, tens of thousands of Malaysians
have participated in street protests demanding his release and
Mahathir's resignation.
	   During the trial, Anwar has been spending most of his time in
the dock taking notes on large sheets of paper and paying close
attention to the arguments.
	   During breaks, either for lunch or when the judge leaves the
courtroom, Anwar talks to his family or foreign diplomats who have
been attending the trial that is being closely watched by human
rights groups worldwide.
	   On Thursday, his 13-year-old son Mohamed Ihsan stroked his
father's hand while Anwar spoke with his wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   The case attracted international attention after Anwar showed up
at his arraignment Sept. 29 with a black eye and bruises. He
claimed police beat him after his arrest.
	   In another development, the national news agency Bernama
confirmed earlier reports that Mahathir is among the 52 people the
prosecution plans to call as witnesses.
	   Others in the list are Mahathir's chief economic advisor, Daim
Zainuddin, Malaysia's police chief, Abdul Rahim Noor, former
members of Anwar's staff and 20 police officers.

China studying possibility of holding 2008 Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China said Thursday it is studying whether to bid
for the 2008 Olympic Games, despite having lost the 2000 Olympics
to Sydney.
	   ``We are actively researching the possibility,'' said Wu Shaozu,
president of the Chinese Olympic Committee. ``The moment there's a
result, we'll let everyone know.''
	   Wu said countries have until February 2000 to make up their
minds.
	   ``There's still time,'' Wu said at a news conference about
China's participation at the Asian Games in Thailand next month.
	   The Olympic Committee's research is being carried out at the
prompting of the government, and a team has been established for
the task, said the committee's press director, He Huixian.
	   The cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in the south all
hope to hold the games and are equipped to handle major sporting
events, she said.
	   Pressed as to whether China would indeed bid, He said: ``We are
quite positive.''
	   ``The government supports our research,'' she said. ``Of course
we need the government's support and approval.''
	   Beijing lost to Sydney by two votes in the selection for the
2000 Games host in 1993. China chose not to pursue the 2004
Olympics.

Israelis, Palestinians slug it out over Mideast accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ ``Read to the end of the sentence!'' Israeli
Cabinet secretary Dan Naveh screamed, waving a copy of the new
Mideast accord in the face of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
senior aide.
	   ``You're ripping the soul out of the agreement!'' retorted Ahmed
Tibi, jabbing his finger angrily in the air.
	   Only 10 days have passed since the two negotiators sat in the
East Room of the White House applauding while their bosses signed a
new peace agreement. But in sharp contrast to the warm smiles,
handshakes and talk of partnership in Washington, the atmosphere
back home has been more like a grudge match between two college
football teams from the same state.
	   Implementation of the accord was to have begun already, but all
that's happened so far are delays, finger-pointing and nasty public
debates like the Naveh-Tibi exchange aired Wednesday on Israel TV.
	   Naveh and Tibi appeared together on the weekly news program
called ``One on One,'' to explain their interpretations of the
land-for-security deal. There was no sign of new trust _ only
sparks, flames and bad blood.
	   Talk of Israel's latest demand that the Palestinians arrest 30
suspected terrorists deteriorated quickly into a test of lung
power. Naveh insisted the Palestinians hand over a timetable for
arresting the suspects. Tibi said that wasn't part of the
agreement.
	   ``What is this, a kids game?'' Tibi yelled. ``Is that how you
deal with security, by broadcasting all your plans on Israeli
television and radio?'' Tibi said Israel was looking for excuses to
avoid carrying out the agreement, which calls for it to hand over
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control.
	   Dressed in dark suits and ties, the two men leaned forward in
their seats and shouted at each other mostly in Hebrew, switching
to English when they read parts of the accord aloud. Attempts by
the moderator to get a word in or calm the two men were ignored.
	   Similar debates have raged between other officials. Senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and David Bar-Illan, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, have angrily traded
blame on television for delays relating to the accord.
	   Half way through Wednesday's 30-minute debate between Naveh and
Tibi, Naveh said, ``I'm very sorry to hear that before the ink is
dry, a representative of Yasser Arafat says here that he will
violate it.''
	   Tibi shot back: ``Did you even read the agreement?''
	   Naveh countered: ``While you were giving interviews to the
press, I was busy writing it.''

	   The Russian Constitution says a president may only serve two
terms. But some of Yeltsin's supporters argued that his first term
should not count against the limit, because it began in 1991,
before the current constitution was adopted in 1993.
	   Yeltsin's poor health would appear to rule out another
presidential bid. The president has given conflicting signals about
his plans, though in recent months he has been saying he would not

Russian court says Yeltsin can't run for a third term

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's highest court said Thursday that Boris
Yeltsin cannot seek a third term as president because he already
has been elected twice, the limit under the Russian Constitution.
	   The announcement by the Constitutional Court was a bit vague,
but appeared to rule out the possibility that Yeltsin could run for
another term when elections are planned in the year 2000.
	   The Russian Constitution says a president may only serve two
terms. But some of Yeltsin's supporters argued that his first term
should not count against the limit, because it began in 1991,
before the current constitution was adopted in 1993.
	   Yeltsin's poor health would appear to rule out another
presidential bid. The president has given conflicting signals about
his plans, though in recent months he has been saying he would not
run again.
	   Yeltsin is currently recuperating from his latest illness at the
Black Sea resort of Sochi in southern Russia.
	   The president's critics have been saying that Yeltsin is not
physically fit to run the country and should resign. The president
insists he does not have any serious health problems and will serve
out his tenure.
	   Thursday's announcement came on the second anniversary of
Yeltsin's quintuple heart bypass surgery, which sidelined him for
months in 1996. The president has been ill several times since
then, and has been working only sporadically in recent months.

Thousands storm police station, trying to get at suspected killers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of villagers stormed a West
Java police station sheltering four people they suspected of having
a hand in a wave of mysterious murders, police said Thursday.
	   At least seven policemen were hurt in the attack Wednesday in
Kuningan, about 270 kilometers (168 miles) southeast of Jakarta.
	   Vigilantes throughout the main island of Java have taken revenge
against people they believe were involved in a wave of mysterious
killings that began in August in the East Java region of
Banyuwangi. More than 150 Muslim clerics and people believed to
have been dabbling in black magic have been killed.
	   Mobs taking revenge for those deaths in turn have killed dozens
of people.
	   At Kuningan, police refused to hand over four people transferred
to the station by villagers who had captured them earlier in the
day, said Ebo Rianto, an officer at the police station.
	   Police had to fire blanks and tear gas to disperse the mob,
which pelted the station with stones and bottles, injuring seven
policemen, he added.
	   Vigilantes in a nearby village had seized a car carrying six
people roaming its streets at dawn Wednesday, but two of them
escaped. They then took the remaining four to the police station.
	   Later, thousands of villagers went to the station to demand that
police hand over the four for punishment.
	   Meanwhile, the newspaper Suara Karya reported that police have
shot two suspects to death and wounded five others since three
police officers were killed last week on Madura Island, off Java's
northeastern coast.
	   Forty suspects, including two women, were also arrested.
	   Fear prevails in many small towns, where mobs have lynched
people suspected of carrying out the murders. In many areas,
mentally ill people have become scapegoats.
	   Muslim leaders have warned they will deploy their own civilian
security forces if the military is unable to restore order.

	   EL OJOCHAL, Nicaragua (AP) _ In a former peanut field a few
miles (kilometers) from the Casitas volcano, brigades of health
ministry workers walked over the mud burning bodies with flame
throwers made from pesticide sprayers.
	   There were so many bodies in one small area _ 36 burned, 10
waiting to be buried _ that they were running low on diesel fuel
Wednesday.
	   ``We've been over less than a square kilometer (440 yards) and
we've burned that many. There are 80 square kilometers (32 square
miles), so just imagine,'' said Carlos Curtado, a Health Ministry
official.
	   Two hundred more corpses were found Wednesday in this disaster
zone in western Nicaragua, boosting the civil defense's confirmed
death toll to 1,568. As many as 2,000 were feared dead. More than
750,000 people lost their homes or possessions across Nicaragua,
and 1,804 are listed as missing nationwide.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman _ who turned aid distribution over to
the Roman Catholic Church on Wednesday after government relief
efforts were criticized _ said he would bow to residents in
deciding whether to declare the Casitas area a national cemetery.
	   The mud, which rolled down Friday after the crater lake at the
top of Casitas collapsed, practically wiped out El Ojochal and
other villages. In Rolando Rodriguez, there were 260 house before
the mudslide; five are left. El Porvenir had 200 houses; one
remains.
	   Mariana Centeno Gonzalez, 52, lost most of her family in the
mudslide, but is housing other survivors at her thatch-roofed home
in Rolando Rodriguez.
	   ``There are a lot of people who need food and water. The
government says it is helping, but it isn't helping at all,'' she
said.
	   ``There's another type of aid going on here,'' she said, waving
toward her fellow survivors, who were helping each other get by.
	   Rescuers came out of the hills Tuesday with reports of 400
bodies found in a village called La Flor, said Dr. Juan Jose
Guadamuz. He was tending to the injured in a sesame seed packing
house that was transformed into a shelter in Posoltega.
	   Guadamuz said the rescue workers told him 30 villagers were
still alive and had survived by eating dogs and pigs that were
feeding on human bodies. The survivors told rescuers they did not
want to leave for fear that what little they had left would be
stolen.
	   Mayor Felicita Zeledon of Posoltega said about 400 people have
walked out of the region since the mudslides began and 450
survivors were believed still stranded and in need of help.
	   Rescue workers heard cries for help in the hills Tuesday, but
were unable to reach the people, said Isaac Travers of the Red
Cross in Chinandega. They planned to try again, he said.
	   At a packed hospital in Chinandega, 10-year-old Norlan Javier
Ocejo screamed in pain when a nurse lifted him onto his hospital
bed. The open wounds across his back were stuck to the bandages
again.
	   ``I want to go home!'' he screamed, a trickle of blood flowing
down his leg. ``I want my mommy!''
	   Norlan's mother and father were at the hospital, but his older
brother and younger sister were missing and presumed dead in El
Porvenir.
	   With heavy rain still falling, the government has urged people
near Casitas and eight other volcanos to evacuate for fear of new
mudslides.
	   A magnitude-3.2 earthquake was reported Wednesday near the
Casitas peak, but lava flows from nearby Cerro Negro volcano, which
began Tuesday, appeared to have stopped. No injuries or damages
were reported in either incident.
	   Central American officials say more than 9,000 people died in
floods and mudslides triggered by Mitch, one of the strongest
hurricanes ever to hit the Caribbean.

USET tries to regain its footing in Olympic race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARGARET LILLARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A year ago, the U.S. Equestrian Team's show
jumping squad looked as powerful and smooth as one of its best
four-legged competitors on a flawless run.
	   The team won an Olympic silver medal and one Nations' Cup
victory after another, right up to the 1997 National Horse Show.
	   Then the stumbles started _ and continued _ and the team is now
at risk of missing the 2000 Olympics.
	   A chastened, determined USET returns to Madison Square Garden
Thursday night hoping that the home turf of the 115th National
Horse Show will be the place to start turning around the disastrous
slide.
	   The team competes Friday in the Nations Cup, and the show ends
Sunday with the dlrs 50,000 Budweiser Grand Prix of New York.
	   The show jumpers got on a roll with the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta, where the squad won a silver medal. Then a first-place
finish at the 1996 National kicked off its most successful season
since 1968, ending with the Samsung Nations Cup series title.
	   A decisive win at last year's National seemed a good sign as the
team prepared for the Olympic-qualifying World Equestrian Games.
	   To concentrate on the games, held every four years, the team cut
back on its Nations Cup participation, entering only nine of the 30
cup events worldwide.
	   It won just two. And when the world competition began in Rome
last month, the momentum was gone. The USET show jumpers finished
ninth.
	   ``It just seemed this year the teams were lackluster,'' chef
d'equipe George Morris said. ``It didn't seem the horses were in
the same form. ... At the end of the day, we just didn't have a
very good day in Rome. There are no excuses.''
	   To earn a spot in the Olympics, the show jumping team must
finish no lower than fourth at the 1999 Pan-American Games in
Winnipeg. The team got a bronze in Buenos Aires three years ago.
	   The low point in Rome was the performance of three-time Olympic
veteran Anne Kursinski and Eros, her rock-steady mount in Atlanta
and the top international horse at the 1995 National.
	   The two had been expected to be the show jumping team's
cornerstone. But in the Nations Cup competition, Kursinski and Eros
collected 12 faults in the first round and 13 in the second.
	   Kursinski said Eros was uncharacteristically nervous. Teammate
Margie Goldstein-Engle, the top-ranked U.S. rider at this week's
National, sympathized.
	   ``Any given day can be like that. It's hard (to tell why)
because you can't talk to the horse,'' she said. ``A horse with a
big heart will reach down and give a big performance. The same
horse on a different day on the same course may not do as well.''
	   Kursinski and Eros came back two weeks later to win the dlrs
450,000 Pulsar Crown Grand Prix in Monterrey, Mexico, one of seven
wins and six second-place finishes in 14 classes for the 10-member
USET show jumping team.
	   At the same time, a smaller squad _ Goldstein-Engle, McLain
Ward, and Mark and Peter Leone _ won the Nations Cup at the
Washington International Horse Show in Landover, Maryland.
	   Hopes are high that autumn's three North American shows _
Washington, New York and the Toronto Royal Agricultural Winter Fair
_ will launch the team's recovery this year.
	   The USET has been the National's top international team 23 times
since 1970 and has won its Nations Cup 30 times since 1957.
	   Goldstein-Engle will be joined by Alison Firestone, Leslie
Burr-Howard and Eric Hasbrouck, competing against teams from France
and Canada.

Border says Warne likely to miss three tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Warne and chief of selectors &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian cricket captain and
current selector Allan Border says star spinner Shane Warne may be
left out of the opening three Ashes tests against England for his
own good.
	   Border doused Warne's optimism that he might recover from a
shoulder injury in time to play in the opening test in Brisbane
from Nov. 20.
	   Writing in a syndicated newspaper column Thursday, Border said
Warne would likely miss the first two tests to prevent him causing
further damage to his injured shoulder.
	   ``Given an incident-free comeback to first class cricket and a
spotless report from the specialists, the best-case scenario is for
Warne to return in the third test in Adelaide from Dec. 15,''
Border wrote. ``But, in my view, the more realistic date is the
fourth test in Melbourne on (Dec. 26).''
	   Warne bowled for the first time since surgery in April during a
district cricket match last weekend. He got a wicket with his third
ball and finished with 1-13 from six overs.
	   He had hoped to make Victoria's team for the Sheffield Shield
match being played against New South Wales in Melbourne but was
left out and has one more Shield chance before the first test.
	   Chief of selectors Trevor Hohns said Warne would miss all five
tests if it was necessary.
	   ``If it takes one, two, three, four or even five Tests, Shane
won't be coming back until he's 100 per cent fit,'' Hohns said.
	   Warne said he would be guided by the selectors.
	   ``They have my best interests at heart, the selectors, whatever
they say is the right way to go,'' Warne said Thursday. ``I think
we've always said from day one that we won't be rushing it, so
whatever test, whenever it is, it will be when my shoulder is
right.
	   Border's statements were the strongest indication yet that the
selectors would take a hard-line on Warne.
	   ``Only last week there were headlines about Shane bowling 30
balls in the nets,'' Border wrote. ``You simply cannot go from
bowling 30 balls at moderate intensity to delivering 80 test match
overs at maximum intensity within three weeks.''
	   Border said he had spoken to Warne on the phone and the
match-winning leg-spinner had raised the possibility of a return
for the first test.
	   ``I have said to him `you have some serious talking to do to
convince me that would be possible,''' Border wrote.
	   Border played a record 156 test matches and is the highest
run-scorer in test cricket. He said Australia had begun to adopt a
tougher stance on injured players.
	   ``We want him for five to seven years,'' said Border. ``One
extra month on the sidelines is not a big price to pay.''
	   Warne has dominated England since his first ball in Ashes
conflict, a leg-spinner which knocked over Mike Gatting's off
stump.
	   England team management made a special effort to counter Warne
on this tour, handing out an extensive document detailing the art
of leg-spin. The tourists brought former Australian test bowler
Peter Philpott on tour as their spin doctor and shortly after
arrival the squad had a clinic where they were shown how to bowl
like Warne.
	   Australia unveiled another promising leg-spinner in Pakistan
last month when Stuart MacGill took nine wickets in Australia's
decisive first test victory in Rawalpindi.

Russian court says Yeltsin can't run for a third term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with comment from court. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's highest court said Thursday that Boris
Yeltsin cannot seek a third term as president because he already
has been elected twice, the limit under the Russian Constitution.
	   The announcement by the Constitutional Court should finally
settle the question on whether Yeltsin is permitted to run for
re-election in the year 2000. The court noted that Yeltsin himself
has all but ruled out running for a third term, and a presidential
aide said the court's decision was correct.
	   ``As a guarantor of the constitution, the president himself has
repeatedly said he wouldn't run again in the year 2000 because that
would contradict the current constitution,'' the court said in its
verdict.
	   The Russian Constitution says a president may only serve two
terms. But some of Yeltsin's supporters argued that his first term
should not count against the limit, because it began in 1991,
before the current constitution was adopted in 1993.
	   Yeltsin had been coy about whether he would seek a third term,
letting aides promote the idea. He appeared to have given up the
idea in recent months as speculation has mounted about the state of
his health.
	   Yeltsin is currently recuperating from his latest illness at the
Black Sea resort of Sochi in southern Russia.
	   ``It has been clear for the president. He said he wouldn't run
again,'' Mikhail Mityukov, Yeltsin's envoy to the Constitutional
Court said after the verdict. ``This case has been inspired by the
political games in (parliament).''
	   Alexi Zakharov, one of the lawmakers who asked the court to rule
on whether Yeltsin could seek a third term, said the decision was a
victory for democracy.
	   He said the verdict would entrench constitutional rule and
prevent abuses of power, and he also praised Yeltsin for his
contributions to democracy.
	   ``We should thank the president, he was among those who gave us
freedom. But he should leave on time, in accordance with the law,
without provoking a riot and let people use this freedom,'' said
the member of the liberal Yabloko faction.
	   The president's critics have been saying that Yeltsin is not
physically fit to run the country and should resign. The president
insists he does not have any serious health problems and will serve
out his tenure.
	   Thursday's announcement came on the second anniversary of
Yeltsin's quintuple heart bypass surgery, which sidelined him for
months in 1996. The president has been ill several times since
then, and has been working only sporadically in recent months.

Mahathir, Goh announce thaw in frosty relations

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Frosty relations between Malaysia
and Singapore thawed significantly Thursday as the prime ministers
of the Southeast Asian neighbors met and agreed to improve ties.
	   Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad met for two hours in the VIP lounge of
the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
	   ``We talked about how we can improve relations with each
other,'' Mahathir told a news conference. Foreign reporters were
initially barred from the conference, but later allowed in.
	   He said the two leaders agreed their officials would curb the
heated attacks on each other.
	   ``The two of us will not say anything,'' he said.
	   Goh's surprise visit followed squabbles between the two nations
over a host of issues ranging from airspace to the location of a
railroad station.
	   It was the first top-level meeting between the two countries
since relations, testy even before the added pressure of the Asian
financial crisis, started to deteriorate rapidly earlier this year.
They last met in April.
	   Mahathir said he intended to raise funds from neighboring
Singapore to help during the economic crisis, though he didn't say
how much or what the money would be used for.
	   Goh had little to add except that ``we are resuming a
discussion'' and that he was pleased by Mahathir's invitation to
meet with him.
	   ``The differences will be there,'' Goh said. ``But the main
thing is to narrow the differences.'' He left for Singapore soon
after lunch with Mahathir.
	   In recent months, the neighbors have argued over the location of
a border post and the cancellation of automatic flyover rights for
Singaporean military aircraft using Malaysian airspace.
	   Malaysia's withdrawal from joint military exercises, and a halt
to trading of Malaysian stocks and currencies in Singapore, have
also strained ties.
	   Criticism of past Malaysian leaders as corrupt and morally lax
in Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew's recently released
memoirs only added to the tensions.
	   Last month, Mahathir said his country would find it difficult to
be friendly again with Singapore, saying the island republic had
not shown the sensitivity of a good neighbor.
	   Soon after, Goh urged the people of his small city-state to
remain mentally tough amid tensions with its larger neighbor.
	   Thursday's meeting moved toward resolving the sensitive issue of
sharing water, Mahathir said.
	   Under agreements set forth in two treaties, about half of the
water consumed daily by Singaporeans comes from Malaysia. One of
those treaties expires in 2011 and the other in 2061. Singapore
wants a clearly defined, long-term treaty.
	   Mahathir said Malaysia would determine the demand, ``so that we
can meet Singapore's requirement.''
	   Singapore's military aircraft would be given immediate clearance
to overfly Malaysia if the planes were on a rescue or emergency
mission, Mahathir said.
	   Britain allowed Singapore to govern itself in 1959, with Lee
Kwan Yew as prime minister. In 1963, Singapore was incorporated
into Malaysia, an experiment that failed two years later after
wrangling between Lee and the late Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku
Abdul Rahman.
	   Since then, the two countries have gone through periods of
hostility. But Singapore still remains Malaysia's third-largest
trade partner and an important gateway into Malaysia. More than
200,000 Malaysians cross over to Singapore each day to work.

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela (AP) _ Former President Carlos Andres
Perez is switching roles with the rebellious soldier who once tried
to overthrow him.
	   As president, Perez had Hugo Chavez arrested for his attempted
coup. Six years later, Perez is under arrest and Chavez is leading
the polls to become president.
	   But at 76, Perez, twice president and still one of Latin
America's most controversial politicians, is refusing to disappear
into the night. He is running for senate despite being under house
arrest on charges of illegal enrichment.
	   Defiant as ever, he's also vowing to form a ``movement of
resistance'' against Chavez, whose candidacy has polarized
Venezuela between those who favored and those who opposed the coup
attempt against Perez.
	   If Chavez wins the presidency, ``the cure is going to be worse
than the disease because he will destroy the bases of our
democracy,'' Perez told The Associated Press.
	   He spoke before being transferred last weekend from Caracas to
his home state of Tachira, where he is favored to win a senate seat
on Nov. 8.
	   If Perez does win, he will get parliamentary immunity and be
freed.
	   More than 2,000 cars, horns honking and radios blaring, joined
Perez on Saturday in a caravan to his new ``jail,'' a cousin's
house in the Andean city of San Cristobal. People cheered from
balconies and ran into the street to greet the former president,
who stood beaming in an open jeep, hands waving high above his
head.
	   The sister and mother of Cecilia Matos, Perez's fugitive
mistress, rode in a car trailing the jeep. She and Perez have been
charged with depositing illicit funds into U.S. bank accounts _ an
allegation the former president insists is false.
	   As the caravan advanced, Ms. Matos called her sister's cellular
phone from Madrid to ask about the homecoming. The sister gushed:
``They love him.''
	   Perez says he's running for senate to work on behalf of the
people of Tachira and to oppose a possible Chavez administration.
	   Chavez's campaign manager, Gen. Alberto Muller, called Perez's
campaign ``an act of cynicism.''
	   ``Anyone else would feel a little shame, would be embarrassed to
run for office again after being condemned as a thief,'' he said.
	   During his first term as president, from 1974-79, Perez oversaw
an oil boom in which many of the country's leaders became
fabulously rich. The boom had ended by the time he began his second
time in 1989, and his term was marred by rioting, two coup attempts
and his impeachment in 1993 for misuse of state funds.
	   Perez served 28 months in jail and under house arrest. He was
freed in September 1996, only to be arrested this year on separate
charges.
	   The politician, who says he awakens at 5 a.m. every day for 1{
hours of exercise, takes it all in stride.
	   At his 76th birthday party recently, about 60 guests gathered
for a catered meal at his Caracas home, where Perez smiled broadly
and a band played ``Yesterday.'' Outside, a half-dozen members of
the secret police guarded their prisoner.
	   Perez insists all charges against him are a political vendetta
by those who did not like the austerity plan he tried to impose as
president. Venezuela's old-style politicians are threatened,
Perez's supporters say, by his talent for moving the masses.
	   Perez's legal woes haven't destroyed his international
reputation as a statesman. As president, he helped solve seemingly
intractable conflicts in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama and
Bolivia. Former President Jimmy Carter, in Venezuela this week,
publicly praised Perez and called him in San Cristobal.
	   Yet Perez's ``frantic race to appear in every world forum
disconnected him from the reality of this country,'' said Jose
Vicente Rangel, the journalist who uncovered the evidence that led
to Perez's impeachment. When his defense minister warned him of
Chavez's impending coup, Perez called it ``nonsense.''
	   For millions of poor Venezuelans, Chavez has become a folk hero.
But in Rubio, the town where Perez was born, the former president
is the hero.
	   ``He's the only president they threw in jail and the only one
who's ever done anything,'' cafe owner Jose Daniel Luna said.

Four sentenced to death in China's largest tax fraud case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Four people have been sentenced to death in a 6.3
billion yuan (dlrs 760 million) tax fraud case described by state
media Thursday as China's biggest ever.
	   The case is part of a 5-year-old official battle against
corruption that has gained urgency as Beijing tries to protect
state finances amid slowing economic growth and mounting losses at
government companies. Thousands of officials have been punished for
extortion, embezzlement and other abuses.
	   The tax fraud in Jinhua County, in the southeastern province of
Zhejiang, involved 65,536 fake value-added tax invoices from 218
companies, the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily and other
official newspapers said. They did not give any details of how the
swindle was carried out.
	   Yang Shangrong, an official in the county Bureau of Finance, and
three local businessmen were sentenced to death for their role, and
85 others were arrested, the newspapers said.
	   A local Communist Party official, Ye Guoliang, was sentenced to
15 years in prison for taking bribes. Details of other sentences
were not reported.
	   In a front-page commentary, the People's Daily reminded
officials that taxes pay for economic development and urged them to
guard against fraud.
	   In another prominent case, an official in the southern island
province of Hainan was sentenced to death for taking bribes and
embezzlement, the newspaper Worker's Daily reported Thursday.
	   Qi Huogui, former Communist Party chief of the city of Dongfang,
was convicted of taking 1.9 million yuan (dlrs 227,000) in bribes
and kickbacks from 1992 to 1998 and accumulating 11 million yuan
(dlrs 1.3 million) in illegally acquired wealth, the report said.
	   His wife, Fu Rongying, former director of the Dongfang branch of
the government-owned Bank of China, was sentenced to 16 years in
prison, the newspaper said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After several delays, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Thursday presented the land-for-peace agreement with
the Palestinians to his Cabinet for approval, taking a necessary
step toward implementation of the accord.
	   The Cabinet was expected to narrowly ratify the agreement
despite vocal opposition by several ministers. However, the vote
might only be taken on Friday or even Sunday, after many hours of
debate, said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.

 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A cousin of dissident leader Anwar
Ibrahim has been arrested under a law that allows imprisonment
without trial, a news report said Thursday.
	   Zulkifli Saad was picked up by police at his office Tuesday.
Family members were informed later that he was being held under the
Internal Security Act and would be charged at a later date, the Sun
newspaper reported.
	   Police could not immediately be contacted.
	   Zulkifli's arrest brings to six the number of Anwar's associates
detained recently under the act, which allows indefinite detention
on the grounds of national security. Police had detained 12 others
who have since been released.
	   Anwar, who was fired last month as Malaysia's deputy prime
minister, went on trial Monday on charges of corruption and sexual
misconduct. Police said that once the trial ends sometime in June
1999, Anwar will face more sex-related charges.

	   Netanyahu had postponed the Cabinet meeting twice in two days,
charging that the Palestinians failed to present a time table for
the arrests of 30 suspects in the killings of nearly 100 Israelis.
	   Bar-Illan said the Cabinet was convened after Israel received
assurances from the United States on Wednesday evening that the 30
would be arrested in three stages, with the roundup to be completed
by the end of January.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank over a period of 12 weeks, with the Palestinians taking
steps against Islamic militants during each phase of the pullback.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that 12 of the
wanted men were already in detention, and that he would make an
effort to round up the others.
	   A Palestinian police official said Thursday that in all, 14 were
in jail. Several of the suspects have been in Palestinian jails for
months or years, but Palestinian security officials in the past
refused to provide exact figures.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, meanwhile, delayed his trip to
the Middle East. Ross was to arrive in the region on Thursday to
oversee implementation, but is now only expected over the weekend,
Palestinian officials said.

China to restrict ITICs as debt fears loom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Chinese regulators plan to curtail the
securities activities of state investment companies, underscoring
concern that the debt-laden corporations could threaten the Chinese
economy, officials said Thursday.
	   Such companies _ known as investment trusts, or ITICs _ have
been under scrutiny since one of the best-known, Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., was closed last month
after it couldn't pay dlrs 2 billion in foreign debt.
	   Regulators are crafting rules to curb speculative investments by
ITICs and reduce their exposure to Chinese stock markets, officials
told Dow Jones Newswires. Companies eventually would have to get
rid of their stock-trading and brokerage operations.
	   ``The long-term goal is to completely separate ITICs from the
securities industry,'' said an official of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Created in the mid-1980s, investment trusts are state-owned but
meant to propel economic reform by giving managers a free hand to
make commercial decisions without political meddling. The most
famous is China International Trust and Investment Corp., which is
owned by the Chinese Cabinet and has holdings in Hong Kong and
abroad.
	   Many raised capital by offering unusually high interest rates.
Regulations on their businesses were limited. Under pressure to
repay depositors, many ITICs got involved in real estate and other
profitable but speculative investments.
	   When the real estate market fell in 1994 after China imposed
austerity measures to stop 20 percent inflation, ITICs switched to
the stock market. Stock prices have soared in recent years, but
regulators worry about high debt loads among the companies.
	   Total overseas debts for the 240 ITICs are believed to be as
high as dlrs 10 billion.
	   Officials are moving gradually to clean up the ITICs, apparently
concerned about the effect on confidence in Chinese financial
markets and the billions of yuan deposited in the companies by
private savers.
	   Officials say most ITICs will be closed or merged with healthier
ones, paring their ranks to 40.
	   ITIC assets are believed to total some dlrs 36 billion, while
their total debts are unknown.
	   But many are technically bankrupt and only 50 to 60 percent of
assets are recoverable, a central bank official said.
	   The official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said most
companies would gradually disappear, with their businesses taken
over by securities companies and banks. The government would place
top priority on helping creditors and debtors, he said.

Shadowy ``Patriots'' group may be linked to restaurant blast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Police investigating a deadly
restaurant blast said on Thursday a shadowy new terrorist group
calling itself The Patriots may be linked to the bombing.
	   A letter sent by the previously unknown group to a local radio
station has claimed responsibility for bombing a Cape Town police
station earlier this year.
	   Though the letter does not mention the Planet Hollywood attack,
the pipe bomb used was ``forensically identical'' to the one placed
in the restaurant, police director Leonard Knipe told a news
conference.
	   Knipe also said 13 other bombings in Cape Town in recent years
had used devices with similar tell-tale signs such as tooling marks
and design, which indicated they came from a single source. The
other bombings targeted police buildings and the homes of Muslim
clerics.
	   ``An assumption can be made that the people who placed the
Planet Hollywood bomb may have placed other bombs,'' Knipe said.
	   Knipe said the letter, and the group it describes, could be a
``red herring'' but the police were following up all possible
leads. Police stressed they had no other information on such a
group.
	   The letter, postmarked on the same Aug. 25 date that the Planet
Hollywood bomb exploded, calls for a crackdown on drug dealers,
illegal bars and corrupt police officers.
	   It expresses sympathy with local Islamic vigilante organization
PAGAD, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs, but says The Patriots
are a separate group.
	   ``We, however, will remain underground and independent since our
background is strongly militaristic,'' the letter said.
	   Threatening to take further action unless its demands are met,
the group said: ``Our sincere prayer is that the taking of innocent
lives be minimal''.
	   Three people died after a bomb exploded at the bar of Planet
Hollywood in the Waterfront area, one of Cape Town's top tourist
destinations.
	   Initially a caller to a local radio station claimed the blast on
behalf of a local Islamic group, but the organization later denied
responsiblity and condemned the attack.
	   Knipe said forensic experts sifting through the debris had
recovered traces of a blue and white checked shirt, bearing the
``Soviet'' label, which was wrapped around the bomb.
	   With only 150 such shirts sold in the Western Cape area, Knipe
appealed for help in tracing its owner. ``I am quietly optimistic
that Planet Hollywood will be solved,'' he said.

After many delays, Cabinet meets to debate peace agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, UPDATES with quote by Palestinian
negotiator &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After several delays, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Thursday presented the land-for-peace agreement with
the Palestinians to his Cabinet for approval, taking a necessary
step toward implementation of the accord.
	   The Cabinet was expected to narrowly ratify the agreement
despite vocal opposition by several ministers. However, the vote
might only be taken on Friday or even Sunday, after many hours of
debate, said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.
	   Netanyahu had postponed the Cabinet meeting twice in two days,
charging that the Palestinians failed to present a time table for
the arrests of 30 terror suspects accused of killing nearly 100
Israelis.
	   Bar-Illan said the Cabinet was convened after Israel received
assurances from the United States on Wednesday evening that the 30
would be arrested in three stages, with the roundup to be completed
by the end of January.
	   However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the
Palestinians had not provided any new assurances in the past two
days. Erekat said the delays and disputes of the past few days did
not bode well for the implementation of the accord.
	   ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu to stop such painful tactics, to stop
exporting blame to us ... and maybe to start thinking in the
mentality of a partner,'' Erekat said.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank over a period of 12 weeks, with the Palestinians taking
steps against Islamic militants during each phase of the pullback.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that 12 of the
wanted men were already in detention, and that he would make an
effort to round up the others.
	   A Palestinian police official said Thursday that in all, 14 were
in jail. Several of the suspects have been in Palestinian jails for
months or years, but Palestinian security officials in the past
refused to provide exact figures.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross is to oversee implementation of
the agreement. He was to arrive in the region on Thursday, but now
is only expected over the weekend, Palestinian officials said.
	   While the dispute over the wanted men appeared to have been
settled, the next crisis already appeared on the horizon.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials have widely divergent
interpretations of the procedure that will lead to the annulment of
clauses in the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's
destruction. The paragraph in the peace agreement addressing the
issue is vaguely worded.
	   Israeli officials insist that the clauses by annulled with a

President Bill Clinton concerning the revoking of the offending

Japanese stocks fall on profit-taking, dollar climbs against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar climbed against the yen Thursday as U.S.
election results eased concerns over a possible impeachment of
President Bill Clinton. Japanese stock prices sank on
profit-taking.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 186.44 points,
or 1.28 percent, closing at 14,341.37. On Wednesday, it had surged
575.06 points, or 4.12 percent.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 117.64 yen, up 1.00 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level
of 116.60 yen overnight.
	   Japanese banks and investors bought dollars following Tuesday's
U.S. elections, in which the Democratic Party made a
stronger-than-expected showing, traders said.
	   The results allayed worries over the increasing likelihood that
President Clinton would be impeached, and lifted the Dow Jones
Industrial Average 76.99 points to 8,783.14 at the close of
Wednesday's trading on Wall Street.
	   Traders said investors who had held short, or oversold, dollar
positions ahead of the election were now buying back the U.S.
currency.
	   ``Although people were fearful of the dollar dropping below 110
yen, the election results helped to ease the uncertainty,'' said
Shinji Imanishi, chief foreign exchange dealer at Sumitomo Trust
and Banking.
	   Also hurting the yen were news reports that Japanese banks were
having trouble raising funds overseas amid concern over the health
of major Japanese financial institutions, traders said.
	   The dollar ranged between 116.80 yen and 118.00 yen in
Thursday's trading.
	   On the stock market, traders locked in profits after the Nikkei
average had soared a total of 963.30 points, or 7.1 percent, over
the two trading sessions. On Wednesday, stocks had jumped on
comments by influential Morgan Stanley strategist Barton Biggs, who
said Tokyo shares were undervalued.
	   On Thursday, investors were discouraged by reports in a major
Japanese business newspaper that the government will delay debating
income, corporate and housing tax cuts until the regular Parliament
session next year, rather than during an extra session this year,
traders said.
	   ``The market's uncertain situation is continuing,'' said Sachio
Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Declines outnumbered advances 668 to 463, with 162 issues
unchanged. Trading was fairly active, with about 569 million shares
changing hands on the first section, down from Wednesday's 687
million.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 2.79 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,104.57. It
had gained 41.52 points, or 3.90 percent, Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.860 percent from Wednesday's finish of
0.870 percent, driving its price up to 108.34 yen from 108.24 yen.

Mahathir, Goh announce thaw in frosty relations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES graf 9 with Singapore agreeing to help Malaysia &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Frosty relations between Malaysia
and Singapore thawed significantly Thursday as the prime ministers
of the Southeast Asian neighbors met and agreed to improve ties.
	   Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad met for two hours in the VIP lounge of
the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
	   ``We talked about how we can improve relations with each
other,'' Mahathir told a news conference. Foreign reporters were
initially barred from the conference, but later allowed in.
	   He said the two leaders agreed their officials would curb the
heated attacks on each other.
	   ``The two of us will not say anything,'' he said.
	   Goh's surprise visit followed squabbles between the two nations
over a host of issues ranging from airspace to the location of a
railroad station.
	   It was the first top-level meeting between the two countries
since relations, testy even before the added pressure of the Asian
financial crisis, started to deteriorate rapidly earlier this year.
They last met in April.
	   Mahathir said he intended to raise funds from neighboring
Singapore to help during the economic crisis, though he didn't say
how much or what the money would be used for.
	   Goh had little to add except that ``we are resuming a
discussion'' and that he was pleased by Mahathir's invitation to
meet with him. But he did say Singapore had agreed to assist
Malaysia in overcoming its financial problems.
	   ``The differences will be there,'' Goh said. ``But the main
thing is to narrow the differences.'' He left for Singapore soon
after lunch with Mahathir.
	   In recent months, the neighbors have argued over the location of
a border post and the cancellation of automatic flyover rights for
Singaporean military aircraft using Malaysian airspace.
	   Malaysia's withdrawal from joint military exercises, and a halt
to trading of Malaysian stocks and currencies in Singapore, have
also strained ties.
	   Criticism of past Malaysian leaders as corrupt and morally lax
in Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew's recently released
memoirs only added to the tensions.
	   Last month, Mahathir said his country would find it difficult to
be friendly again with Singapore, saying the island republic had
not shown the sensitivity of a good neighbor.
	   Soon after, Goh urged the people of his small city-state to
remain mentally tough amid tensions with its larger neighbor.
	   Thursday's meeting moved toward resolving the sensitive issue of
sharing water, Mahathir said.
	   Under agreements set forth in two treaties, about half of the
water consumed daily by Singaporeans comes from Malaysia. One of
those treaties expires in 2011 and the other in 2061. Singapore
wants a clearly defined, long-term treaty.
	   Mahathir said Malaysia would determine the demand, ``so that we
can meet Singapore's requirement.''
	   Singapore's military aircraft would be given immediate clearance
to overfly Malaysia if the planes were on a rescue or emergency
mission, Mahathir said.
	   Britain allowed Singapore to govern itself in 1959, with Lee
Kwan Yew as prime minister. In 1963, Singapore was incorporated
into Malaysia, an experiment that failed two years later after
wrangling between Lee and the late Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku
Abdul Rahman.
	   Since then, the two countries have gone through periods of
hostility. But Singapore still remains Malaysia's third-largest
trade partner and an important gateway into Malaysia. More than
200,000 Malaysians cross over to Singapore each day to work.

Three South Korean athletes banned from Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Three South Korean female athletes
have been banned from the Asian Games in Thailand next month after
failing a doping test, officials said Thursday.
	   ``They are expected to be suspended for two years by related
sports organizations in the near future,'' said Kim Tae-young, a
spokesman for the Korea Sports Council.
	   Identified only by their initials, the two gymnasts and one
swimmer tested positive for furosemide, a banned diuretic that
promotes weight loss.
	   The doping test was conducted on 210 national athletes two weeks
ago.
	   On Thursday, fresh tests were conducted on six female gymnasts,
including the two who failed the initial test. Officials plan to
test South Korea's other 500 athletes soon.
	   It is the third time that South Korean athletes have failed drug
tests. A female weightlifter and a male sprinter were suspended for
using banned drugs in the early 1990s.
	   South Korea plans to send 710 athletes to the 13th Asian Games
to compete in all but three of the 36 events.

Russian court says Yeltsin can't run for a third term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS five grafs with decision likely to increase election
speculation. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's highest court said Thursday that Boris
Yeltsin cannot seek a third term as president because he already
has been elected twice, the limit under the constitution.
	   The Constitutional Court's announcement should finally settle
the question on whether Yeltsin is permitted to run for re-election
in the year 2000. The court noted that Yeltsin himself has all but
ruled out running for a third term, and a presidential aide said
the court's decision was correct.
	   ``As a guarantor of the constitution, the president himself has
repeatedly said he wouldn't run again in the year 2000 because that
would contradict the current constitution,'' the court said in its
verdict.
	   The court said there was no case to consider because the
constitution was clear that the president may only serve two terms.
	   But some of Yeltsin's supporters argued that his first term
should not count against the limit, because it began in 1991,
before the current constitution was adopted in 1993. Yeltsin was
re-elected in 1996.
	   Yeltsin had been coy about whether he would seek a third term,
letting aides promote the idea. He appeared to have given up the
idea in recent months as speculation has mounted about the state of
his health.
	   Yeltsin is currently recuperating from his latest illness at the
Black Sea resort of Sochi in southern Russia.
	   ``It has been clear for the president. He said he wouldn't run
again,'' Mikhail Mityukov, Yeltsin's envoy to the Constitutional
Court said after the verdict. ``This case has been inspired by the
political games in (parliament).''
	   Alexi Zakharov, one of the lawmakers who asked the court to rule
on whether Yeltsin could seek a third term, said the decision was a
victory for democracy.
	   He said the verdict would entrench constitutional rule and
prevent abuses of power, and he also praised Yeltsin for his
contributions to democracy.
	   ``We should thank the president, he was among those who gave us
freedom. But he should leave on time, in accordance with the law,
without provoking a riot and let people use this freedom,'' said
the member of the liberal Yabloko faction.
	   The president's critics have been saying that Yeltsin is not
physically fit to run the country and should resign. The president
insists he does not have any serious health problems and will serve
out his tenure.
	   Thursday's announcement came on the second anniversary of
Yeltsin's quintuple heart bypass surgery, which sidelined him for
months in 1996. The president has been ill several times since
then, and has been working only sporadically in recent months.
	   Yeltsin's fragile health and the court ruling will encourage
several top political leaders to step up preparations for
presidential bids. Yeltsin insists he will serve out his term until
the middle of the year 2000, but there is growing speculation in
Russia that elections may come sooner.
	   Top presidential candidates include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and nationalist leader Alexander Lebed. Both have been calling on
Yeltsin to step down early because of his poor health, while
revving up their presidential campaign preparations.
	   The Communists, the most powerful faction in the state Duma, the
lower house of Parliament, also have been calling for Yeltsin to
resign because of his health and inability to tackle the country's
economic crisis.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov was second to Yeltsin in the
1996 election, but the party is undecided about who to run in the
next presidential election because of growing internal splits.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, named in September to tackle
the economic crisis, also has been mentioned as a presidential
candidate. He scores well in popularity polls, although his
government has done little to address the economic crisis or even
suggest strong policies to handle it.

	   Netanyahu had postponed the Cabinet meeting twice in two days,
charging that the Palestinians had failed to present a time table
for the arrests of 30 suspects in the killings of nearly 100
Israelis.
	   Bar-Illan said the Cabinet was convened after Israel received
assurances from the United States on Wednesday evening that the 30
would be arrested in three stages, with the roundup to be completed
by the end of January.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank over a period of 12 weeks, with the Palestinians taking
steps against Islamic militants during each phase of the pullback.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that 12 of the
wanted men were already in detention, and that he would make an
effort to round up the others.
	   A Palestinian police official said Thursday that in all, 14 were
in jail. Several of the suspects have been in Palestinian jails for
months or years, but Palestinian security officials in the past
refused to provide exact figures.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, meanwhile, delayed his trip to
the region. Ross was to arrive on Thursday to oversee
implementation of the agreement, but is now expected over the
weekend, Palestinian officials said.

clauses in the Palestine Liberation Organization founding charter

agreement addressing the issue is vaguely worded.

clauses will be reaffirmed.
	   Israel radio said several Cabinet ministers planned to approve
the peace accord only on condition that a sentence is added
declaring that the charter clauses by annulled by a PNC vote.

said the Cabinet members were not trying to change the accord.

Lower household spending streak extends to record 11 months in
</HEADLINE>
Japan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's average spending per household fell for the
11th consecutive month in September, extending a record long slump
amid the country's worst recession since World War II, the
government said Thursday.
	   Household expenditure last month shrank an inflation-adjusted
1.5 percent from the previous month to an average of 308,841 yen
(dlrs 2,622.19), the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   The streak of declines is the longest since the agency began
compiling household spending statistics in 1963.
	   The amount of disposable income that went into household
spending climbed to 70.9 percent in September from 68.5 percent in
August on a seasonally adjusted basis not accounting for inflation,
it said.
	   Also Thursday, 17 of Japan's biggest electronics makers,
including Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp., said they plan to cut
semi-annual bonus payments for employees by the largest
year-on-year amount since 1969, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The value of winter bonus payments will average between 2.0 and
2.5 months' worth of an employee's annual base wage, down from an
average of 2.4 to 2.6 months' pay last year, it said.

After many delays, Cabinet meets to debate peace agreement

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After several delays, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Thursday presented the land-for-peace agreement with
the Palestinians to his Cabinet for approval, taking a necessary
step toward implementation of the accord.
	   The Cabinet was expected to narrowly ratify the agreement
despite vocal opposition by several ministers. However, the vote
might not be taken until Friday or even Sunday, after many hours of
debate, said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.
	   Netanyahu had postponed the Cabinet meeting twice in two days,
charging that the Palestinians had failed to present a time table
for the arrests of 30 suspects in the killings of nearly 100
Israelis.
	   Bar-Illan said the Cabinet was convened after Israel received
assurances from the United States on Wednesday evening that the 30
would be arrested in three stages, with the roundup to be completed
by the end of January.
	   However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the
Palestinians had not provided any new assurances in the past two
days. Erekat said the latest delays and disputes did not bode well
for the implementation of the accord.
	   ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu to stop such painful tactics, to stop
exporting blame to us ... and maybe to start thinking in the
mentality of a partner,'' Erekat said.
	   Under the accord reached during last month's Mideast summit at
the secluded Wye Plantation in Maryland, Israel is to withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank over a period of 12 weeks, with the
Palestinians taking steps against Islamic militants during each
phase of the pullback.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that 12 of the
wanted men were already in detention, and that he would make an
effort to round up the others.
	   A Palestinian police official said Thursday that in all, 14 were
in jail. Several of the suspects have been in Palestinian jails for
months or years, but Palestinian security officials in the past
refused to provide exact figures.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, meanwhile, delayed his trip to
the region. Ross was to arrive on Thursday to oversee
implementation of the agreement, but is now expected over the
weekend, Palestinian officials said.
	   While the dispute over the wanted men appeared to have been
settled, the next crisis already loomed on the horizon.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials have widely divergent
interpretations of the procedure that will lead to the annulment of
clauses in the Palestine Liberation Organization founding charter
calling for Israel's destruction. The paragraph in the peace
agreement addressing the issue is vaguely worded.
	   Israeli officials ir, the aermdment only says that PNC members, along with
members of other Palestinian organizations, will be invited to a

China's top central banker seeks to ease concerns over debts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-China-Troubled ITICs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ China's central bank chief told Hong Kong
bankers the collapse of a provincial lending institution would not
be followed by numerous similar failures _ but he stopped short of
promising all its debts will be repaid, newspapers reported
Thursday.
	   The People's Bank of China governor, Dai Xianglong, reportedly
said the closure of Guangdong International Trust and Investment
Corp., or GITIC, does not reflect a broader weakness in China's
some 240 trust and investment companies, called ``ITICs.''
	   But Dai said a few more ITICs would likely be closed, and others
will need fresh injections of capital or restructuring to stay in
business, the respected Hong Kong Economic Journal reported.
	   Dai discussed the ITIC situation in a closed-door meeting
Wednesday in Beijing with Joseph Yam, the chief executive of the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto central
bank.
	   ``Dai said it was difficult to foresee other ITICs having as big
a problem as GITIC, and that came as welcome news to everybody,''
Yam was quoted as telling the Hong Kong Standard.
	   Another prominent banker, Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Hong
Kong Association of Banks and Asia group executive director of
Standard Chartered Bank, agreed Dai's remarks were encouraging.
	   ``We would not anticipate other major shocks in the market.
GITIC is an isolated incident,'' Davies told the Standard.
	   Dai reiterated the central bank's position that it would repay
creditors of GITIC's registered loans, but that it was still
considering how to deal with unregistered loans, according to the
Hong Kong edition of Wen Wei Po, a mouthpiece for China's Communist
Party.
	   Many loans were set up through Hong Kong banks and never
registered in China, which would put them in jeopardy if China
fails to recognize them.
	   Yam reportedly has lobbied the mainland Chinese to consider the
loans legitimate if they were arranged legally in Hong Kong. He was
accompanied by executives from top banks including the Bank of
China, ABN Amro Bank, Banque Nationale de Paris, Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co. of New York and Chase Manhattan Bank.
	   The Chinese central bank's closure of GITIC last month has Hong
Kong bankers worrying about problem loans emerging at other ITICs.
The total foreign debt of the ITICs is estimated at U.S. dlrs 10
billion. GITIC alone reportedly has debts of about U.S. dlrs 2
billion.
	   Dai sought to put the troubles in perspective, saying that all
of the ITICs account for just 2.5 percent of China's financial
system, so even if a few are closed, the impact would be minimal.
	   Some experts disagree.
	   Dow Jones Newswires quoted an industry specialist at one of
China's largest trust and investment companies, whom it did not
identify, as saying: ``Shutting down these firms overnight would be
disastrous, and could even cause a domestic financial crisis.''
	   Thousands of state-owned companies and government departments
that have borrowed from the ITICs also have billions of yuan on
deposit with the ITICs, the specialist told Dow Jones.

Troops deployed to curb protests over price hikes
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Heavily armed troops fanned out Thursday
in township suburbs a day after protests over fuel price increases.
	   Army foot patrols and riot police watched over thousands of
commuters waiting for buses operated by a state-owned bus company.
Others waited for scaled-back services by private taxi vans in the
dormitory suburb of Chitungwiza, 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of
Harare.
	   A military helicopter skimmed over townships in eastern Harare
and troops carriers were seen headed for the southwestern townships
of Mufakose and Kuwadzana, scenes of rioting and stone-throwing
Wednesday.
	   There were no early reports of violence. Numerous and businesses
on the outskirts of Harare remained closed as commuters failed to
reach their jobs. Businesses in downtown Harare reopened but
traffic was light.
	   Violent demonstrations erupted Wednesday after private buses and
taxi van raised their fares, some by double, to meet a 67 percent
hike in the price of gasoline announced by the government.
	   It was the second time since the nation gained independence in
1980 that army troops were deployed in the capital to combat civil
unrest.
	   Six people died, mostly in army and police gunfire, during food
riots in January triggered by a 25 percent increase in the price of
corn meal, the staple food.
	   ``People can't afford the fares now. It's impossible,'' said
Philip Mugwaza, a clerk trying to hitch a ride in eastern Harare.
	   Groups of stranded commuters said they blamed the government for
mismanaging the economy, forcing sharp price increases, and
squandering money by deploying 6,000 troops to the distant Congo to
back embattled President Laurent Kabila.
	   ``They must bring the boys back. We are suffering right here,''
said Chipo Vimbe, an office worker.
	   Most makeshift barricades thrown up by rioters Wednesday were
cleared overnight. Private taxi van and bus operators said they
were keeping their vehicles off the road to protest the gasoline
price increases.
	   Demonstrators on Wednesday stoned passing cars, torched taxi
vans and a bus, looted several shops and were charged by police
with batons when trying to torch a gas station. Police fired tear
gas in two suburbs to disperse angry mobs and reportedly arrested
120 people across the capital.
	   Defense Minister Moven Mahachi defended the deployment of
troops.
	   ``Violence leads to anarchy and anarchy can burn down the
country in minutes,'' he said.
	   The government said the gasoline increases were forced by a 80
percent slide in the value of the Zimbabwe dollar against the U.S.
currency in the past year.

Child porn peddler sentenced in Hungary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A man was given a five-year jail
sentence for using children in pornogpraphic publications and
videos, state-run radio reported Thursday.
	   The case shocked Hungary two years ago when it became known that
dozens of girls, aged 11 to l6, from respectable homes in Eger were
persuaded to pose nude and participate in sex acts.
	   Acting on a parent's complaint in 1996, police raided a house
and found it full of pornographic material, said Lt. Col. Istvan
Nagy, criminal investigations chief in the city of 65,000 people
located 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of Budapest.
	   Istvan Kun, 39, a teacher of natural medicine and Oriental
mediation with no previous criminal record, was arrested.
	   On Thursday the Eger municipal court found him guilty of
indecent assault, public indecency, corruption of minors and
copyright violations and sentenced him to five years in jail.
	   Kun's lawyer said he would appeal the sentence.
	   Kun claimed he was working on a survey of the sex habits of
teenage girls.
	   A local teacher identified only as Anita D. was sentenced in
September to a year in jail and an additional three years suspended
for participating in sex acts with an under-aged girl in one of
Kun's videos.

French ferry workers in Calais suspend their strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALAIS, France (AP) _ French ferry workers in the northern port
of Calais on Thursday suspended their strike that had disrupted
service across the English Channel for two days.
	   The strikers at the Seafrance ferry company said the workers
were prepared to resume their protest if they did not reach
agreement over their grievances at a meeting with management later
Thursday.
	   The workers are protesting Seafrance's decision to hire a sailor
from outside the company to be the new chief of passenger services,
claiming the candidate is not qualified for the mob.
	   The workers want Seafrance management to name a company employee
for the job.
	   Service between Calais and the English port of Dover was
expected to resume Thursday morning.
	   The two-day strike action sharply reduced services across the
English Channel on Wednesday and also caused long traffic jams on
roads leading to the port.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Troubled Philippine Airlines is
willing to give Cathay Pacific Airways management rights in
exchange for a sizable investment, a PAL official said Thursday.
	   Manolo Aquino, senior vice president of PAL, said the two
companies are discussing an initial buy-in offer presented by
Cathay Pacific.
	   ``We met yesterday and we will continue meeting today on what we
can agree upon on the first proposal,'' he said in a radio
interview. He did not provide details of the proposal.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to make payments on
dlrs 2.1 billion in debt. It was devastated by a pilots' strike in
June and by Asia's currency crisis.
	   ``If Cathay Pacific comes in, we will give them a free hand
because they will run Philippine Airlines,'' Aquino said.
``Whatever they see that could improve the operations of Philippine
Airlines, if they see the need to retrench some people, I think we
should give them a free hand here.''
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the negotiations are
``almost 90 percent completed'' and that a deal may be reached
``within the month.''
	   He said the airline needs 6 billion pesos (dlrs 150 million) in
fresh capital.
	   Alexander Barrientos, president of PAL's ground crew union, said
he was told by PAL management that Cathay Pacific wants to appoint
PAL's president, chief operating officer, chief executive officer,
chief finance officer and head of marketing.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after the ground crew
union turned down a management-proposed recovery plan that included
a 10-year suspension of its collective bargaining agreement in
exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown, and the airline resumed domestic flights Oct. 7 and
international flights Oct. 26.
	   Barrientos, however, said the entry of Cathay Pacific would
dilute PAL shares and the employees may end up with only one or two
of the three board seats promised by management under the recovery
plan.
	   He said Cathay Pacific may demand an agreement between the union
and the airline on how to implement the recovery plan.
	   PAL submitted a draft memorandum of agreement last week, but the
union rejected it as ``one-sided,'' forcing the airline to open
talks on a new draft, he said.
	   Abel Capili, another union leader, said employees are planning a
protest Friday because of fears of mass layoffs and reduced
benefits.
	   ``Despite the suspension of the CBA, there is still no security
of tenure, there is no assurance that a majority of the employees
will be retained,'' Capili said.
	   Aquino said the airline and the union are continuing talks on a
memorandum of agreement and dismissed the fears of mass layoffs as
speculation.
	   He appealed to the union to avoid any protest, saying this would
``reinforce fears'' among passengers about PAL's reliability.

Unemployment rate sinks in Germany, continuing slight improvement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's jobless figure sank again in
October to 10.1 percent, down from 10.3 percent last month, the
federal labor office in Nuremberg said Thursday.
	   The rate in the former East Germany was at 15.7 percent, which
translates to 1.19 million people out of work there, compared to
8.7 percent, or 2.7 million people, out of work in western Germany.
	   Nationwide, 3.89 million people were jobless, 23,000 less than
in September. The preliminary figures were unadjusted for seasonal
factors.
	   The figures will cheer the new Social Democratic-led government,
which has made fighting unemployment its top priority.

<TEXT>
	   CALAIS, France (AP) _ French ferry workers in the northern port
of Calais on Thursday suspended their strike that had disrupted
service across the English Channel for two days.
	   The strikers at the Seafrance ferry company said the workers
were prepared to resume their protest if they did not reach
agreement over their grievances at a meeting with management later
Thursday.
	   The workers are protesting Seafrance's decision to hire a sailor
from outside the company to be the new chief of passenger services,
claiming the candidate is not qualified for the job.
	   The workers want Seafrance management to name a company employee
for the job.
	   Service between Calais and the English port of Dover was
expected to resume Thursday morning.
	   The two-day strike action sharply reduced services across the
English Channel on Wednesday and also caused long traffic jams on
roads leading to the port.

China's Jiang off to Russia, Japan later this month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Making up for foreign travels postponed by
devastating summer floods, China announced Thursday that President
Jiang Zemin will visit Russia and Japan in late November.
	   Jiang's trip is intended to preserve the momentum in steadily
improving relations with Russia _ once a Cold War foe _ and help
propel forward often rocky relations with Japan, China's leading
investor.
	   He will hold his sixth summit meeting with President Boris
Yeltsin, despite reports about the Russian leader's ill health, and
he will urge Japan to support China's claim to rival Taiwan,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told reporters.
	   Zhu wished Yeltsin ``an early recovery.'' The spokesman stressed
that the two leaders will be holding an informal meeting. Jiang
will also visit New Siberia during his Nov. 22-25 trip.
	   While Russia has become China's top supplier of military
hardware and diplomatic relations have moved ahead under a
much-touted ``strategic partnership,'' both governments have been
frustrated by an inability to raise anemic trade.
	   Jiang's Nov. 25-30 trip to Japan will be the first ever by a
Chinese head of state, and as such Zhu noted ``it will be of great
immediate and far-reaching historical significance to Sino-Japanese
relations.''
	   Jiang will meet with Japanese Emperor Akihito, hold talks with
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and travel to the northern cities of
Sendai and Sapporo. Zhu said officials from both governments were
working out specifics for the agenda.
	   Despite close economic ties, rivalry for regional influence,
memories of Japan's often brutal 1931-45 occupation of much of
China and suspicions about Tokyo's intentions toward Taiwan have
periodically roiled relations.
	   Spokesman Zhu indicated China hoped to secure the kind of
apology for wartime atrocities that Obuchi gave to South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung in Tokyo last month.
	   ``On the basis of history we should orient toward the future and
develop our friendly relations for generations. The pretext is that
we have to face and recognize the history and stick to the road of
peace,'' Zhu said.
	   China has been trying to keep Taiwan diplomatically isolated to
deprive its government of legitimacy and worries the island is
gaining encouragement from conservative Japanese politicians who
want closer ties and a U.S.-Japan defense treaty.
	   Zhu noted that Japan agreed in two pacts, in 1972 and 1978, to
recognize China's claim to sovereignty over Taiwan.
	   ``The Japanese side should adhere to such principles, honor
their commitments and do some real deeds to safeguard the friendly
relationship,'' Zhu said.
	   When asked by reporters if that meant Beijing wanted Tokyo to
state it would not support an independent Taiwan _ a commitment
U.S. President Bill Clinton made in China in June _ Zhu said Japan
``should have a progressive attitude.''

Opposition wants amnesty for general before joining government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hardening the political deadlock
that has left Cambodia without a government, the opposition said
Thursday it would not join any coalition unless supporters
convicted in political cases received pardons.
	   The new demand widens the gap between the opposition and
strongman Hun Sen, who narrowly won disputed elections in July but
has been unable to win the opposition support needed for a
two-thirds majority in parliament to endorse a new government.
	   The new demands, issued in a joint statement by opposition
leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, are aimed at
winning a pardon for Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, the main general who
stayed loyal to the prince when Hun Sen ousted him as co-premier in
a 1997 coup.
	   The statement said that amnesty for loyalists convicted of
political crimes _ a Hun Sen-controlled court found Nhek Bunchhay
guilty of treason in a show trial earlier this year _ would be a
``necessary gesture'' to build confidence for new talks.
	   Cambodia's political impasse is prolonging the desperately poor
country's economic and political limbo since the 1997 coup. Without
a new, legally recognized government, Cambodia is unlikely to join
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations soon or win new
investment.
	   ``The issue of amnesty must be addressed if the coalition
partners are going to work together in the next government,'' the
statement said.
	   The statement also called for an end to impunity in human rights
violations and corruption and for administrative reforms and
economic measures to be adopted to allow a resumption of foreign
aid.
	   An agreement to these agendas should be reached before a lasting
coalition government can be achieved, it said.
	   The formation of a government appears remote. After the
ceremonial opening of parliament Sept. 24, a large number of
opposition members of parliament fled abroad, fearing arrest by Hun
Sen after two alleged attempts on his life.
	   Three-way negotiations ended in deadlock. A key issue was the
dispute between Hun Sen's party and Ranariddh's party _ the top two
finishers in the elections _ over the chairmanship of the National
Assembly.
	   Khieu Kanharith, a spokesman for Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party, ridiculed the amnesty demand as a public relations measure
and said a government needed to be formed before political agendas
could be discussed.

ETA says cease-fire could become permanent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA said
Thursday that its current cease-fire could develop into a
definitive renunciation of violence, days after the government
proposed talks to resolve the conflict, news reports said.
	   This transformation of the indefinite cease-fire announced by
the separatists in mid-September into a permanent end to the
group's bombings and shootings depended on ``progress made in the
near future,'' ETA said in statement published in the radical
newspaper Euskadi Informacion, national Spanish radio reported.
	   On Tuesday Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar authorized contacts
with organizations linked to ETA _ what is normally referred to as
``ETA's World.''
	   Late Wednesday, official government spokesman Josep Pique said
the government was seeking direct talks with ETA ``without
intermediaries.''
	   It was not immediately clear whether ETA's statement, written in
the Basque language, was written prior to or after the government's
new willingness to negotiate an end to the conflict.
	   ETA has been fighting for an independent Basque homeland
incorporating parts of northern Spain and southern France for 30
years. The group, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom
in the Basque language, has killed nearly 800 people.

Hackers wanted for Singapore trade exhibition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Computer hackers can finally come out in this
law-abiding island state. They are wanted to test software at a
Singapore exhibition next June that will promote cyber security.
	   ``We are looking for individuals or teams who are interested in
taking up the challenge of infiltrating firewalls set up by our
sponsors,'' said Jimmy Lau, president of Reed Exhibition Companies
and one of the organizers of the exhibition.
	   ``This will provide our sponsors an opportunity to demonstrate
the effectiveness of their products at Infosecurity Asia '99,'' Lau
said in a statement.
	   Firewalls are programs designed to protect software from
hackers, or unauthorized infiltrators.
	   The exhibition is co-organized by National Computer Systems, a
subsidiary of the Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. group.
	   ``In this age of e-commerce, we need to protect the information
and network infrastructure of our customers against possible
corruption,'' said Lee Kwok Cheong, chief executive officer of NCS.
	   The exercise will be carried out in a controlled environment,
where hackers will attempt to penetrate various demonstration
sites.
	   Said Lau: ``Rest assured, there will be no hacking of computer
systems outside of the demonstration environment.''

Russian court says Yeltsin can't run for a third term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Yeltsin expressing satisfaction with the court's
ruling, comments from his aides in new grafs 7-9. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's highest court said Thursday that Boris
Yeltsin cannot seek a third presidential term in 2000 because he
already has been elected twice, the constitutional limit.
	   The Constitutional Court's announcement should finally settle
the question on whether Yeltsin is permitted to run for re-election
in less than two years' time. The court noted that Yeltsin himself
had all but ruled out seeking a third term, and the president said
through his aides that he was satisfied with the ruling.
	   ``As a guarantor of the constitution, the president himself has
repeatedly said he wouldn't run again in the year 2000 because that
would contradict the current constitution,'' the court said in its
verdict.
	   The court said there was no case to consider because the
constitution was clear that the president may only serve two terms.
	   But some of Yeltsin's supporters argued that his first term
should not count against the limit, because it began with his
election victory in 1991, before the current constitution was
adopted in 1993. Yeltsin was re-elected in 1996.
	   Yeltsin had been coy about whether he would seek a third term,
letting aides promote the idea. He appeared to have given up the
idea in recent months as speculation has mounted about the state of
his health.
	   The president praised the court's decision as a ``victory of law
over emotions and passions,'' his spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said,
according to Russian news agencies.
	   Yeltsin was satisfied with the ruling, ``since he long has found
an answer for himself to the main question _ he wouldn't take part
in the 2000 presidential elections.'' Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin is currently recuperating from his latest illness at the
Black Sea resort of Sochi in southern Russia.
	   Alexei Zakharov, one of the lawmakers who asked the court to
rule on whether Yeltsin could seek a third term, said the decision
would strengthen Russia's young democracy.
	   He said the verdict would entrench constitutional rule and
prevent abuses of power, and he also praised Yeltsin for his
contributions.
	   ``We should thank the president, he was among those who gave us
freedom. But he should leave on time, in accordance with the law,
without provoking a riot and let people use this freedom,'' said
Zakharov, a member of the liberal Yabloko faction.
	   The president's critics have been saying that Yeltsin is not
physically fit to run the country and should resign. The president
insists he does not have any serious health problems and will serve
out his tenure.
	   Thursday's announcement came on the second anniversary of
Yeltsin's quintuple heart bypass surgery, which sidelined him for
months in 1996. The president has been ill several times since
then, and has been working only sporadically in recent months.
	   Yeltsin's fragile health and the court ruling should encourage
several top political leaders to step up their presidential bids.
If Yeltsin were to resign, or give up his office due to illness,
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov would take over temporarily and
would be required to call new elections within three months.
	   Top presidential candidates include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and nationalist leader Alexander Lebed. Both have been calling on
Yeltsin to step down early because of his poor health, while
revving up their presidential campaign preparations.
	   The Communists, the most powerful faction in parliament, also
have been calling for Yeltsin to resign because of his health and
inability to tackle the country's economic crisis.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov was second to Yeltsin in the
1996 election. But the party, which has a number of internal
splits, has not named a candidate for the next election.
	   Primakov, named in September to tackle the economic crisis, also
has been mentioned as a presidential candidate. He scores well in
popularity polls, though his government has been unable to make any
real headway in fighting the country's economic crisis.

Microsoft to open research center in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Microsoft Corp. will set up an international
research lab in Beijing, its first in Asia and second in the world,
the company announced Thursday.
	   Kai-fu Lee, an expert in speech recognition, artificial
intelligence, 3-D graphics and Internet multimedia, will head the
laboratory, Microsoft said in a statement.
	   Microsoft plans to spend dlrs 80 million over the next six years
to build up the facility.
	   ``China is the most populous country in the world and the use of
computers is growing rapidly. To make the experience compelling,
there are many challenges that need to be addressed to adapt
computing and software to the Chinese marketplace. We believe it's
important the industry invests in finding solutions that can help
us overcome these challenges,'' said Rick Rashid, vice president of
Microsoft Research.
	   The plan won praise from Minister of Information Industry Wu
Jichuan for helping to promote information technology development
in China and to bring in a pool of talent.
	   Company officials said the lab would work closely with the
Chinese government, universities and research institutes in finding
ways to make computers see, listen, speak and learn.
	   ``By focusing our research efforts in Beijing on areas like
speech, vision, graphics, natural language and multimedia
technologies, we hope we can bring these improvements to the
Chinese computing experience,'' Lee said.
	   Microsoft Research, founded in 1991, also has labs in San
Francisco and in Cambridge, England. Its initial staff of five in
Beijing is expected to grow to 100 over the next few years, the
company said.

Indonesian opposition leader urges restraint during government
</HEADLINE>
assembly &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Fearing anarchy, a prominent
opposition leader urged Indonesians Thursday to refrain from
disrupting a government assembly next week. Yet as he spoke,
students protesters marched in the streets and pro-government
groups staged a huge rally.
	   Amien Rais, a potential presidential candidate who contributed
to the tumultuous ouster of former President Suharto, accused the
government of stalling democratic reforms. But he said politically
and economically fragile Indonesia could ill afford more unrest.
	   ``I don't believe revolution is appropriate now for the
Indonesian people,'' Rais said in a lunch meeting at the Jakarta
Foreign Correspondents' Club. His call for restraint contrasted
with his fiery rhetoric when Suharto was in power.
	   The 77-year-old former authoritarian leader quit in May after
student protests as well as riots in Jakarta that killed 1,200
people and left thousands of cars and buildings gutted or damaged.
	   Determined to ward off unrest, the military has deployed tens of
thousands of police and soldiers in Jakarta to guard the meeting of
the People's Consultative Assembly.
	   The 1,000-member assembly, Indonesia's highest legislative body,
will convene at Parliament to cast guidelines for general elections
scheduled for next May or June.
	   Some 70,000 people from Muslim groups gathered Thursday in a
soccer stadium in a show of religious unity and support for the
Nov. 10-13 assembly at Parliament.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation. Dozens of
Muslim-based political parties plan to contest the elections.
	   Meanwhile, 400 student activists demonstrated at a Jakarta
intersection ringed by luxury hotels, rejecting the assembly as a
political tool for cronies from the Suharto era.
	   They said President B.J. Habibie, a onetime protege of Suharto,
should step down and let others push political reform and grapple
with Indonesia's worst economic turmoil in three decades.
	   ``Habibie has to step down because there is no proof until now
that he is able to lead the country out of this crippling economic
crisis,'' protester Usman said.
	   Rais accused Habibie of neglecting reforms and maneuvering to
stay in power, but he said his resignation could leave a power
vacuum that would only exacerbate divisions in Indonesia.
	   ``Habibie's government is still a continuation of the old
regime,'' said Rais, former head of the 28 million-member
Muhammadiyah movement, Indonesia's second-largest Muslim group.
	   Rais has formed his own political group, the National Mandate
Party, and said he has proposed to opposition leader Megawati
Sukarnoputri that they form an opposition coalition.
	   Megawati, daughter of Indonesia's founding President Sukarno,
has yet to respond, Rais said.
	   Also Thursday, about 100 members of the People's Democratic
Party, which had been banned during the Suharto era, protested near
Parliament against the military's prominent role in politics.
	   The military, accused of widespread human rights abuses when
Suharto was in power, has 75 seats allocated to it in the
500-member Parliament.
	   At the lunch, Rais also speculated that Suharto or members of
the military were behind a spate of mysterious killings in the
eastern part of the main island of Java. He did not offer proof of
the charges, which the military has dismissed as slander.

October inflation in Ukraine rises to 6.2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's inflation was 6.2 percent in
October, well above September's rate of 3.8 percent, the State
Statistics Committee said Thursday.
	   Overall inflation this year has amounted to 12.8 percent, but 10
percent of that increase has come in just the past two months, the
committee said.
	   The increase in consumer prices in Ukraine in September and
October reflected the turmoil in the country's financial markets
that followed the economic crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency has been sliding steadily in response
to the Russian ruble's fall.
	   Ukraine's annual inflation rate had been declining steadily
since peaking at more than 10,000 percent in 1993. The rate fell to
10 percent last year and appeared headed lower this year until the
recent turmoil.

Report: labor costs in Singapore five times higher than some
</HEADLINE>
rivals &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's labor costs have risen to levels
five times those of some of its regional rivals, putting
manufacturers here at a distinct disadvantage, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Information gathered by the Singapore National Employers
Federation show labor costs, comprising regular wages and pension
payments but excluding bonuses, now average dlrs 7 an hour in the
affluent city-state.
	   The figure contrasts sharply with some of Singapore's principal
competitors, said The Straits Times. For example, hourly labor
costs average dlrs 1.40 in West Malaysia and dlrs 1.20 in Thailand,
the report said.
	   Entering its first economic slowdown since a recession in the
mid-1980s, Singapore is expected to unveil a host of cost-cutting
moves later this month to aid beleaguered businesses.
	   The government has said it will concentrate on slashing labor
costs, and is almost certain to include reductions in wages and a
major cut in company contributions to Singapore's mandatory
state-run pension fund.
	   But some economists say the measures to reduce business costs
will probably have greater success slowing Singapore's rise in
unemployment than improving competitiveness and luring investment.

Government increases security on eve of assassination verdict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HASAN SAEED &QC;

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Nearly 10,000 security personnel will
be deployed in an attempt to prevent unrest when a court pronounces
its verdict in the trial of the accused assassins of Bangladesh's
first prime minister, a senior security official said Thursday.
	   Though the trial has proceeded without incident since hearings
began last year, there are fears the verdict, expected Sunday,
could result in protests.
	   Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led the movement to carve independent
Bangladesh out of Pakistan in 1972, and most of his immediate
family were shot and killed in an army coup in 1975. His daughter
Sheikh Hasina, who became prime minister in 1996, has used her
power to bring his accused killers to trial.
	   The security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
police were detaining potential troublemakers in advance of the
verdict.
	   Authorities were particularly worried about coup supporters
believed to have received military training in Libya. Libya gave
shelter to some of the coup leaders who had to flee after rival
military officers staged another takeover.
	   In addition, the security official said there had been reports
that associates of international terrorist Osama bin Laden had
slipped into Bangladesh and were planning some action around the
time of the verdict. It was not clear what interest they would have
in the trial.
	   On Oct. 30, authorities raided a printing press in Dhaka, seized
pro- bin Laden leaflets and arrested six people, the official said.
Bin Laden espouses militant Muslim causes. Bangladesh is a Muslim
country, but few of its citizens are militant.

US Defense Secretary in Oman to lobby for action against Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen arrived
in Oman Thursday to press for support for possible strikes against
Iraq, but there appeared to be little backing in the region for the
use of force.
	   Cohen arrived in Oman from Qatar where he met with the emir,
Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, and Foreign Minister Hamad bin
Jassim al-Thani. No details of the meeting were available.
	   Cohen will meet with Sultan Qaboos and other senior Omani
officials before flying to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
	   At least publicly, there appears to be little support for any
U.S. military action against Iraq.
	   ``Can the United States imagine that there is a country, whether
Arab or not, except its subservient Britain, which can say `yes' to
striking Iraq?'' Egypt's Al-Akhbar, a state-owned newspaper, asked
in a front page editorial.
	   Reflecting the feeling in the Arab world that Washington is
tough on Iraq and soft on Israel, the newspaper wrote that ``the
giant United States has become a lion before Iraq but an ostrich
and a helpless rat before Israel.''
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to try and force Baghdad to rescind its Saturday
decision to end cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. The U.N.
Security Council has condemned the Iraqi decision.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.
	   It is not clear, however, whether the United States' Gulf allies
would allow the use of bases on their territory.
	   On Tuesday, a Saudi official said King Fahd told the defense
secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks
on Iraq.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   But the Pentagon said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq.
	   During the standoff between Iraq and the U.N. over weapons
inspectors in February, Kuwait was the only Arab state that opened
its air bases to U.S. and British warplanes.
	   Cohen earlier visited Bahrain and Kuwait.

Traffic accidents kill 54,909 Chinese in nine months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Traffic accidents killed 54,909 people and
injured 2.26 million in this year's first nine months, as China's
roads grew increasingly dangerous.
	   While traffic fatalities rose 4.7 percent from January-September
last year, injuries soared by 61.5 percent, the state-run newspaper
Legal Daily reported Thursday without giving comparative figures.
	   The report said police were trying to reverse the trend by
enforcing harsher penalties for drunken driving and other common
offenses.
	   The country has seen the number of fatal accidents rise along
with an explosion in the number of vehicles on its overcrowded and
chaotic roads. Traffic fatalities hit a world record 73,861 last
year.
	   Many of those on China's roads are new drivers with little
experience and minimal respect for traffic laws. Drivers commonly
drive down oncoming lanes, cross intersections and change lanes
without watching for other vehicles.

game.

Troubled Lao Aviation seeks foreign partner to fly again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) _ With most of its fleet held back from
international flights due to safety concerns, troubled Lao Aviation
is seeking a foreign partner to restore its credibility.
	   Company officials and the newspaper Pasason said Wednesday that
the state-controlled airline is sifting through a number of
proposals and is eager to find a deal before Visit Laos Year opens
in 1999.
	   Nearly all of Lao Aviation's fleet _ mostly Chinese- and
Soviet-built aircraft _ has been restricted to Laotian airspace
since midyear. Only a single French-built ATR-72 is serving routes
to Thailand, Cambodia, China and Vietnam.
	   The landlocked, mountainous country, one of Asia's poorest and
least accessible, has taken an economic knock in its slow evolution
out of communist central planning due to the economic crisis
engulfing its richer neighbors.
	   The problems have hurt the airline, though official financial
figures are not known. Early this year, foreign embassies in Laos
began advising their staffs against flying Lao Aviation both
domestically and internationally.
	   In June, the United Nations issued a notice prohibiting any
travel on the airline for its employees following the grounding of
the fleet because of lack of spare parts.
	   Problems for the airline intensified after an acrimonious
dissolution May 15 of a joint-venture agreement with Yunnan
Airlines of China. The arrangement had given the Chinese partner 60
percent of the company and veto power over decisions.
	   A senior Lao Aviation official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday that the company is looking for a new
deal that must give the Laotian carrier a majority 51 percent share
and final say over operations.
	   Under the old agreement, Lao Aviation's Chinese-made Y-7
aircraft were serviced in Xian, China. Following the breakup,
maintenance trips to China ended and the international reputation
of Lao Aviation was seriously downgraded.
	   The company official said that Swiss Air Group had made a
financial offer to the Laotian government for a share of the
company. It was unknown if the offer would cover the carrier's
considerable debt.
	   A private company, Thai Flying Service, has also expressed an
interest in a tie-up and has submitted an investment feasibility
proposal to the country's foreign investment review agency.
	   The newspaper reported that Singapore's Alpha Aviation PTE Ltd.
has made an official bid to join Lao Aviation and establish a
helicopter service to fly to remote areas of the country not served
by airstrips.
	   In a move specifically designed to cater to an expected increase
in foreign travelers, the government also has ordered the airline
to acquire a second ATR-72. The official said the company is now
testing the market to lease a used ATR with a later option to buy.
	   The airline is also undergoing an internal shakeup. Executives
are worried that the company will lose face for the country if the
airline's problems are not somehow addressed for next year's
tourism campaign.

Philippine stocks rebound on bargain-hunting; index up 2.8 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rebounded Thursday
as investors, heartened by a stable peso and Wall Street's
overnight gains, resumed bargain-hunting, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 47.51 points,
or 2.8 percent, to 1,761.60.
	   A technical correction Wednesday shaved 87.55 points, or 4.9
percent, from the index. Wednesday's loss ended eight sessions of
gains that had added 333.95 points, or 23 percent, to the index.
	   The strong performance of Manila shares Thursday caught market
pundits by surprise.
	   ``Fundamentally, this rally is unjustifiable. We were expecting
the correction to continue, but demand, especially for blue-chip
stocks, was pretty strong,'' said Astro del Castillo, analyst for A
and A Securities Inc.
	   Traders surmised that investors used the stable peso and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average's 76.99-point gain Wednesday as excuses to
resume bargain-hunting.
	   Property and gaming concern Belle Corp. was the most actively
traded stock, finishing 26 centavos, or 12 percent, higher at 2.38
pesos on speculation that the company's much-awaited jai-alai
franchise may finally be approved by Congress.
	   Jai-alai, a fast-paced ball game, is a popular and profitable
gaming activity.
	   The market's resiliency, in contrast to the weakness displayed
by major Asian markets Thursday, may also stem from expectations
that the peso will continue to outperform the dollar, said Jose
Ricardo Garcia, vice president for Diversified Securities Inc.
	   With remittances from Filipino workers set to pick up by the
middle of this month ahead of Christmas, inflows are likely to
improve, thus further easing pressure on the peso.
	   In currency trading, dealers said the peso was weighed down by
minimal dollar inflows and profit-taking by some banks that have
taken long dollar positions.
	   The dollar averaged 39.585 pesos for the day, up from
Wednesday's average of 39.380 pesos. It reached a high of 39.780
pesos, and closed at 39.770 pesos.
	   Generally weaker Southeast Asian currencies also weighed on
sentiment for the peso, traders said.
	   The peso has gained 11 percent since averaging 43.974 pesos to
the dollar on Oct. 1, when it began getting strong support from
investment inflows for the stock market and remittances from
Filipinos working overseas.
	   The release of inflation data for October did not affect the
stock or currency markets, as the figure was in line with
projections of many economists.
	   The government said inflation was 10.2 percent in October
compared to a year ago and was up 0.6 percent from the previous
month.

Revived Tropical Storm Mitch lashes southern Florida, Keys

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Still picking up after Hurricane Georges, southern
Florida was battered again by tornadoes, heavy rain and high wind
as Tropical Storm Mitch approached after killing thousands in
Central America.
	   Hardest hit as Mitch rolled toward the western coast Thursday
were the slender Florida Keys. Winds up to 55 mph (88 kph) flipped
over trailers in a campground, ripped off a motel roof and knocked
down trees and power lines in the same region pounded by Georges in
September.
	   Seven people were treated and released for storm-related
injuries.
	   ``There've been lots of cuts and scrapes, not hugely serious,''
said Jill Miranda Baker, spokeswoman at a hospital on Plantation
Key. ``Somebody got hit in the head with a tree branch, someone
else got hit by a table they were moving.''
	   Schools were closed Thursday in Monroe County, which covers the
southwest part of Florida's mainland and the 110-mile
(177-kilometer) long Keys. Much of southern Florida was under a
tropical storm warning, and street flooding was already a problem.
	   At 0900 GMT, Mitch was churning toward Florida's southwest coast
at 23 mph (37 kph). Forecasters predicted up to 8 inches (20
centimeters) of rain by the time Mitch spins out into the Atlantic,
probably by Friday.
	   Western Cuba, from Matanzas Province westward and including the
Isle of Youth, also was under a tropical storm warning, as were the
northwest Bahamas.
	   Storm shelters were open in Key West, Big Pine Key, Marathon,
Tavernier and Key Largo. More than 100 people were staying in the
Key Largo shelter, said Irene Toner, operations manager for Monroe
County emergency management.
	   Several tornadoes touched down on the Keys on Wednesday evening,
said Becky Herrin, a spokeswoman for the Monroe County Sheriff's
Office. A few struck Key Largo and one hit near Islamorada.
	   ``It took the roof off the Hampton Inn _ most of the roof,
anyway,'' she said.
	   Farther north, at Calusa Campground, ``a bunch of trailers
turned over and people were trapped inside,'' Herrin said. ``We had
to go trailer to trailer getting people out.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police saying cousin arrested under sedition law,

 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A cousin of ousted Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim became the 18th of his associates to be
detained, a news report said Thursday.
	   Zulkifli Saad was picked up by police at his office Tuesday.
Family members were informed later that he was being held under the
Internal Security Act and would be charged at a later date, the Sun
newspaper reported.
	   Penang state's police chief, Abdul Hamid Mustapha, denied,
however, that Zulkifli had been arrested under the ISA, which
allows for indefinite detention if suspects are deemed a threat to
national security.
	   Abdul was quoted by the state news agency, Bernama, as saying
Thursday that Zulkifli was detained under the Printing Presses and
Publications Act. The report did not say why he had been detained.
	   Zulkifli's arrest would bring to six the number of Anwar's
associates arrested since he was ousted from power on Sept. 2.
Police had detained 12 others who have since been released.
	   Anwar went on trial Monday on charges of corruption and sexual
misconduct. Police said that once the trial ends sometime in June
1999, Anwar will face more sex-related charges.

Lithuanian president arrives in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus arrived
in Ukraine on Thursday to discuss bilateral political and economic
issues with senior Ukrainian officials.
	   During planned meetings with President Leonid Kuchma, Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and parliament speaker Oleksandr
Tkachenko, Adamkus is to discuss strengthening economic ties,
namely more effective implementation of a 1995 bilateral free trade
agreement.
	   The sides also plan to talk about Ukraine's closer cooperation
with other Baltic states, including construction of new transport
routes from the Baltic region to the Black Sea.
	   Accompanying Adamkus is a large delegation of Lithuanian
businessmen, who are to discuss with Ukrainain entrepreneurs the
creation of new joint ventures and new investment projects.
	   Ukraine was Lithuania's fourth largest trade partner in 1997,
and the trade turnover between the two former Soviet republics
amounted to dlrs 314 million in the first seven months of 1998, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   On Friday, Adamkus will visit the western Ukrainian city of
Lviv.

German finance minister meets country's central bankers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine met
on Thursday with Germany's top central bankers, with many hoping
the talks will help resolve a row over his demands for an interest
rate cut to boost the economy and reduce unemployment.
	   The visit, which the government described as a courtesy call,
was Lafontaine's first as finance minister to the fortress-like
German central bank, or Bundesbank, located in a Frankfurt suburb.
	   The Bundesbank central council will debate cutting rates at the
meeting, though it is not expected to cut rates.
	   Lafontaine has provoked strong debate with his repeated calls
for interest rate cuts and for the Bundesbank to factor in cutting
unemployment and boosting growth when deciding monetary policy.
	   Many central bankers regard the suggestions as heresy, saying
their job is to maintain steady prices and low inflation, not get
involved in problems they say are structural and can only be solved
by broader economic, or political, measures.
	   Increasingly, analysts are suggesting Lafontaine may be trying
to divert attention from the government's promises to cut
unemployment by making the central bank co-responsible for the
issue in the eyes of the public.
	   Lafontaine was trying to make the Bundesbank a scapegoat because
the new government ``has presented far too few recipes against
unemployment,'' said Ulrich Ramm, head economist at Commerzbank,
speaking on Inforadio Berlin-Brandenburg.
	   The leader of the Federal Union of German Banks, Manfred Weber,
called on the government ``to do its economic homework,'' adding he
shared its view that cutting unemployment was the country's most
pressing challenge.
	   ``Where I completely disagree is in the measures and instruments
with which we can achieve it,'' Weber said, adding he hoped
Lafontaine's meeting with central bankers would clear up the row.
	   The new government was elected largely on promises to cut
unemployment, which on Thursday dropped to 10.1 percent, a slight
dip from last month.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police have barred a prominent democracy
campaigner from attending a human rights ceremony in the United
States and have detained four other dissidents in eastern China.
	   Ren Wanding said Thursday that Beijing police rejected his
request for a passport to attend the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial
Center for Human Rights' annual award ceremony in Washington next
Monday.
	   Police told him ``they oppose this conference'' and that as a
former prisoner under parole he had no right to attend, Ren said in
a telephone interview.
	   ``I protested, saying I did have the right and that they were
wrong not to let me go.''
	   Ren and fellow dissident Wei Jingsheng received the Robert F.
Kennedy Memorial Human Rights Award in 1994, when they were in
prison. Wei was given a medical parole last year and went into
exile in the United States.
	   Ren, a veteran activist who spent 1979-1983 in prison, finished
another seven-year prison term in 1996 for making speeches during
the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989. According to
his sentence, however, he has been stripped of his political rights
until next June.
	   In defiance of those terms, Ren has recently joined efforts to
form an opposition party and has been interrogated and placed under
police surveillance.
	   Ren said police pressure has forced him to temporarily put off
trying to register a Beijing branch of the China Democracy Party.
	   Dissidents in at least nine provinces and major cities have
attempted, as required by law, to register the party since June. So
far, authorities have refused and have detained many of its
members, mostly for short periods.
	   Meanwhile, 109 dissidents issued an appeal Thursday through a
Hong Kong-based human rights group for the release of Wang Youcai,
a China Democracy Party supporter detained along with three others
earlier this week in the eastern city of Hangzhou.
	   One of those detained, Wang Ce, lives in Spain and is thought to
have slipped back illegally into China via the Portuguese enclave
of Macau, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   The others were Li Li, who traveled back to China from France,
and Hangzhou-based dissident Huang Heqing, it said.
	   Meanwhile, another Beijing-based dissident, Gao Hongming, has
written a letter protesting the rejection of his candidacy for a
seat in the city legislature, the Information Center said.
	   Gao, who spent two years in a labor camp after the 1989
crackdown on the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, was one of three
dissidents who had sought and failed to win approval to run for the
city legislature in elections this month.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Aleksandras Lileikis, charged with
sending scores of Jews to their deaths during the Nazi occupation,
appeared in court Thursday in a wheelchair and proclaimed his
innocence, but was rushed away in an ambulance minutes later.
	   Doctors said the 91-year-old Lileikis may have suffered a heart
attack and the judge postponed the court proceedings until Monday.
	   Lileikis' trial was to have begun in September, but was delayed
when his lawyers said he was too ill to come to court. The court
appointed a panel of doctors to examine him, which said he was in
poor health but fit to stand trial.
	   Lileikis was head of the security police in Vilnius during the
1941-44 Nazi occupation. He is charged with genocide for allegedly
turning over more than 70 Jews to a Nazi execution squad.
	   ``I was working for my nation and my country for all my life and
now I am old and weak. But I can still say I did nothing wrong in
my lifetime,'' Lileikis told the court from his wheelchair.
	   Minutes later, his hands began trembling, he started reciting
the Lord's Prayer and he asked for more air. His daughter rushed to
his side, crying and handing pills to her father.
	   The judge called for a recess and asked doctors to examine
Lileikis, who was taken to an adjoining room and then rushed away
in an ambulance.
	   It is the first Nazi war-crimes trial in the countries of the
former Soviet Union. Some Jewish groups have criticized Lithuania
for being slow in beginning the trial, alleging that officials hope
Lileikis will die before the start of proceedings that would bring
painful reminders of the slaughter of the occupation years.
	   About 90 percent of Lithuania's 240,000 pre-war Jews died during
the occupation.
	   Lileikis emigrated to the United States in 1955, and lived in
Norwood, Massachusetts, where he worked for a publishing house. He
returned to Lithuania in 1996 as a U.S. court took steps to revoke
his citizenship and deport him.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's intelligence chief
testified Thursday that a top aide of the prime minister may have
schemed with other Cabinet ministers to oust Anwar Ibrahim, the
former deputy leader now on trial.
	   Daim Zainuddin, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's chief economic
adviser, plotted with the sister of Anwar's private secretary to
prove Anwar was indulging in illegal sex, Mohamed Said Awang
testified on the fourth day of Anwar's corruption and sexual
misconduct trial.
	   A statement by Ummi Hafilda Ali, saying her brother's wife had
sex with Anwar, is being used by the prosecution in the trial.
	   The other statement being used against Anwar is by his personal
driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, who said Anwar sodomized him 15 times.
	   The details of possible involvement of government ministers in a
scheme to unseat Anwar were mentioned in a police report that was
sent to Mahathir in August 1997, Mohamed said during his
cross-examination by defense lawyers.
	   ``Did the report you gave to the prime minister contain a
statement from you that the allegations were politically
motivated?'' Christopher Fernando, one of Anwar's nine defense
attorneys, asked Mohamed.
	   ``I don't deny it,'' he replied.
	   ``Did you mention that Daim Zainuddin met with Ummi Hafilda as
part of the scheme?'' Fernando asked.
	   ``I don't deny that,'' said Mohamed.
	   Mohamed startled the court earlier by saying he might lie under
oath if ordered to do so by his bosses.
	   Fernando asked him: ``If someone higher than the deputy prime
minister were to instruct you to come and lie to the court here,
would you do it?''
	   Mohamed replied: ``Depends on the situation.''
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul interjected, looking somewhat
alarmed, ``So you may lie?''
	   ``I may or I may not,'' the witness replied.
	   Gasps erupted through the public gallery of the federal
courthouse filled with journalists, international human rights
activists and members of Anwar's family.
	   Anwar, 51, fired on Sept. 2, faces 10 counts of abuse of power
and sexual misconduct. He denies the charges and says they were
fabricated because Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad considered his
popularity a threat to his 17-year rule.
	   On Wednesday, Mohamed accused Anwar of trying to force police to
cover up his alleged sexual misconduct. He testified that Anwar
demanded that intelligence officers use a secret method called
``Operation Turning Over'' to intimidate the two people who had
accused him of sexual misbehavior.
	   Mohamed testified that the method, a ``great secret'' he
declined to reveal in court, worked. The two gave him retractions
that Anwar demanded be forwarded to Mahathir.
	   On Thursday, he became flustered and dodged defense questions
about how the Special Branch ``neutralized'' suspects it deemed
uncooperative.
	   Mohamed said he agreed to get the retractions from Ummi and
Azizan despite believing the sexual allegations.
	   The 54-year-old Mohamed, on leave prior to his retirement,
denied he was afraid of losing his pension.
	   Since Anwar's arrest Sept. 20, tens of thousands of Malaysians
have participated in street protests demanding his release and
Mahathir's resignation.
	   The case attracted international attention after Anwar showed up
at his arraignment Sept. 29 with a black eye and bruises. He
claimed police beat him after his arrest.
	   In another development, the national news agency Bernama
confirmed earlier reports that Mahathir is among the 52 people the
prosecution plans to call as witnesses.
	   Others on the list are Daim, Malaysia's police chief Abdul Rahim
Noor, former members of Anwar's staff and 20 police officers.
	   Meanwhile, Anwar's cousin became the 18th of his associates to
be detained, Bernama reported Thursday.

Govt. troops retake key buildings in northern Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops drove rebel forces
out of key buildings and began reclaiming control of a city in
northern Tajikistan in a second day of heavy fighting, officials
said Thursday.
	   The fierce battle for Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125
miles) north of the capital, Dushanbe, was one of the most serious
outbursts of violence since a peace accord was signed last year,
ending five years of civil war in the small, impoverished Central
Asian nation.
	   The government press service said up to 100 government troops
have been killed, but presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov put the
death count at 39. He said 50 rebels had been killed, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The government claimed it had retaken two buildings belonging to
the Interior Ministry, which the rebels seized when they stormed
the city Wednesday morning.
	   By midday Thursday, there was still fighting in and around the
old fortress in the city center, but the government troops were
gaining the upper hand, according to Interior Minister Khumdin
Sharipov.
	   The government was also pouring reinforcements into the region.
	   Tajikistan's Vice Premier Abdurakhmon Azimov said in a radio
broadcast that ``there will be no negotiations or consideration of
the rebels' demands. The matter in question is to block and
liquidate them.''
	   The rebels still controlled the northern town of Aini, about 140
kilometers (87 miles) northeast of Dushanbe. They have taken all
government buildings, appointed a new police chief, and confiscated
large amounts of industrial explosives from a local factory, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   But a strategically important mountain pass, just below the
town, was still controlled by government troops, and small groups
of refugees were moving along toward Dushanbe, Interfax said.
	   The attackers were led by Makhmud Khudoberdyev, a former army
colonel who turned against hardline President Emomali Rakhmonov
last year, authorities said. The rebel forces were estimated to
number several hundred, possibly as many as 1,000.
	   Khudoberdyev issued a statement Thursday, and said he would not
negotiate with the government until it broadcast his demands on
national television and radio.
	   ``We have decided to enter the political arena ... to force the
Rakhmonov government to listen to the voice of its own people and
to end the terror against its political opponents,'' the statement
said.
	   Representatives of seven nations, along with the United Nations
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, met in
the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, to discuss potential solutions to the
crisis.
	   The civil war was waged between Rakhmonov's secular government
and the mostly Muslim opposition. Since the peace deal was signed,
the main opposition groups have been participating in a National
Reconciliation Commission.
	   However, a number of warlords have refused to recognize the deal
and continue to attack government forces.
	   Russia has about 25,000 troops in Tajikistan to support the
government, with most deployed along the country's southern border
with Afghanistan to prevent an influx of drugs and weapons. The
Russian forces were not involved in the latest fighting.

US defense secretary in Oman to lobby for action against Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen arrived
in Oman Thursday to press for support for possible military strikes
against Iraq, but so far there appeared to be little backing in the
region for the use of force.
	   Cohen arrived in Oman from Qatar where he met with the emir,
Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, and Foreign Minister Hamad bin
Jassim al-Thani. No details of the meeting were available.
	   Cohen was to meet with Sultan Qaboos and other senior Omani
officials before flying to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
	   At least publicly, there appears to be little support for any
U.S. military action against Iraq.
	   ``Can the United States imagine that there is a country, whether
Arab or not, except its subservient Britain, which can say `yes' to
striking Iraq?'' Egypt's Al-Akhbar, a state-owned newspaper, asked
in a front page editorial.
	   Reflecting the feeling in the Arab world that Washington is
tough on Iraq and soft on Israel, the Egyptian newspaper wrote that
``the giant United States has become a lion before Iraq but an
ostrich and a helpless rat before Israel.''
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to try and force Baghdad to rescind its Saturday
decision to end cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. The U.N.
Security Council has condemned the Iraqi decision.
	   The United States has about 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.
	   It is not clear, however, whether the United States' Gulf allies
would allow the use of bases on their territory for launching
strikes against Iraq.
	   On Tuesday, a Saudi official said King Fahd told the defense
secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks
on Iraq.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   But the Pentagon said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq.
	   During the standoff between Iraq and the United Nations over
weapons inspectors in February, Kuwait was the only Arab state that
opened its air bases to U.S. and British warplanes.
	   On his current trip, Cohen earlier visited Bahrain and Kuwait.

French high school students plan new round of protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Disgruntled high school students were planning a
third round of nationwide marches Thursday in what was seen as a
test of their fledgling movement, which last month drew hundreds of
thousands of protesters.
	   Demonstrations were set for the cities of Bordeaux, Toulon,
Saint-Brieuc, Toulouse, Nice, and Lyon as well as Paris. Meetings
and sit-ins were planned in high schools throughout the country.
	   The students are protesting overcrowded classrooms, outmoded
equipment, a lack of teachers and other conditions they say leave
them badly prepared for the future.
	   Following last month's protests, Education Minister Claude
Allegre announced the addition of thousands of new teachers and
assistants.
	   But many students remain skeptical that the Education Ministry's
plans, which also called for new equipment and a lighter work load,
are sufficient to improve conditions.
	   Last month's protests disintegrated into violent rock-throwing
demonstrations, resulting in injuries and property damage. Much of
the violence was caused by youths from troubled suburbs who were
not connected to the protests.
	   Anticipating further violence, French police announced plans for
tight security in the capital Thursday.
	   They banned street parking as of Wednesday evening and urged
merchants to shutter their shops along the planned march route from
the Montparnasse train station to the Education Ministry.

Singapore's Keppel announces layoffs, closures, mergers amid
</HEADLINE>
losses &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Facing a big loss this year, Singapore's
government-linked Keppel conglomerate announced Thursday it will
reduce its work force by 10 percent and sell, merge or close 50 of
its 600 companies.
	   Keppel Chairman Sim Kee Boon told reporters without elaboration
that the group, which now has 9,000 workers, faces ``quite a big
loss.'' He added that the group, which includes banking, shipyard
and property development divisions among others, should return to
profits in 1999.
	   ``We have decided on severe cost-cutting measures leading to
about 100 million Singapore dollar (dlrs 60 million) savings per
year, or about 12 percent of the group's overhead,'' he said.
	   The savings don't include relief expected to come from
government measures such as a cut in mandatory company contribution
to employees' retirement programs, he said.
	   ``Since the Asian financial crisis (began) last year, few in the
region have been spared,'' Sim said. ``For the Keppel group, it
seems 1985 has revisited us.'' That year was the beginning of
Singapore's last recession.
	   As part of ``some serious spring cleaning,'' Keppel will sell,
merge or close about 50 companies that either don't fit into the
group's core business or have ``persistently underperformed,'' he
said.
	   ``We have to energetically prune and remove deadwood,'' Sim
said.
	   Among the companies being sold will be the regional liner
shipping business of Keppel Telecommunication and Transportation
Ltd., the U.S. leisure and aviation businesses of Keppel Marine
Industries Ltd. as well as trading and general contracting
businesses under Keppel Integrated Engineering Ltd.
	   ``Some of these divestments will not be immediate,'' he said.
``We will dispose of them over time, at prices we are happy with.
If not next year, then maybe the year after.''

German chancellor meets Polish leaders

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Polish leader urged visiting German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Thursday to pledge clear support
for Poland's swift entry into the European Union.
	   Schroeder, on his third foreign trip since taking office Oct.
27, was meeting Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and President Aleksander
Kwasniewski.
	   Aside from European integration, the leaders were expected to
discuss reparations for Nazi-era slave laborers from Poland, a
painful issue in the two neighbors' troubled past.
	   Schroeder's visit to Germany's biggest eastern neighbor was
intended to show the significance of German-Polish ties, which have
fully recovered from decades of enmity over World War II only after
the fall of the Iron Curtain. Poland is Germany's biggest business
partner in eastern Europe and in line to join NATO and the EU.
	   But Poles were alarmed by Schroeder's call for ``realism'' in
accepting new EU members soon after his election. His predecessor,
Helmut Kohl, pushed strongly to get Poland into the European Union.
	   ``I hope that today's visit by Chancellor Schroeder will be an
unambiguous signal that Germany will support Poland's entry into
the European Union,'' Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said on
Polish radio.
	   Deputy foreign minister Guenter Verheugen, traveling with
Schroeder to Warsaw, said Germany would seek to have Poland join
the EU in 2002. But Kohl's suggestion that it could happen by 2000
was ``not serious,'' he said.
	   ``It is Poland's task to create the conditions for EU
membership,'' Verheugen told reporters on Schroeder's plane.
	   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer reassured Polish leaders on a
visit to Warsaw last week that Germany supports an EU spot for
Poland, but he left his hosts uneasy by failing to name a date.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Aleksandras Lileikis, charged with
sending scores of Jews to their deaths during the Nazi occupation,
appeared in court Thursday in a wheelchair and proclaimed his
innocence, but was rushed away in an ambulance minutes later.
	   Doctors said the 91-year-old Lileikis may have suffered a heart
attack and the judge postponed the court proceedings until Monday.
	   Lileikis' trial was to have begun in September, but was delayed
when his lawyers said he was too ill to come to court. The court
appointed a panel of doctors to examine him, which determined he
was in poor health but fit to stand trial.
	   Lileikis was head of the security police in Vilnius during the
1941-44 Nazi occupation. He is charged with genocide for allegedly
turning over more than 70 Jews to a Nazi execution squad.
	   ``I was working for my nation and my country for all my life and
now I am old and weak. But I can still say I did nothing wrong in
my lifetime,'' Lileikis told the court from his wheelchair.
	   Minutes later, his hands began trembling, he started reciting
the Lord's Prayer and he asked for more air. His daughter rushed to
his side, crying and handing pills to her father.
	   The judge called for a recess and asked doctors to examine
Lileikis, who was taken to an adjoining room and then rushed away
in an ambulance.
	   It is the first Nazi war-crimes trial in the countries of the
former Soviet Union. Some Jewish groups have criticized Lithuania
for being slow in beginning the trial, alleging that officials hope
Lileikis will die before the start of proceedings that would bring
painful reminders of the slaughter of the occupation years.
	   About 90 percent of Lithuania's 240,000 pre-war Jews died during
the Nazi occupation.
	   Lileikis emigrated to the United States in 1955, and lived in
Norwood, Massachusetts, where he worked for a publishing house. He
returned to Lithuania in 1996 after a U.S. court took steps to
revoke his citizenship and deport him.

Asian markets end mixed as investors cash in on earlier gains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian shares turned in a mixed performance
Thursday, with prices falling on the big Tokyo and Hong Kong
markets at the same time some smaller exchanges were showing big
gains.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed
186.44 points, or 1.28 percent, closing at 14,341.37. On Wednesday,
the Nikkei had surged 575.06 points, or 4.12 percent, on comments
from an influential Wall Street strategist that Tokyo stocks were
undervalued.
	   Reports in a major Japanese business daily Thursday that the
government will delay debating sweeping tax cuts until the regular
Parliament session next year also hurt market sentiment.
	   ``The market's uncertain situation is continuing,'' said Sachio
Ishikawa of Chuo Securities in Tokyo.
	   The dollar rose against the yen as Japanese banks and investors
bought dollars following Tuesday's U.S. elections, in which the
Democratic Party's stronger-than-expected showing eased concerns
over a possible impeachment of President Bill Clinton, analysts
said.
	   The dollar bought 117.64 yen in late afternoon, up 1.00 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
116.60 yen overnight.
	   In Hong Kong, share prices retreated as some investors decided
to sell blue chips that had climbed nearly 30 percent in a six-week
rally.
	   The Hang Seng Index ended down 286.27 points, or 2.7 percent, at
10,221.98. It had gained 149.73 points, or 1.4 percent, on
Wednesday.
	   But analysts saw no signs of sentiment turning negative.
	   ``There's no bad news in the market. The market's run out of
steam,'' said Jerry Pang of HSBC Securities Asia Ltd.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mixed as investors cashed in on the
market's earlier gains. The STI closed 1.53 points, or 0.10
percent, lower at 1,299.52.
	   BANGKOK: The benchmark index ended 2.3 percent higher as
investors continued buying on a stronger baht and easing of local
interest rates. The SET index rose 7.97 points, closing at 362.08.
	   MANILA: Shares ended higher as investors, heartened by a stable
peso and Wall Street's overnight gains, resumed buying oversold
stocks. The PSE Index closed up 47.51 points, or 2.8 percent, at
1,761.60.
	   JAKARTA: Massive foreign buying of blue chips sent the benchmark
index up 7.6 percent at the close to a 10-week high. The JSX
Composite Index was up 25.069 points to 355.528.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares finished higher on buying by local
institutional investors. The Composite Index closed up 6.96 points,
or 1.6 percent, at 438.66.
	   SEOUL: Share prices ended 1.1 percent higher, rising for the
eighth straight day on massive buying demand from foreigners. The
KOSPI was up 4.73 points, closing at 418.20.
	   SYDNEY: Shares ended moderately lower, with the finance sector
accounting for much of the losses after National Australia Bank
Ltd. reported its annual earnings. The All Ordinaries index was
down 7.5 points, or 0.30 percent, closing at 2,672.4.
	   TAIPEI: Shares ended higher on a strong showing in electronics
stocks and government efforts to ease corporate financial crises.
The Weighted Price Index was up 51.95 points, or 0.75 percent,
closing at 6,957.27.
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 finished at its highest point since
August, buoyed by hefty gains by international markets overnight.
The benchmark index closed up 63.92 points, or 3.3 percent, at
2,029.73.

Bishop calls for international effort to end Sudan war

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A Catholic bishop urged world leaders on
Thursday to intensify efforts to end the civil war in southern
Sudan that has killed an estimated 1.5 million people in 15 years.
	   ``We call on the international community to focus on this
conflict where millions of lives are at risk, and where there is
the gross daily assault on human life and dignity,'' said Bishop
John H. Ricard.
	   Ricard, the bishop of Pensacola, Fla., and president of the
Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services, spoke to journalists in
Kenya after a two-day visit to southern Sudan.
	   Ricard and CRS officials, including Executive Director Kenneth
F. Hackett, visited the towns of Rumbek and Mapuordit in the Lakes
Province about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southwest of Khartoum.
	   Both towns are controlled by the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army.
	   ``In my many years of travel in Africa and many other parts of
the world, I have found the conditions in the south (Sudan) are
without parallel,'' Ricard said.
	   CRS, one of the major private and U.N. agencies providing
emergency food, clothes, and medical and veterinary assistance to
southern Sudan, operates feeding centers for up to 900 malnourished
children in Rumbek and Mapuordit.
	   Food shortages are a persistent problem in southern Sudan.
Rebels or government soldiers often burn or steal crops on which
their enemies rely, causing famine.
	   Aid workers estimate 1 million people are facing severe food
shortages in southern Sudan, mainly in Bahr el-Ghazal province,
north of the Lakes Province.
	   Most of the needy in Rumbek and Mapuordit fled recent fighting
in Bahr el-Ghazal.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is dropping 9,500 tons of food a
month into southern Sudan, the world's largest aid operation at the
moment.
	   The rebel SPLA has been fighting the Muslim government in the
north since 1983 to demand more autonomy for Christians and
animists in the south.
	   Both sides declared a cease-fire to let international aid
agencies work in the southern provinces.
	   Ricard said the Vatican and Catholic bishops in the United
States have stressed the need for a peaceful settlement in southern
Sudan.
	   ``It is clearly evident that unless there is some move toward a
peaceful solution to this problem, many of these conditions will
remain,'' Ricard said.
	   The next round of peace talks between the rebels and the
government was scheduled for February.

Basque separatist group says cease-fire could become permanent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA said
Thursday that its current cease-fire could develop into a
definitive renunciation of violence, news reports said.
	   This transformation of the indefinite cease-fire announced by
the separatists in mid-September into a permanent end to the
group's bombings and shootings depended on ``progress made in the
near future,'' ETA said in a statement published in the radical
newspaper Euskadi Informacion, national Spanish radio reported.
	   The statement followed Tuesday's announcement by Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar authorizing contacts with organizations linked to
the ETA.
	   Late Wednesday, official government spokesman Josep Pique said
the government was seeking direct talks with ETA ``without
intermediaries.''
	   It was not immediately clear whether ETA's statement, written in
the Basque language, was written prior to or after the governmen
displayed its new willingness to negotiate an end to the conflict.
	   ETA has been fighting for an independent Basque homeland
incorporating parts of northern Spain and southern France for 30
years. The group, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom
in the Basque language, has killed nearly 800 people.

Japanese airliner faces inspection over maintenance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese aviation authorities plan a quick
inspection Friday at the maintenance division of All Nippon Airways
after one of its planes flew from Honolulu to Nagoya despite a
malfunctioning instrument, an official said.
	   The Boeing 747, carrying 357 people, made the flight to the
central Japanese city on Aug. 11 without incident, Takeshi Endo, a
Transport Ministry official, said Thursday.
	   But he said that under ANA's maintenance rules, the two vertical
speed indicators installed in the plane's cockpit both must be
functioning. Only one was functioning properly, he added.
	   Endo said that in a pre-flight inspection in Hawaii, a worker
for United Airlines, which does ANA's maintenance work there, found
the malfunction and reported it to ANA's office in Tokyo.
	   But ANA gave the go-ahead for the flight's departure anyway, he
said.
	   ANA did not notify the Transport Ministry until a Japanese
newspaper recently reported the case, Endo said. ANA then reported
that an in-house inspection had found no other unreported cases, he
added.
	   Naoto Takada, a spokesman for ANA, said the company has
reconfirmed that all workers must thoroughly abide by all
maintenance rules.
	   ANA, Japan's second-largest airline, has 131 passenger jets,
including 39 Boeing 747's, flying its domestic and international
routes, Takada said.

Man accused of car bombing at Kremlin has mental disorder, doctor
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian man who blew up his explosives-laden car
at the Kremlin gates has been found mentally ill and remained in a
Moscow hospital Thursday with minor injuries, officials said.
	   Ivan Orlov, a 65-year old freelance journalist for a right-wing
political magazine, drove his car across Red Square on Wednesday
evening, and then jumped out and detonated a bomb just outside
Spassky Gate, which sports a tall red clock tower that is one of
Russia's most distinctive symbols.
	   Spassky Gate, the main pedestrian entrance to the Kremlin, is
heavily guarded.
	   A soldier and two officers of the Kremlin guard, who rushed to
stop Orlov, suffered numerous injuries and remained hospitalized
Thursday.
	   Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Orlov once
belonged to his party but had been expelled for ``extremism.''
	   Zhirinovsky, speaking to reporters in parliament, described
Orlov as a ``loser.''
	   ``He was an enraged man, whose whole life went wrong,''
Zhirinovsky said. ``He had family problems and was criticized at
work.''
	   Orlov worked for the magazine Russian Pravda, which carried
anti-Semitic and nationalist articles, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   The editor of Russian Pravda, Alexander Aratov, told Interfax
that Orlov ``hated President Boris Yeltsin because Yeltsin's policy
had driven him to despair.''
	   Orlov also authored two books, ``The Country of Yeltsin'' and
``Russia Is Moaning from Its Leaders.''
	   Yeltsin's office is inside the Kremlin walls, but the president
has been been in the Black Sea resort of Sochi since last Friday
recovering from an illness.
	   Aratov also said that Orlov had personal problems. He said Orlov
was divorced, but had to share the same apartment with his former
wife and her numerous relatives.
	   After the car explosion, Orlov tried to shoot himself with a
pistol, but was apprehended by police, authorities said.
	   A psychiatrist examined him at a hospital on Wednesday and
issued a preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said, citing the Federal Security Service, which carries out
the investigation.
	   The Security Service said the self-made bomb contained about 500
grams (1.1 pounds) of explosives. Earlier reports said the bomb
contained 6 kilograms (13 pounds) of dynamite.

Bin Laden `hero' to some who warn U.S. against his capture

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An Islamic militant group on Thursday
threatened to retaliate if Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden is
arrested, and described Washington's No. 1 enemy as a ``hero'' to
Muslims worldwide.
	   Bin Laden, believed to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were
indicted Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in the U.S. embassy
bombings in Africa and are accused of conspiring to kill Americans
outside the United States. The State Department also announced a
reward of up to dlrs 5 million for bin Laden's capture.
	   ``It is a challenge to the entire Muslim world ... Bin Laden is
a hero of the Muslim world,'' said Omar Warsi, a leader of
Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or
Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet. ``If anything happens to
him, America will be responsible.''
	   Many Sipah-e-Sahaba followers are fighting in neighboring
Afghanistan alongside the Taliban army, which rules 90 percent of
Afghanistan and has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
those areas.
	   Warsi's group is well-armed with everything from machine guns to
rocket launchers. In Pakistan, it has been blamed in killings of
hundreds of Shiite Muslims, whom the group reviles as non-Muslims
based on a centuries-old dispute over who was the proper successor
to the Prophet Mohammed.
	   Harakat-ul-Ansar, a Pakistan-based organization labeled a
terrorist group by the United States, said, however, that
foreigners in Pakistan ``have nothing to fear from us.''
	   Harakat is considered a strong supporter of bin Laden, and
several Harakat followers were killed in the U.S. missile attack on
alleged bin Laden terror sites in Afghanistan.
	   ``What the United States does is their business,'' said Abdul
Bassit, a Harakat follower. He added, however, that the United
States should know bin Laden ``is a good Muslim, and all the Muslim
world thinks he is a good Muslim.''
	   The Taliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not be
extradited. However, they have set up a judicial inquiry to accept
evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity and have
promised to prosecute him if the evidence warrants it.
	   Washington blames bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, for the Aug. 7
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224
people, including 12 Americans, and injured an estimated 5,000
people.
	   The United States retaliated Aug. 20, firing Tomahawk cruise
missiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in eastern
Afghanistan. At least 26 people were killed, but damage to the area
was not considered extensive.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan evacuated nonessential staff and
family members prior to the August bombing of Afghanistan, fearing
retaliation. While some embassy workers are back, their dependents
and about 30 percent of the staff have not been allowed to return.
	   Embassy officials said no fresh security warnings followed
Wednesday's indictment. Security measures already in place include
cement barricades blocking the road leading to the U.S. Embassy in
Islamabad and razor-sharp barbed wire topping the brick-walled
compound.
	   In the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, on the border
with Afghanistan, the U.S. consulate is surrounded by barbed wire
and protected by an armored personnel carrier and dozens of armed
police.

Unemployment rate sinks in Germany, continuing slight improvement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout; CORRECTS lower unemployed figure is east
Germany &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's record-high unemployment
eased for a second consecutive month in October, dropping to 10.1
percent from 10.3 percent, the federal labor office in Nuremberg
said Thursday.
	   Nationwide, 3.89 million people were jobless, 43,000 less than
in September, when German unemployment dropped below 4 million for
the first time in two years.
	   Labor office chief Bernhard Jagoda attributed the continued
improvement to expanded job-creation plans, especially in the five
states of the former communist East Germany. Joblessness has been
most severe in the east, which is still adjusting to a market
economy after unifying with the capitalist west in 1990.
	   Unemployment in the east remained almost twice that in the west:
15.7 percent in October compared to 8.7 percent. Still, conditions
in the east improved slightly more than in the west. About 23,000
more people in the east had jobs than in the previous month,
compared to 20,000 in the west.
	   The labor office figures were unadjusted for seasonal factors.
Adjusted numbers from Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank,
showed a higher unemployment rate _ 10.6 percent in October, down
just one percentage point from its September rate.
	   Jagoda said he expected joblessness to remain below 4 million,
although his office said October's promising numbers did not yet
reflect Germany's weaker economy. The office said jobs creation in
the future could slow if global financial trouble persisted.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian police have freed a Taiwanese fishing boat
owner who was held hostage aboard the vessel by Chinese sailors
demanding he pay their overdue wages, news reports said Thursday.
	   The Fufang-2 boat, sailing under a North Korean flag, had
arrived at Russia's Far Eastern port of Nakhodka for repairs. Its
crew included 45 Chinese sailors, 10 Taiwanese, 10 Burmese and 18
Russians and Ukrainians, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. But it
was the Chinese who incited the protest over the wage debt,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   The fishermen had threaten to stab to death their employer,
identified as Lin Ziren, if he failed to pay the dlrs 100,000 he
owed in back wages, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   But Lin managed to send a distress message to the water police
in Nakhodka.
	   Twenty Russian police officers were sent to rescue him, and one
policeman and one fisherman were lightly wounded during the
operation, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The sailors retained control of the boat until the Chinese
consul general from the regional center of Khabarovsk persuaded
them to surrender Thursday, the report said.
	   There was no word on whether any arrests or promises to repay
back wages had been made.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks ending inconclusively; edits to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan discussed a water
sharing dispute Thursday, part of an attempt to improve relations
between the nuclear rivals, even as they continued skirmishes along
the Kashmir border.
	   Thursday was the first day of talks over the next week in New
Delhi on a range of issues that have been overshadowed by the main
dispute between the two neighbors: their competing claims to the
Himalayan border region of Kashmir.
	   India had hoped progress on other issues could improve the
atmosphere to the point where Kashmir could be tackled. But
Pakistan maintains that no progress can be made until Kashmir is
resolved.
	   Since their twin independence from Britain in 1947, India and
Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, a border region divided
between them that both claim in its entirety.
	   The two sides regularly skirmish along the Kashmir border.
Indian police reported Thursday that three civilians were killed by
a Pakistani shell that landed in a northwestern region of the
Indian-held portion of Kashmir Wednesday night.
	   Their enmity and Kashmir's central role in the rivalry became an
international concern in May, when India and Pakistan conducted
underground nuclear tests, declared themselves nuclear powers and
generated global fears of a nuclear confrontation.
	   Hopes were raised when Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif met in July and
agreed to resume peace negotiations that had been suspended in
1997. But when Pakistan's top foreign office bureaucrat and his
Indian counterpart met last month in the Pakistani capital to
discuss Kashmir, their consultations yielded little more than
pledges to meet again in February.
	   Like those talks, Thursday's meeting between water ministry
officials from India and Pakistan ended inconclusively, with a
promise to meet again on an as yet undetermined date. In a joint
statement, the two sides said they merely ``exchanged views'' and
reviewed negotiations last held in 1992 on the use of the Jhelum
River, which flows through Kashmir.
	   Under a 1960 agreement, Pakistan was to have unrestricted use of
the waters of the Jhelum. India wants to construct a dam to control
the Jhelum's flow to make the river navigable in the dry season.
India says the dam would not affect the water flow to Pakistan, but
Pakistan has questioned whether the plan conflicts with the 1960
agreement.
	   The dispute is all the more difficult to resolve because it
involves a river in Kashmir.
	   Six days of talks are scheduled through Nov. 13 in New Delhi. On
Friday, defense ministry officials take up the tangled issue of
Siachen, a glacier battlefield in Kashmir.
	   An Indian foreign ministry official had indicated the best that
could be hoped for was an agreement to stop the almost daily
skirmishing across the border in Siachen. The two countries cannot
even agree on whether they agreed to withdraw troops from the
glacier when they last met on the issue, in 1992.
	   Other issues on the New Delhi agenda include a proposal to start
bus service between the Indian capital and the Pakistani border
city of Lahore, and a possible deal for Pakistan to sell
electricity to India. Officials from both sides have said they
expect few breakthroughs in New Delhi.

Royal Dutch-Shell profits hit by low oil prices and Asian

recession &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. said Thursday
that quarterly profits fell by 56 percent as it suffered the
effects of depressed oil prices and the recession in the
Asia-Pacific region.
	   The Anglo-Dutch oil giant reported net income of dlrs 841
million, or 25 cents a share, for the three months ending Sept. 30,
compared with dlrs 1.9 billion, or 60 cents per share, in the same
period a year earlier.
	   Quarterly revenues fell 21 percent to dlrs 33.1 billion, from
dlrs 41.9 billion a year ago.
	   For the first nine months of the year, Royal Dutch-Shell
reported net income of dlrs 4.3 billion, or dlrs 1.14 per share,
down by 31 percent from dlrs 6.3 billion, or dlrs 1.79 per share,
in the same period a year earlier.
	   Revenues for the nine-month period came to dlrs 103.7 billion,
down 19 percent from dlrs 128.4 billion.
	   Lower crude oil prices and gas extraction significantly hurt
earnings in exploration and production, the company said. Oil
production fell by 1 percent and gas sales fell by about 4 percent
compared with the same period last year.
	   Although the company sold 1 percent more oil products than they
did this time last year, earnings were hit by lower profit margins
on refining, the company said.
	   Profits in the chemicals division were also hit by the Asian
recession, the company said. They were down 90 percent to dlrs 27
million, from dlrs 284 million during the same period last year.
For the first nine months of the year, earnings from chemicals were
down 30 percent to dlrs 489 million from dlrs 701 million.

China scorns Dalai Lama, warns Washington over contacts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With the Dalai Lama readying peace overtures to
Beijing while on a U.S. tour, China scorned the exiled Tibetan
leader as a separatist Thursday and warned Washington not to
support him.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao accused the Dalai
Lama of having agitated for Tibet's independence from China for
years.
	   ``There are no facts to prove that he is repentant,'' Zhu said
at a twice-weekly media briefing.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin offered to restart a dialogue with
the Dalai Lama in June as long as the Tibetan leader renounced
separatism and stated that Tibet and Taiwan are part of China. A
spokesman for the Chinese government was quoted Thursday by state
media as saying those conditions still stand.
	   Aides to the Dalai Lama have said he will deliver a response to
the Chinese offer during a current 10-day visit to the United
States, possibly during his four-day stay in Washington, which
starts Saturday.
	   It was unclear how far the Dalai Lama was willing to go to
satisfy Chinese demands. He has argued for years that he wants true
autonomy, not independence for Tibet. Many exiled Tibetans have
also grown impatient with his support for non-violent struggle
against China's often harsh 47-year rule of their fervently
Buddhist homeland.
	   The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet amid a failed anti-Chinese
uprising in 1959, has since gained a worldwide following, won the
Nobel Peace Prize and met with world leaders _ prominence that has
stung China.
	   Zhu, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, warned Washington
not to arrange any meetings between the Dalai Lama and senior U.S.
officials.
	   If Washington does so, ``it plays a role in conniving and
supporting his activities which will seriously hurt the feelings of
the Chinese people,'' Zhu said. He added that recently warm
Chinese-U.S. ties would be at risk.
	   During a nationally televised news conference in Beijing in
June, U.S. President Bill Clinton suggested to Chinese President
Jiang that Jiang meet with the Dalai Lama and said the two might
even like each other.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After several delays, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Thursday presented the land-for-peace agreement with
the Palestinians to his Cabinet for approval, taking a necessary
step toward implementation of the accord.
	   The Cabinet was expected to narrowly ratify the agreement
despite vocal opposition by several ministers. However, the vote
might not be taken until Friday or even Sunday, after many hours of
debate, said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.
	   Netanyahu had postponed the Cabinet meeting twice in two days,
charging that the Palestinians had failed to present a time table
for the arrests of 30 suspects in the killings of nearly 100
Israelis.
	   Bar-Illan said the Cabinet was convened after Israel received
assurances from the United States on Wednesday evening that the 30
would be arrested in three stages, with the roundup to be completed
by the end of January.
	   However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the
Palestinians had not provided any new assurances in the past two
days. Erekat said the latest delays and disputes did not bode well
for the implementation of the accord.
	   ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu to stop such painful tactics, to stop
exporting blame to us ... and maybe to start thinking in the
mentality of a partner,'' Erekat said.
	   Under the accord reached during last month's Mideast summit at
the secluded Wye Plantation in Maryland, Israel is to withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank over a period of 12 weeks, with the
Palestinians taking steps against Islamic militants during each
phase of the pullback.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that 12 of the
wanted men were already in detention, and that he would make an
effort to round up the others.
	   A Palestinian police official said Thursday that in all, 14 were
in jail. Several of the suspects have been in Palestinian jails for
months or years, but Palestinian security officials in the past
refused to provide exact figures.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, meanwhile, delayed his trip to
the region. Ross was to arrive on Thursday to oversee
implementation of the agreement, but is now expected over the
weekend, Palestinian officials said.
	   While the dispute over the wanted men appeared to have been
settled, the next crisis already loomed on the horizon.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials have widely divergent
interpretations of the procedure that will lead to the annulment of
clauses in the Palestine Liberation Organization founding charter
calling for Israel's destruction. The paragraph in the peace
agreement addressing the issue is vaguely worded.
	   Israeli officials insist that the clauses by annulled with a
vote by the Palestine National Council, a body with hundreds of
members.
	   However, the agreement only says that PNC members, along with
members of other Palestinian organizations, will be invited to a
meeting in mid-December during which an Arafat letter to U.S.
President Bill Clinton concerning the revoking of the offending
clauses will be reaffirmed.
	   Israel radio said several Cabinet ministers planned to approve
the peace accord only on condition that a sentence is added
declaring that the charter clauses by annulled by a PNC vote.
	   Such an addition could create new confusion, though Bar-Illan
said the Cabinet members were not trying to change the accord.

Sex lives threatened by smoking, Thai men warned

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai men who smoke may have shrugged
off threats of heart and lung disease, but a new warning appearing
Thursday on cigarette packets should grab their attention _
``Smoking Causes Impotence.''
	   However, not everyone believes it.
	   ``I've been smoking for 20 years, and my sex life is fine,''
said Somboon Thonglee, 35, a taxi driver. ``I have two kids and one
on the way to prove it. Unless the government is slipping something
we don't know about into the cigarettes, I'm not worried.''
	   One government branch, the Thai Tobacco Monopoly, is obliged to
obey the regulations of another, the Health Ministry, in printing
warnings on the packs of the 16 brands of cigarettes it makes. So
are foreign tobacco companies exporting here.
	   The impotence warning is the latest of 10 that are required to
be rotated after every 5,000 packs. The other nine stress concerns
ranging from ``Cigarettes Affect Passive Smokers'' to ``Smoking
Leads People to Other Addictive Substances.''
	   All the warnings and studies behind each claim are weighed and
decided by the Health Ministry.
	   Adulvit Kitchakarn, deputy managing director of the Tobacco
Monopoly, believes bringing sex into the picture was a clever move,
though it could hurt sales, particularly among the young.
	   ``This might just scare them away,'' Adulvit joked.
	   Last year, the monopoly generated more than 30 billion baht
(dlrs 830 million) for the government, a sizable sum as Thailand
struggles to make ends meet amid the worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   But the state enterprise is stuck between two major forces _ the
need to keep up a solid smoking customer base to justify its
existence, and health authorities keen to get Thais, especially the
younger generation, off the tobacco hook.
	   Adulvit professes to be untroubled by it.
	   ``We are not in the business of encouraging people to smoke,''
Adulvit said. ``We are simply providing a consumer product to
generate money for the state. It's a global trend that smoking is
on the decline, especially among the more developed countries.''
	   Health Ministry officials refused to comment on the new warning.
But Dr. Prakit Vateesatogkit, a member of a government committee
that has drafted regulations for tobacco control, said the
impotence study was carried out by the American Council on Science
and Health.
	   The target of the warning, Prakit said, is actually middle-aged
men, proportionally the higest-smoking population. More Thais are
smoking now than 15 years ago, he said, but the overall percentage
of smokers among the population is smaller.
	   ``In general, sex is something every culture is conscious of,''
Prakit said. ``If they know that smoking can affect sex, it will
affect their decision to smoke.''
	   The last time sex became a major concern for Thai smokers was
about 15 years ago, when a rumor made the rounds in the
impoverished northeast that smoking reduces the size of a man's
penis, said Adulvit, who was in tobacco marketing research at the
time.
	   No warning to that effect was ever put on cigarette packets.
	   ``We concluded that it was a combination of a psychological
effect originating from the bad rumor, combined with the cool
weather of the region,'' Adulvit said.

Annan calls for urgent action to protect children's rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called
on the international community Thursday to take immediate action to
protect the rights of children
	   In a message to a conference organized by UNICEF and the
Cyprus-based Center for World Dialogue, Annan said that the
``international community needs to act now and on many fronts to
honor what is in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child.''
	   ``No aim is more intensely desirable than that of eradicating
the dangers to children's lives,'' Annan said in his message.
	   Nearly 13 million young children die each year, 130 million are
denied education and 100 million work in exploitative and hazardous
conditions, including prostitution, Marta Santos Pais, a planning
director for UNICEF, said at the two-day conference.

Yokoo takes 4-point lead in Acom International
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IWAKI, Japan (AP) _ Japanese golfer Kaname Yokoo took a
four-point lead Thursday in the opening round of the 120 million
yen (dlrs 1.02 million) Acom International.
	   Yokoo, winless in three years as a pro, shot an eagle, seven
birdies and two bogeys for 17 points on the 6,948-yard
(6,323-meter), par-72 Seve Ballesteros Golf Club course.
	   The tournament's modified Stableford scoring system awards 8
points for a double eagle, 5 for an eagle, 2 for a birdie, zero for
par, minus-1 for a bogey and minus-3 for a double bogey or worse.
	   Toshimitus Izawa, winner of the Tokai Classic last month,
collected 13 points, followed by Toru Suzuki's 10.
	   Another point behind at 9 were Tsuyoshi Yoneyama, Katsunori
Kuwabara and Kazuhiko Hosokawa.

Taiwan market stabilizes after government moves to head off crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's stock market showed signs of
stability Thursday, posting modest gains a day after the government
moved to rescue a troubled finance company and urged looser lending
policies to ease a short-term credit crunch.
	   Traders said investors' confidence was boosted after three
state-run banks took over operations of Central Bills Finance Co.
to try to resolve its severe cash-flow problems. But the market was
still rife with vague rumors about troubles at other companies and
some shares continued to plunge.
	   Several customers of Central Bills have recently run into
financial troubles that eventually caught up with Central Bills
itself, which failed to pay back an estimated 4 billion Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 123 million) worth of loans that had come due.
	   After plunging a total of 4 percent Tuesday and Wednesday, blue
chips on the Taiwan Stock Exchange rebounded Thursday with a gain
of 0.8 percent, closing at 6,957.27.
	   But shares in four subsidiaries of two business groups that were
unable to come up with cash to settle their stock deals dropped for
the third straight day by 7 percent, the maximum allowed under
Taiwanese securities law.
	   Traders say the subsidiaries of the conglomerates New Magnitude
and Panvest got into trouble as they tried to prop up one another
through share purchases.
	   Hit by Asia's financial crisis, Taiwan's economy has slowed and
domestic consumption has slumped, leaving many companies struggling
to pay off debts that they ran up when times were better.
	   Even as the stock market calmed, traders were chasing rumors
that more business groups faced financial difficulties, prompting
the Tuntex and Chunghsing Textiles groups to deny they had bounced
checks.
	   Chunghsing's shares dropped amid reports that it planned to sell
its downtown Taipei building to help repay its mounting debts.
	   Premier Vincent Siew has pledged government help to financial
institutions that are sound but facing short-term problems with
cash flow.
	   The government has lowered its forecast of economic growth this
year to 5.3 percent, down from 6.8 percent growth last year, amid
falling exports.
	   But Finance Minister Paul Chiu maintains the economy is still
fundamentally sound. Officials say they expect the economy to
bottom out in the last quarter of 1998 as Asian currencies and
economies have been more stable lately.

Mark McGhee sacked as Wolves manager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOLVERHAMPTON, England (AP) _ Mark McGhee was fired Thursday as
manager of struggling Division One side Wolverhampton Wanderers.
	   Wolves have won just two of their last 12 games and lie 11th in
the first division standings.
	   McGhee, a Scot, joined Wolves from Leicester in 1995. He twice
led the club to the play-offs and last season's FA Cup semifinal
but he never managed to win promotion to the Premier League.
	   Colin Lee, McGhee's assistant manager, was named caretaker boss
at Molineux. The club has not set a timetable on the appointment of
a full-time successor.
	   Managing director John Richards said McGhee was leaving by
mutual consent.
	   ``We all agreed that it would be in the interests of the club to
make this joint decision,'' Richard said. ``Mark fully understood
the position and the meeting ended amicably.''

Czech government not surprised by negative EU report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel urged the
government on Thursday to speed up integration attempts into the
European Union, following EU criticism of Czech slowness in
revamping legislation to conform to West European standards.
	   The report on progress of candidate nations in adapting EU
standards singled out the Czechs for their ``worrying slowdown.''
The Czech Republic, along with Hungary and Poland, are front
runners among the former Soviet bloc countries hoping for
membership.
	   The report said that the Czech Republic, along with Estonia,
Hungary, Poland and Slovenia ``are functioning market economies
that should be able to cope with competitive pressures and market
forces within the union in the medium term.'' But it noted that the
Czech Republic's speed in enacting necessary legislation is not
satisfactory.
	   ``I expected such a critical report,'' President Vaclav Havel
said, adding he asked the government to ``speed up steps that will
lead to the fulfillment of EU's conditions.''
	   Former Premier Vaclav Klaus, the architect of Czech economic
reform, suggested the report was biased, telling the daily Lidove
Noviny: ``In some countries, there is a strong campaign against the
enlargement of the EU.''
	   The Czech Republic is among six countries that are expected to
join the EU in five or six years.
	   Preliminary talks with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus began this year and the EU also opened
``preparatory'' talks with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   The second group are nations facing a tougher job in improving
their economies before serious membership talks can begin.

Environmental activists protest DiCaprio film, `The Beach'

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Leonardo DiCaprio is getting a rough
ride as he shifts from the ``Titanic'' to Thailand.
	   A man costumed as DiCaprio led a colorful environmental protest
Thursday against the Hollywood star's upcoming project, an
adaptation of the best-selling novel, ``The Beach,'' to be shot on
Phi Island off southern Thailand.
	   A handful of protesters staged a performance outside the Bangkok
offices of 20th Century Fox depicting their view that the
government is selling out the country's natural beauty in a quest
for Hollywood dollars and the tourism sure to follow the film.
	   Wearing a DiCaprio mask and a loud tropical shirt, activist
Manit Sriwanichpoom condemned the Forestry Department for allowing
the film makers to adjust the landscape of the island _ which is a
national park _ to create their set.
	   ``The government is making only 4 million baht (dlrs 105,000) to
let the film maker use and change the island,'' Manit said. ``But
can we afford paying for the damage to the environment?''
	   His message was delivered to a somewhat disappointed crowd, many
of whom were female office workers who had heard the Hollywood
heartthrob was in Bangkok and were disappointed to find a masked
Thai activist.
	   On the island, work for the shooting, to begin in mid-January,
is already under way. The film makers plan to replant some 100
coconut trees and temporarily remove some vegetation to broaden one
of the island's beaches for a football playing scene.
	   Santa Petanji, the film's Thai coordinator, told The Associated
Press that the development plan is environmentally friendly and
that 20th Century Fox has placed a 5 million baht (dlrs 132,000)
deposit as a guarantee against any damage.
	   The Thai Film Board, which has rejected Fox's project to film a
Jodie Foster remake of ``Anna and the King'' out of belief it would
be disrespectful to a revered monarch, has no problem with ``The
Beach.''
	   ``The Beach'' is expected to generate 500 million to 1 billion
baht (dlrs 12.5 million to dlrs 25 million) in investment and
employment of local people.
	   Thipawadee Maenyart, chief of the board's secretariat division,
said the film would be free publicity for Thailand's tourism
industry, in the middle of a major two-year campaign. The money
will be especially welcome during the current recession.
	   The board rarely rejects film projects unless the movie is
considered grossly violent or insensitive, Thipawadee said.
	   A locally made film, ``My Dog Eats Biscuits,'' was banned from
the recent Bangkok Film Festival for scenes deemed denigrating to
Buddhism, the country's main religion.

Germany holds South Korea to a 3-3 draw

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Germany earned its first point in the
20th Champions Trophy men's field hockey tournament after holding
South Korea to a 3-3 draw Thursday.
	   However, a draw might not be enough for the South Koreans to
qualify for Sunday's final. It now has five points after four
games. It meets Spain on Friday.
	   Despite the draw, it was a disappointing performance by Germany,
which has lost to Holland, Spain and Australia in previous matches.
	   Germany, which plays Pakistan on Friday, is at the bottom of the
six-team standings with just one point.
	   Song Seong Tac scored twice for South Korea and Kim Jeong Chul
scored the third goal before the half.
	   Frank Gemmrig scored two goals for Germany, including the
equalizer off a penalty stroke in the 59th minute. Christian Kurtz
was the other German scorer.
	   South Korea almost won in the final seconds, but German
goalkeeper and captain Christopher Reitz saved a strong deflection
from unmarked South Korean forward Kang Keon Wook.
	   Song, with a red scarf tightened around his head, moved swiftly
from time to time and in the second half was just off the target
from the top of the striking circle.
	   It was Song's fourth minute effort that put South Korea ahead
1-0. Germany struck back with two superb field goals. Gemmrig's
powerful drive hit the roof of the net in the ninth minute, while
Kurtz scored in a similar fashion in the 31st minute.
	   South Korea replied with two quick short corners in the last
minute before half-time and Kim Jeong Chul tied it at 2-2 on the
second penalty corner.
	   The Germans lodged several challenges against the decisions of
Pakistan umpire Faiz Mohammad Faizi in the second half.
	   Song put South Korea ahead 3-2 ahead in the 51st minute when he
smartly grabbed an opportunity. But Benjamin Kopp managed to win a
penalty stroke for Germany in the 59th minute which was duly
converted by Gemmrig.
	   Result: South Korea 3 (Song Seong Tac, 4th min, 51st min; Kim
Jeong Chul, 45th. Germany 3 (Frank Gemmrig, 9th min, 59th min;
Christian Kurtz, 31st min).

Rwanda accuses reluctant donors of endangering economy reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Despite ethnic violence at home and war in
neighboring Congo, the Rwandan government said its military
spending was under control and accused reluctant donors of putting
economic reforms in danger.
	   Donald Kaberuka, minister of finance and economic planning, said
Wednesday international donors had failed to deliver funds promised
to support Rwanda's economic reforms, despite the country's good
economic performance.
	   ``Reasons are clearly not economic. If the donors told us it is
because of the poor performance of the program, I would
understand,'' Kaberuka said. ``But clearly, the reasons for the
slow disbursement have nothing to do with our economic
performance.''
	   There was no immediate comment from donors.
	   Kaberuka said the slight depreciation of the Rwandan franc
against the U.S. dollar was due to a fall in the price of coffee _
Rwanda's main export _ and delayed disbursement of donors' funds,
and not a rise in military expenditure.
	   On the black market, the Rwandan franc traded at 337 to the U.S.
dollar, up from 320 a month ago.
	   Kaberuka said the country's foreign reserves _ estimated at dlrs
160 million _ were sufficient to keep the currency at its official
rate of 300.
	   Pundits attributed the depreciation as well as tardy paychecks
to civil servants to Rwanda's involvement in a three-month war in
neighboring Congo. The government officially denies supporting the
Congolese rebels who are fighting to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   ``Military expenditure in Rwanda is still within the rate
agreed, which is below 4 percent of the GDP,'' Kaberuka said.
``Despite challenges we face, the defense expenditure is under
control. The government intends to retain discipline.''
	   He said the monthly inflation rate was slashed from 17 percent
last September to 5 percent a year later; monthly food production
was growing at 11 percent; government revenue was 66 billion
Rwandan francs (dlrs 220 million), above a target of 59 billion
(dlrs 196 million); and 1998 public expenditure was cut by 7
billion Rwandan francs (dlrs 23 million) to 73.5 billion (dlrs 245
million).
	   Rwanda, one of the world's poorest countries, has an estimated
dlrs 35 million gross domestic product. Exports of tea and coffee,
mostly to Germany, are the main source of hard currency. Industry
employs only 3 percent of the working population.
	   Last year, the government slashed the defense budget from 34
percent to 20 percent, despite continuing Hutu insurgency in
northwestern Rwanda and crisis in Congo.
	   Earlier this year, it signed a three-year loan facility with the
International Monetary Fund, and entered negotiations on reducing
its dlrs 1.3 billion external debt.
	   Kaberuka said donors' slowness in paying promised money meant
the next year's budget, to be presented Tuesday, will have to rely
heavily on domestic resources instead of foreign aid. Almost half
of the 1997/98 budget, which was 96 billion Rwandan francs, or dlrs
314.5 million, relied on donors' aid.
	   ``The donors' response has been very disappointing. We were
expecting dlrs 56 million, and instead got 30 million,'' Kaberuka
said.
	   ``I'm hoping to pass on the message to donors to assist Rwanda
in remain on track of economic reforms so the objectives agreed are
met.''

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Heavily armed troops fanned out Thursday
in township suburbs a day after protests over fuel price increases.
	   Army foot patrols and riot police watched over thousands of
commuters waiting for buses operated by a state-owned bus company.
Others waited for scaled-back services by private taxi vans in the
dormitory suburb of Chitungwiza, 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of
Harare.
	   In one incident in Chitungwiza, troops prevented a mob from
marching on a gas station they aimed to trash, witnesses said.
	   By noon, crowds of commuters dispersed and troops withdrew from
main streets to enclosed government compounds and police stations
in the suburbs.
	   Earlier, a military helicopter skimmed over townships in eastern
Harare and troops carriers were seen headed for the southwestern
townships of Mufakose and Kuwadzana, scenes of rioting and
stone-throwing Wednesday.

Dutch TV show in hot water over `Teletubbies' spoof
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Note contents 3rd graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HILVERSUM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch spoof of the BBC
children's show ``Teletubbies'' showing the popular characters
simulating sex and violence could land its makers in court, a
programming director has warned.
	   ``Tuberculosistubbies,'' made by irreverent youth channel BNN,
features brightly colored characters bearing a more-than-passing
resemblance to Po, Laa-Laa, Tinky-Winky and Dipsy.
	   But instead of the happy, harmless storylines of the British
Broadcasting Corp. program, the Tuberculosistubbies are shown
simulating sexual intercourse and fighting.
	   As if that isn't bad enough, fans of the Tuberculosistubbies are
now posting obscene messages on a Dutch Teletubbies site on the
World Wide Web, shocking parents whose children visit the site.
	   ``In total, 30,000 adults and children visit our site,'' Cees
Schippers, programming director for Dutch broadcaster Teleac/Not,
told the daily Trouw newspaper for Thursday's editions.
	   ``Since the parody ... many people are visiting the site to pour
filthy language onto the screen. Parents are concerned because they
don't want their children exposed to that kind of language,'' he
said.
	   Schippers said BBC representatives had asked to see a videotape
of the show and may consider legal action against BNN. The BBC did
not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday.
	   The Tuberculosistubbies are shown on BNN's Sunday night program.
This week, the show agreed to remove the offending item from a
Monday afternoon repeat because it would have aired just before
Dutch children's programming got under way.

Asian Crisis nearly sank Thailand's Asian Games hopes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ National pride in being chosen as host
for the Asian Games nearly turned to major embarrassment when
behind-schedule work and the Asian economic crisis almost cost
Thailand the continent's largest sporting event.
	   Bhichai Rattakul, a deputy prime minister and the top government
official overseeing the games, told foreign correspondents
Wednesday that Thailand nearly had the games taken away by Olympic
authorities when work fell far behind schedule last year.
	   ``Thai people like to wait until the last minute,'' said
Bhichai, chairman of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee.
``Just 45 days ago, I couldn't sleep because some of the equipment
hadn't arrived yet.''
	   But Bhichai expressed confidence that everything would be in
place when the 8,000 athletes from 43 countries arrive to compete
in the Dec. 6-20 games.
	   Thailand was awarded the games eight years ago during the fever
of an economic boom that saw the Southeast Asian country post some
of the world's highest growth rates.
	   But little progress was made on developing the facilities, and
when Thailand became the first Asian nation to fall into economic
crisis last year, it was unclear whether it could stage the event.
	   However, proposed alternatives _ among them Malaysia and South
Korea _ soon had their own crises to worry about.
	   A year ago, problems included inadequate transportation to the
sporting venues, a construction company that lacked cash to
complete a major sports complex, and private sponsors who suddenly
found themselves hard up for cash.
	   Bhichai was appointed committee chairman last November when the
Democrat Party, which he once led, took office. One of his first
acts was to do away with the daily allowance for committee members
of 2,000 baht (dlrs 55) to attend meetings.
	   To ease the burden for countries experiencing financial crisis,
Bhichai said the committee lowered fees from dlrs 70 to dlrs 50 per
athlete per day. A few countries _ he declined to name them _ still
could not meet the obligation and the committee is helping them.
	   ``I don't see it as a compromise,'' said Bhichai. ``What matters
is that all the countries who want to be here can do so.''
	   The committee is expecting to break even, with about 2.8 billion
baht (dlrs 78 million) from sponsorship and another 700 million
baht (dlrs 19.6 million) from ticket sales.

S.Africa warns Congo crisis could spread
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Thursday warned
the Congo conflict, which reportedly involves troops from at least
eight nations, could engulf Africa in a major war.
	   Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz
Pahad said the escalating crisis, triggered by a rebellion against
President Laurent Kabila, could damage continent-wide efforts for
political and economic stability.
	   ``If this conflict is not stopped the danger of a massive
African war is a reality,'' he said ``It could set us back for many
years.''
	   The comments echo the sentiments of the U.S. State Department's
top Africa official, Susan Rice, who last month warned of
``Africa's first world war.'' Rice is visiting regional leaders but
her trip has yielded few results.
	   Tutsi-led rebels, backed by Uganda and Rwanda, are seeking to
oust Kabila, who himself last year overthrew dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko.
	   Pushing forward from their bases in eastern Congo, the rebels
launched a lightning assault in August and attacked the capital
Kinshasa. However, a last minute military intervention by troops
from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola repelled the assault.
	   Numerous efforts towards resolving the war have produced little
in the way of concrete results, chiefly because Kabila refuses to
talk directly with the rebels, which he claims are a proxy for
foreign interference in his country.
	   However, sources close to the peace talks believe the onset of
the rainy season in the vast and mineral rich central African
country may offer a chance to clinch a deal.
	   Despite a recent announcement by Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe that a new offensive was planned against rebel bases, one
source said all countries involved were keen to solve the crisis.
	   ``The countries that are involved militarily are all looking for
a way out,'' the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Forget the public postures. ... Governments are saying things
publicly that they do not mean privately.''
	   South Africa is involved in shuttle diplomacy with both sides.
Following a meeting with rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba last
week, President Nelson Mandela will meet with Rwandan strongman
Vice-President Paul Kagame on Friday in Pretoria.
	   The Congo foreign minister is expected to arrive in South Africa
next week.

Shadowy ``Patriots'' group may be linked to restaurant blast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in graf 11 two died, sted three &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Police investigating a deadly
restaurant blast said on Thursday a shadowy new terrorist group
calling itself The Patriots may be linked to the bombing.
	   A letter sent by the previously unknown group to a local radio
station has claimed responsibility for bombing a Cape Town police
station earlier this year.
	   Though the letter does not mention the Planet Hollywood attack,
the pipe bomb used was ``forensically identical'' to the one placed
in the restaurant, police director Leonard Knipe told a news
conference.
	   Knipe also said 13 other bombings in Cape Town in recent years
had used devices with similar tell-tale signs such as tooling marks
and design, which indicated they came from a single source. The
other bombings targeted police buildings and the homes of Muslim
clerics.
	   ``An assumption can be made that the people who placed the
Planet Hollywood bomb may have placed other bombs,'' Knipe said.
	   Knipe said the letter, and the group it describes, could be a
``red herring'' but the police were following up all possible
leads. Police stressed they had no other information on such a
group.
	   The letter, postmarked on the same Aug. 25 date that the Planet
Hollywood bomb exploded, calls for a crackdown on drug dealers,
illegal bars and corrupt police officers.
	   It expresses sympathy with local Islamic vigilante organization
PAGAD, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs, but says The Patriots
are a separate group.
	   ``We, however, will remain underground and independent since our
background is strongly militaristic,'' the letter said.
	   Threatening to take further action unless its demands are met,
the group said: ``Our sincere prayer is that the taking of innocent
lives be minimal''.
	   Two people died after a bomb exploded at the bar of Planet
Hollywood in the Waterfront area, one of Cape Town's top tourist
destinations.
	   Initially a caller to a local radio station claimed the blast on
behalf of a local Islamic group, but the organization later denied
responsiblity and condemned the attack.
	   Knipe said forensic experts sifting through the debris had
recovered traces of a blue and white checked shirt, bearing the
``Soviet'' label, which was wrapped around the bomb.
	   With only 150 such shirts sold in the Western Cape area, Knipe
appealed for help in tracing its owner. ``I am quietly optimistic
that Planet Hollywood will be solved,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ International conventions outlawing genocide and
other crimes against humanity mean that Gen. Augusto Pinochet
should face trial for human rights abuses committed during his
17-year tenure as Chile's dictator, lawyers argued Thursday.
	   ``Torture and other serious crimes against humanity have been
well-established as crimes in international law throughout the '70s
and '80s, and indeed earlier than that,'' said Christopher
Greenwood, a lawyer representing a Spanish magistrate, British
prosecutors and the Spanish government.
	   On the second day of Pinochet's appeal of a High Court finding
that his Oct. 16 arrest on a Spanish warrant was illegal, lawyers
continued arguing that Pinochet should not be granted immunity
because of his status as a former head of state.
	   England's 1978 State Immunity Act, under which the High Court
quashed Pinochet's arrest last week, should be superseded by
international conventions that Britain has signed onto, the lawyers
said.
	   On Wednesday, the five judges hearing the case in Britain's
highest court, Parliament's House of Lords, overruled objections
from Pinochet's lawyers and agreed to hear new arguments that
prosecutors did not raise at the High Court hearing.
	   The prosecutors will attempt to throw doubt on whether Pinochet
was actually head of state throughout his rule, particularly in the
first violent hours after he seized power on Sept. 11, 1973, and
whether international law now calls for anyone accused of genocide,
torture and kidnapping to face a court.
	   The present Chilean government says some 3,000 political
opponents were killed or disappeared during the years Pincohet held
power after ousting President Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   ``Our argument can be put in one sentence,'' said lawyer Alun
Jones, arguing against the High Court ruling. ``It is no part of
the functions of a head of state recognized by English or
international law to behave like that.''
	   Jones also argued that even if Pinochet has immunity for
tortures and killings carried out in Chile by DINA, his secret
police, he remained legally responsible for killings of opponents
in other countries, including Spain, Italy, and the United States.
	   The son of Allende's foreign minister, Orlando Letelier, killed
in a 1976 car bombing in Washington, is among a delegation of
Chilean lawmakers and human rights activists now in London
highlighting human rights abuses committed under Pinochet.
	   The hearing in the House of Lords, originally scheduled to end
Thursday, was expected to last until Monday. The Lords, who do not
sit on Fridays, may not decide the case immediately.
	   Pinochet, who underwent back surgery Oct. 9, remains under
police guard in a north London hospital.
	   In Chile, the government said Wednesday that if Pinochet
returns, he should quit politics totally and ask for forgiveness.
Pinochet has had immunity from prosecution in Chile as a
senator-for-life and under laws he initiated.

Crowley in doubt for tour

<TEXT>
	   CALOUNDRA, Australia (AP) _ Wallaby forward Dan Crowley suffered
a serious ankle injury at training Thursday, putting him in doubt
for the two test tour of France and England this month.
	   An Australian team spokesman said Cameron Blades would join the

	   MAGURELE, Romania (AP) _ Prince Charles first missed the hoop.
Then, to everyone's delight, he netted a perfect basket.
	   Charles is on a week-long tour of Eastern Europe. On Thursday,
in a village near the capital, he shook hands with disabled
Romanians and listened carefully how they construct their own
wheelchairs and try to use computers.
	   ``It is a very moving gesture for us, because usually all the
other people avoid us or forget we exist,'' said Gheorghe Filip,
27, who has been forced to use a wheelchair since a truck hit his
bicycle five years ago.
	   Charles promised to visit Filip after he sets up his own
wheelchair repair shop in the northeast Moldova region in the
coming years.
	   In bright sunshine, the heir to the British throne played
basketball and spoke about the problems of the young teenagers
helped by the British-Romanian Motivation Wheelchair foundation.
	   The foundation was set up in 1993 with the help of the British
Motivation Charitable Trust and has trained dozens of people who
cannot walk.
	   ``We help these people restart another life,'' said Dinu Oana,
one of the students who works for foundation. ``Before meeting us
most of them were ashamed of their body and did not leave their
beds and houses.''
	   Charles also had lunch with Premier Radu Vasile at the
18th-century Mogosoaia palace.
	   In the afternoon, Charles is due to visit Stavropoleos, an
ornate 18th century Orthodox monastery in Bucharest.

China to restrict ITICs as debt fears loom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Hong Kong-China-ITICs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Chinese regulators plan to curtail the
securities activities of state investment companies, underscoring
concern that the debt-laden companies could threaten the Chinese
economy.
	   Such companies _ known as investment trusts, or ITICs _ have
been under scrutiny since one of the best-known, Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., or GITIC, was closed last
month after it couldn't pay dlrs 2 billion in foreign debt.
	   Regulators are crafting rules to curb speculative investments by
ITICs and reduce their exposure to Chinese stock markets, officials
told Dow Jones Newswires this week. Companies eventually would have
to get rid of their stock-trading and brokerage operations.
	   ``The long-term goal is to completely separate ITICs from the
securities industry,'' said an official of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The collapse of GITIC and rumored troubles in other such
companies have worried Hong Kong's financial community, source of
much of the money that fueled the ITICs' boom.
	   China's central bank chief, Dai Xianglong, reportedly told a
group of visiting Hong Kong bankers this week that a few other
investment trusts would go the way of GITIC, but he suggested they
would be limited in number.
	   In a closed-door meeting in Beijing Wednesday, People's Bank of
China governor Dai, however, stopped short of promising Hong Kong
monetary chief Joseph Yam and banking executives that all of
GITIC's debts would be repaid, Hong Kong media reported.
	   Created in the mid-1980s, investment trusts are state-owned but
meant to propel economic reform by giving managers a free hand to
make commercial decisions without political meddling. The most
famous is China International Trust and Investment Corp., which is
owned by the Chinese Cabinet and has holdings in Hong Kong and
abroad.
	   Many raised capital by offering unusually high interest rates.
Regulations on their businesses were limited. Under pressure to
repay depositors, many ITICs got involved in real estate and other
profitable but speculative investments.
	   When the real estate market fell in 1994 after China imposed
austerity measures to stop 20 percent inflation, ITICs switched to
the stock market. Stock prices have soared in recent years, but
regulators worry about high debt loads among the companies.
	   Assets of the 240 ITICs are believed to total some dlrs 36
billion, while their total debts are unknown. But their overseas
debt alone has been estimated to be as much as dlrs 10 billion.
	   Officials are moving gradually to clean up the ITICs, apparently
concerned about the effect on confidence in Chinese financial
markets and the billions of yuan deposited in the companies by
private savers.
	   Officials say most ITICs will be closed or merged with healthier
ones, paring their ranks to 40.
	   But many are technically bankrupt and only 50 to 60 percent of
assets are recoverable, a central bank official said.
	   The official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said most
companies would gradually disappear, with their businesses taken
over by securities companies and banks. The government would place
top priority on helping creditors and debtors, he said.

E. Timorese exiles threaten terrorist attacks against Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An East Timorese group opposed to
Indonesian rule in the disputed territory Thursday threatened
terrorist attacks against Indonesia if Jakarta does not allow six
East Timorese asylum-seekers to leave the country.
	   Azancot de Menezes, the exiled Lisbon representative of the
Timor Socialist Party, said his group was ready to coordinate the
attacks with pro-independence guerillas based inside East Timor.
	   ``We can strike at military and economic targets inside
Indonesia,'' de Menezes said in a telephone interview. ``We have
the right to find ways of pressuring Indonesia. We just hope it
doesn't come to that,'' he added.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, after the departure of
Portugal's colonial administration.
	   The pro-independence Timor Socialist Party, that maintains an
underground network in East Timor and Indonesia, wants Indonesia to
permit the departure of six East Timorese holed up in the Austrian
Embassy in Jakarta.
	   The party's secretary-general, Avelino da Silva, his wife and
two daughters aged four and six, and two other East Timorese
clambered over the embassy compound's walls 14 months ago.
	   They claim they are seeking to escape persecution by Indonesian
authorities. Jakarta has refused to let them leave the country.
	   Indonesia's military have accused Da Silva and his wife of being
members of a bomb-making gang, known as the Black Brigade.
	   The group allegedly planned to blow up civilian targets in their
fight for East Timor's independence.
	   De Menezes said he asked United Nations envoy Jamsheed Marker,
in Lisbon to hold talks with Portuguese officials and East Timorese
exiles, to intervene in the standoff.
	   Marker met with De Menezes on Wednesday, the first day of his
three-day visit to discuss a U.N. proposal to end the stalemate
between Portugal and Indonesia over the territory, 1,200 miles
(1,900 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
	   He declined to give details of the proposal.

Violence continues as Serbian president arrives in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A shootout was reported Thursday
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo,
reflecting continued tension as Serbian President Milan Milutinovic
arrived for a visit.
	   The village of Priluzje, 20 kilometers (13 miles) northwest of
the provincial capital Pristina, came under small-arms fire for
several hours during the night but no one was injured, the Serb
Media Center reported.
	   The center, which carries official Serb viewpoints, said several
houses were damaged in the ensuing shootout, and blamed the attack
on ethnic Albanian extremists fighting for independence.
	   Although the report could not be independently confirmed, there
have been frequent reports of violence and gunfire exchanges
despite last month's U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
	   Milutinovic arrived in Pristina on Thursday and began talks with
local Serb officials. Further details weren't immediately
available.
	   Serb police in Kosovo raised security measures around a coal
mine and power plant outside Pristina following an attack Tuesday
in which three Serb coal mine workers were injured, the independent
Beta news agency reported.
	   NATO said Wednesday that the cease-fire in Kosovo, where
hundreds of people were killed in seven months of conflict between
the ruling Serbs and the ethnic Albanians, seems to be holding
despite occasional skirmishes.
	   Albanians make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
population and suffered the most during the fighting. As many as
300,000 ethnic Albanian civilians were driven from their homes by
Serb police and army forces.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency said Thursday there are
roughly 150,000 displaced people in Kosovo but only a couple of
hundred still living in the open.
	   ``We had an example reported yesterday that there were some
clashes in the west of the country where returnee people went again
to the forest, but it is very small numbers,'' Jacques Franquin
said.
	   The United Nationsl High Commissioner for Refugees is conducting
an overall survey and census and hopes to have more exact figures
within a few days.
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslav authorities have failed to issue visas for a
team from the International War Crimes Tribunal that was due to
head to Belgrade on Friday at the start of a week-long mission to
Kosovo.
	   Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor from the tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands, and the tribunal's president, Gabrielle Kirk
McDonald, scheduled a news conference for later Thursday to express
their anger.
	   On Wednesday, Arbour stressed that Yugoslav authorities are
legally bound to let her investigate alleged atrocities in Kosovo.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian shares turned in a mixed performance
Thursday, with prices falling on the big Tokyo and Hong Kong
markets at the same time some smaller exchanges were showing big
gains. In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed
186.44 points, or 1.28 percent, closing at 14,341.37. Reports in a
major Japanese business daily Thursday that the government will
delay debating sweeping tax cuts until the regular Parliament
session next year hurt market sentiment. In Hong Kong, share prices
retreated as some investors decided to sell blue chips that had
climbed nearly 30 percent in a six-week rally. The Hang Seng Index
ended down 286.27 points, or 2.7 percent, at 10,221.98. The dollar
rose against the yen as Japanese banks and investors bought dollars
after Tuesday's U.S. elections, in which the Democratic Party's
strong showing eased concerns over a possible impeachment of
President Bill Clinton, analysts said. The dollar bought 117.64 yen
in late afternoon, up 1.00 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo.
Markets made strong gains in Thailand, the Philippines, Korea, and
New Zealand. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ With much of the world agreed on
a timetable to cut pollution, a U.N. conference on global warming
is turning its attention to ways to trim the costs of the effort.
U.S. officials this week said efforts to reach those levels should
take into account the enormous expense to scale back emissions.
Some European Union and developing countries disagreed, saying the
price of cleaning the environment should not be the first
consideration. Delegates from over 160 nations are in Buenos Aires
to find ways to implement a 1997 global warming treaty reached in
Kyoto, Japan. At that time, countries agreed industrialized nations
should cut their pollution output by an average 5 percent below
1990 levels by 2012. (GLOBAL WARMING)
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Polish leader urged visiting German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Thursday to pledge clear support
for Poland's swift entry into the European Union. Schroeder, on his
third foreign trip since taking office Oct. 27, was meeting Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek and President Aleksander Kwasniewski. Aside
from European integration, the leaders were expected to discuss
reparations for Nazi-era slave laborers from Poland, a painful
issue in the two neighbors' troubled past. Schroeder's visit to
Germany's biggest eastern neighbor was intended to show the
significance of German-Polish ties, which have fully recovered from
decades of enmity over World War II only after the fall of the Iron
Curtain. Poland is Germany's biggest business partner in eastern
Europe. (POLAND-GERMANY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. said Thursday
that quarterly profits fell by 56 percent as it suffered the
effects of depressed oil prices and the recession in the
Asia-Pacific region. The Anglo-Dutch oil giant reported net income
of dlrs 841 million, or 25 cents a share, for the three months
ending Sept. 30, compared with dlrs 1.9 billion, or 60 cents per
share, in the same period a year earlier. Lower crude oil prices
and gas extraction significantly hurt earnings in exploration and
production, the company said. Oil production fell by 1 percent and
gas sales fell by about 4 percent compared with the same period
last year. Although the company sold 1 percent more oil products
than they did this time last year, earnings were hit by lower
profit margins on refining, the company said. (EARNS-ROYAL

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A senior Apple Computer executive is standing
by his claim that Microsoft bullied his company into using its
Internet software by threatening to pull a popular business program
critical to Apple's bottom line. The allegation supports the U.S.
government's main argument in the antitrust trial that Microsoft
used its dominance in the high-tech industry to manipulate rivals
and customers. Avadis Tevanian, a senior vice president for Apple,
testified that Microsoft used its dominance in the software
industry to force Apple into distributing its browser software,
which let people view the Internet. He said Microsoft threatened to
stop making its popular Mac Office software for Apple if it failed
to comply. Microsoft attorneys tried to deflate the allegation
Wednesday, saying Apple used muscling tactics. They said Apple
threatened to slap Microsoft with a dlrs 1.2 billion lawsuit over
patent infringement. The high-stake negotiations ultimately led to
a surprise August 1997 agreement between the two companies that
stunned many in the U.S. technology industry. (US-MICROSOFT)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditor banks on Thursday approved
Hyundai Motors Co.'s takeover of fellow South Korean automaker Kia
Motors Corp., ending a months-long process of auctioning off the
bankrupt firm. Kia's creditors have been studying Hyundai's
takeover terms since Hyundai outbid Ford Motor Co. and South
Korea's Samsung Motors and Daewoo Motors in October to win the
right to buy Kia. Korea Development Bank and 27 other creditors
said Hyundai agreed to scale down its debt writeoff request from
7.3 trillion won (dlrs 5.6 billion) to 7.17 trillion won (dlrs 5.5
billion). Kia's total debt is estimated at dlrs 9.1 billion. Most
of the creditor banks are controlled by the government, and long
before Thursday's decision government officials had given Hyundai
their tacit endorsement. Kia's collapse last year was widely
believed to have been a key trigger for the onset of South Korea's
economic crisis which forced the country to call in the
International Monetary Fund to bail out its economy. (SKOREA-KIA

category codes:
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Hondurans buried more of their dead
and formed long lines for water and gasoline as officials struggled
to feed and shelter a population still in shock from Hurricane
Mitch. An estimated 13,000 people were missing across Central
America. The national death toll in Honduras estimated at 6,500,
with as many as 1 million homeless. All told, Hurricane Mitch
killed an estimated total of nearly 9,000 people in its rampage
through Central America. ``We really don't know what the numbers
are. There are places we haven't reached yet,'' said Col. Rene
Osorio of Honduras' national emergency committee. A revived
Tropical Storm Mitch raced across the Gulf of Mexico toward South
Florida and the Florida Keys Wednesday, buffeting the region with
pelting rain, wind gusts up to 50 mph (80 kph) and tornadoes.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After several delays, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Thursday presented the land-for-peace agreement with
the Palestinians to his Cabinet for approval, taking a necessary
step toward implementation of the accord. The Cabinet was expected
to narrowly ratify the agreement despite vocal opposition by
several ministers. However, the vote might not be taken until
Friday or even Sunday, after many hours of debate, said Netanyahu
adviser David Bar-Illan. Netanyahu had postponed the Cabinet
meeting twice in two days, charging that the Palestinians had
failed to present a time table for the arrests of 30 suspects in
the killings of nearly 100 Israelis. Bar-Illan said the Cabinet was
convened after Israel received assurances from the United States on
Wednesday evening that the 30 would be arrested in three stages,
with the roundup to be completed by the end of January.

	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops drove rebel forces
out of key buildings and began reclaiming control of a city in
northern Tajikistan in a second day of heavy fighting, officials
said Thursday. The fierce battle for Khodzhand, about 200
kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital, Dushanbe, was one of
the most serious outbursts of violence since a peace accord was
signed last year, ending five years of civil war in the small,
impoverished Central Asian nation. The government press service
said up to 100 government troops have been killed, but presidential
spokesman Zafar Saidov put the death count at 39. He said 50 rebels
had been killed, the Interfax news agency reported. Tajikistan's
Vice Premier Abdurakhmon Azimov said in a radio broadcast that
``there will be no negotiations or consideration of the rebels'
demands. The matter in question is to block and liquidate them.''
(TAJIKISTAN-FIGHTING)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court is hearing a new argument
that genocide and murder are universally recognized as crimes as
five judges decide whether the arrest of former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet is legal. The judges said they would consider
opinions from academics on Thursday, the second day of an appeal of
a High Court finding. The High Court ruled last week that
Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest on a Spanish warrant was illegal. The
court said that as a foreign former head of state, he has immunity
from prosecution for murder, kidnappings and torture of leftists by
security forces while he ruled. On Wednesday, the judges overruled
objections from Pinochet's lawyers and agreed to hear new arguments
that prosecutors did not raise at the High Court hearing. The
prosecutors will ask whether international law now requires anyone
accused of genocide, torture and kidnapping to face a court. The
present Chilean government says some 3,000 political opponents were
killed or disappeared during the 17 years Pincohet held power after
ousting President Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan discussed a water
sharing dispute Thursday, part of an attempt to improve relations
between the nuclear rivals, even as they continued skirmishes along
the Kashmir border. Thursday was the first day of weeklong talks in
New Delhi on a range of issues that have been overshadowed by the
main dispute between the two neighbors: their competing claims to
the Himalayan border region of Kashmir. India had hoped progress on
other issues could improve the atmosphere to the point where
Kashmir could be tackled. But Pakistan maintains that no progress
can be made until Kashmir is resolved. Since their twin
independence from Britain in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought
two wars over Kashmir, a border region divided between them that
both claim in its entirety. (INDIA-PAKISTAN-PEACE TALKS)

Czech government not surprised by negative EU report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel urged the
government on Thursday to speed up integration attempts into the
European Union, following EU criticism of Czech slowness in
revamping legislation to conform to West European standards.
	   The report on progress of candidate nations in adapting EU
standards singled out the Czechs for their ``worrying slowdown.''
The Czech Republic, along with Hungary and Poland, are front
runners among the former Soviet bloc countries hoping for
membership.
	   The report said that the Czech Republic, along with Estonia,
Hungary, Poland and Slovenia ``are functioning market economies
that should be able to cope with competitive pressures and market
forces within the union in the medium term.'' But it noted that the
Czech Republic's speed in enacting necessary legislation is not
satisfactory.
	   ``I expected such a critical report,'' President Vaclav Havel
said, adding he asked the government to ``speed up steps that will
lead to the fulfillment of EU's conditions.''
	   Former Premier Vaclav Klaus, the architect of Czech economic
reform, suggested the report was biased, telling the daily Lidove
Noviny: ``In some countries, there is a strong campaign against the
enlargement of the EU.''

Unemployment rate sinks in Germany, continuing slight improvement

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's high unemployment eased for
a second consecutive month in October, dropping to 10.1 percent
from 10.3 percent, the federal labor office in Nuremberg said
Thursday.
	   Nationwide, 3.89 million people were jobless, 73,700 less than
in September, when German unemployment dropped below 4 million for
the first time in two years.
	   Labor office chief Bernhard Jagoda attributed the continued
improvement to expanded job-creation plans, especially in the five
states of the former communist East Germany. Joblessness has been
most severe in the east, which is still adjusting to a market
economy after unifying with the capitalist west in 1990.
	   A ``fundamental social consensus'' was needed to quickly tackle
joblessness, Jagoda said.
	   Unemployment in the east remained almost twice that in the west:
15.7 percent in October compared to 8.7 percent. Still, conditions
in the east improved slightly more than in the west, with 43,900
people finding jobs there, compared to the west's 29,800.
	   The labor office figures were unadjusted for seasonal factors.
Separately, seasonally adjusted numbers from Germany's central
bank, the Bundesbank, showed a higher unemployment rate _ 10.6
percent in October, down minimally from 10.7 percent the month
before.
	   Jagoda said he expected joblessness to remain below 4 million,
although his office said October's promising numbers did not yet
reflect Germany's weaker economy. The office said jobs creation in
the future could slow if global financial trouble persisted.
	   The year's average would likely be around 4.3 million, instead
of the 4.4 million earlier expected, he said.
	   The opposition Christian Democrats claimed credit for the fresh
drop in jobless figures, calling it ``a positive aftereffect of
Helmut Kohl's government'' and its pro-business reforms.
	   Peter Hintze, the party's general secretary, accused the new
center-left government of threatening to wipe out the improvement
by planning higher taxes on business.
	   The lower figure is likely to cheer the Social Democrat-led
government, which has made fighting unemployment its key goal.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A group of students and human rights
activists on Thursday demanded the release of political prisoners
and the trial of soldiers suspected of violating human rights in
Indonesia's northernmost province.
	   At the justice ministry, 50 protesters criticized the government
despite its pledges to help victims of a military operation against
separatist rebels in Aceh province on the northern tip of Sumatra
Island.
	   The peaceful protest by the Students' Solidarity for Aceh and
the Non-Governmental Forum for Human Rights Defense came three days
after a riot in Aceh. Hundreds of protesters tore down Indonesian
flags at government and military offices.
	   Police arrested 23 people suspected of involvement in the Monday
riot.
	   The military has been accused of widespread abuses in Aceh
during its operation to quell a small rebel group that wants a
separate Islamic state.
	   In a statement, the protesters said only 14 of 54 political
prisoners in Aceh have been released despite pledges by President
B.J. Habibie to free them.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. said Thursday
that quarterly profits fell by 56 percent as it suffered the
effects of depressed oil prices and the recession in the
Asia-Pacific region.
	   The Anglo-Dutch oil giant reported net income of dlrs 841
million, or 25 cents a share, for the three months ending Sept. 30,
compared with dlrs 1.9 billion, or 60 cents per share, in the same
period a year earlier.
	   Oil industry analysts said that although they were expecting
profits to be substantially down, the earnings were worse than
observers had predicted.
	   Alan Marshall, an oil analyst for Robert Flemming Securities,
said that even though the oil market is weak, the results are
``unexpectedly poor'' when compared those reported by competitors
this quarter.
	   ``Exxon, which is the closest comparable, was 23 percent down.
This is more than twice as bad,'' he said. ``They've got a bit of
explaining to do.''
	   He said he was expecting third quarter profits in the region of
dlrs 1.2 billion, on the lower end of the range analysts were
predicting before the results were released.
	   Quarterly revenues fell 21 percent to dlrs 33.1 billion, from
dlrs 41.9 billion a year ago, the company reported.

Philippines protests Chinese military ships' presence in Spratlys
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine officials summoned China's
ambassador in Manila Thursday to protest the presence of Chinese
military ships off a South China Sea reef claimed by both
countries.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the ships, equipped with
guns, were renovating Chinese structures on Mischief Reef in the
disputed Spratly Islands. He said the actions were a violation of a
bilateral agreement to refrain from hostile activities while
territorial disputes are discussed.
	   ``This is a provocative action on the part of the Chinese,''
Mercado told a news conference. He said the Chinese activity was a
``potential security threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the
Philippines.''
	   He presented photographs of the Chinese ships off the reef taken
from Philippine air force reconnaissance planes.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said the government is
preparing a diplomatic note protesting the presence of the Chinese
ships in the reef and the renovation of the Chinese structures
there.
	   ``This will create another ripple on our relations with China,''
Siazon told reporters. ``We will ask for the demolition of the
structures.''
	   The Philippines protested in 1995 when China built concrete
platforms on Mischief Reef, one of several areas in the Spratlys
claimed by both Manila and Beijing.
	   China said the platforms were shelters for fishermen but the
Manila government said they could be used militarily.
	   China's behavior caused suspicion among countries in the region
that it might be trying to gradually seize the Spratlys, which are
believed to lie atop vast deposits of oil, minerals and natural
gas.
	   Siazon said the Philippine ambassador in Beijing, Romualdo Ong,
was notified by Chinese officials recently that they planned to
renovate the platforms on Mischief Reef.
	   Even with such notification, China still violated an agreement
signed in 1995 forbidding such renovations and massive military
presence or movement in contested Spratlys areas, he said.
	   Mercado said the Chinese vessels entered the area Oct. 28 and
included large military cargo and supply ships with helipads to be
used in transporting construction materials to the reef.
	   In 1992, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations issued a
statement advocating a peaceful resolution of the territorial
disputes. China has said it supports the ASEAN resolution.
	   Four members of the regional group, including the Philippines,
have claims in the disputed territories.
	   A visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Manila in 1995
helped ease strains caused by China's structures at Mischief Reef,
but subsequent incidents have strained relations again.
	   The Spratly Islands are also claimed in whole or in part by
Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei.

Russian court says Yeltsin can't run for a third term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Duma failing to pass a bill demanding a medical
check-up of Yeltsin in new grafs 15-16. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's highest court ruled Thursday that Boris
Yeltsin cannot seek a third presidential term in 2000 because he
already has been elected twice, the constitutional limit.
	   The Constitutional Court's decision should finally settle the
question on whether Yeltsin is permitted to run for re-election.
The court noted that Yeltsin himself had all but ruled out seeking
a third term, and the president said through his aides that he was
satisfied with the ruling.
	   ``As a guarantor of the constitution, the president himself has
repeatedly said he wouldn't run again in the year 2000 because that
would contradict the current constitution,'' the court said in its
verdict.
	   The court said there was no case to consider because the
constitution was clear that the president may only serve two terms.
	   But some of Yeltsin's supporters argued that his first term
should not count against the limit, because it began with his
election victory in 1991, before the current constitution was
adopted in 1993. Yeltsin was re-elected in 1996.
	   Yeltsin had been coy about whether he would seek a third term,
letting aides promote the idea. He appeared to have given up the
idea in recent months as speculation has mounted about the state of
his health.
	   The president praised the court's decision as a ``victory of law
over emotions and passions,'' his spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said,
according to Russian news agencies.
	   Yeltsin was satisfied with the ruling, ``since he long has found
an answer for himself to the main question _ he wouldn't take part
in the 2000 presidential elections.'' Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin is currently recuperating from his latest illness at the
Black Sea resort of Sochi in southern Russia.
	   Alexei Zakharov, one of the lawmakers who asked the court to
rule on whether Yeltsin could seek a third term, said the decision
would strengthen Russia's young democracy.
	   ``We should thank the president, he was among those who gave us
freedom. But he should leave on time, in accordance with the law,
without provoking a riot and let people use this freedom,'' said
Zakharov, a member of the liberal Yabloko faction.
	   The president's critics have been saying that Yeltsin is not
physically fit to run the country and should resign. The president
insists he does not have any serious health problems and will serve
out his tenure.
	   Thursday's announcement came on the second anniversary of
Yeltsin's quintuple heart bypass surgery, which sidelined him for
months in 1996. The president has been ill several times since
then, and has been working only sporadically in recent months.
	   A bill that would require the president to undergo a medical
exam, with the results passed on to parliament, narrowly failed in
parliament on Thursday. Some lawmakers opposed it on ethical
grounds and others said it violated the law.
	   A total of 221 lawmakers in parliament's lower house, the State
Duma, voted for the bill, while 56 voted against it. The measure
needed 226 votes, or a simple majority in the 450-seat Duma, to
pass.
	   Yeltsin's fragile health and the court ruling should encourage
several top political leaders to step up their presidential bids.
If Yeltsin were to resign, or give up his office due to illness,
Primakov would take over temporarily and would be required to call
new elections within three months.
	   Top presidential candidates include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and nationalist leader Alexander Lebed. Both have been calling on
Yeltsin to step down early because of his poor health, while
revving up their presidential campaign preparations.
	   The Communists, the most powerful faction in parliament, also
have been calling for Yeltsin to resign because of his health and
inability to tackle the country's economic crisis.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov was second to Yeltsin in the
1996 election. But the party, which has a number of internal
splits, has not named a candidate for the next election.

Jumping the queue? Organized taxi-sharing debuts in London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Standing in line is as much a part of daily life
in Britain as umbrellas and hot tea with milk.
	   Now, though, comes a new plan at one of the country's busiest
train stations that encourages commuters to commit the un-British
sin of jumping the queue _ all part of an effort to move people
along quicker.
	   Those waiting in the back of taxi lines at London's Paddington
Station now can move to the front during the morning rush hour if
they're willing to share a cab with as many as four other people
going in the same direction.
	   BAA spokeswoman Caroline Corfield _ whose company runs the
Heathrow Express train to Paddington from London's busiest airport
_ said it wasn't doing any good getting people to the station
quickly if they then had to wait in a taxi queue for 15 minutes.
	   The rail company pays a ``taxi marshal'' to approach people in
line and organize willing passengers going in the same direction.
Journeys into six designated city zones cost riders anywhere from 4
to 6 pounds (dlrs 6.40 to 9.60) each.
	   Waiting time is cut by one-third, individual passenger fares are
less, and cab drivers make more money per trip, Corfield said.
	   Some passengers quickly have become fans of the system. But
Jamie Macleod of Edinburgh, Scotland, recently chose to stay with
tradition and patiently wait his turn.
	   ``I don't know if I will be the first to be dropped off or the
last, and I don't want to risk a slower journey,'' he told the
Times of London. ``But it does annoy me that people further back in
the queue can overtake me.''

Annan calls for urgent action to protect children's rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged
the international community Thursday to take immediate action to
protect the rights of children
	   In a message to a conference organized by UNICEF and the
Cyprus-based Center for World Dialogue, Annan said that the
``international community needs to act now and on many fronts to
honor what is in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child.''
	   ``No aim is more intensely desirable than that of eradicating
the dangers to children's lives,'' Annan said in his message.
	   Nearly 13 million young children die each year, 130 million are
denied education and 100 million work in exploitative and hazardous
conditions, including prostitution, Marta Santos Pais, a planning
director for UNICEF, said at the two-day conference.

Some 6,000 people evacuated after river floods in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAIA MARE, Romania (AP) _ A river in northwest Romania burst its
banks, flooding nine villages and forcing the evacuation of
thousands of people early Thursday.
	   The Tisa (Tisza) River, which flows from western Ukraine along
the Romanian border through Hungary and Yugoslavia into the Danube,
overflowed after days of heavy rain in Ukraine, taking Romanian
officials by surprise.
	   ``We were not informed by Ukraine,'' said Gabriel Sersescu,an
official of the Romanian Waters Bureau. ``Hungarian authorities let
us know (of the situation) late last night because they have a
powerful radar.''
	   Border police evacuated around 6,000 people, leaving the
villages of Teceu and Remeti on the Romanian-Ukrainian border
completely deserted.
	   ``People spent the night out of doors in pouring rain. They will
get food and tents from the army,'' said Col. Teodor Cristea from
the border police at the northern city of Baia Mare, 450 kilometers
(281 miles) northwest of Bucharest.
	   The river Tisa rose 87 centimeters (35 inches) over the danger
level due to heavy rain and snowfall in Ukraine in the past days.
	   According to a preliminary evaluation, some 150 hectares (370
acres) of fields are under water.
	   Floods in May in the region destroyed crops worth 10 billion lei
(dlrs 1 million).

Hong Kong deports Vietnamese asylum-seekers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government sent 154 Vietnamese
asylum-seekers back to their homeland Thursday, leaving about 1,300
still in jail and awaiting deportation.
	   Thousands of Vietnamese have used Hong Kong as a gateway to a
new life since communist North Vietnam defeated the U.S.-backed
South Vietnam in 1975, but Hong Kong now rejects most asylum
applications and repatriates the people.
	   Earlier this year, Hong Kong abolished its 23-year-old policy of
offering temporary asylum to the Vietnamese and shut down the last
remaining government detention camp for those whose bids for asylum
were unsuccessful.
	   Vietnamese who arrive illegally now are simply held in detention
run by charitable organizations until arrangements can be made to
send them back.
	   The government said 666 Vietnamese have arrived so far this
year, while 1,500 people have been sent back.

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen met with the leaders of Oman and the United Arab
Emirates Thursday to press for support for possible strikes against
Iraq, but he appeared to be gaining little backing.
	   In Oman, Cohen met with Sultan Qaboos, who said he opposed any
unilateral U.S. strike against Iraq.
	   ``The issue must be handled through the United Nations,'' Qaboos
said, according to Omani officials. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Cohen earlier visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.
	   At least publicly, there appears to be little support for any
U.S. military action against Iraq.
	   ``We see no reason to provoke a crisis with Iraq other than to
distract attention from the president's personal problems,'' the
Dubai-based Al-Bayan newspaper said in an editorial.
	   Reflecting the feeling in the Arab world that Washington is
tough on Iraq and soft on Israel, Egypt's Al-Akhbar said that ``the
giant United States has become a lion before Iraq but an ostrich
and a helpless rat before Israel.''
	   ``Can the United States imagine that there is a country, whether
Arab or not, except its subservient Britain, which can say `yes' to
striking Iraq?'' Al-Akhbar, a state-owned newspaper, asked in a
front-page editorial.
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to try and force Baghdad to rescind its Saturday
decision to end cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. The U.N.
Security Council has condemned the Iraqi decision.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.
	   It is not clear, however, whether the United States' Gulf allies
would allow the use of bases on their territory.
	   On Tuesday, a Saudi official said King Fahd told the defense
secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks
on Iraq.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   But the Pentagon said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq.
	   During the standoff between Iraq and the U.N. over weapons
inspectors in February, Kuwait was the only Arab state that opened
its air bases to U.S. and British warplanes.
	   Cohen earlier visited Bahrain and Kuwait.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A crowded bus plunged off a bridge into
a river in eastern India on Thursday, killing at least 47 people, a

 &UR; Swiss report says anti-Semitism revived by Holocaust controversy &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Long-buried prejudice against Jews in
Switzerland surfaced over the last two years as the country's
wartime past came under international scrutiny, Swiss anti-racism
experts said Thursday.
	   ``We were struck by the speed with which the situation
deteriorated last year,'' said Boel Sambuc, deputy head of the
government's Federal Commission against Racism.
	   The problem has not yet fully receded, chairman Georg Kreis
added as the panel released a 72-page report on anti-Semitism in
Switzerland.
	   But the Swiss are at last dealing with anti-Semitism after
ignoring it since the end of World War II, the authors said.
	   The study cautioned that the August settlement in which
Switzerland's two biggest banks agreed to pay Holocaust survivors
dlrs 1.25 billion in compensation for wartime losses ``may arouse
new signs of anti-Semitism in Switzerland.''
	   The accord followed prolonged international pressure, notably
from Jewish groups.
	   An outspoken Swiss Jewish leader, who has complained of the
attacks from abroad, commended the report.
	   ``It's an accurate reflection,'' although the problem is not
exceptionally large in Switzerland, said Thomas Lyssy, vice
president of the Swiss Confederation of Hebrew Congregations.
	   Lyssy said that, despite initial resentment, the settlement in
August helped dampen anti-Semitism.
	   Like its European neighbors, Switzerland has a long tradition of
underlying anti-Semitism, the panel said. However, it found
prejudice against Jews is unorganized and rarely has links to
right-wing extremism.
	   But accusations that Switzerland acted as banker to Nazi Germany
and other criticism of its wartime record caused widespread
resentment.
	   ``Comments by various politicians and a few flame-fanning
newspaper headlines helped to heat up the situation,'' the
commission said.
	   In early 1997 then-President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz drew
accusations of anti-Semitism by labeling as ``blackmail'' Jewish
demands for a dlrs 250 million Holocaust compensation fund.
	   Delamuraz eventually apologized but his comments were supported
by a large number of Swiss, the report said.
	   ``A wave of anti-Semitism'' followed, the report said, citing
letters to newspapers, threats to Jewish figures and groups and
``everyday situations in which Jews were and continue to be
insulted and ostracized.''
	   It noted, however, that Jewish organizations received many
sympathetic letters.
	   Switzerland has a Jewish community of some 19,000 in a
population of 7 million.
	   Its 1995 anti-racism law outlaws the belittling of the
Holocaust. Of some 100 cases have so far made it to court, 55
involved anti-Semitism charges.
	   The report, commissioned last year by the government, estimated
that one-tenth of the population holds anti-Semitic views, but more
could be influenced by propaganda.
	   The commission called on politicians to take a clear position
against anti-Semitism and that schools, workplaces and the army
must also deal with the issue.
	   The government said it would do ``everything in its power'' to
implement the recommendations.

Anwar trial will not derail APEC forum meeting: Downer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with further comment from Downer, aspects
of trade talks; CORRECTS spelling of Komura throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government said
Thursday it was concerned that Japanese intransigence on trade
liberalization in some industries threatened to mar an upcoming
meeting of Pacific leaders in Kuala Lumpur.
	   But the trial of Malaysia's former deputy leader would not
derail the meeting, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said.
	   After meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Masahiko Komura,
Downer said Japan had refused to reduce trade barriers on its
forestry and fisheries industries.
	   Australia is concerned that Japan's stand could prompt other
leaders to seek special exemptions, wrecking the momentum for free
trade at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting
starting next week.
	   Despite pleas during meetings Thursday with Australian Prime
Minister John Howard and Downer, Komura was unwilling to make
concessions on Japan's stance, Downer said.
	   ``There wasn't any sign at this meeting that they are prepared
to make further concessions, but we will continue to argue right up
to and during the APEC meetings for further concessions from Japan
on this issue,'' Downer told reporters.
	   ``The real risk is that you might find some other countries
saying that we've got areas of sensitivity as well and if you're
prepared to make an exception for Japan then why not make an
exception for us in some other area.''
	   Downer said he had pressed Japan to support APEC's stated goals
of achieving free trade between the region's developed countries by
2010, and bringing developing countries under the same umbrella 10
years later.
	   The summit is also threatened by political turmoil in Malaysia
due to the trial of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, on charges of corruption and sexual
misconduct.
	   Downer said he and Komura had discussed the political situation
in Malaysia, but he rejected suggestions the trial could wreck the
summit.
	   ``I don't think it will derail APEC, no,'' Downer said.
	   ``You can't ignore the fact that what is happening in Malaysia
is a significant issue ... which is of great interest to the
Asia-Pacific region as a whole.
	   ``Every government in the region is devoting a bit of time to
seeing how this issue in Malaysia is going to unfold,'' Downer
said.
	   Australia was concerned that Anwar's trial was free and fair,
Downer said.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts.
	   Anwar has denied the charges and says they were fabricated to
eclipse his challenge to Mahathir 17-year rule.
	   Downer said he had not considered meeting Anwar's family while
he is in Kuala Lumpur for the APEC meeting.

China expresses concern over Indonesia riot probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China urged Indonesia Thursday to investigate
charges that the Indonesian military helped incite deadly riots in
May in which dozens of ethnic Chinese women were raped.
	   An Indonesian government-backed panel set up to investigate the
riots found that the military actively encouraged some burning and
looting and that half the 66 women raped and 10 of those assaulted
were ethnic Chinese.
	   The unrest ended Indonesian President Suharto's 32-year rule and
provoked outrage among ethnic Chinese in East Asia. In Beijing,
university students protested outside the Indonesian Embassy and
women's groups demanded that Suharto's successor investigate the
rapes.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said the
government was concerned about the panel's findings.
	   ``The Indonesian government has the responsibility to thoroughly
investigate and handle relevant issues and prevent similar
accidents from happening again,'' Zhu said at a twice-weekly media
briefing.
	   ``As a friendly neighbor, it is China's hope that Indonesia can
maintain social stability and that the people of all ethnic groups
including the Chinese ethnics can enjoy equal rights and live in
harmony,'' Zhu said.
	   China's Communist Party leaders have long fancied themselves
champions of Chinese interests but in recent decades have been wary
of aggravating ethnic tensions in Southeast Asian countries with
large Chinese populations.
	   In Indonesia, Chinese were persecuted as communist sympathizers
in the 1960s and in recent decades resented for their economic
success.

Bank of England cuts interest rates by 0.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Bank of England cut interest rates by 0.5
percent Thursday, the first time the independent bank has cut rates
by more than 0.25 percent.
	   The cut, which brings interest rates down to 6.75 percent,
follows a drop of 0.25 percent last month, and came after business
leaders urged a substantial cut to stave off recession.
	   The bank said the cut was needed to hit its 2.5 percent
inflation target and that news about international economic
conditions had prompted it to moderate its growth forecasts for
next year and downgrade its projection for inflation over the next
two years.
	   The move was welcomed by business leaders and hailed as
``brave'' by analysts.
	   But the cut would not save the economy single-handedly, with the
global financial crisis far from over, said Julian Jessop,
economist at Nikko Europe.
	   Geoffrey Dicks, economist at Greenwich NatWest said that while
he welcomes the break with precedent in the face of international
economic turmoil, rates still need to come down to about 6 percent.

U.S. APEC official insists Japan sign liberal trade pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The U.S. coordinator of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum said Thursday the United
States would push Japan to sign on to a massive trade
liberalization pact it has so far resisted.
	   Twenty Pacific Rim leaders, including President Bill Clinton,
will meet Nov. 17-18 in the Malaysian capital for an APEC summit.
	   High on the agenda will be the Early Voluntary Sector
Liberalization pact, aimed at opening up trade in nine key
industries by next year.
	   Ambassador John Wolf, the U.S. APEC coordinator, said APEC
leaders had to recognize the importance of free trade.
	   ``Now is not the time for protectionism,'' Wolf said from
Washington, taking questions via satellite from reporters in
Malaysia, South Korea, Australia and Indonesia.
	   During a senior ministers meeting in June, Japan stonewalled
against liberalizing fisheries and forestry, the sectors it sees as
most vulnerable to foreign competition.
	   Some other crisis-wracked Asian countries have also expressed
reservations about the pact, which would lift trade barriers and
lower tariffs for some dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of goods and
services in APEC countries.
	   APEC's mission is free trade among the developed member nations
by 2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   U.S. officials have accused Japan of shirking its commitment to
the free-trade pact on environmental products and services, energy,
fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   Wolf said Japan must participate as the world's second largest
economy.
	   ``It's not enough just to give financial assistance to the
region,'' he said. ``It's also important that there be an opening
of Japan's markets.''
	   Last month, Japan announced plans to lend dlrs 30 billion to the
battered economies of East Asia, which it hoped would stimulate
demand in its own economy.
	   ``We think that market opening is an essential part of the kind
of growth message that Asia-Pacific economies need to send in order
to rebuild market confidence,'' Wolf said.
	   Wolf acknowledged that the case of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's
ousted deputy prime minister, who is on trial on charges of
corruption and sexual misconduct, could cast a shadow over the
summit.
	   There was an international outcry when Anwar, popular among
politicians and Western financial experts, showed up at his
arraignment last month with a black eye and bruises.
	   The presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines threatened to
boycott the summit and Clinton has said he won't meet with
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad because of concern over
the handling of the former finance minister's case.
	   Wolf said Anwar's case was an issue for APEC leaders to discuss
privately.
	   He said the trade bloc also would discuss ways to curtail
volatility in the world's financial markets. But he cautioned APEC
doesn't have the same expertise as institutions like the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
	   Rather, the policy decisions of each individual economy in the
region would determine the speed from which they recover from the
crisis.
	   ``I don't think APEC can design a single solution to help all
the countries,'' Wolf said.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join in November.

Youth who killed elderly sisters in speeding Porsche gets four
</HEADLINE>
years &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ A youth who knocked down and killed
two elderly sisters while speeding in the Porsche he had received
for his 18th birthday just days before was sentenced to four years'
detention Thursday.
	   Satvinder Nijjer, now 19, was convicted last month of two counts
of causing death by dangerous driving.
	   In ordering Nijjer confined to the youth facility, Judge John
Warner said he was traveling at ``grossly excessive'' speed when he
knocked down and killed Lavinia and Winifred Carrington, 78 and 76,
during a school lunch break last year.
	   I am sure you were showing your friends just what the car could
do,'' the judge said.
	   Of the Carrington sisters, he said, ``Mercifully, it would
appear they did not know what had happened to them.''
	   The sisters, who were hit from behind when the red convertible
Porsche 944 jumped the curb going 70 mph (112 kph), had been
returning home a lunch celebrating Winifred's 76th birthday.
	   The judge noted a number of mitigating factors in Nijjer's case,
including the ``immaturity and lack of judgment'' that come with
his young age.
	   He added that Nijjer's father, Surinder, who bought him the car,
``had a lot to answer for'' and shared the blame for the tragedy.
	   ``You were provided with a very powerful car by your father
which was well beyond your capabilities,'' Warner said. ``You were
given no tuition.
	   ``He may bear no legal responsibly, but in my view he has a lot
to answer for. If he had thought about this, he would have known
this was an accident waiting to happen.''

Indian troops arrive to join U.N. force in south

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Soldiers from one of India's top
battalions joined U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon Thursday,
replacing Norwegian troops who had served amid war conditions for
20 years.
	   Soldiers from the 2nd Battalion of the 4th Gurkha Rifles arrived
Thursday morning at Beirut International Airport on a chartered
civilian flight from New Delhi.
	   The 135 soldiers, wearing camouflage fatigues and the trademark
U.N. blue berets, paraded on the tarmac as U.N. and Indian flags
fluttered and a Lebanese army band played martial music.
	   Additional soldiers will arrive by Nov. 23 to raise the total
strength of the Indian battalion to 670.
	   ``It's a pleasure for us to come and serve under the United
Nations flag,'' Col. Guru Saday Batabyal said at the airport.
	   As the Indian troops boarded the white U.N. buses and trucks for
the three-hour trip south, troops of the 470-strong Norwegian
battalion were packing and getting ready to leave their outposts in
the eastern sector of the U.N.-controlled zone in the south.
	   Norway announced in June it was withdrawing from the
nine-nation, 4,500-strong U.N. force because of problems recruiting
enough volunteers.
	   The zone to be transferred from the Norwegians to the Indians is
one of the most difficult in the south because it is inside an
enclave that Israel has occupied since 1985 to guard against
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   The troops will have to cross the line between Israeli troops
and Lebanese guerrillas when deploying.
	   The Indian unit is no stranger to difficult situations.
	   The battalion participated in several operations prior to and
during World War I and World War II. It served in India's North
Western Frontier Province, Iraq, Greece and Syria.
	   The battalion served in Punjab during the partition of the
Indian subcontinent, took part in operations in Kashmir and
deployed on the border with Bangladesh during the 1965 and 1971
wars, according to a statement released by the United Nations.
	   In addition to the Indians, the U.N. force comprises troops from
Fiji, Finland, France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal and Poland.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A record number of asylum requests was
made in Switzerland in October as a result of the crisis in
Serbia's Kosovo province, authorities said Thursday.
	   Almost 6,000 people applied for asylum in October, the first
time since 1991 that more than 5,000 requests have been made in one
month, according to the Federal Office for Refugees.
	   Some 69 percent of them were Yugoslav citizens.
	   Switzerland has struggled to cope with a growing flood of
refugees fleeing violence in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   The influx is expected to push the number of asylum seekers to
an all-time high by the end of the year.
	   Some 32,000 asylum applications have been made so far this year,
two-thirds more than at the same point in 1997.
	   Last month, the government authorized the use of the army to
help house and feed the Kosovo refugees.
	   Switzerland is home to a large population of ethnic Albanians
and so has acted as a magnet to refugees from Kosovo.

After many delays, Cabinet meets to debate peace agreement

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After several delays, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Thursday presented the land-for-security agreement
with the Palestinians to his Cabinet for approval and moved a step
closer to carrying out the accord.
	   The Cabinet was expected to narrowly ratify the agreement
despite vocal opposition by several ministers. However, the vote
might only be taken on Friday or even Sunday, after many hours of
debate, said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.
	   In an attempt to appease opponents of the accord, Netanyahu
announced at the meeting that Jewish settlers would be given a say
in deciding from which West Bank areas Israel would withdraw. As
part of the peace accord, Israel has pledged to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank over the next 12 weeks, in exchange for
Pales keeping their
promises, especially a pledge to annul clauses of the PLO founding
charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   ``If there is a violation here, there won't be an agreement,''
said Netanyahu spokesman Aviv Bushinsky.
	   The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of seizing pretexts to
try to get out of the agreement.
	   In the past week, Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet meeting three
times amid claims that the Palestinians had not completed their
anti-terror plan as promised.
	   ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu to stop such painful tactics, to stop
exporting blame to us ... and maybe to start thinking in the
mentality of a partner,'' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   The latest dispute centered on the fate of 30 Palestinians
suspected in the killings of nearly 100 Israelis.
	   Netanyahu demanded that he receive a timetable for the arrest of
the wanted men before convening the Cabinet to ratify the accord.
Bar-Illan said Israel received written assurances from the United
States on the issue late Wednesday, thus paving the way for the
Cabinet meeting.
	   However, Erekat said the Palestinians did not provide new
assurances in the past two days. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Wednesday that 12 of the wanted men were already in detention,
and that he would make an effort to round up the others.
	   A Palestinian police official said Thursday that in all, 14 were
in jail. Several of the suspects have been in Palestinian jails for
months or years, but Palestinian security officials in the past
refused to provide exact figures.
	   The continued acrimony over every detail of the accord
highlighted the need for close U.S. supervision of implementation.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive Thursday in the
region to start watching the two sides, but his trip was moved up
to the weekend. Palestinian officials said they believed Ross did
not want to begin his mission until the Israeli Cabinet approved
the agreement.
	   While the dispute over the wanted men appeared to have been
settled, the next crisis already loomed on the horizon.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials have divergent views of the
procedure to annul clauses in the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destruction. The paragraph in the peace agreement
addressing the issue is vaguely worded, allowing different
interpretations.
	   The agreement says members of the Palestine National Council,
along with those of other Palestinian organizations, will be
invited to a mid-December meeting to affirm an Arafat letter to
U.S. President Bill Clinton about revoking the offending clauses.
	   The PLO charter itself says it can only be amended by a
two-thirds vote of the PNC members, but the agreement does not
refer to holding a vote or a necessary majority. Still, Israel says
the charter must be annulled with a vote by the PNC, not by
affirmation.
	   ``Concerning the PNC, the prime minister made it clear to the
Cabinet ministers that Israel will not tolerate any Palestinian
attempt to avoid the issue,'' Bushinsky told Israel radio.
	   In an attempt to appease hard-liners, Netanyahu announced that a
group of ministers would meet Jewish settlers to discuss the
withdrawal map. ``The committee has received a mandate to make
certain corrections if needed,'' Netanyahu said in a statement. He
said he was responding to a request by the Jewish Settlers'
Council.

Philippines protests Chinese military ships' presence in Spratlys

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine officials summoned China's
ambassador Thursday to protest the presence of Chinese military
ships off a South China Sea reef claimed by both countries.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the ships, equipped with
guns, were renovating Chinese structures on Mischief Reef in the
disputed Spratly Islands. He said the actions were a violation of
an agreement to refrain from hostile activities while territorial
disputes are discussed.
	   ``This is a provocative action on the part of the Chinese,''
Mercado told a news conference. He said the Chinese activity was a
``potential security threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the
Philippines.''
	   He presented photographs taken from Philippine air force
reconnaissance planes of the Chinese ships off the reef, 215 miles
(345 kilometers) from the western Philippine island of Palawan.
	   President Joseph Estrada ordered officials to file a diplomatic
note with China to protest the Chinese actions, his spokesman said.
	   Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Leonides Caday later handed
the note to Chinese Ambassador Guan Dengming, who was summoned to
the Department of Foreign Affairs.
	   After the meeting, Caday said Guan promised to relay the
Philippine position to the Chinese government and issue a reply
later.
	   Guan said the two governments were committed to maintain peace
in the South China Sea and keep good bilateral ties.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, however, said the Chinese
activities would ``create another ripple on our relations with
China,'' and that the Philippines would insist the Chinese
structures be dismantled.
	   The Philippines protested in 1995 when China built concrete
platforms on Mischief Reef, one of several areas in the Spratlys
claimed by both Manila and Beijing.
	   China said the platforms were shelters for fishermen but the
Manila government said they could be used militarily.
	   China's behavior caused suspicion among countries in the region
that it might be trying to gradually seize the Spratlys, which are
believed to lie atop vast deposits of oil, minerals and natural
gas.
	   Siazon said the Philippine ambassador in Beijing, Romualdo Ong,
was notified on Oct. 15 by Chinese officials that they planned to
renovate the platforms on Mischief Reef.
	   Even with such notification, China still violated an agreement
signed in 1995 forbidding such renovations and massive military
presence or movement in contested Spratlys areas, he said.
	   Mercado said the Chinese vessels entered the area Oct. 28 and
included large military cargo and supply ships with helipads to be
used in transporting construction materials to the reef.
	   He said Philippine military planes were carefully monitoring
Chinese activities in the reef but there was no need to send troops
to the area.
	   In 1992, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations issued a
statement advocating a peaceful resolution of the territorial
disputes. China has said it supports the ASEAN resolution.
	   Four members of the regional group, including the Philippines,
have claims in the disputed territories.
	   A visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Manila in 1995
helped ease strains caused by China's structures at Mischief Reef,
but subsequent incidents have strained relations again.
	   The Spratly Islands are also claimed in whole or in part by
Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei.

Repatriation of Bosnian refugees kicks up storm in Cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A push to repatriate 25,000
Bosnian refugees has triggered a rift among the ruling parties in
the Dutch government.
	   Prime Minister Wim Kok's left-leaning Labor Party has rejected
suggestions by other coalition partners to send back Bosnian
refugees, especially those who have been granted permanent asylum
status in the Netherlands.
	   ``They think the refugees should go back, but we're not so
sure,'' Labor Party spokeswoman Susan Baart said Thursday.
	   While all parties agreed that most refugees should go home once
conditions in their hometowns have been deemed stable, they clashed
over refugees with so-called ``A-status,'' who are allowed to stay
in the country permanently as seekers of political asylum.
	   ``For the majority of areas in Bosnia, it is safe to go back,''
said Mieke Libosan, a spokeswoman for the coalition government's
junior partner, the Democrats 66 party.
	   Her party has spearheaded a motion supporting the return of
refugees with A-status, and has the support of the right-of-center
Liberal Party.
	   Kok called the dispute ``unacceptable'' after meeting with
feuding party officials on Wednesday.
	   Deputy Justice Minister Job Cohen, whose ministry oversees the
asylum policy, told Dutch television Thursday that talks aimed at
mending the rift were continuing.
	   Of the 25,000 Bosnian refugees in the Netherlands, about 17,000
have been granted A-status, according to the Justice Ministry.

Israel to develop drone jet capable of carrying missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is planning to develop a pilotless
combat plane that can attack missiles as they are launched, and is
seeking U.S. support for the project, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The director general of the Israeli Defense Ministry, Maj. Gen.
Ilan Biran, on Thursday left for the United States where he will
seek U.S. funding for the drls 2 billion program, the Haaretz daily
said.
	   The advantage of a pilotless combat plane would be its ability
to strike missiles before they enter the territory of the country
under attack.
	   The Arrow anti-missile missile, which was developed with U.S.
funding and is expected to be operational by mid-1999, is unable to
attack missiles soon after they are launched.
	   The Defense Ministry said Biran, his top aides and senior army
officers would meet with officials from the U.S. State Department
and the Pentagon, but refused comment on the Haaretz report.
	   Haaretz said the talks will focus on Israel's long-term defense
needs and possible U.S. funding for such projects as the pilotless
combat plane.
	   Israel is concerned about Iran's successful test in July of the
Shahab 3 missile, which can reach Israel with it's 800-mile
(1,287-kilometer) range. Iran is also developing a Shahab 4 missile
that is to have a range of 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers).
	   Israel is also worried about Scud missile programs in Syria and
Iraq, which fired 39 missiles at Israel in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The United States has funded 75 percent of a four-year, dlrs 40
million project to develop a drone fighter jet that can carry
missiles, Haaretz said.
	   Israel and the United States signed a strategic cooperation pact
last month to protect Israel against ballistic missile attacks.

Bank of England cuts interest rates by 0.5 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mortgage companies following suit and comment
from Confederation of British Industry; no UPPICK

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Bank of England cut interest rates by 0.5
percent Thursday, the first time the independent bank has cut rates
by more than 0.25 percent.
	   The cut, which brings interest rates down to 6.75 percent,
follows a drop of 0.25 percent last month, and came after business
leaders urged a substantial cut to stave off recession.
	   The bank said the cut was needed to hit its 2.5 percent
inflation target and that news about international economic
conditions had prompted it to moderate its growth forecasts for
next year and downgrade its projection for inflation over the next
two years.
	   The move was welcomed by business leaders and hailed as
``brave'' by analysts, while mortgage companies immediately moved
to cut lending rates by the same amount.
	   Kate Barker, chief economic adviser for the Confederation of
British Industry, said that as inflationary pressures eased there
should be scope for further reductions in the coming months.
	   ``Business will welcome this decision as the right response to
our warnings on the increasing risk of a U.K. recession,'' she
said. ``Similar cuts are still likely to be necessary in the months
ahead if we are to head off the dangers of recession next year.''
	   Shares jumped on the news, only to fall back later as dealers
digested the bank's comments and concluded that further cuts were
now unlikely.
	   But the cut would not save the economy single-handedly, with the
global financial crisis far from over, said Julian Jessop,
economist at Nikko Europe.
	   Geoffrey Dicks, economist at Greenwich NatWest said that while
he welcomes the break with precedent in the face of international
economic turmoil, rates still need to come down to about 6 percent.

Tourists back at palace near Naples day after fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CASERTA, Italy (AP) _ School groups and tourists were back
Thursday in ``the Versailles of Italy'' a day after a blaze broke
out in the attic of sumptuous Reggia palace.
	   The 18-century palace, once the jewel of the Kingdom of Naples
and set in a sprawling garden 30 kilometers (20 miles) from that
city, is one of Italy's most prized monuments.
	   RAI state TV reported that the fire, which broke out Wednesday
night after the complex was closed to the public, apparently was
caused by a short circuit in a part of the palace under
restauration.
	   The flames reportedly burned some timber beams under the attic
roof, but no extensive damage was reported. Authorities said no art
works were harmed.
	   The fire drew attention to the fact that air force officers are
housed in a wing of the palace, raising objections from some that
that was an improper use of the 1,200-room complex, which was added
last year to UNESCO list of World Heritage sites deserving of
special protection.
	   However, military officials were quick to say there was no link
between the lodging and the fire and insisted that they help with
palace upkeep.

U.S. envoy returns to Zambia in bid to end Congolese conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ A top U.S. envoy, in an abrupt change of
plans, Thursday returned to Zambia in a continuing bid to end a
three-month war in Congo that has embroiled troops from at least
eight countries.
	   Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Susan Rice has acknowledged
that she had achieved little so far on her seven-nation tour to
persuade outsiders to withdraw from Congo.
	   ``We are encouraged by the recognition of all those with whom we
talked that there can be no viable military solution, and by the
expressed desire for peace,'' Rice said before leaving Entebbe for
Lusaka.
	   ``However, we remain concerned about the continued buildup of
military forces, which underscores the importance of moving forward
to find a peaceful solution.''
	   Zambia has sent 6,000 troops and an air force to prop up
Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Angola and Namibia also sent
troops and tanks to help stop rebel advances.
	   Despite denials from the Ugandan and Rwandan governments, their
troops repeatedly have been seen fighting on the rebels' side.
	   U.S. diplomats said Rice, who already has visited South Africa,
Angola, Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda, had a hard time
convincing the countries supporting Kabila that the United States
was impartial in the conflict.
	   Rice said she delayed plans to return to Washington to travel to
Lusaka to share her findings with Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba.
	   On the last scheduled stop of her tour, Rice met with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni in Entebbe for two hours Wednesday night.
	   In a statement issued Thursday, Museveni said he told Rice the
conflict ``can and will be resolved,'' and that a cease-fire was
possible.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Rice met with Congolese rebels and Rwandan
officials.
	   ``We had a frank exchange of views,'' said Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition. ``The
Americans listened to our concerns, and we hope the contacts will
continue.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ If the United States and Russia agree on a food
aid package, the first shipments could start arriving next month, a
Russian official said Thursday.
	   Russian and American officials could conclude a second round of
talks Thursday on details of the deal, said Leonid Cheshinsky,
president of the Roskhlebprodukt bakery company. He has been taking
part in the negotiations, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The United States plans to provide Russia with 3.1 million tons
of food, valued around dlrs 500 million, the White House has said.
	   About 1.6 million metric tons is being provided for free. The
rest is being sold to Russia under a 20-year loan.
	   Russia has been hit hard by economic problems coupled with the
worst grain harvest in 40 years. Food prices have risen 50 percent
due to the financial crisis, prompting worries that the poor won't
be able to afford food.
	   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has said the aid package
will include 100,000 tons of unspecified commodities, to be
distributed through non-governmental and private voluntary
organizations to some of the most vulnerable Russian citizens,
especially the elderly and poor.
	   The other 3 million metric tons comprise 1.5 million tons of
wheat donated by the U.S. government and 1.5 million tons bought by
the Russians with a U.S. loan.
	   The first shipment is expected to arrive in December, Cheshinsky
of Roskhlebprodukt said, according Interfax.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday that U.S.
negotiators were working with the Russians to make sure the food
isn't diverted into the black market, and makes it to the people
who actually need the food.
	   The U.S. is also working with Russia to make sure the food is
exempted from both taxes and customs duties.
	   This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The United States provided
food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   In other economic news Thursday, Russia's Central Bank announced
that its gold and foreign-currency reserves rose by dlrs 300
million in the last week of October, reaching dlrs 13.6 billion on
Oct. 30.
	   Also, the tax service said it would like to crack down on tax
evasion by banning tobacco and alcohol sales at private kiosks and
wholesale markets, Boos said.
	   In the past, the government has tried to ban alcohol sales at
street kiosks. But enterprising kiosk owners responded by adding
small sales rooms, allowing them to pass for reals stores, and thus
continue selling alcohol.

Czech government not surprised by negative EU report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel urged the
government on Thursday to speed up integration attempts into the
European Union, following EU criticism of Czech slowness in
revamping legislation to conform to West European standards.
	   The report on progress of candidate nations in adapting EU
standards singled out the Czechs for their ``worrying slowdown.''
The Czech Republic, along with Hungary and Poland, are front
runners among the former Soviet bloc countries hoping for
membership.
	   The report said that the Czech Republic, along with Estonia,
Hungary, Poland and Slovenia ``are functioning market economies
that should be able to cope with competitive pressures and market
forces within the union in the medium term.'' But it noted that the
Czech Republic's speed in enacting necessary legislation is not
satisfactory.
	   ``I expected such a critical report,'' President Vaclav Havel
said, adding he asked the government to ``speed up steps that will
lead to the fulfillment of EU's conditions.''
	   Former Premier Vaclav Klaus, the architect of Czech economic
reform, suggested the report was biased, telling the daily Lidove
Noviny: ``In some countries, there is a strong campaign against the
enlargement of the EU.''
	   The Czech Republic is among six countries that are expected to
join the EU in five or six years.
	   Preliminary talks with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus began this year and the EU also opened
``preparatory'' talks with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   The second group are nations facing a tougher job in improving
their economies before serious membership talks can begin.

Bounty on rats offered as deaths from disease reach nine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Authorities offered a bounty on rats
Thursday to stem an outbreak of a rare disease spread by rat urine
that has killed at least nine people and put 100 in the hospital.
	   The epidemic of leptospirosis, which can cause kidney or liver
complications and in extreme cases kill victims in as little as
three days after infection, so far has been confined to the
northern province of Phrae.
	   But provincial officials fear it could spread and have offered a
one-baht (2.5-cent) bounty for each rat killed. Hunters had turned
in some 5,000 rat tails by late Thursday to provincial health
authorities, the Independent Television News station reported.
	   Authorities were offering free traps, poison and other
rat-extermination gear to help curb the rodents.
	   ``We're encouraging people to catch these rats,'' said Puchong
Veerakanin, director of the Phrae provincial health office.
``People from other districts should also be on the watch for this
disease.''
	   Local people have been warned to be careful in preparing food
and drink that could be contaminated by rat urine. But the disease
can also spread through open cuts and wounds and by rubbing the
eyes.
	   The rice and sugar fields around Thailand swarm with rodents,
and workers could catch the disease through contact with crops
where rats have urinated.
	   The newspaper Bangkok Post cited Puchong as saying he was
unaware of any vaccine that can counter the disease.
	   The bacteria are present in the organs of rats, frogs, rabbits
and snakes. Patients normally develop high fever, severe headache,
muscle pains and sometimes enlarged livers.
	   The disease is often mistaken for flu.

Ukraine's parliament attacks government for failure to support
</HEADLINE>
agriculture &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament lashed out at the
government for failing to support the country's agrarian sector and
urged President Leonid Kuchma to punish those responsible, a news
report said Thursday.
	   In a non-binding resolution Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada asked
Kuchma to ``take measures'' against unspecified officials who have
failed to carry out a Cabinet resolution to stabilize the situation
in agriculture, the independent UNIAN news agency said.
	   ``The Cabinet is incapable of resolving agricultural
questions,'' charged Socialist Oleksandr Moroz, former parliament
speaker and now chairman of its agrarian policy committee.
	   The document was adopted last month after Agriculture Minister
Borys Supikhanov complained that inadequate state financing and a
lack of fuel were hampering farming operations.
	   Since the Cabinet resolution, agricultural producers were to
receive 315 million hryvna (dlrs 92.6 million) in state subsidies,
but only 116.3 million hryvna (dlrs 34.2 million) actually were
transferred, he said.
	   Supikhanov also noted that the government has only provided
102,000 metric tons of oil from the planned 200,000 tons needed to
produce fuel for agrarian industry needs.
	   Moroz, meanwhile, charged that ``only half of the amount (of
fuel) was actually delivered to the villages, and nine regions were
left without fuel at all,'' according to UNIAN.
	   Parliament also asked Kuchma to create a new post of deputy
prime minister in charge of agriculture.

	   --
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe fired the two
top officials in the state security agency after allegations that
rivalry between them jeopardized intelligence gathering, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   The independent Financial Gazette said Central Intelligence
Organization director-general Shadreck Chipanga and his deputy
Lovemore Mukandi were replaced earlier this week by two senior army
officers.
	   Quoting unidentified security agents, the paper said the spy
chiefs ``failed to work together'' and accused each other of
corruption after about 30 million Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 820,000)
meant to acquire new facilities, including ``safe houses,''
disappeared.
	   It was the first time military officers were brought in to
command the intelligence agency, a move indicating Mugabe, facing
growing criticism over economic hardships at home and his
deployment of 6,000 troops in the Congo, was demanding
military-style discipline and loyalty in the agency.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ High-level corruption and an outdated
education system mean more than 500,000 Kenyans who join the
workforce each year are unable to find jobs, an analyst said
Thursday.
	   ``Corruption is a hidden `tax' that increases the cost of doing
business, makes us less competitive, gives us bad public relations
and discourages investment, both local and international,'' Jane
Ng'ethe said at a forum on job creation organized by the Institute
of Economic Affairs.
	   Kenya's education system need to be reviewed so that it is
oriented to future employment needs, she said.
	   A World Bank official said Kenyans should not assume foreign
investors are in their country to create jobs for them.
	   ``They are here to make money for the shareholders,'' said Anand
Rajaram, the World Bank's chief economist based in Kenya.
	   Kenya's gross domestic product would need to grow at 23 percent
from 1991 to 2000 in order to absorb all new entrants in the job
market, according to a 1993 World Bank study.
	   Instead it is declining.
	   Gross domestic product grew by 1.5 percent in 12 months to June
compared to 2.3 percent in 1997, the Central Bank said Wednesday.
	   --
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia are
unlikely to meet face-to-face this weekend in the latest attempt to
end their border war, a mediator said.
	   Several hundred people have been killed in the dispute, which
has simmered for six months.
	   Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the Organization of
Africa Unity, said Wednesday before leaving for Burkina Faso that
OAU leaders will meet separately with the two sides.
	   Three African presidents _ OAU Chairman Blaise Compaore of
Burkina Faso, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Hassan Ghouled Aptidon
of Djibouti _ were mandated by the OAU in June to find a peaceful
solution.
	   They were expected to finalize their peace plan on Saturday,
then present it Sunday in separate meetings to Ethiopia's President
Negasso Ghidada and his Eritrean counterpart, President Isaias
Afwerki, Salim said.
	   Previous efforts to broker peace by the OAU, Rwanda and the
United States have failed.
	   --
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The countries bordering Sierra Leone
should not support armed insurgents fighting that country's
government, a visiting U.S. official has warned.
	   ``It appears that the insurgents who are carrying out horrible
killings against civilians in Sierra Leone are better armed and
better trained than they have been in the past,'' Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for Africa Vicki Huddleston told reporters
Tuesday in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.
	   Without mentioning any nation in particular, Huddleston called
for neighboring countries to ensure that their citizens are not
crossing the border to fight in Sierra Leone and that weapons are
not being smuggled to the rebels there.
	   The government of Sierra Leone has accused neighboring Liberia
of supporting their opponents, a charge Liberia denies.
	   A Nigerian-led intervention force ousted the military junta in
Sierra Leone earlier this year, restoring the elected government.
Fighting continues, however, in parts of Sierra Leone, with ousted
junta soldiers and their rebel allies killing, maiming and
torturing civilians.
	   --
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Austria has cancelled dlrs 11.6
million dollars of debt owed by Mozambique.
	   A news release from the Bank of Mozambican says the agreement,
which was signed a week ago, covers debt payments which should have
begun in 1999.
	   The cancellation is in response to the appeals that the
Mozambican government has made to the international community to
alleviate the burden of foreign debt so that the resources freed up
may be used to strengthen economic and social development.

Thai central bank intervenes by buying dollars, dealers say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With the Thai currency strengthening,
Thailand's central bank bought dollars heavily Thursday in a move
that should increase foreign reserves, dealers said.
	   The U.S. currency fell through resistance at 36.50 baht, closing
at 36.40.
	   The Bank of Thailand has said it will not intervene against
market trends but will step in to moderate any excessive movements
in exchange rates. The bank is also accumulating dollars to boost
reserves and pay off forward obligations in foreign exchange
markets.
	   Duangmanee Vongpradhip, director of the central bank governor's
office, said the bank did not comment on its day-to-day involvement
in foreign exchange markets.
	   ``It's a general policy that there is no intervention,''
Duangmanee said. ``We just try to smooth out the fluctuations.''
	   One dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said market
patterns appeared to indicate central bank buying, but noted that
there was wide buying support from U.S. banks and other
institutions whenever the dollar dipped below 36.40 baht
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said earlier that
foreign reserves had risen to dlrs 28.4 billion as of Wednesday
from dlrs 28.2 billion Oct. 22.
	   The central bank's net forward obligations in foreign exchange
markets fell to dlrs 8.4 billion from dlrs 8.9 billion over the
same period, Tarrin said.
	   Tarrin told reporters that the baht's recent strength was not
out of line with the rest of the region and should not affect
competitiveness of exports.
	   The baht's strength is attributed to a current account surplus,
foreign direct investment and sales of Thai assets, and the
government's efforts to push through a restructuring of financial
institutions and non-performing loans.
	   At current exchange rates, the baht has lost 29 percent of its
value against the dollar since Thailand abandoned a fixed exchange
rate system July 2, 1997.
	   But it has recovered 35 percent of its value since hitting an
all-time low of 56.40 to the dollar in January.

<TEXT>
	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ A top U.S. envoy, in an abrupt change of
plans, Thursday returned to Zambia in a continuing bid to end a
three-month war in Congo that has embroiled troops from at least
eight countries.
	   Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Susan Rice has acknowledged
that she had achieved little so far on her seven-nation tour to
persuade outsiders to withdraw from Congo.
	   ``We are encouraged by the recognition of all those with whom we
talked that there can be no viable military solution, and by the
expressed desire for peace,'' Rice said before leaving Entebbe for
Lusaka.
	   ``However, we remain concerned about the continued buildup of
military forces, which underscores the importance of moving forward
to find a peaceful solution.''
	   Zimbabwe has sent 6,000 troops and an air force to prop up
Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Angola and Namibia also sent
troops and tanks to help stop rebel advances.

France denies its officer compromised NATO plans in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Defense Minister Alain Richard denied Thursday that
a French officer accused of giving intelligence on planned NATO
strikes to a Serbian secret agent compromised the alliance's
mission.
	   ``It's a hard blow,'' Richard told a news conference. However,
he added that the officer had only had access to preparatory
documents and that NATO action ``had not been compromised.''
	   Pierre Bunel, a 46-year-old army major, was arrested last week
for allegedly supplying ``intelligence to a foreign power.'' He
faces up to 15 years in prison.
	   Richard insisted Bunel never saw actual strike plans.
	   NATO had planned the air strikes in order to pressure Yugoslav
leader Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, a
province in Yugoslavia that is seeking independence.
	   Bunel is accused of supplying documents on planned NATO air
strikes to a Serb intelligence officer operating under diplomatic
cover during the October standoff over Kosovo.
	   Richard refused to say how the leak had been uncovered, nor
would he reveal whether France intended to review its rules for
contacts between the French military and Serb officials.
	   He did say France had been in contact with top NATO officials
over the case.
	   ``We have been extremely clear with the responsible heads of the
alliances and have assessed the effects,'' of the leak, Richard
said. He stressed that Bunel's action had not jeopardized NATO's
plans.
	   Speaking on French television Wednesday, Richard said Bunel's
act constitute treason.
	   The officer's arrest comes at a bad time for France, which is
set to take on a leading role in the international military force
that has been assigned to protect the 2,000 civilian verifiers of
an agreement for Serbia to withdraw its forces
	   Speaking at the same news conference, Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said the case had not raised any doubts among France's
credibility.
	   France has been embarrassed by the Bunel affair, the second time
this year that the loyalty of one of its officers dealing with the
Balkans has been called into question by NATO.
	   France long has been considered sympathetic to the Serbs. France
and Britain helped set up an independent Yugoslavia after the
Ottoman Empire collapsed at the end of World War I.
	   Earlier this year, France recalled Maj. Herve Gourmelon from
Bosnia following reports his contacts with Radovan Karadzic led
NATO to abort a mission to arrest the Bosnian Serb leader.
	   Richard said a security breach could have happened to any
country and insisted politics did not affect French military
operations.

Turkey praises EU decision on candidacy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's foreign minister on Thursday said
the European Union's definition of Turkey as a candidate for
membership will pave the way to improved relations between Brussels
and Ankara.
	   ``Although wrong assessments by the European Union persist, with
the definition of Turkey by the European Commission as one of the
12 candidate countries, the road toward developing our relations
has opened,'' Minister Ismail Cem said in a statement.
	   After the decision in December to exclude Turkey from the first
wave of enlargement talks, Turkey put its relations with the
15-member union on hold. Since then, the EU has been trying to
patch up the relationship, with several leaders of member countries
insisting that Turkey's place is in the union.
	   The European Commission released Thursday its first set of
regular reports assessing the progress towards EU membership of 12
candidate countries, including 10 central and eastern European
countries and Cyprus and Turkey.
	   The EU ambassador to Turkey, Karen Fogg, insisted that the
report ``did not signal a new status of Turkey, but the
confirmation that Turkey is a candidate country.''
	   In any case, the report indicated Turkish membership would not
come soon.
	   ``The persistent violations of human rights and important
deficiencies in the treatment of minorities are causes of
concern,'' the report on Turkey stated.
	   Turkish authorities are frequently accused of systematically
violating human rights, especially in the southeast where Kurdish
rebels have been fighting for autonomy since 1984.
	   The Commission also criticized the lack of civilian control over
the military, which plays a central role in the country's political
life.
	   The report praised Turkey's economic policy but said it still
had a long way to go in the adoption of EU legal and administrative
standards.

Philippine president says economy recovering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Estrada said
Thursday the stable peso and bullish stock market show the
country's economy is on its way to recovery after being battered by
Asia's financial crisis.
	   ``This is a good sign that there is no stopping our economic
recovery,'' Estrada said. ``I'm really happy about that.''
	   But he added: ``At the same time we should not be complacent. We
should work harder in order to achieve our goals.''
	   The peso averaged 39.573 pesos per dollar Thursday. The
Philippine currency has gained 11 percent since Oct. 1, when it
began getting strong support from investment inflows for the stock
market and remittances from Filipinos working overseas.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange Index has risen steadily in recent
weeks and has gained 15 percent in the past 10 trading sessions.
	   Business tycoon Jose Concepcion III, president of RFM Food
Corp., one of the biggest Philippine food and beverage companies,
also was upbeat Thursday about the economy.
	   ``Interest rates are going down, the peso is appreciating,
investor climate in Asia is improving, and in the Philippines,
investors are coming back,'' he said. ``In my view the downturn is
over and all the countries in the region, especially the
Philippines, are on their way up.''
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the improvement in the
economy ``is really a restoration of confidence, and you can see it
by the way things are happening in the stock market, in the
currency.''
	   The Philippines has not been as badly affected by the currency
crisis as many of its Asian neighbors. But economic growth has
slowed, inflation has risen and interest rates are still higher
than they were before the crisis started in July 1997.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ If the United States and Russia agree on a food
aid package, the first shipments could start arriving next month, a
Russian official said Thursday.
	   Russian and American officials could wrap up a second round of
talks Thursday on details of the deal, said Leonid Cheshinsky,
president of the Roskhlebprodukt bakery company. He has been taking
part in the negotiations, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The United States plans to provide Russia with 3.1 million
metric tons of food, valued at around dlrs 500 million, the White
House has said.
	   About 1.6 million metric tons would be provided for free. The
rest would be sold to Russia under a 20-year loan.
	   Russia has been hit hard by economic problems coupled with the
worst grain harvest in 40 years. Food prices have risen about 50
percent due to the country's financial crisis, prompting worries
that the poor won't be able to afford food.
	   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has said the aid package
will include 100,000 tons of unspecified commodities, to be
distributed through non-governmental and private organizations to
some of the most vulnerable Russian citizens, especially the
elderly and poor.
	   The remaining 3 million metric tons would be made up of 1.5
million tons of wheat donated by the U.S. government and 1.5
million tons bought by the Russians with a U.S. loan.
	   The first shipment is expected to arrive in December, Cheshinsky
of Roskhlebprodukt said, according to Interfax.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday that U.S.
negotiators were working with the Russians to make sure the food
isn't diverted into the black market.
	   The United States is also working with Russia to make sure the
food is exempted from both taxes and import duties.
	   This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The United States provided
food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   In other economic news Thursday, Russia's Central Bank announced
that its gold and foreign-currency reserves rose by dlrs 300
million in the last week of October, reaching dlrs 13.6 billion on
Oct. 30.
	   Also, the tax service said it would like to crack down on tax
evasion by banning tobacco and alcohol sales at private kiosks and
wholesale markets, tax chief Georgy Boos said.
	   In the past, the government has tried to ban alcohol sales at
street kiosks. But kiosk owners responded by adding small sales
rooms, allowing them to pass for real stores, and thus continue
selling alcohol.

Thailand to reward medal winners with cash at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government will award 1
million baht (dlrs 28,000) to each Thai gold medal winner at the
Asian Games next month, officials said Thursday.
	   Jurin Laksanavisith, a minister from Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai's office, said that silver medals would be rewarded with
300,000 baht (dlrs 8,000) and bronze 200,000 baht (dlrs 5,600).
	   The same prizes apply to individuals competing in team sports. A
budget of about 50 million baht (dlrs 1.3 million) has been set
aside for the rewards.
	   Thailand is expected to win about 25 gold medals from a number
of sports, including boxing, gymnastics, swimming, weightlifting
and wind surfing, the organizing committee said in a statement.
	   The games are expected to attract more than 8,000 athletes from
43 countries. The Dec. 6-20 competition is the continent's top
sporting event.

FA-18 fighter crash caused by human error, Swiss say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Investigators have concluded human
error caused the crash of an F-18 fighter jet last April in which
two pilots died, the Swiss defense ministry said Thursday.
	   Examination of the flight data recorder and the shattered
wreckage of the aircraft has allowed a technical fault to be ruled
out as the cause of the crash of the American-made jet.
	   The plane plunged into a mountainside near the ski resort of
Crans Montana in foggy conditions.
	   The accident happened when the jet, made by the U.S.-based
McDonnell Douglas company, was on a training mission.
	   The pilot is thought to have lost his bearings during a maneuver
which followed a simulated missile firing, the defense ministry
said.
	   The plane was delivered to Switzerland in January 1997 as part
of a consignment of 34 fighter jets from the United States. Twenty
planes still have to be delivered.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Bank of England cut interest rates by 0.5
percent Thursday, the first time the independent bank has cut rates
by more than 0.25 percent.
	   The cut, which brings the rate at which the bank lends to other
banks down to 6.75 percent, follows a drop of 0.25 percent last
month, and came after business leaders urged a substantial cut to
stave off recession.
	   The bank said the cut in the so-called repo rate was needed to
hit its 2.5 percent inflation target and that news about
international economic conditions had prompted it to moderate its
growth forecasts for next year and downgrade its projection for
inflation over the next two years.

Russian government to consider granting asylum to Kurdish rebel
</HEADLINE>
leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Foreign Ministry said Thursday the
government would consider parliament's request to offer political
asylum to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in
Turkey on charges of heading a terrorist organization.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Russian
officials don't know Ocalan's whereabouts. Turkey says he recently
left Syria for Russia.
	   Rakhmanin also reiterated that the Kurdish problem should be
solved on assumption of territorial integrity of Turkey, but called
on Ankara to avoid use of force and respect the rights of Kurds.
	   ``A solution can only be found only through political
settlement,'' he said at a briefing.
	   Turkey officially asked Russia last week to extradite Ocalan,
who leads the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984. The
conflict has killed an estimated 37,000 people.
	   Russian parliament's lower house, the State Duma, on Wednesday
passed an appeal to President Boris Yeltsin to grant asylum to
Ocalan.
	   Turkey's Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday told reporters
that Moscow had promised to extradite the rebel leader. He claimed
that Turkey had received a written statement from the Russian
government, stating that ``Russia would not allow this murderer to
find refuge in the country.''

Violence continues as Serbian president arrives in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tension smoldered northwest of
Pristina Thursday, following reports of a shootout between Serb
forces and ethnic Albanian militants. But the U.S. envoy for Kosovo
said prospects for peace _ though distant _ were promising.
	   The village of Priluzje, 20 kilometers (13 miles) northwest of
the provincial capital Pristina, came under small-arms fire for
several hours during the night but no one was injured, the Serb
Media Center reported.
	   The center, which carries official Serb viewpoints, said several
houses were damaged in the ensuing shootout, and blamed the attack
on ethnic Albanian extremists fighting for independence.
	   Although the report could not be independently confirmed, there
have been frequent reports of violence and gunfire exchanges
despite last month's U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
	   Tension on a different front was generated by a dispute between
Yugoslav authorities and the U.N. war crimes tribunal. Chief Judge
Gabrielle Kirk McDonald and other tribunal members canceled a
planned visit to Belgrade for an international war crimes
conference, complaining that the Yugoslav government had refused to
issue tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbor with a visa that would
enable her to visit Kosovo.
	   Arbour had planned to gather evidence on suspected atrocities
committed during the nearly eight-month crackdown on the armed
Albanian independence struggle in Kosovo that killed hundreds,
mostly ethnic Albanian civilians, and made refugees of hundreds of
thousands.
	   The tribunal argues that it has been authorized by the U.N.
Security Council to investigate war crimes in all of Yugoslavia,
which includes Kosovo, an Albanian-majority province of Serbia,
Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
	   Milutinovic arrived in Pristina on Thursday and began talks with
local Serb officials. Further details weren't immediately
available.
	   Serb police in Kosovo raised security measures around a coal
mine and power plant outside Pristina following an attack Tuesday
in which three Serb coal mine workers were injured, the independent
Beta news agency reported.
	   Despite occasional skirmishes, NATO said Wednesday that a
cease-fire in Kosovo seems to be holding in the wake of an Oct. 12
agreement committing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to scale
back police and army forces in the province.
	   And the U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said there was
``serious progress'' toward a permanent solution, although that
goal remained far away.
	   Hill, U.S. ambassador in Macedonia, spoke in Belgrade only hours
before a meeting with Milosevic.
	   ``We have made some serious progress, not only in reducing
violence ... but also in coming around to a political solution that
would meet basic interests of the two sides.''
	   He said the aim of the U.S.-drafted agreement on Kosovo is to
``push responsibility downwards to lower levels'' of authority, and
thus introduce democracy and protection of human rights in the
Serbian province.
	   ``We are very much on the road and moving ahead,'' he told
reporters. ``Both sides understand that the status quo is
unacceptable and that we have to move on.''
	   Albanians make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
population and suffered the most during the fighting. As many as
300,000 ethnic Albanian civilians were driven from their homes by
Serb police and army forces.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency said Thursday roughly
150,000 displaced people remain in Kosovo but only a couple of
hundred are still living in the open.

Congolese rebels hope for peace talks with Kabila
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Despite President Laurent Kabila's refusal
to negotiate, the Congolese rebel leader on Thursday said growing
international pressure will bring peace to his country sooner or
later.
	   A day after meeting Susan Rice, U.S. assistant secretary of
state and peace envoy, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition, said African leaders were moving
toward getting Kabila and the rebels to negotiate directly.
	   ``There are major attempts at peace which are increasingly
coordinated,'' Wamba told The Associated Press from the eastern
rebel stronghold at Goma.
	   ``There are still differences in whether this rebellion is
internal or external, but there seems to be consensus that talks
must take place. The easiest thing is to persuade Kabila to come to
negotiations.''
	   On Thursday, Rice unexpectedly returned to the Zambian capital,
Lusaka, for consultations with President Frederick Chiluba who is
spearheading southern African efforts to broker peace in Congo.
	   On Friday, Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, Rwandan vice president, and
chief architect of Rwandan policy in Congo, will meet with South
African President Nelson Mandela.
	   Rwanda officially denies support for the rebels but says it has
legitimate security concerns in eastern Congo, where it accuses
Kabila of anti-Tutsi persecution and failing to rid the common
border of Rwandan rebels.
	   ``If Rice is going to add an impetus to regional efforts, the
better. But even if they don't do anything, their presence will
help,'' Wamba said. He said apart from an exchange of views during
a meeting with Rice in Kigali on Wednesday, no concrete proposals
were made.
	   Wamba said Mandela, Chiluba and former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere were trying to organize negotiations involving
Kabila, the rebels and other Congolese opposition groups.
	   Kabila's allies in Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia want the
withrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops from Congo before any
direct negotiations commence, Wamba said.
	   On the ground, Wamba said his forces had repelled successive
government attacks on Kabalo in southern Katanga Province and Buta
in northern Congo, apparently the first signs of a
counter-offensive promised by Kabila and his allies.
	   Wamba said the rebels' main concern was the presence of 7,000
former Rwandan Hutu soldiers and militiamen in Mbuji-Mayi, capital
of diamond-rich Eastern Kasai, where he feared they may engage in
ethnic persecution of tribes considered disloyal to Kabila.
	   The Hutu fighters fled reprisals for the genocide of more than
500,000 Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994.

Philippines to send 276 athletes to Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines will send at least
276 athletes, one of its biggest sporting contingents in recent
years, to next month's Asian Games in Bangkok, officials announced
Thursday.
	   Pocholo Veguillas, head of the delegation, expressed optimism
that the large delegation will improve on the performance of the
147-member Philippine team at the Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan,
in 1994.
	   The Philippines' shooting team has the largest number of
participants, with 27 members, followed by the men's and women's
basketball squads with a total of 24 players.
	   There are about seven athletes for boxing, the Philippines' most
popular sport after basketball. In the Hiroshima games, the
Philippines' three gold medals all came from boxing.
	   Because of the Asian economic crisis, the Philippines has had
difficulty assembling a large, well-trained contingent for the
games.
	   But the country, long a hotbed for basketball in Asia, hopes to
challenge the region's current lords of that sport by sending its
best prepared, all professional team to the Bangkok games.
	   The 13-man Philippine team is in the United States for a 22-day
training regimen against American collegiate teams to simulate
tough competition expected from defending champion China and
perennial challenger South Korea.
	   The U.S. trip will allow the team to develop plays against
heftier and taller teams, like those it will meet in the Asian
Games.
	   Tim Cone, the team's Philippine-based American coach, said that
aside from China and South Korea, the Philippines is also closely
watching teams from Japan, Kazakstan, Kyrgyztan and Saudi Arabia.
	   But Cone admits that China remains the Philippines' biggest
headache.
	   ``We've got to overachieve to beat China,'' he told reporters in
Manila before leaving on the U.S. trip.
	   The Philippines was Asia's basketball king before it launched
its own professional league in 1975. Since then, it has been
sending top amateurs to foreign competitions. That approach proved
adequate in Southeast Asia but not against the rest of Asia, which
has developed tremendously.
	   Filipinos had to watch helplessly as the best Philippine
players, after playing a few years with the Philippine team, jumped
to the country's professional Philippine Basketball Association,
which pays salaries higher even than those of top local business
executives.
	   When the Olympics allowed American professional players to play
in 1992, the door opened for Filipinos to regain their reputation
as a basketball power in Asia.
	   As a quick fix, it sent a professional team to the Hiroshima
Asian Games, hoping for an immediate win. But it lost the bronze in
a defeat by Japan.
	   Officials then realized that a professional Philippine team was
not enough against teams that have played together for a long time.
They formed a new team in February, which has been training as a
unit since then.
	   The PBA, which is bankrolling the Philippines' participation in
the games, has had to suffer dwindling receipts at the gate as its
stellar players were lent to the Asian game team.
	   Cone, who is also coach of the top Philippine professional team,
Alaska, had to give up a chance to win a third straight league
victory.

Former slave laborers plan to fight German government-industry
</HEADLINE>
fund &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Former World War II slave laborers
said on Thursday they would fight a plan by Germany's government
and industry to set up a compensation fund, saying the proposed
settlement was an attempt to bypass their claims.
	   ``The survivors are ready to work toward a solution _ but they
will not be shut out and the German government cannot stop their
claims,'' the group said in a statement faxed from their lawyer's
office in the United States.
	   Before taking office last month, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
government said a group comprising government and industry will
work out a plan to settle back-wage claims from World War II-era
slave laborers.
	   Among those participating in the group are the bosses of Allianz
insurance company, Dresdner and Deutsche banks, Volkswagen, BMW,
Siemens, Krupp, Degussa and BASF. It will be headed by Schroeder's
chief of staff, Bodo Hombach.
	   The plan is an attempt to ``bargain away our claims,'' survivor
Paul Frenkel said in the statement.
	   An alternative group comprising class action claimants, slave
labor survivors, the Jewish Claims Conference, German industry and
banks and the German government should meet and agree on a
settlement, group lawyer Michael Witti said in the statement.
	   The survivors called on the German government to recognize their
right to settle their claims individually or on a class action
basis, pointing to the recent 1.25 billion dollar settlement
reached with Swiss banks.
	   New York-based lawyer Ed Fagan and Munich-based Witti will
accompany representatives of the group on a two-day trip to
Frankfurt Friday and Saturday, where they will press their claims.

EU Commissioners defend tax free perks - for themselves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission _ the 20-member
panel that goes to bat daily for a borderless European Union _ said
Thursday it won't forego tax-free perks for itself even though
duty-free sales will end in 1999 for most ordinary citizens.
	   European commissioners have generous allowances of tax-free
purchases of tobacco, wine, spirits and car fuel each year because
they have diplomatic status.
	   EU transport workers unions are complaining because the
commission is abolishing tax-free shopping for travelers within the
15-nation EU, yet its members will continue to enjoy benefits they
deny other Europeans.
	   All 20 commissioners _ minus Belgian's Karel van Miert because
he's on home territory _ have the right to buy 60 liters of
spirits, 400 liters of wine, 20,000 cigarettes and 4,000 liters of
car fuel tax free each year.
	   ``We must keep things in proportion,'' EU spokeswoman Betty
Olivi told reporters Thursday. ``European Commissioners enjoy the
same benefits as other diplomats in Belgium.''
	   The issue has renewed a debate in Britain about the perceived
aloofness of the European Commission from the average European.
	   John Cryer, a Labor member of parliament, said the tax-free
perks enjoyed by the EU executive were ``another example of, and
reason why, everyone calls the European Commission the biggest
gravy train in the world.''
	   Olivi said that although European commissioners _ who earn a
minimum of dlrs 200,000 a year tax free _ are entitled to duty free
benefits, not all make use of these.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan discussed a water
sharing dispute Thursday, part of an attempt to improve relations
between the nuclear rivals even as they continued skirmishes along
the Kashmir border.
	   Thursday was the first day of weeklong talks on a range of
issues that have been overshadowed by the neighbors' main dispute:
their competing claims to the Himalayan border region of Kashmir.
	   India had hoped progress on other issues could improve the
atmosphere and enable a breakthrough on Kashmir. But Pakistan
maintains that no progress can be made without a Kashmir
resolution.
	   Since their twin independence in 1947, India and Pakistan have
fought two wars over Kashmir, a border region divided between them
that both claim in its entirety. The two sides regularly skirmish
over Kashmir _ Indian police reported Thursday that three civilians
were killed by a Pakistani shell that landed in a northwestern
region of Indian-held Kashmir Wednesday night.
	   Their enmity and Kashmir's central role in it became an
international concern in May, when India and Pakistan conducted
underground tests, declared themselves nuclear powers and generated
global fears of a nuclear confrontation.
	   Hopes were raised when Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif met in July and
agreed to resume peace negotiations that had been suspended in
1997. But when Pakistan's top foreign office bureaucrat and his
Indian counterpart met last month in the Pakistani capital to
discuss Kashmir, their consultations yielded little more than
pledges to meet again in February.
	   Like those talks, Thursday's meeting between water ministry
officials from India and Pakistan ended inconclusively, with a
promise to meet again on an as yet undetermined date.
	   Z. Hasan, who led India's delegation, told reporters the two
sides merely ``exchanged views'' and reviewed negotiations last
held in 1992 on the use of the Jhelum River, which flows through
Kashmir.
	   ``The differences remain but we shall try to work on them. It is
a complex issue,'' Hasan said. ``We said we should begin at he
point at which we left during the last series of talks, but they
wanted everything afresh.''
	   Under a 1960 agreement, Pakistan was to have unrestricted use of
the waters of the Jhelum. India wants to construct a dam to control
the Jhelum's flow to make the river navigable in the dry season.
India says the dam would not affect the water flow to Pakistan, but
Pakistan has argued that the plan conflicts with the 1960
agreement.
	   The dispute is all the more difficult because it involves a
river in Kashmir. Hasan acknowledged the problem had more to do
with politics than water.
	   Six days of talks are scheduled through Nov. 13 in New Delhi.
Friday, defense ministry officials take up the tangled issue of
Siachen, a glacier battlefield in Kashmir.
	   An Indian foreign ministry official had indicated the best that
could be hoped for was an agreement to stop the almost daily
skirmishing across Siachen. The two countries cannot even agree on
whether they agreed to withdraw troops from the glacier when they
last met on the issue, in 1992.
	   Other issues on the New Delhi agenda include a proposal to start
bus service between the Indian capital and the Pakistani border
city of Lahore, and a possible deal for Pakistan to sell
electricity to India. Officials from both sides have said they
expect few breakthroughs in New Delhi.

1999 Tour de France route shorter, less grueling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEAN-LUC COURTHIAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Tour de France, its image badly tarnished by a
doping scandal last year, will be shorter and less grueling next
summer.
	   But organizers of the prestigious cycling race, who unveiled the
route for next year's 20-stage race Thursday, emphasized that
despite last year's troubles, ``the Tour's popularity remains
intact.''
	   The 3,680-kilometer (2,286-mile) race will start in Puy du Fou
in central France with a short prologue on July 3 and will end with
its traditional ride up and down the Champs-Elysees on July 25.
	   The Tour, which will be about 200 kilometers (124 miles) shorter
than last year, will also include an extra day of rest.
	   But Jean-Marie Leblanc, the race director, sought to play down
last year's doping scandal.
	   ``Since my arrival in 1989, there has been a trend toward making
the route easier,'' Leblanc told reporters.
	   He said the fact that none of the host towns have backed out of
the Tour in the wake of the scandal, proof that France's most
beloved sporting event has not lost its appeal.
	   The Tour de France was rocked last year by a doping scandal that
saw the Festina team expelled following revelations of the
systematic use of EPO, a performance-enhancing drug.
	   Festina's team director, doctor and masseur were jailed during a
preliminary investigation after banned substances were found in a
team car.
	   Seeking to repair cycling's tattered image, three top French
sponsors said last month they have signed a charter aimed at
clamping down on the use of banned drugs among cyclists with stiff
provisions for members of their teams.
	   Next year's course includes the usual two time trials _ the
first in Metz on July 11 before arrival in the Alps, and the second
in Poitiers on July 24.
	   In its only stage outside France, the route will take riders to
Sestrieres in the Italian Alps on July 13.
	   The racers will then head south to the Pyrenees mountains,
climbing to the Piau-Engaly Pass _ the Tour's highest ever at 1,810
meters (5,938 feet) _ on July 20.
	   In all, the racers will climb 23 mountain passes.
	   Looking toward the year 2000, organizers said the Tour could
start on the island of Guadeloupe.

Revived Tropical Storm Mitch lashes Florida

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ After killing thousands in Central America as a
hurricane, Tropical Storm Mitch hit southern Florida on Thursday
with 55 mph (89 kph) wind, flooding and tornadoes. The Keys, hard
hit by Hurricane Georges, were under siege again.
	   By the time Mitch's center made landfall Thursday morning, the
region had been lashed with thunderous rain, whipping winds and
occasional twisters for hours.
	   The Keys, the chain of islands at the state's southern tip, were
hit especially hard. Mobile homes flipped, a motel's roof ripped
off, trees fell and power lines snapped in the same areas where
Hurricane Georges left damage in September.
	   There were multiple tornado touchdowns in Key Largo on Wednesday
and at one touchdown in Islamorada, said Becky Herrin, a
spokeswoman for the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. ``It took the
roof off the Hampton Inn _ most of the roof, anyway.''
	   Farther north, ``a bunch of trailers turned over and people were
trapped inside. We had to go trailer to trailer getting people
out,'' she said.
	   Seven people were treated for storm-related injuries, mostly
cuts and scrapes, at Mariner's Hospital on Plantation Key on
Wednesday.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter rescued a man and a woman
Wednesday after their boat sunk amid 6-to-8 foot (2-to-3 meter)
swells in the Atlantic Ocean about 52 miles (84 kilometers) east of
West Palm Beach. The two U.S. citizens, who were not identified,
were found in a life raft and taken to a hospital in the Bahamas,
said Lt. Javier Delgado. Their conditions were not immediately
available.
	   Television news reports showed snapped trees in southern Broward
County.
	   The storm was expected to move over the state and out over the
Atlantic by this afternoon. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches (10 to
20 centimeters) were forecast.
	   Flooding was reported on many streets in the region, slowing
morning commuters in the Miami area.
	   A tropical storm warning was in effect, extending from the
Florida Keys north to Tarpon Springs on Florida's Gulf coast, and
north to New Smyrna Beach on the Atlantic coast. Western Cuba also
was under a tropical storm warning, as were the northwestern
Bahamas.
	   At (1200 GMT), Mitch had top sustained winds near 55 mph (89
kph), with gusts as high as 69 mph (111 kph). The storm was
centered just south-southeast of Naples on the state's southern
Gulf coast. The storm was moving to the east-northeast at near 23
mph (37 kph) and was expected to pick up speed. Forecasters said it
was a good thing that the storm was moving rapidly; rainfall totals
would have been higher if the storm was moving more slowly.

Japan's space agency seeks name for astronaut teddy bear
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's space agency began soliciting ideas
Thursday for the name of a teddy bear aboard the U.S. space shuttle
Discovery.
	   Japanese astronaut Chiaki Mukai asked for ideas for the name of
the teddy bear, which is traveling in space with Discovery's
seven-member crew, during a television broadcast from the shuttle.
	   Mukai, who became Japan's first woman in orbit four years ago
and is the first Japanese to fly in space twice, also asked for
ideas on completing a poem that begins ``Turn space somersaults, As
many times as you like, That is weightlessness.''
	   The poem was in the traditional Japanese ``tanka'' form and
should be completed with two lines of seven syllables each.
	   Prizes for winning entries have yet to be decided, said a
spokeswoman for the National Space Development Agency of Japan, who
asked that she not be identified by name.
	   Ideas must be sent by Dec. 1, she said.
	   The agency will accept submissions for the bear's name or the
poem from outside Japan, though the poem should be written in
Japanese. They can be sent by postcard or by e-mail via NASDA's Web
site at http://www.nasda.go.jp.
	   The Discovery took off last Thursday from the Kennedy Space
Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and is scheduled to touch down
Saturday.

Thai prime minister says future lies in manufacturing, not farming
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai rejected
calls for agriculture to save Thailand from economic crisis and
said Thursday that a strong manufacturing sector is still needed to
propel the nation out of recession.
	   Manufacturing has been hard hit by the Asian economic crisis and
some Thais have suggested the country should refocus on its
traditional strengths in agriculture. The country is the world's
top rice exporter and farming accounts for about 50 percent of the
work force.
	   Addressing a seminar at Bangkok's Thammasat University, Chuan
noted that the agricultural sector has provided sources of income
and absorbed a large amount of workers who have lost factory jobs.
The government expects unemployment will reach 2 million people due
to the crisis.
	   But Chuan sounded a note of caution that the higher income
currently enjoyed by farmers, who have been exporting a record
amount of rice thanks largely to the Thai baht's depreciation
against the U.S. dollar, should not herald a return to a farming
economy.
	   ``I don't think we will enjoy anything like this again,'' Chuan
said. ``We cannot expand our land. Each year, our population grows
by about 1 million people. We cannot always find new plots of land
for this growing population.''
	   Chuan said that manufacturing still enjoys growth potential,
while agricultural production has tended to decline as a proportion
of gross domestic product.
	   Manufacturing industries contributed 28.4 percent to GDP in
1996, compared to 21.5 percent in 1980. Agriculture dropped from
23.2 percent to 11 percent.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An Islamic militant group threatened
Thursday to retaliate if Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden is
arrested, and described Washington's No. 1 enemy as a ``hero'' to
Muslims worldwide.
	   Bin Laden, believed to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were
indicted Wednesday by a U.S. court in the U.S. embassy bombings in
Africa and are accused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the
United States. The U.S. State Department also announced a reward of
up to dlrs 5 million for bin Laden's capture.
	   ``It is a challenge to the entire Muslim world. ... Bin Laden is
a hero of the Muslim world,'' said Omar Warsi, a leader of
Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or
Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet. ``If anything happens to
him, America will be responsible.''
	   Many Sipah-e-Sahaba followers are fighting in neighboring
Afghanistan alongside the Taliban army, which rules 90 percent of
Afghanistan and has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
those areas.
	   Warsi's group is well-armed with everything from machine guns to
rocket launchers. In Pakistan, it has been blamed in the killings
of hundreds of Shiite Muslims, whom it reviles as non-Muslims based
on a centuries-old dispute over who was the proper successor to the
Prophet Mohammed.
	   In Afghanistan, a Taliban spokesman vowed to protect bin Laden
``at any cost.''
	   ``We cannot allow any harm to come to Osama because he is a
Muslim and a guest,'' said Abdul Hai Muttmayan, who was reached by
satellite telephone in the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar.
	   Harakat-ul-Ansar, a Pakistan-based organization labeled a
terrorist group by the United States, said, however, that
foreigners in Pakistan ``have nothing to fear from us.''
	   Harakat is considered a strong supporter of bin Laden's, and
several Harakat followers were killed in the U.S. missile attack on
alleged bin Laden terror sites in Afghanistan.
	   ``What the United States does is their business,'' said Abdul
Bassit, a Harakat follower. He added, however, that the United
States should know bin Laden ``is a good Muslim, and all the Muslim
world thinks he is a good Muslim.''
	   The Taliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not be
extradited. However, they have set up a judicial inquiry to accept
evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity and have
promised to prosecute him if the evidence warrants it.
	   ``The United States is hostile to Osama and it is wrong for them
to do anything without any proof and they have no case against
Osama,'' Muttmayan said.

Bad loans of Philippine banks rise in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Bad loans of Philippine commercial
banks rose relatively sharply in August, but the central bank said
Thursday it wasn't alarmed by the rise.
	   The central bank said the percentage of non-performing loans of
commercial banks rose to 10.51 percent in August, more than double
last year's average of 4.6 percent. The ratio was 9.64 percent in
July and 8.94 percent in June.
	   Despite the rise to double digits, central bank Governor Gabriel
Singson said the latest figure was ``not so disturbing.'' He did
not elaborate.
	   The central bank has partly attributed the rise in bad-loan
figures to a stricter classification introduced in April. Loans now
are considered non-performing when they go unpaid for three months,
compared with the previous six months.
	   Corporate borrowers also have been hit hard by higher interest
rates since the regional financial crisis broke last year.
	   Some 30 companies have sought relief from debt payments since
July last year, citing cash-flow problems and financial losses
resulting from the effects of the weaker peso and higher interest
rates.
	   Banks' prime lending rates, currently at between 14 and 20
percent, rose sharply as a result of the premium placed on domestic
funds because of tight credit. In the third quarter of last year,
prime lending rates rose as high as 35 percent.
	   Prior to the crisis, the rates averaged 13 percent.

last year's doping scandal.
	   ``Since my arrival in 1989, there has been a trend toward making
the route easier,'' Leblanc told reporters.
	   He said the fact that none of the host towns have backed out of
the Tour in the wake of the scandal, proof that France's most
beloved sporting event has not lost its appeal.
	   The Tour de France was rocked last year by a doping scandal that
saw the Festina team expelled following revelations of the
systematic use of EPO, a performance-enhancing drug.
	   Festina's team director, doctor and masseur were jailed during a
preliminary investigation after banned substances were found in a
team car.
	   Seeking to repair cycling's tattered image, three top French
sponsors said last month they have signed a charter aimed at
clamping down on the use of banned drugs among cyclists with stiff
provisions for members of their teams.
	   Next year's course includes the usual two time trials _ the
first in Metz on July 11 before arrival in the Alps, and the second
in Poitiers on July 24.
	   In its only stage outside France, the route will take riders to
Sestrieres in the Italian Alps on July 13.
	   The racers will then head south to the Pyrenees mountains,
climbing to the Piau-Engaly Pass _ the Tour's highest ever at 1,810
meters (5,938 feet) _ on July 20.
	   In all, the racers will climb 23 mountain passes.
	   Looking toward the year 2000, organizers said the Tour could
start on the island of Guadeloupe.

1999 Tour de France route shorter, less grueling

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Tour de France, its image badly tarnished by a
doping scandal last year, will be shorter and less grueling next
summer.
	   But organizers of the prestigious cycling race, who unveiled the
route for next year's 20-stage race Thursday, emphasized that
despite last year's troubles, ``the Tour's popularity remains
intact.''
	   The 3,680-kilometer (2,286-mile) race will start in Puy du Fou
in central France with a short prologue on July 3 and will end with
its traditional ride up and down the Champs-Elysees on July 25.
	   The Tour, which will be about 200 kilometers (124 miles) shorter
than last year, will also include an extra day of rest.
	   But Jean-Marie Leblanc, the race director, sought to play down
last year's doping scandal.
	   ``Since my arrival in 1989, there has been a trend toward making
the route easier,'' Leblanc told reporters.

Violence continues as Serbian president arrives in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A shootout was reported Thursday
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo,
reflecting continued tension as the government refused visas for an
international tribunal investigating atrocities in the restive
province.
	   The village of Priluzje, 20 kilometers (13 miles) northwest of
the provincial capital Pristina, came under small-arms fire for
several hours Wednesday night but no one was injured, the Serb
Media Center reported.
	   The center, which carries official Serb viewpoints, said several
houses were damaged in the ensuing shootout, and blamed the attack
on ethnic Albanian militants fighting for independence.
	   Although the report could not be independently confirmed, there
have been frequent reports of violence and gunfire despite last
month's U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
	   An International War Crimes Tribunal investigating atrocities in
Kosovo angrily canceled this week's planned visit since Yugoslav
authorities failed to issue visas for a team.
	   Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor from the tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands, and the tribunal's president, Gabrielle Kirk
McDonald, scheduled a news conference for later Thursday to express
their anger over the government's failure to allow the weeklong
mission to Belgrade, which was scheduled to start Friday.
	   On Wednesday, Arbour stressed that Yugoslav authorities are
legally bound to let her investigate alleged atrocities in Kosovo.
	   NATO said Wednesday that the cease-fire in Kosovo, where
hundreds of people were killed in seven months of conflict between
the ruling Serbs and the ethnic Albanians, seems to be holding
despite occasional skirmishes.
	   Albanians make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
population and suffered the most during the fighting. As many as
300,000 ethnic Albanian civilians were driven from their homes by
Serb police and army forces.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency said Thursday there are
roughly 150,000 displaced people in Kosovo but only a couple of
hundred still living in the open.
	   ``We had an example reported yesterday that there were some
clashes in the west of the country where returnee people went again
to the forest, but it is very small numbers,'' Jacques Franquin
said.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is conducting an overall
survey and census and hopes to have more exact figures within a few
days.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic arrived Thursday in Pristina
and began talks with local Serb officials. Further details weren't
immediately available.
	   Serb police in Kosovo raised security measures around a coal
mine and power plant outside Pristina following an attack Tuesday
in which three Serb coal mine workers were injured, the independent
Beta news agency reported.

China to restrict ITICs as debt fears loom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 11th graf pvs `Assets of ... ' to CORRECT asset amount to
400 billion yuan, sted dlrs 36 billion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Chinese regulators plan to curtail the
securities activities of state investment companies, underscoring
concern that the debt-laden companies could threaten the Chinese
economy.
	   Such companies _ known as investment trusts, or ITICs _ have
been under scrutiny since one of the best-known, Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., or GITIC, was closed last
month after it couldn't pay dlrs 2 billion in foreign debt.
	   Regulators are crafting rules to curb speculative investments by
ITICs and reduce their exposure to Chinese stock markets, officials
told Dow Jones Newswires this week. Companies eventually would have
to get rid of their stock-trading and brokerage operations.
	   ``The long-term goal is to completely separate ITICs from the
securities industry,'' said an official of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The collapse of GITIC and rumored troubles in other such
companies have worried Hong Kong's financial community, source of
much of the money that fueled the ITICs' boom.
	   China's central bank chief, Dai Xianglong, reportedly told a
group of visiting Hong Kong bankers this week that a few other
investment trusts would go the way of GITIC, but he suggested they
would be limited in number.
	   In a closed-door meeting in Beijing Wednesday, People's Bank of
China governor Dai, however, stopped short of promising Hong Kong
monetary chief Joseph Yam and banking executives that all of
GITIC's debts would be repaid, Hong Kong media reported.
	   Created in the mid-1980s, investment trusts are state-owned but
meant to propel economic reform by giving managers a free hand to
make commercial decisions without political meddling. The most
famous is China International Trust and Investment Corp., which is
owned by the Chinese Cabinet and has holdings in Hong Kong and
abroad.
	   Many raised capital by offering unusually high interest rates.
Regulations on their businesses were limited. Under pressure to
repay depositors, many ITICs got involved in real estate and other
profitable but speculative investments.
	   When the real estate market fell in 1994 after China imposed
austerity measures to stop 20 percent inflation, ITICs switched to
the stock market. Stock prices have soared in recent years, but
regulators worry about high debt loads among the companies.
	   Assets of the 240 ITICs total as much as 400 billion yuan (dlrs
48 billion), according to Hong Kong media reports. While their
total debts are unknown, overseas debt alone has been estimated to
be as much as dlrs 10 billion.
	   Officials are moving gradually to clean up the ITICs, apparently
concerned about the effect on confidence in Chinese financial
markets and the billions of yuan deposited in the companies by
private savers.
	   Officials say most ITICs will be closed or merged with healthier
ones, paring their ranks to 40.
	   But many are technically bankrupt and only 50 to 60 percent of
assets are recoverable, a central bank official said.
	   The official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said most
companies would gradually disappear, with their businesses taken
over by securities companies and banks. The government would place
top priority on helping creditors and debtors, he said.

Tajikistan troops retake northern city from rebels

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government troops claiming control of city,
surrounding rebel headquarters, rebel leader threatening dam
explosion. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops claimed Thursday
they had largely driven rebel fighters out of a city in northern
Tajikistan after two days of heavy fighting that left dozens dead.
	   The fierce battle for Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125
miles) north of the capital, Dushanbe, was one of the most serious
outbursts of violence since a peace accord was signed last year,
ending five years of civil war in the small, impoverished Central
Asian nation.
	   The government press service said up to 100 government troops
have been killed, but presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov put the
death count at 39. He said 50 rebels had been killed, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The presidential press service said government soldiers were in
full control of the city, which the rebels stormed Wednesday. The
government troops have also surrounded the rebels' headquarters
near Khodzhand, the press service said.
	   However, the ITAR-Tass news agency said there was still fighting
in and around the old fortress in the center of Khodzhand.
	   Tajikistan's Vice Premier Abdurakhmon Azimov said in a radio
broadcast that ``there will be no negotiations or consideration of
the rebels' demands. The matter in question is to block and
liquidate them.''
	   The rebels were still in control of the northern town of Aini,
about 140 kilometers (87 miles) northeast of Dushanbe. They have
taken all government buildings, appointed a new police chief, and
confiscated large amounts of industrial explosives from a local
factory, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But a strategically important mountain pass, just below the
town, was still in government hands, and small groups of refugees
were moving along toward Dushanbe, Interfax said.
	   The attackers were led by Makhmud Khudoberdyev, a former army
colonel who turned against hardline President Emomali Rakhmonov
last year, authorities said. The rebel forces were estimated to
number several hundred, possibly as many as 1,000.
	   Khudoberdyev issued a statement Thursday, and said he would not
negotiate with the government until it broadcasts his demands on
national television and radio.
	   ``We have decided to enter the political arena ... to force the
Rakhmonov government to listen to the voice of its own people and
to end the terror against its political opponents,'' the statement
said.
	   Khudoberdyev said that ``Rakhmonov and his government do not
want peace in Tajikistan, preferring the use of force to
negotiations.''
	   Khudoberdyev claimed that his supporters had planted mines on a
dam of a local power plant, ``which if burst would flood huge
territories in Central Asia.''
	   ``Hot heads in Tajikistan and outside it should make a choice:
Either peace in Tajikistan, or millions of victims for the sake of
preserving Rakhmonov's ambitions,'' Khudoberdyev said.
	   Representatives of seven nations, along with the United Nations
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, met in
the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, to discuss potential solutions.
	   The civil war was waged between Rakhmonov's secular government
and the mostly Muslim opposition. Since the peace deal was signed,
the main opposition groups have been participating in a National
Reconciliation Commission.
	   However, a number of warlords have refused to recognize the deal
and continue to attack government forces.
	   Russia has about 25,000 troops in Tajikistan to support the
government, with most deployed along the country's southern border
with Afghanistan to prevent an influx of drugs and weapons. The
Russian forces were not involved in the latest fighting.

Ukraine's central bank to consider changing primary interest rate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's central bank is considering
lowering the key interest rate next week because it has managed to
restore stability in the country's financial markets, the bank's
chief said.
	   ``The central bank positively views the present situation at the
currency market, which gives us grounds to consider changing the
discount rate,'' National Bank director Viktor Yushchenko told a
news conference late Wednesday.
	   The bank's discount rate is 82 percent, and has remained
unchanged since July. Yuschenko did not say how much the rate might
be lowered.
	   The National Bank has been struggling since August to limit
fallout of the economic crisis in neighboring Russia on Ukraine's
financial market.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency, which stood at about 2.1 to the
dollar before the crisis, lost more than 50 percent of its value in
September alone in response to the Russian ruble's fall.
	   The hryvna's quick devaluation forced the government to widen
the currency trading band it had previously set for the whole of
1998.
	   The hryvna fell only 0.6 percent in October because the National
Bank took steps such as restrictions on hard currency purchases
that equalized supply and demand of dollars at the currency
exchange.
	   The hryvna's rate has remained stable at about 3.428 to the
dollar since mid-October and even strengthened slightly last week.
	   ``The market is now in the phase of relative stability and the
main task is to pursue a policy of stable prices and stable
currency until the end of 1998,'' Yushchenko said.
	   However, he did not say whether the National Bank could afford
to keep the hryvna in the new trading band of 2.5 to 3.5 to the
dollar until the end of the year.
	   The National Bank, which relied on its reserves for most of the
year to defend the currency, is now restricted in such efforts by
the International Monetary Fund's requirements under a recently
approved dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
	   Yushchenko said the bank would decide on new monetary policies
only after it examines forecasts for Ukraine's trade balance and
the government's debt restructuring plans for the next two months.
	   ``We are not discarding the present currency trading band, but
we want to examine all the destabilizing factors more carefully,''
Yushchenko said.
	   The IMF has conditioned disbursement of its latest loan to
Ukraine on the country's maintaining _ among other indicators _ a
specific level of foreign currency reserves every month.
	   An IMF mission is in Kiev this week to look at Ukraine's
performance in October and decide on further disbursement of the
loan.
	   Several senior government officials have said they want to ask
the fund to soften some of its conditions because they are too
difficult for Ukraine's shaky financial system to meet.

Three more legal actions against Pinochet in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ More Chilean exiles filed complaints
against former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet in German courts
Thursday, hoping to pressure Germany to demand his extradition, a
spokesman for a coordinating group said.
	   The three latest complaints allege Pinochet was responsible for
the attempted murder of plaintiffs, deprivation of liberty, bodily
harm and the murder of friends, said Rainer Patz, spokesman for the
Office for Coordinating Complaints against Pinochet.
	   They bring to six the number of complaints lodged, representing
a total of eight people.
	   Courts are reviewing the complaints to see if they have
jurisdiction, as all of the plaintiffs were Chilean citizens at the
time of the alleged crimes. They have since all gained German
citizenship.
	   Courts also are investigating if the statue of limitations could
have expired in the 25 years since the alleged crimes.
	   A seventh case will be lodged soon in a Berlin court by a person
who was a German citizen at the time of the alleged crimes, said
Patz.

Moving with the times, the Bible gets a Dutch makeover
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Bible is getting a Dutch
makeover to make it more user-friendly. But as translators here
have quickly learned, taking on the world's most enduring book
means courting controversy.
	   The first installment of the New Bible Translation has hit the
bookstores, mainly earning applause but upsetting some scholars who
think readers are getting a ``dumbed-down'' version of the sacred
book.
	   ``They think we're so stupid that we won't understand,'' said
the Rev. Nico ter Linden, a prominent Dutch Reformed minister.
	   With the dawning of a new millennium, translators hope the new
ecumenical version will succeed the last official Dutch translation
of 1951 and become the standard Bible for the next 50 years.
	   They say the new version is essential because the Dutch language
has evolved with changing times; words and phrases that once were
widely understood have become archaic and confusing.
	   Yet just as the English-speaking world wavers between the
honorable _ if a bit stiff _ King James version and the breezy _ if
less poetic _ Good News Bible, the Dutch seem torn between old and
new.
	   ``I grew up with the old translation ... and I know a lot of the
verses by heart,'' said Janike van Dijk, a married mother of two
who is active in her nondenominational church in Amsterdam.
	   ``But in some ways it's old. Some of the words have no meaning
to me.''
	   Enter the New Bible Translation _ circa 1998 _ with crisp prose
and lucid style.
	   ``It's so modern and attractive,'' said Panc Beentjes, a
professor of the Old Testament at the Catholic Theological
University in Utrecht and vice-chairman of the steering panel
overseeing the translation.
	   Ancient texts such as ``the sons of Israel'' have been replaced
by the more gender-neutral ``Israelites.'' The old-fashioned and
formal Dutch term for the Lord, ``de Heere,'' has been replaced
with the more common and contemporary ``de Heer.''
	   An example of the new translation comes from the famous opening
verse of the Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes.
	   In the old translation, it reads: ``Vanity of vanities; all is
vanity.'' In the new translation, it goes like this: ``Air and
emptiness; everything is but emptiness.''
	   Not only is the new version suitable for church services and
Bible study groups, Beentjes expects its easy and informal style to
appeal to nonbelievers and casual readers.
	   Critics like Ter Linden, however, contend the wholesale approach
has erased some symbols and subtleties, weakening the power of the
ancient texts and altering their original meaning.
	   ``I feel so disappointed. The Bible is full of mysteries, but
very often they are gone in the new translation,'' said Ter Linden,
who pastored Amsterdam's landmark West Church for 18 years.
	   ``The public is being dumbed down instead of being taught new
words and new concepts,'' he added.
	   Unlike ``The Book,'' a popular Dutch paraphrase of the Bible,
the new version is an official translation that strives to be true
to the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts. Beentjes defends
what he calls the high literary standards and accuracy of the 21
translators working alongside just as many linguists and other
fine-tuning experts.
	   The mammoth project, spearheaded by several leading Bible
societies, is also backed by dozens of churches and the Dutch
Jewish community. In view of the country's divisive religious
landscape, such broad support is already a victory of sorts.
	   A 1970s effort at a new translation flopped, Beentjes said, when
rival denominations couldn't even get past the first verse.
	   ``In the Netherlands, everyone thinks he should have a say about
Bible translation,'' he said. ``We were very surprised that so many
churches, from left to right, are cooperating with this project.''
	   Already five books _ Esther, Ecclesiastes, Jonah, Acts, and
Judith from the Apocrypha _ have been translated and published
under the title ``Work in Progress.'' By 2004, the entire Bible
will be completed at a cost of 21.6 million guilders (dlrs 11.6
million).
	   If initial book sales are any indication, readers apparently
prefer the colloquial approach: The first printing of 8,000 copies
sold out within a week.
	   ``The Bible should be read by everyone,'' said Van Dijk. ''It's
good to make it more modern.''

Iraq dismisses U.N. draft resolution, says sanctions must be
</HEADLINE>
lifted &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq dismissed a draft U.N. resolution that
demands its cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors and said Thursday
that any measure adopted must include a timetable for ending
economic sanctions.
	   The draft resolution to be discussed Thursday in the U.N.
Security Council threatens no force if Iraq ignores the demand to
rescind its Saturday decision to end cooperation with arms
inspectors.
	   If the resolution does not ``look positively and fairly at
Iraq's right to have the sanctions lifted'' it will be rejected by
Baghdad, al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party said
Thursday.
	   ``Iraq shall not rescind its decision unless the council meets
its legitimate and just demands,'' said Al-Thawra, which expresses
government views on matters of national interest.
	   The paper also repeated Baghdad's demand for a restructuring of
the arms inspection commission and the dismissal of its chief,
Richard Butler.
	   The United Nations imposed an economic embargo against Iraq
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Council diplomats have
said they will not lift the sanctions until monitors certify that
Iraq has dismantled its weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen was in the Gulf Thursday
trying to rally Arab leaders for a united stand against Iraq.
	   Babel, Iraq's most influential newspaper, said Iraq was certain
that apart from Kuwait no other Arab country would back a U.S.
strike against Iraq.

Nepalese monarch suffers heart trouble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's king experienced heart trouble
overnight and was described as improving on Thursday, according to
a palace statement.
	   The statement said King Birendra, 52, experienced ``cardiac
ischemia,'' or a block in the flow of blood, Wednesday night.
Doctors advised him to rest and the palace said he was feeling
better Thursday.
	   The Harvard-educated King Birendra ascended to the throne in
1972 after the death of his father King Mahendra.
	   He was an absolute monarch until 1990, when a pro-democracy
movement forced constitutional reforms that made a figurehead of
the throne. Nepal has been politically unstable since then, with
parties and factions _ including a royalist group _ undermining
each other in a constant power struggle. The country has had five
prime ministers in the last four years.
	   King Birendra has great influence over Hindu priests in this
Hindu kingdom.
	   The king's oldest child, Crown Prince Dipendra, is 26 years old.

Festina parts company with Virenque
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Richard Virenque, the French cyclist who has been
embroiled in a doping scandal since the Tour de France, will no
longer ride for Festina, according to reports Thursday.
	   ``Our paths are separating,'' Festina executive director Gines
Gorriz said in an interview with French daily Le Figaro. ``We do
not want to work with cyclists still under a judicial procedure.''
	   ``Festina is not saying that Virenque was doped. No one can say
if he is guilty or not, only him,'' Gorriz said.
	   Ex-Festina team doctor Eric Ryckaert and former masseur Willy
Voet have both recognized the use of banned doping products within
the team, but Virenque still denies he knowingly took such
substances.
	   Festina said another reason for the split was that Virenque
refused a 75-percent cut in salary.
	   Gorriz said Festina offered a salary of three million francs
(dlrs 545,000), which represented the 75-percent salary cut.
	   Laurent Brochard, Didier Rous, Christophe Moreau and Pascal
Herve will continue to cycle for Festina.

Former slave laborers plan to fight German government-industry

fund &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to add under the Nazis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Former World War II slave laborers
under the Nazis said on Thursday they would fight a plan by
Germany's government and industry to set up a compensation fund,
saying the proposed settlement was an attempt to bypass their
claims.
	   ``The survivors are ready to work toward a solution _ but they
will not be shut out and the German government cannot stop their
claims,'' the group said in a statement faxed from their lawyer's
office in the United States.
	   Before taking office last month, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
government said a group comprising government and industry will
work out a plan to settle back-wage claims from World War II-era
slave laborers.
	   Among those participating in the group are the bosses of Allianz
insurance company, Dresdner and Deutsche banks, Volkswagen, BMW,
Siemens, Krupp, Degussa and BASF. It will be headed by Schroeder's
chief of staff, Bodo Hombach.
	   The plan is an attempt to ``bargain away our claims,'' survivor
Paul Frenkel said in the statement.
	   An alternative group comprising class action claimants, slave
labor survivors, the Jewish Claims Conference, German industry and
banks and the German government should meet and agree on a
settlement, group lawyer Michael Witti said in the statement.
	   The survivors called on the German government to recognize their
right to settle their claims individually or on a class action
basis, pointing to the recent 1.25 billion dollar settlement
reached with Swiss banks.
	   New York-based lawyer Ed Fagan and Munich-based Witti will
accompany representatives of the group on a two-day trip to
Frankfurt Friday and Saturday, where they will press their claims.

German finance minister meets country's central bankers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with finance ministry comment, interest
rates unchanged. Adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine met
on Thursday with Germany's top central bankers, but apparently
failed to end a row over his demands for an interest rate cut to
boost the economy and reduce unemployment.
	   The visit, which the government described as a courtesy call,
was Lafontaine's first as finance minister to the fortress-like
German central bank, or Bundesbank, located in a Frankfurt suburb.
	   The talks involved ``an intense exchange of views'' about fiscal
and monetary policy, the Finance Ministry said.
	   A particular focus was the development of money-market rates,
which are falling in eight European countries including Britain,
the statement said.
	   It said Lafontaine told the central bankers he wanted good
cooperation and insisted that ``no member of the government is
questioning the independence of the Bundesbank and the European
Central Bank,''
	   Lafontaine has provoked strong debate with his repeated calls
for interest rate cuts and for the Bundesbank to factor in cutting
unemployment and boosting growth when deciding monetary policy.
	   Many central bankers regard the suggestions as heresy, saying
their job is to maintain steady prices and low inflation, not get
involved in problems they say are structural and can only be solved
by broader economic, or political, measures.
	   The bank announced after the meeting of its central council that
it left rates unchanged, as widely expected.
	   Increasingly, analysts are suggesting Lafontaine may be trying
to divert attention from the government's promises to cut
unemployment by making the central bank co-responsible for the
issue in the eyes of the public.
	   Lafontaine was trying to make the Bundesbank a scapegoat because
the new government ``has presented far too few recipes against
unemployment,'' said Ulrich Ramm, head economist at Commerzbank,
speaking on Inforadio Berlin-Brandenburg.
	   The leader of the Federal Union of German Banks, Manfred Weber,
called on the government ``to do its economic homework,'' adding he
shared its view that cutting unemployment was the country's most
pressing challenge.
	   ``Where I completely disagree is in the measures and instruments
with which we can achieve it,'' Weber said, adding he hoped
Lafontaine's meeting with central bankers would clear up the row.
	   The new government was elected largely on promises to cut
unemployment, which on Thursday dropped to 10.1 percent, a slight
dip from last month.

Clinton's brother says Chelsea deeply affected by Lewinsky scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bill Clinton's brother says the president's
daughter Chelsea has been deeply affected by the Monica Lewinsky
sex scandal and has done her utmost to survive the ordeal.
	   In an interview published in this week's Paris Match, Clinton's
younger brother Roger said his niece was conducting her life
business as usual, but that things weren't easy.
	   ``She's going to class every day and I imagine that, in that her
milieu, there's no shortage of talk ...,'' Clinton was quoted as
telling the weekly magazine.
	   Chelsea is a sophomore at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Ca.
	   ``For the moment, the situation isn't easy because things have
been blown out of proportion. Despite her sense of humor and
gaiety, Chelsea has been deeply affected by the scandal, like Bill,
like Hillary,'' the president's younger brother told Paris Match.
	   Clinton, a rock'n roll singer who had a drug problem in the
mid-1980s, said he had no idea what Hillary was feeling, and had no
intention of trying to guess.
	   ``No one can put themselves in her shoes,'' he was quoted as
saying.
	   The magazine ran seven pages of family photos of the younger
Clinton, his wife and baby taken during Christmas holidays
celebrated with the First Family in the White House.
	   Several show the president cooing over his baby nephew, Tyler.
	   Clinton described his niece as ``intelligent, brilliant, with a
good sense of humor.
	   ``I'm convinced we'll hear from her someday, believe me,'' he
was quoted as saying. ``She's really something special!''
	   Clinton said Chelsea would never give up her good spirits,
regardless of what the three were going through.
	   He also said his relationship with Hillary had improved over the
years, and blamed their strained past on his own pig-headedness.
	   `` I wasn't in good shape at the time, and I refused to take her
advice,'' Clinton was quoted as saying. ``Today, if I've got my
head on straight, it's because of her.''

 &UR; Czech government not surprised by negative EU report

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel urged the
government on Thursday to speed up integration attempts into the
European Union, following EU criticism of Czech slowness in
revamping legislation to conform to West European standards.
	   The report on progress of candidate nations in adapting EU
standards singled out the Czechs for their ``worrying slowdown.''
The Czech Republic, along with Hungary and Poland, are front
runners among the former Soviet bloc countries hoping for
membership.
	   The report said that the Czech Republic, along with Estonia,
Hungary, Poland and Slovenia ``are functioning market economies
that should be able to cope with competitive pressures and market
forces within the union in the medium term.'' But it noted that the
Czech Republic's speed in enacting necessary legislation is not
satisfactory.
	   ``I expected such a critical report,'' President Vaclav Havel
said, adding he asked the government to ``speed up steps that will
lead to the fulfillment of EU's conditions.''
	   Former Premier Vaclav Klaus, the architect of Czech economic
reform, suggested the report was biased, telling the daily Lidove
Noviny: ``In some countries, there is a strong campaign against the
enlargement of the EU.''
	   The Czech Republic is among six countries that are expected to
join the EU in five or six years.
	   Preliminary talks with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus began this year and the EU also opened
``preparatory'' talks with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   The second group are nations facing a tougher job in improving
their economies before serious membership talks can begin.

Unfaithful married men face labor camp in south China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Married men who keep mistresses or frequent
prostitutes could be sent to labor camps under new rules in one of
China's most liberal cities, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported Thursday.
	   The rules _ contained in a directive issued recently to
government departments in Guangzhou _ are intended to bolster
marriage and protect the legal rights of women, Xinhua said.
	   Cases in which married men ```cohabitate with concubines'' or
otherwise `support mistresses''' are rising in the city, Xinhua
quoted Ding Lu, head of legal protection for the government-backed
All-China Women's Federation, as saying.
	   Under the rules, married men who financially support mistresses
or treat them as spouses will be charged as bigamists; they, along
with patrons of prostitutes, could be punished by administrative
sanction or sent to labor camps, Xinhua said.
	   The report did not specify how long offenders would be held, but
police have the authority to send criminal suspects to labor camps
for up to three years without trial.
	   Although jilted partners in a marriage may contact courts or
police to punish their spouses, authorities may act even without
receiving a complaint in cases ``deemed harmful to society,''
Xinhua said.
	   Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong province, which borders
wealthy Hong Kong. A nearly 20-year economic boom has turned the
city into a freewheeling center of conspicuous consumption for the
newly wealthy.
	   The moves to try to stem extra-marital affairs in Guangzhou
dovetail with a national debate over revisions to China's marriage
law. Earlier drafts of the revised law included such tough
sanctions but drafters say many of the controversial measures have
been dropped.

EU Commissioners defend tax free perks - for themselves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission _ the 20-member
panel that goes to bat daily for a borderless European Union _ said
Thursday it won't forego tax-free perks for itself even though
duty-free sales will end in 1999 for most European citizens.
	   European commissioners have generous allowances of tax-free
purchases of tobacco, wine, spirits and car fuel each year because
they have diplomatic status.
	   EU transport workers unions are complaining because the
commission is abolishing tax-free shopping for travelers within the
15-nation EU, yet its members will continue to enjoy benefits they
deny other Europeans.
	   All 20 commissioners _ minus Belgian's Karel van Miert because
he's on home territory _ have the right to buy 60 liters of
spirits, 400 liters of wine, 20,000 cigarettes and 4,000 liters of
car fuel tax free each year.
	   ``We must keep things in proportion,'' EU spokeswoman Betty
Olivi told reporters Thursday. ``European Commissioners enjoy the
same benefits as other diplomats in Belgium.''
	   The issue has renewed a debate in Britain about the perceived
aloofness of the European Commission from the average European.
	   John Cryer, a Labor member of parliament, said the tax-free
perks enjoyed by the EU executive were ``another example of, and
reason why, everyone calls the European Commission the biggest
gravy train in the world.''
	   Olivi said that although European commissioners _ who earn a
minimum of dlrs 200,000 a year tax free _ are entitled to duty free
benefits, not all make use of these.

Iran's first private news agency to start operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has issued a license for the country's
first private news agency, the organization's director said
Thursday.
	   The Fars News Agency was issued a permit by the Ministry of
Culture and Islamic Guidance and will start operating within the
next two weeks, the agency's managing director, Saeed Nowbari, told
The Associated Press.
	   Iran currently has only one news agency, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency, which is considered allied with President
Mohammad Khatami and supports his reforms. The political leaning of
the new news agency, however, was unclear.
	   ``We will act independently and we are determined to be
reliable, accurate and fast in our reporting,'' Nowbari said.
	   The Farsi-language agency was founded by six investors and will
have 20 staffers, said Nowbari, an official with the Tehran
judiciary and a former IRNA employee. The judiciary is considered a
stronghold of hard-liners.
	   ``Over the next two weeks, we will have our first news item. We
do not in any way rely on any public department,'' he said.
	   The agency will later expand operations by equipping offices in
provincial centers, appearing on the Internet and ultimately
setting up offices outside the country, he said.
	   Khatami has been pushing for greater press and cultural freedoms
since his election last year. Hard-liners have opposed his moves.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ In a bid to stop illegal dealings in hard
currency, Sudan has introduced curbs on foreign exchange accounts
held by individuals, state-run television has reported.
	   The government announced Wednesday that the minimum amount
needed to open a such an account is dlrs 5,000, Sudanese Television
said. The figure is very high by the standards of Sudan, one of the
poorest countries in Africa.
	   In the past one could open a foreign exchange account with any
amount of money as long as it had been transferred from abroad.
	   Observers say the curb is designed to head off a challenge to
the official exchange rate, which now stands at 2,050 Sudanese
pounds to the dollar.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Arab economies needed to increase
inter-governmental cooperation and reform their financial sectors,
finance ministry officials told a banking conference here Thursday.
	   ``The international economic and financial problems ... that
challenge our Arab world can only be faced through joint Arab
cooperation at the official level, and more importantly and
effectively, at the level of economic and financial institutions,''
Fouad Saniora, the Lebanese state minister for finance, told the
opening session.
	   Saniora called for laws and regulations to promote a sound and
transparent banking sector.
	   ``What hinders cooperation between Arab banks is that they often
do not abide by the rules of sound banking,'' he said.
	   The vice president of the Arab Bankers' Association, Joseph
Torbey, said Arab states should work to avoid a crash similar to
that which has ravaged the Asian financial markets.
	   He said the fact that nascent Arab markets have so far managed
to avoid a slump similar to that in Asian countries, Russia and
Latin American states should be an incentive for improved
cooperation.
	   Some 350 officials from Arab and international financial
institutions are attending the three-day conference entitled ``Arab
Banking Cooperation: Trends and Opportunities.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Trading levels slipped in the Baghdad Stock
Exchange this week as tension mounted over U.N. weapons
inspections.
	   The number of shares traded dropped 18 per cent from 49.8
million the previous week to 40.6 million, said a market bulletin
released Thursday.
	   The value of these shares, the bulletin added, rose by 4 per
cent to 407.4 million (dlrs 239,000).
	   The bulletin, reflecting activity for three business days ending
Wednesday, said investors this week opted for high-value shares,
particularly those in the service sector.
	   Demand for government bonds also surged with 332 bonds traded,
compared to 98 last week.
	   Iraq severed all ties with U.N. weapons inspectors on Saturday.
The United States said it would not rule out military action to
force Baghdad to back down.
	   The crisis has also led to a drop in the value of the Iraqi
dinar. The currency on Thursday was trading at 1,730 to the dollar
compared to 1,650 the previous week.
	   Shares of only 60 companies were traded out of the 94 firms
listed in the stock exchange, the bulletin said.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 1.934.9 points at the end of this week, up 2.01 percent,
from the previous week, a report said Thursday.
	   The market, which had fallen to an almost two-year low, was
revived by an official statement indicating the government was
going to take steps that would increase much-needed liquidity, said
the National Investments Co. in a weekly report.
	   The company said these measures have to be implemented quickly
and must include opening the market to foreign investors, as well
as encouraging the private sector to play a larger role in the
state-dominated economy.
	   Only Kuwaitis and nationals of the other six Arab states in the
Gulf can trade in the market's 76 listed companies.
	   Some 195.50 million shares were traded this week, up 21.34
percent from last week. The value of these shares rose 32.02
percent to 41.96 million dinars (dlrs 138.94 million).
	   According to the report, the stocks of 69 companies were traded
this week, with 43 closing higher, 18 lower and 8 unchanged.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices increased, but turnover
slipped on Jordan's stock exchange this week, brokers said
Thursday. Trading was focused on commercial banks.
	   A market report, reflecting activity for six business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
rose by 1.08 percent to 162.73 percent.
	   It said shares of commercial banks nudged up by 1.77 percent and
the insurance sector by 0.46 percent. But shares of industrial
firms slipped by 0.41 percent and service companies by 0.99
percent.
	   Turnover slipped by 59.6 percent to 4.6 million Jordanian dinars
(dlrs 6.5 million), the report said.
	   Stocks of 97 firms were traded during the week.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Denmark gave Jordan a soft loan of dlrs 10
million Thursday to finance local projects, the Industrial
Development Bank said.
	   The bank's general manager, Rajab Saad, said Denmark had given
the money to his organization which would use it for loans to
Jordanian investors who are launching businesses. The investors
must be prepared to import at least 50 percent of their raw
materials from Denmark.
	   He declined to provide the terms of the loan.

Inter Milan's Simoni desperate for derby victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Luigi Simoni might finally be running out of second
chances.
	   The Internazionale of Milan coach, recipient of several
ultimatums during his rocky one-plus seasons at the helm,
desperately needs to halt a three-game losing streak in the Serie A
Sunday night when the club faces cross-city rival AC Milan.
	   Touted at the start of the season as a title contender, Inter
has struggled with inconsistent defense and injuries to star
strikers Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio. After consecutive losses to
Lazio of Rome, league leader Juventus of Turin and mediocre Bari,
Inter has a 3-1-3 record, good only for eighth place in the 18-team
standings.
	   One of the biggest criticisms aimed at Simoni is that he is too
defense-minded, yet only two clubs have allowed more goals than the
12 Inter has given up.
	   That could be a problem against Milan, which is enjoying a
rebound from back-to-back poor seasons. Milan is tied for third
place with a 4-1-2 record, led by the goalscoring of Germany's
Oliver Bierhoff (five goals) and Brazil's Leonardo (four), who had
been sidelined with injury but is expected to start Sunday.
	   The Milan-Inter showdown, before what is expected to be a
sellout crowd of about 85,000 at hallowed San Siro Stadium,
highlights an otherwise drab eighth round schedule. Juventus _
which leads the league with 16 points, one ahead of Fiorentina _
travels to Udinese, while Fiorentina hosts Venezia. Other games
have AS Roma at Bologna; AC Parma at Bari; Lazio of Rome hosting
Empoli; Piacenza at Calgiari; Vicenza at Perugia, and Sampdoria of
Genoa hosting Salernitana.
	   Simoni could use a breakthrough game from Ronaldo. The Brazilian
is still working his way back from a long layoff with tendinitis in
both knees. He came off the bench last weekend and nearly led Inter
past Bari, but it was too little too late in the 3-2 defeat.
	   ``I am happy about what he has done so far,'' the coach said of
his star. ``He needs to improve little by little, and I am sure
that slowly he will come back as he was before.''
	   While Nicola Ventola (already a career-high five goals), Chile's
Ivan Zamorano and Andrea Pirlo have been scoring enough in
Ronaldo's absence, the backline has been rather dismal. Simoni has
even tried swtiching Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone back to
sweeper in order to shore up the defense.
	   Portugal's Paolo Sousa, who had returned from injury to provide
some stability at midfield, will miss Sunday's game through
suspension.
	   Milan's game revolves around Bierhoff, in the midst of another
solid season. After last year's breakthrough (league-best 27 goals
for small-time Udinese), the German has adapted well to playing
under the spotlight. His physical style could give Inter fits,
unless muscular Nigerian defender Taribo West is given a man-to-man
assignment.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Joyce Salvadori Lussu, a writer, poet and
intellectual and a pioneer of Italian feminism and
environmentalism, has died from a heart attack, news reports said
Thursday. She was 86.
	   The widow of Italian poet Emilio Lussu, she died on Wednesday in
her Rome apartment, RAI state TV said.
	   Born in Florence in 1912 to Italian-British parents, she
traveled throughout Europe during the 30s and 40s as an
anti-fascist. In Paris, in 1938, she met Lussu and joined him in
the Resistance fight against Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's
regime.
	   They later settled in her family's villa on the Adriatic coast.
She began her writings advocating attention to the environment and
women's progress and also translated poetry.
	   Among her publications are ``Il Libro delle Streghe'' (``The
witches' book''), the essay ``Tradurre Poesia'' (``Translating
Poetry'') and the recent autobiography ``Portrait.''
	   Information on survivors was not immediately available.
	   Like her husband, she will be cremated.

Unemployment rate sinks in Germany, continuing slight improvement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Greens comment, graf 11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's high unemployment eased
again in October, dropping to 10.1 percent from 10.3 percent, the
federal labor office in Nuremberg said Thursday.
	   Nationwide, 3.89 million people were jobless, 73,700 less than
in September, when German unemployment dropped below 4 million for
the first time in two years.
	   Labor office chief Bernhard Jagoda attributed the continued
improvement to expanded job-creation plans, especially in the five
states of the former communist East Germany. Joblessness has been
most severe in the east, which is still adjusting to a market
economy after unifying with the capitalist west in 1990.
	   A ``fundamental social consensus'' was needed to quickly tackle
joblessness, Jagoda said.
	   Unemployment in the east remained almost twice that in the west:
15.7 percent in October compared to 8.7 percent. Still, conditions
in the east improved slightly more than in the west, with 43,900
people finding jobs there, compared to the west's 29,800.
	   The labor office figures were unadjusted for seasonal factors.
Separately, seasonally adjusted numbers from Germany's central
bank, the Bundesbank, showed a higher unemployment rate _ 10.6
percent in October, down minimally from 10.7 percent the month
before.
	   Jagoda said he expected joblessness to remain below 4 million,
although his office said October's promising numbers did not yet
reflect Germany's weaker economy. The office said jobs creation in
the future could slow if global financial trouble persisted.
	   The year's average would likely be around 4.3 million, instead
of the 4.4 million earlier expected, he said.
	   The opposition Christian Democrats claimed credit for the fresh
drop in jobless figures, calling it ``a positive aftereffect of
Helmut Kohl's government'' and its pro-business reforms.
	   Peter Hintze, the party's general secretary, accused the new
center-left government of threatening to wipe out the improvement
by planning higher taxes on business.
	   Gunda Roestel, a spokeswoman for the Greens, the ruling Social
Democrats junior coalition partner, said 3.89 million unemployed
was ``the legacy of the failed economic policy of the Kohl
administration.''
	   The falling figure is likely to cheer the Social Democrat-led
government, which has made fighting unemployment its key goal.

France to supply most of the troops to protect verifiers in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France will supply the most troops for a new
military force to protect civilian verifiers who run into trouble
while ensuring that the peace deal in Kosovo is observed, top
French officials said Thurday.
	   French Defense Minister Alain Richard said France would provide
up to half of the future force, which will consist of 1,200 to
1,800 members, and will be backed by helicopters and tanks based in
neighboring Macedonia.
	   The purpose of the extraction force is to protect the 2,000
unarmed civilian ground verifiers being deployed in Kosovo under
the direction of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   Four or five European nations will take part in the force, but
it was not yet clear whether the United States would participate.
At this point, Russia does not plan to join the effort.
	   Richard and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, speaking at a joint
news conference, stressed the military mission carried risks given
the explosive nature of the conflict, the terrain, and the weakness
of ground intelligence.
	   The rules of engagement for the military force are currently
being worked out by NATO, Richard said. He said the verifiers would
be able to call upon the force in case of danger.
	   Helicopters would be able to reach the verifiers within an hour,
while it would take at least half a day for troops in tanks to come
to their assistance, Richard said.
	   As part of an agreement reached by U.S. negotiator Richard
Holbrooke on Oct. 12 with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
about 2,000 verifiers are being sent to Kosovo, a southern province
of Yugoslavia, to ensure that Milosevic makes good on his pledge to
withdraw troops and police from the area.
	   Vedrine criticized remarks made recently by Holbrooke which
indicated the United States believed that intervention could be
taken in the Balkans without a resolution by the United Nations.
	   The French diplomat said it was U.N. resolutions which helped
define the mission in the Balkans, and gave the mission its legal
force.

French high school students hold new round of protests

 &UR; By SUSANNAH PATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Disgruntled high school students staged a third
round of nationwide marches Thursday, but the protest _ seen as a
test of their fledgling movement _ appeared much smaller this time.
	   Last month, before students went on a weeklong vacation,
hundreds of thousands of them took to the streets to protest
overcrowded classrooms, outmoded equipment, a lack of teachers and
other conditions they say leave them badly prepared for the future.
	   Demonstrations Thursday were set for the cities of Bordeaux,
Toulon, Saint-Brieuc, Toulouse, Nice, and Lyon as well as Paris.
Meetings and sit-ins were planned in high schools throughout the
country.
	   Following last month's protests, Education Minister Claude
Allegre announced the addition of thousands of new teachers and
assistants.
	   But many students remain skeptical that the Education Ministry's
plans, which also called for new equipment and a lighter work load,
are sufficient to improve conditions.
	   ``We started something, and now we want to finish it,'' said
Aline Doussin, 16, who marched in Paris. ``Allegre only gave us
half of what we asked for.''
	   ``We won't stop our protests until we see results,'' said
Guillaume Thfoin, 17, who goes to school in Savigny-sur-Orge south
of Paris. ``We have 35 students in every class, and that has to
change.''
	   Last month's protests disintegrated into violent rock-throwing
demonstrations, resulting in injuries and property damage. Much of
the violence was caused by youths from troubled suburbs who were
not connected to the protests.
	   Anticipating further violence, French police in riot gear
surrounded the protesters Thursday.
	   They also banned street parking as of Wednesday evening and
urged merchants to shutter their shops along the planned march
route from the Montparnasse train station to the Education
Ministry.

International aid sanctions on Sarajevo to be lifted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The European Union on
Thursday said it will resume reconstruction aid to Sarajevo after a
months-long suspension, imposed to force authorities to speed up
the repatriation of non-Muslims to the capital.
	   The suspension was announced in July by the two main
reconstruction funders, the United States Agency for International
Development and the European Union. Construction worth dlrs 20
million was postponed in an attempt to pressure city officials to
allow the return of some 20,000 non-Muslims to their prewar homes.
	   The European Union lifted its construction aid moratorium on
recommendation of Carlos Westendorp, Bosnia's senior international
administrator. USAID was expected to follow suit.
	   Under pressure from international officials, the Sarajevo
government signed an agreement in March pledging to actively help
the return of up to 20,000 Bosnian Serbs and Croats to their prewar
homes, now occupied by Muslims, by the middle of this year.
	   Although still disappointed with the number of non-Muslims
returning to the Muslim-held Bosnian capital, Westendorp decided to
recommend the lifting of suspension, said a statement from his
office.
	   ``While estimates of how many minority returns have taken place
vary, it is clear that return is happening,'' the statement said
adding that the available housing space in Sarajevo needs to be
expanded to make room for more returns.
	   City officials argued the town was crowded by Muslim refugees
from Serb-held areas and said return should go both ways, with
Muslims also being allowed to settle in former home regions now
dominated by Serbs.
	   According to the independent International Crisis Group, fewer
then 52,000 minority returns have been registered throughout the
country since the end of war in 1995. In the Bosnian Serb part of
the country, only 2,000 non Serbs have come home.
	   Westendorp said the authorities will have to redouble their
efforts to reach the 20,000 minority returns goal.

Greece says Turkey's decision to defrost EU relations positive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; WITH BC-Turkey-EU &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece on Thursday expressed pleasure that
Turkey was defrosting its relations with the European Union, but
warned its neighbor that membership was still far off.
	   ``This is a very positive step,'' said Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos. ``It is also very positive for Turkey as its
relations with the EU had worsened.''
	   Turkey's foreign minister said his country's relations with the
EU will improve following a European Commission report on the
progress of candidate countries, which included Turkey. Ankara
essentially froze its relations with the EU last December after the
Union to exclude Turkey as a candidate.
	   ``Turkey has for a long time gained the right to be an member of
the EU,'' Pangalos said. ``We have always supported Turkey's
European orientation.''
	   Pangalos also added that Greece did not think that Turkey's
predominantly Muslim population was a problem.
	   ``Islam already exists in the EU. There are already six to seven
million Muslim citizens of Europe, so for me and my government this
is not a problem,'' he said.
	   But Pangalos said Turkey must still take steps to improve its
record on issues such as human rights and respect some EU decisions
``on good neighborly relations, respect for international law, and
to cooperate in solving the Cyprus problem.''
	   Turkey, Pangalos said, also has to recognize the general
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice at the Hague.
This would help its EU aspirations, but also solve many
longstanding problems with Greece.
	   ``If it accepts this, then there will be not just one dialogue,
but thousands,'' Pangalos said.
	   Greece and Turkey have many longstanding disputes over the
Aegean Sea. Athens has said it is willing to take some to the
international court, whose jurisdiction is so far not recognized by
Turkey.

Cook issues fresh warning to Saddam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook issued a fresh
warning Thursday that Iraq faces the ``severest consequences'' if
Saddam Hussein does not back down in the latest standoff over U.N.
weapons inspections.
	   Although a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Saddam
did not specifically authorize military force, Cook said legal
authority exists for airstrikes if inspectors are not allowed to
resume their work.
	   ``We are quite confident that if it comes to that, there is
adequate legal basis for us to proceed,'' Cook said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. interview. ``All options are open.''
	   Iraq's decision Saturday to end all cooperation with disarmament
monitors has been condemned by the Security Council as a ``flagrant
violation'' of the country's agreements with the world body. On
Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen lobbied Gulf states
for support of possible military action.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, addressing a group of
students Thursday, also spoke of the government's readiness to use
military force against Saddam if necessary.
	   ``The reason that we are supporting the U.S. and the U.S. is
supporting us is because we believe in what we are doing in
relation to Iraq,'' Blair said. ``The international community must
be prepared to act, if necessary by military force, to stop him.''
	   Cook said that while the current emphasis is on a diplomatic
solution to the crisis, U.S.-led forces assembled in the region in
February remain ready to strike.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, more than 20 warships
and about 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.

three-month war in Congo that has embroiled troops from at least
eight countries.
	   Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Susan Rice has acknowledged
that she had achieved little so far on her seven-nation tour to
persuade outsiders to withdraw from Congo.
	   ``We are encouraged by the recognition of all those with whom we
talked that there can be no viable military solution, and by the
expressed desire for peace,'' Rice said before leaving Entebbe for
Lusaka.
	   ``However, we remain concerned about the continued buildup of
military forces, which underscores the importance of moving forward
to find a peaceful solution.''
	   Zimbabwe has sent 6,000 troops and an air force to prop up
Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Angola and Namibia also sent
troops and tanks to help stop rebel advances.
	   Despite denials from the Ugandan and Rwandan governments, their
troops repeatedly have been seen fighting on the rebels' side.
	   U.S. diplomats said Rice, who already has visited South Africa,
Angola, Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda, had a hard time
convincing the countries supporting Kabila that the United States
was impartial in the conflict.
	   Rice said she delayed plans to return to Washington to travel to
Lusaka to share her findings with Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba, a leading mediator in the Congo conflict.
	   Two rounds of peace talks hosted by Chiluba have failed, and he
is sympathetic to Rice's mission. Other leaders have asked him to
arrange talks leading to direct negotiations between Kabila and the
rebels.
	   On the last scheduled stop of her tour, Rice met with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni in Entebbe for two hours Wednesday night.
	   In a statement issued Thursday, Museveni said he told Rice the
conflict ``can and will be resolved,'' and that a cease-fire was
possible.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Rice met with Congolese rebels and Rwandan
officials.
	   ``We had a frank exchange of views,'' said Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition. ``The
Americans listened to our concerns, and we hope the contacts will
continue.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Bill Clinton's brother says the president's
daughter Chelsea has been deeply affected by the Monica Lewinsky
sex scandal and has done her utmost to survive the ordeal.
	   In an interview published in this week's Paris Match, Clinton's
younger brother Roger said his niece was conducting her life
business as usual, but that things weren't easy.
	   ``She's going to class every day and I imagine that, in that her
milieu, there's no shortage of talk ...,'' Clinton was quoted as

Yugoslavia refuses to allow Kosovo investigations

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The president of the U.N. war
crimes tribunal angrily branded Yugoslavia a ``rogue state''
Thursday after Belgrade refused to allow investigators to probe
alleged atrocities in Kosovo.
	   Authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia confirmed they
would not allow Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal, and a team of investigators to carry out
investigations in the troubled region.
	   ``This conduct is a further example of the FRY's utter disregard
for the norms of the international community,'' said tribunal
president Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States.
	   ``Essentially, it has become a rogue state, one that holds the
international rule of law in contempt,'' she said.
	   Arbour would not say what her next step would be. She said her
visa request was a matter of courtesy and that she has a legal
right to carry out investigations throughout the former Yugoslavia.
	   Arbour had asked for visas for herself and 11 members of her
staff so that they could conduct on-site investigations and
interview witnesses. She vowed to continue investigating ``using
all means available to us,'' but did not elaborate.
	   Hundreds have been killed and hundreds of thousands made
homeless in seven months of fighting between Serb forces and
secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels in the southern Yugoslav
province of Kosovo. U.N. investigators want to check reports of
atrocities on both sides.
	   Kirk McDonald said she would report the non-issuance of visas to
the Security Council, which set up the tribunal in 1993, and urge
it to take ``forceful'' action to force Belgrade into line.
	   ``In the final analysis, it is clear to me that I have an
obligation, now that the prosecutor has reported non-compliance, to
bring this matter to the Security Council,'' Kirk McDonald said.
	   She said Belgrade's defiance of the tribunal amounted to ``a
challenge to the authority of the Security Council'' which has
ordered a tribunal investigation of alleged atrocities in Kosovo
and told Yugoslav authorities to cooperate.
	   The visa holdup prompted Kirk McDonald, of Texas, to cancel a
planned visit to Belgrade to speak to a conference on war crimes
trials.
	   ``This move by the Yugoslav government will have serious legal
consequences,'' said Natasa Kandic, chairwoman of the Humanitarian
Law Center organizing the conference.
	   ``With it, the Yugoslav government acted directly contrary to
the U.N. Security Council Resolution demanding free access to
international investigators to Kosovo,'' she said. ``Relations
between the tribunal and authorities here have now become strained
in the extreme.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. said Thursday
that quarterly profits fell by 56 percent as it suffered the
effects of depressed oil prices and the recession in the
Asia-Pacific region.
	   The Anglo-Dutch oil giant reported net income of dlrs 841
million, or 25 cents a share, for the three months ending Sept. 30,
compared with dlrs 1.9 billion, or 60 cents per share, in the same
period a year earlier.
	   Oil industry analysts said that although they were expecting
profits to be substantially down, the earnings were worse than
observers had predicted.
	   Alan Marshall, an oil analyst for Robert Flemming Securities,
said that even though the oil market is weak, the results are
``unexpectedly poor'' when compared those reported by competitors
this quarter.
	   ``Exxon, which is the closest comparable, was 23 percent down.
This is more than twice as bad,'' he said. ``They've got a bit of
explaining to do.''
	   He said he was expecting third quarter profits in the region of
dlrs 1.2 billion, on the lower end of the range analysts were
predicting before the results were released.
	   Shell Chairman Mark Moody-Stuart acknowledged that the results
were ``disappointing.''
	   ``I am sure we are going in the right direction,'' he said.
``But the environment we are working in, underlined by these
results, clearly shows that we have to move futher and faster than
we have been doing.''
	   He said the company was particularly disappointed in its
earnings in chemicals, and in gas and on-shore oil exploration and
production in the United States.

First OSCE observers to arrive in Kosovo on Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The first 46 verifiers of a
European-led mission of unarmed observers in Kosovo will arrive
next week, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said Thursday.
	   Mons Nyberg, the OSCE spokesman in Pristina, said 22 British
verifiers will arrive Monday and another 24 on Thursday.
	   The 46 will go to the southern city of Prizren to set up
operations there, Nyberg said.
	   The Kosovo Verification Mission, part of an Oct. 12 peace
agreement for Kosovo, isn't expected to be officially launched
before the second half of November. It will report on whether
Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic fully complies with the
provisions of the accord.
	   It will eventually absorb another observer mission _ the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission _ which began operating in July.
	   Nyberg said the British verifiers arriving next week will
initially be called KDOM observers because the Kosovo Verification
Mission is still being set up.

Cuban group files suit for genocide probe in Spain against Castro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Encouraged by the Pinochet case, a Cuban
exile group filed a suit before a Spanish court Thursday accusing
Fidel Castro of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   ``Spain's National Court has ruled that it is competent to
investigate crimes of genocide, terrorism and torture in the case
against Pinochet,'' said Guillermo Alonso Olarra, a lawyer for the
Miami-based Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba. ``This case is
identical.''
	   The foundation said the suit was inspired by a National Court
decision last week that gave Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon a green
light to try to bring former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to
trial for crimes committed during his 1973-90 regime.
	   Garzon had Pinochet arrested in London last month as a first
step toward his extradition. The case is pending in Britain's House
of Lords after a court there ruled that Pinochet was entitled to
immunity as a former head of state.
	   Alonso said they had submitted papers to Spain's National Court
detailing the cases of some 120 people who allegedly suffered
torture or other abuses by Castro's government, were executed or
died while in Cuban jails or in police custody.
	   The lawyers added that the suit also included the names of
18,000 people who they say were killed or disappeared in Cuba since
1959 when Castro took power.
	   ``Spain has opened the door to the victims of Argentina and
Chile,'' Clara Maria del Valle, vice president of the foundation,
told a press conference in Madrid. ``Today we come to knock on the
door of Spanish justice in the name of the victims the crimes of
Fidel Castro.''
	   Alonso said last week's Spanish court ruling accepted that the
definition of genocide could include ``the elimination of a social
group, which is the case in Cuba.''
	   Most of the 18,000 on the list are Cubans but there are also
several people of other nationality including North Americans and
Spaniards, Alonso said but was unable to give a precise breakdown.
	   The court is likely to name a judge to review the case by the
weekend who in turn should decide whether there is sufficient
evidence to warrant a formal probe within the next two weeks, said
Javier Barrilero, another lawyer for the foundation.
	   Earlier Thursday, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said the
``the case had no chance of succeeding'' given that Castro was a
head of state and entitled to diplomatic immunity.
	   Alongside Castro, those accused include his brother Raul, Cuban
Tourism Minister and former army commander Osmani Cienfuegos and
Carlos Amat, Cuba's ambassador in Geneva and also a former military
member.
	   Once case cited in suit was that of a raft carrying 72 Cuban
would-be exiles which was allegedly rammed by Cuban police boats on
July 13, 1994 leading to the drowning of 41 people, mostly women
and children.
	   ``I demand justice in my name and that of my son, for the murder
of our family, and the punishment of those to blame for this
massacre,'' a tearful 42-year-old Sergio Perodin told the press
conference.
	   He and another son survived the incident but he lost his wife
and his eldest boy.
	   The Foundation for Human Rights is part of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, a Miami-based group vehemently opposed to
Castro. It is well funded by Cuban exiles living in Florida and
politically influential both in that state and in Washington.

Officers transferred from province where crackdown occurred
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOHAG, Egypt (AP) _ Four police officers accused of taking part
in a police crackdown that followed the murder of two Christians in
southern Egypt were transferred to another town to ensure a fair
inquiry into their conduct, a news agency reported Thursday.
	   Egyptian human rights groups complained that as many as 1,200
people were arrested and many were tortured during the
investigation in El-Kusheh, a farming town 400 kilometers (245
miles) south of Cairo. They suggested that police hoped to find a
Christian suspect to avoid creating tension between the town's
Christians and Muslims.
	   The government has said only a handful were arrested as part of
a standard investigation and that no one was tortured.
	   The official Middle East News Agency quoted Interior Minister
Habib el-Adly as saying that he ordered their transfer to ``ensure
the impartiality of the investigation.'' He did not elaborate.
	   Police officials in Sohag, the provincial capital, said the four
officers were moved to another town in the province while an
inquiry was under way into their conduct during the investigation.
	   Meanwhile, 2,000 prominent Egyptian Christians issued a
statement Thursday denying charges that the community is
mistreated.
	   ``If there have been some peripheral cases about mistreatment of
(Christians) in Egypt, then they are isolated and cannot be
considered government policy,'' they said in a statement carried by
the news agency.

Sri Lanka increases taxes and cigarette, liquor prices to raise
</HEADLINE>
money for war &QL; 
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's government raised taxes
and increased the prices of cigarettes and liquor Thursday to
finance spiraling spending on the country's civil war.
	   ``The economy continues to be strained by the war, which has
claimed a substantial increase in defense expenditure,'' Deputy
Finance Minister Lakshman Peiris told parliament, while presenting
the annual budget.
	   Peiris said defense spending is estimated to be 47 billion
rupees (dlrs 712 million) or about five percent of the country's
gross domestic product next year.
	   Although this is down from this year's 56.9 billion rupees (dlrs
862 million), the government has always overshot expenditure on the
war and had to ask parliament for more money later in the year.
	   ``It is not possible to finance such a large expenditure without
making sacrifices in terms of growth, employment and cost of
living,'' Peiris said.
	   The war against Tamil rebels fighting for a homeland in the
northeast of the island is now in its 16th year, and has been at a
stalemate for more than a year, with both sides exhausted after
ferocious battles.
	   The country's National Security Levy, which is a special war tax
on transactions of most goods and services, will be increased from
4.5 percent to 5.5 percent, said Peiris. Other increases include 10
percent tax on liquor sales, a fifty Sri Lankan cents (0.75 U.S.
cents) increase on every cigarette, and postal rates from 2.50
rupees (dlrs 3.78 U.S. cents) to 3.50 rupees (5.3 U.S. cents).
	   The budget deficit for 1999 is expected to be six percent of
GDP, down from 7.8 percent this year, said Peiris.

Egypt accuses Israel of procrastination after Arafat talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Israel-Palestinians

<TEXT>
	   SHARM EL-SHEIK, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt accused Israel of delaying
the implementation of the Wye River Memorandum after President
Hosni Mubarak met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat here Thursday.
	   Arafat and Mubarak discussed last month's Israeli-Palestinian
accord for 90 minutes in this Red Sea resort. Neither leader spoke
to reporters afterwards, but Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
later held an impromptu press conference.
	   Arab states are now waiting to see whether ``Israel, in
particular, (will implement the accord) because it is the party
that has procrastinated and still does,'' Moussa said.
	   In recent days, the Palestinians have accused Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of finding excuses to delay fulfilling
the agreement, which has a 12-week timetable for implementation.
Israel has accused Arafat's Palestinian Authority of failing to
pursue extremists with sufficient vigor.
	   ``It was clear that as Arafat briefed Mubarak that he has
reached the end of the road as far as other steps are concerned,''
Moussa said of the discussions. The meeting was Arafat's first with
Mubarak since the accord was signed on Oct. 23.
	   If Netanyahu were to ``insist on more security measures, this
means returning to square one because it would be a breach of the
agreement,'' Moussa added.
	   As part of the peace accord, Israel has pledged to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian steps to
improve Israeli security.

 &UR; US Defense Secretary in Gulf lobbying for action against Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cohen in the UAE, comments by Omani leader, ADDS

 &UR; By THOMAS HUSSAIN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen met with the leaders of Oman and the United Arab
Emirates Thursday to press for support for possible strikes against
Iraq, but he appeared to gain little backing.
	   In Oman, Cohen met with Sultan Qaboos, who said he opposed any
unilateral U.S. strike against Iraq.
	   ``The issue must be handled through the United Nations,'' Qaboos
said, according to Omani officials. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Cohen earlier visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.
	   At least publicly, there appears to be little support for any
U.S. military action against Iraq.
	   ``We see no reason to provoke a crisis with Iraq other than to
distract attention from the president's personal problems,'' the
Dubai-based Al-Bayan newspaper said in an editorial.
	   Reflecting the feeling in the Arab world that Washington is
tough on Iraq and soft on Israel, Egypt's Al-Akhbar said that ``the
giant United States has become a lion before Iraq but an ostrich
and a helpless rat before Israel.''
	   ``Can the United States imagine that there is a country, whether
Arab or not, except its subservient Britain, which can say `yes' to
striking Iraq?'' Al-Akhbar, a state-owned newspaper, asked in a
front-page editorial.
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to try and force Baghdad to rescind its Saturday
decision to end cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. The U.N.
Security Council has condemned the Iraqi decision.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.
	   It is not clear, however, whether the United States' Gulf allies
would allow the use of bases on their territory.
	   On Tuesday, a Saudi official said King Fahd told the defense
secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks
on Iraq.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   But the Pentagon said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq.
	   During the standoff between Iraq and the U.N. over weapons
inspectors in February, Kuwait was the only Arab state that opened
its air bases to U.S. and British warplanes.
	   Cohen earlier visited Bahrain and Kuwait.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus
discussed bilateral political and economic issues with Ukrainian
leaders on Thursday, saying his country views Ukraine as a ``very
important neighbor.''
	   ``Today we are speaking of a unified Europe, and we all have a
place in that Europe,'' Adamkus said.
	   In talks with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, Prime Minister
Valery Pustovoitenko and Foreign Minister Borys Tarasiuk, the sides
focused on strengthening economic ties, including more effective
implementation of a 1995 bilateral free trade agreement.
	   The economic crisis in Russia, Ukraine's main trade partner, is
forcing Kiev to look more actively for other partners,
Pustovoitenko noted.
	   The turmoil in Russia and steps taken by both countries to
minimize its effects on their economies also figured prominently in
Adamkus' talks with Kuchma, said presidential spokesman Oleksandr
Martynenko.
	   The sides also discussed Ukraine's closer cooperation with other
Baltic states, including construction of new transport routes from
the Baltic region to the Black Sea.
	   Adamkus called Ukraine a ``very important neighbor.''
	   Accompanying Adamkus is a large delegation of Lithuanian
businessmen, who were to discuss with Ukrainian entrepreneurs the
creation of new joint ventures and new investment projects.
	   Ukraine was Lithuania's fourth largest trade partner in 1997,
and the trade turnover between the two former Soviet republics was
dlrs 275 million in the first nine months of 1998, the Interfax
news agency said.
	   On Friday, Adamkus will visit the western Ukrainian city of
Lviv.

U.S. Embassy imposes new regulations for visas through banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Cairo will require
Egyptians seeking American visas to apply through a local bank and
not the consulate, an embassy spokeswoman said Thursday.
	   Applications and fees will be handled by branches of the
Commercial International Bank, the spokeswoman said.
	   She said the measures, believed to be the first by an American
mission abroad, were taken ``to facilitate'' processing increasing
numbers of applications for U.S. visas.
	   She said the consulate will still process the applications. The
measure will take effect on Nov. 15.
	   Egyptian security officials said the move was apparently taken
for security reasons to avoid crowding at the embassy building.
	   Tight security was imposed on the building in downtown Cairo
after the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in
August.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ International conventions outlawing genocide and
other crimes against humanity mean that Gen. Augusto Pinochet
should face trial for human rights abuses committed during his
17-year tenure as Chile's dictator, lawyers argued Thursday.
	   ``Torture and other serious crimes against humanity have been
well-established as crimes in international law throughout the '70s
and '80s, and indeed earlier than that,'' said Christopher
Greenwood, a lawyer representing a Spanish magistrate, British
prosecutors and the Spanish government.
	   On the second day of Pinochet's appeal of a High Court finding
that his Oct. 16 arrest on a Spanish warrant was illegal, lawyers
continued arguing that Pinochet should not be granted immunity
because of his status as a former head of state.
	   England's 1978 State Immunity Act, under which the High Court
quashed Pinochet's arrest last week, should be superseded by
international conventions that Britain has signed onto, the lawyers
said.
	   On Wednesday, the five judges hearing the case in Britain's
highest court, Parliament's House of Lords, overruled objections
from Pinochet's lawyers and agreed to hear new arguments that
prosecutors did not raise at the High Court hearing.
	   The prosecutors will attempt to throw doubt on whether Pinochet
was actually head of state throughout his rule, particularly in the
first violent hours after he seized power on Sept. 11, 1973, and
whether international law now calls for anyone accused of genocide,
torture and kidnapping to face a court.
	   The present Chilean government says some 3,000 political
opponents were killed or disappeared during the years Pincohet held
power after ousting President Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   ``Our argument can be put in one sentence,'' said lawyer Alun
Jones, arguing against the High Court ruling. ``It is no part of
the functions of a head of state recognized by English or
international law to behave like that.''
	   Jones also argued that even if Pinochet has immunity for
tortures and killings carried out in Chile by DINA, his secret
police, he remained legally responsible for killings of opponents
in other countries, including Spain, Italy, and the United States.
	   The son of Allende's foreign minister, Orlando Letelier, killed
in a 1976 car bombing in Washington, is among a delegation of
Chilean lawmakers and human rights activists now in London
highlighting human rights abuses committed under Pinochet.
	   The hearing in the House of Lords, originally scheduled to end
Thursday, was expected to last until Monday. The Lords, who do not
sit on Fridays, may not decide the case immediately.
	   Pinochet, who underwent back surgery Oct. 9, remains under
police guard in a north London hospital.
	   Pablo Longueira, a Chilean congressman who is president of the
right-wing Independent Democratic Union, told Radio Agricultura of
Santiago that he met with the general for several hours Wednesday.
	   ``He is confident that justice will be made and he will be able
to return to Chile,'' Longueira said. He added that Pinochet
``walked three or four times, although with a great effort.''
	   In Chile, the government said Wednesday that if Pinochet
returns, he should quit politics totally and ask for forgiveness.
Pinochet has had immunity from prosecution in Chile as a
senator-for-life and under laws he initiated.

Egypt accuses Israel of procrastination after Arafat talks

<TEXT>
	   SHARM EL-SHEIK, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt accused Israel of delaying
the implementation of the Wye River Memorandum after President
Hosni Mubarak met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat here Thursday.
	   Arafat and Mubarak discussed last month's Israeli-Palestinian
accord for 90 minutes in this Red Sea resort. Neither leader spoke
to reporters afterwards, but Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
later held an impromptu press conference.
	   Arab states are now waiting to see whether ``Israel, in
particular, (will implement the accord) because it is the party
that has procrastinated and still does,'' Moussa said.
	   In recent days, the Palestinians have accused Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of finding excuses to delay fulfilling
the agreement, which has a 12-week timetable for implementation.
Israel has accused Arafat's Palestinian Authority of failing to
pursue extremists with sufficient vigor.
	   ``It was clear that as Arafat briefed Mubarak that he has
reached the end of the road as far as other steps are concerned,''
Moussa said of the discussions. The meeting was Arafat's second
with Mubarak since the accord was signed on Oct. 23.
	   If Netanyahu were to ``insist on more security measures, this
means returning to square one because it would be a breach of the
agreement,'' Moussa added.
	   As part of the peace accord, Israel has pledged to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian steps to
improve Israeli security.

Lebanon hopes U.N. will deter Israel on alleged soil theft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon hopes U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan will act on its charges that Israel is removing soil from
southern Lebanon, Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Thursday.
	   ``If he could not deter Israel from stealing Lebanese soil, he
will then definitely call for a Security Council meeting on this
subject,'' Bweiz told a news conference.
	   Last week, Bweiz and Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri sent
letters to Annan, the European Union and Arab League
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid urging them to intervene to
stop Israel from taking top soil from southern Lebanon.
	   Local newspapers reported last week that Israeli trucks were
carrying soil from the al-Marj area in the occupied zone to
northern Israel. Lebanese soil is said to be richer.
	   The Israeli government coordinator for south Lebanon, Uri
Lubrani, has dismissed the report as ``nonsense.''

Cologne court dismisses Telekom suit on competitors' access
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ An administrative court in Cologne Thursday
dismissed a Deutsche Telekom lawsuit, which the former monopolist
filed to prevent its competitors from gaining unbundled access to
end-user lines.
	   Telekom argued that its competitors' access to the lines
shouldn't be unbundled, or unrestricted, but should be tied to
additional services, such as online services, that Telekom offers
its customers.
	   On Nov. 30, Germany's telecommunications regulatory authority
will make a final decision on how much Telekom will be allowed to
charge its rivals for unbundled access, opening up the market for
local calls to competition.
	   Since the Jan. 1 liberalization of Germany's telecommunications
market, private operators have snatched between 20 and 30 percent
of Telekom's business for long-distance and overseas calls.
	   However, private operators have largely shied away from entering
the local telephone market due to regulatory uncertainties.
	   The German regulator has set a provisional rate of 20.65 marks
(dlrs 12.44) per month that private operators will have to pay for
unbundled access to a customer's lines.
	   Telekom's last price proposal for unrestricted access was about
47 marks (dlrs 28.31) per month, with private operators suggesting
a rate of about 13 marks (dlrs 7.83) was reasonable.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ New guidelines to clamp down on doping at the Tour
de France were announced Thursday, with the event's director,
Jean-Marie Leblanc warning: ``It's either ethics _ or chaos.''
	   After announcing the schedule for the 1999 race, organizers
unveiled a four-point plan to combat drug abuse. Leblanc said from
now on ``a medical code of ethics will fix the code of conduct.''
	   _ Tour de France organizers reserve the right to challenge any
rider or team which could undermine the Tour's reputation, notably
through doping.
	   _ The organizers reserve the right to immediately exclude any
rider or entire team, notably for doping.
	   _ The organizers will challenge any team failing to adhere to
codes of good conduct drawn up by the sport's authorities and

	   _ Cyclists will have to undergo medical tests on the day before
the race begins. The tests will be independent, carried out under
the aegis of the French Sports Ministry.
	   At first, infractions will be hit with six-month bans, but the
sanctions will soon be reviewed, organizers said.
	   ``Doping is the biggest and sole enemy of sport,'' Jean-Claude
Killy, president and director general of the Tour, said after
announcing the guidelines.
	   ``Several riders didn't realize the gravity of taking
drugs....from now on, they can no longer say they didn't know,'' he
added.
	   Leblanc said cycling, ``must undergo a moral revolution _ or
disappear.''

Postal workers strike to protest plans to streamline service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Postal workers went on a one-day
nationwide strike Thursday to protest government plans to
restructure the service to cut costs and make it more efficient.
	   Post office employees were protesting the socialist government's
decision to exclude some key provisions from a parliamentary bill
designed to streamline the moribund state service. The bill has yet
to be discussed in parliament.
	   Premier Costas Simitis has been seeking to restructure and
streamline various state enterprises in order to cut costs and
ensure Greek membership in European monetary union. They include
Olympic Airways, the post office, public buses and the national
railroad.

Security Council resolution condemns Iraq, but doesn't threaten
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A final draft of a Security Council
resolution condemns Iraq and demands that it resume cooperation
with U.N. arms inspectors, but threatens no explicit force if Iraq
ignores the demand.
	   The United States and Britain say they already have
authorization to take military action against Iraq from previous
council resolutions, and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen is
touring Gulf states to try to muster support for a united stand
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   The resolution, which could be adopted Thursday afternoon, puts
into international law the council's statement Saturday that
condemned Iraq's decision Saturday to halt cooperation with
inspectors as a ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. demands.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction before the council will lift 8-year-old
sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait.
	   Council members on Wednesday added a new element to the draft
that appeared to address Iraqi concerns about the council's
willingness to consider lifting the oil embargo, once U.N.
inspectors have declared Iraq is disarmed.
	   It wasn't clear, however, if that vague reference would be
enough for Iraq, which has demanded a time frame for when sanctions
would be lifted.
	   ``Iraq shall not rescind its decision unless the council meets
its legitimate and just demands,'' the newspaper of the ruling
Baath Party, Al-Thawra, said Thursday.
	   If the resolution does not ``look positively and fairly at
Iraq's right to have the sanctions lifted'' it will be rejected by
Baghdad, said al-Thawra, which expresses government views.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, suggested Wednesday that
Baghdad could reconsider its Saturday decision to halt cooperation
with inspectors if it got some indication from the council that
sanctions could be eased.
	   ``I think that would give us enough assurances'' to reverse the
decision, Hamdoon said.
	   The United States has prevented the council from giving Baghdad
those explicit assurances. But U.S. officials said Wednesday they
could go along with the revised draft resolution, which reaffirmed
the council's willingness to take up the matter of the duration of
the embargo.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh praised the resolution as
good and strong in condemning Baghdad.
	   While it doesn't threaten any force, the resolution notes past
council resolutions that threatened Iraq with the ``severest
consequences'' if it failed to allow inspectors unfettered access
to suspected weapons sites.
	   Russia, which is against using force, noted that the resolution
doesn't give the United States or anyone else a green light for
military action.

Buyers snap up Titanic memorabilia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A pair of menus from the doomed Titanic sold for
19,550 pounds (dlrs 32,275) at Christie's auctioneers Thursday,
exceeding pre-sale estimates by sixfold.
	   The pre-voyage menus, bought by an undisclosed American buyer,
were just one lot in a sale of maritime memorabilia that included a
letter written on the boat by the wife of a passenger who died
during the ill-fated trip.
	   The letter fetched 9,775 pounds (dlrs 16,128), a price that also
was six times higher than expected.
	   One collector who bought a first-class brochure for the Titanic
for 6,900 pounds (dlrs 11,385) described the prices as ``auction
fever.''
	   Gavin Littaur, a postal historian whose Titanic collection was
seen by actress Kate Winslet before she went to Mexico to film the
Hollywood blockbuster, also bought newspaper reports of the
disaster for 1,955 pounds (dlrs 3,225).
	   The Titanic sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg on its maiden
voyage from Southampton, England, to New York. More than 1,500
people died.
	   Other items in the auction included a watch given by passenger
Albert Caldwell to a crew member to ensure places on a lifeboat for
him, his wife and son.
	   A fragment from a Titanic life-belt fetched 6,900 pounds (dlrs
11,385).
	   A total of 17 items fetched 72,749 pounds (dlrs 120,035).

ETA says cease-fire could become permanent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reactions to statement from government and Herri
Batasuna, ADDS background &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA said
Thursday its six-week-old cease-fire could be made definitive
depending on unspecified developments in the near future.
	   ETA's statement, published in the radical newspaper Euskadi
Informacion, said ``events and progress in the coming days'' would
shape the ``definitive nature of the cease-fire.'' It gave no
details as to what those developments might be.
	   The statement came two days after the conservative government of
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar proposed talks to resolve the
conflict in what was his administration's first move towards ETA
since the cease-fire.
	   However, the fact that ETA's statement was written before the
government's initiative prompted deputy premier Francisco Alvarez
Cascos to dismiss it as ``out of date.''
	   On Tuesday, Aznar authorized contacts with organizations linked
to what is referred to in Spain as ``ETA's World,'' and late
Wednesday his spokesman Josep Pique said the government was seeking
direct talks with the gunmen.
	   ``The next move must be made by ETA,'' Cascos told national
radio, stressing that the government had already done its bit to
ensure progress by seeking dialogue.
	   In its statement ETA backed the so-called Lizarra Agreement
signed in early September by a group of Basque political parties
which proposed talks between ETA and the government but also
all-party negotiations on the political future of the troubled
region.
	   The ETA statement said the government said the majority of the
votes cast in October's Basque regional elections went to parties
that signed the agreement, calling on the governm had
	   So far the government has restricted its talks offer to an
exploration of ETA's willingness to give up violence for good.
	   Kai Saez, a spokesman for the Herri Batasuna party frequently
referred to as ETA's political wing, said the government's proposal
to talk directly to ETA was positive, but it had yet to be
complemented with a commitment to define a forum for talks on the
political roots of the conflict.
	   ``If the peace process is thought of as a 100-meter long road,
we have advanced about a meter,'' he said.

brawl &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Thirteen drunken American sailors were
detained in Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odessa following a street
fight at the end of NATO-led international naval maneuvers,
newspapers said Thursday.
	   Police seized the servicemen from USS Stamp before dawn
Wednesday after residents called a local law enforcement department
about a brawl on Odessa's Shevchenko street, a main thoroughfare.
	   It was not clear who started the fight, but only American
sailors were involved, according to the Ukrainian newspapers
Segodnya, Fakty and Dyen.
	   The sailors were part of a U.S. force that participated in the
NATO-led, 11-nation Sea Breeze '98 peacekeeping exercise, which
ended Wednesday.
	   Police questioned the sailors and released them to the American
forces' command, the reports said.
	   A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, Ukraine's capital, told
The Associated Press that the embassy had no information about the
incident.

	   PARIS (AP) _ In a tight match between two players trying to
qualify for the ATP World Championship, Yevgeny Kafelnikov saved a
match point before beating Tim Henman 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-2)
Thursday at the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open.
	   After taking the first set and leading 4-2 in the second, the
big-serving Russian, seeded No. 8, lost the second set to a
determined Henman, the No. 1 British player.
	   In the third set, the ninth-seeded Henman led 5-1. But despite
serving three aces and reaching match point at 5-4, the Briton
couldn't finish off Kafelnikov, who won the decisive tiebreaker.
	   The match was made more important by Richard Krajicek's knee
injury Wednesday.
	   The Dutchman had been competing with Kafelnikov and Henman to
finish in the top eight _ and thereby qualify for the world
championship in Hanover. But he has now ruled himself out of the
event.
	   Henman said he'd been ``outclassed for most of the first two
sets. But I got a chance and took it and played great in the
third.''
	   ``The damage was done at the 5-2 game. I played a couple of
loose points early on and that's a break of serve gone and his
motivation was right back.''
	   Kafelnikov agreed that the match turned when Henman failed to
hold serve at 5-2 in the final set.
	   ``At 5-1 down I thought I would go off the court a loser. When I
broke back, I thought I would win the match,'' he said.
	   But the Russian was upset that Henman didn't apologize for
several fortunate net cords in the final set.
	   ``I got so frustrated, maybe I said something bad to him at the
changeover,'' Kafelnikov said. ``I got so mad I didn't know where I
was. When you go on the court you should respect each other.''
	   In another third-round match, No. 2 seed Marcelo Rios had two
tough sets against Vincent Spadea, but won 7-5, 6-4.
	   Mark Philippoussis of Australia continued his fine form, beating
No. 7 seed Karol Kucera 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Orphans sang ``I believe in Angels''
as Prince Charles visited an 18th-century Orthodox monastery
Thursday in downtown Bucharest.
	   A choir of 15 Romanian orphans sang a rendition of Abba's ``I
have a dream.'' Charles stopped to chat with them, asking them
about their hopes for the future.
	   ``I want to be a painter or a tailor,'' said Florina Vlad, 17,
saying she was happy that her life as a homeless child on the
streets had ended recently when a charity bought an apartment for a
group of kids without homes and families.
	   Charles is on a week-long tour of Eastern Europe. Earlier, in a
village near Bucharest, he shook hands with disabled Romanians and
listened how they construct their own wheelchairs.
	   As Charles stepped into the recently restored 18th-century
Stavropoleus monastery, the only one in Bucharest, nuns and priests
hovered at the entrance.
	   Hundreds of ordinary people pressed to get a glimpse of the son
of Queen Elizabeth II shouting ``We love you'' in English, and
``Charles, Charles.'' When he exited from viewing frescoes of
angels, people tried to touch him. For ten minutes, he shook hands
and spoke to people.
	   On his earlier visit to a wheelchair foundation, Charles played
basketball and pool and spoke to young disabled Romanians,
delighted that a British royal had come to visit.
	   ``It is a very moving gesture for us, because usually all the
other people avoid us or forget we exist,'' said Gheorghe Filip,
27, who has been forced to use a wheelchair since a truck hit his
bicycle five years ago.

Cuba, Russia, 10 others advance to quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Defending champion Cuba, host Japan, Russia and
South Korea led 12 teams into the quarterfinal round Thursday in
the Women's World Volleyball Championships.
	   All four stayed unbeaten through the preliminary round in four
groups of four teams each, and Japan and Russia didn't lose a set.
	   Cuba, also the Olympic gold medalist, lost only one set in its
three Group B games, finishing up Thursday with a 15-7, 15-9, 15-11
victory over Italy.
	   Joining Cuba in one quarterfinal group will be South Korea,
Italy, Bulgaria, China and Croatia.
	   With Japan and Russia in the other are the Netherlands, Peru,
Brazil and the Dominican Republic.
	   Four winless teams _ Kenya, the United States, Germany and
Thailand _ failed to advance to the next round, scheduled Saturday
through Monday.
	   In Thursday's other group B match, Bulgaria scored its first
victory, beating the United States 15-3, 15-7, 15-13.
	   Japan, cheered on by drum-beating home fans in Tokyo, took 85
minutes to beat the Netherlands 15-9, 15-12, 15-6 in their duel for
the top place in Group A.
	   ``Our right attacker (Hitomi) Mitsunaga scored quite a few vital
points and both centers also did a good job,'' said Japan's head
coach Nobuchika Kuzuwa.
	   Dutch coach Pierre Mathieu said of the loss: ``It was a bad
game, that's all. We just didn't play well.''
	   Peru edged Kenya for Group A's other quarterfinal round berth
15-9, 13-15, 6-15, 15-13, 15-10.
	   In Group C, Russia beat the Dominican Republic 15-3, 15-8, 15-1,
while Brazil defeated Germany 15-1, 15-4, 15-3.
	   In a duel of more than two hours, South Korea came out atop
Group D by handing China its first loss, 15-13, 17-15, 6-15, 10-15,
15-9.
	   ``The Koreans played excellent,'' said Chinese coach Lang Ping.
``We played not well in the first two sets and we had no luck in
the fifth set. But the level of this match was very good.''
	   Croatia beat Thailand 15-9, 15-13, 15-10 for Group D's third
berth in the next round.

Bank of England cuts interest rates by 0.5 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from finance chief in graf 7; no PICKUP &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Bank of England cut interest rates by 0.5
percent Thursday, the first time the independent bank has cut rates
by more than 0.25 percent.
	   The cut, which brings the rate at which the bank lends to other
banks down to 6.75 percent, follows a drop of 0.25 percent last
month, and came after business leaders urged a substantial cut to
stave off recession.
	   The bank said the cut in the so-called repo rate was needed to
hit its 2.5 percent inflation target and that news about
international economic conditions had prompted it to moderate its
growth forecasts for next year and downgrade its projection for
inflation over the next two years.
	   The move was welcomed by business leaders and hailed as
``brave'' by analysts, while mortgage companies immediately moved
to cut lending rates by the same amount.
	   Kate Barker, chief economic adviser for the Confederation of
British Industry, said that as inflationary pressures eased there
should be scope for further reductions in the coming months.
	   ``Business will welcome this decision as the right response to
our warnings on the increasing risk of a U.K. recession,'' she
said. ``Similar cuts are still likely to be necessary in the months
ahead if we are to head off the dangers of recession next year.''
	   Britain's finance chief, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
Brown, also welcomed the move, saying it showed Britain is steering
a course of stability.''
	   Shares jumped on the news, only to fall back later as dealers
digested the bank's comments and concluded that further cuts were
now unlikely.
	   But the cut would not save the economy single-handedly, with the
global financial crisis far from over, said Julian Jessop,
economist at Nikko Europe.
	   Geoffrey Dicks, economist at Greenwich NatWest said that while
he welcomes the break with precedent in the face of international
economic turmoil, rates still need to come down to about 6 percent.

Remaining West Indies cricket players want to leave South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Seven remaining West Indies cricket
players want to leave South Africa on Thursday, a move that would
scuttle plans for a long-awaited series here, officials said.
	   ``The situation is very serious. The players are keen to return
to London this evening,'' said Ali Bacher, managing director of the
United Cricket Board of South Africa, on Thursday.
	   Only seven of the team's 16 players arrived in Johannesburg on
Wednesday. The rest defied the West Indies Cricket Board's order to
travel to South Africa because of a money dispute with the board,
and remained in London to discuss their demands.
	   The West Indies board on Wednesday fired Brian Lara as team
captain and Carl Hooper as deputy for the three-month tour of South
Africa, which begins Tuesday. Lara and Hooper were in London.
	   It is the West Indies' first official tour of South Africa.
	   West Indies team manager Clive Lloyd said Thursday in
Johannesburg that the seven players have been discussing the idea
of leaving for ``a couple'' of days, the South African Press
Association reported.
	   ``It is one of many things that have been discussed,'' Lloyd
said. ``But hopefully we will still be able to sort everything
out.''
	   Bacher said the problem must be resolved for the sake of world
cricket, not just the two-nation competition.
	   He said he was awaiting a statement from the West Indies board
and had talked by telephone with Curtly Ambrose, another senior
player holed up in London.
	   ``There is definitely an impasse,'' Bacher said.
	   The West Indies board's decision to demote Lara and Hooper
provoked protest in Barbados, where callers to a radio show called
the actions draconian and demanded the board resign or be fired.
	   The rebel players are demanding above their tour fees for
one-day internationals and for a one-week training camp; increased
meal allowances; and some guarantee of security in crime-ridden
Johannesburg, where two Pakistani players were mugged while on tour
last year.
	   The team had a 15-year winning streak after the last major
financial dispute in the late 1970s that netted players better
contracts.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine officials summoned China's
ambassador Thursday to protest the presence of Chinese military
ships off a South China Sea reef claimed by both countries.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the ships, equipped with
guns, were renovating Chinese structures on Mischief Reef in the
disputed Spratly Islands. He said the actions were a violation of
an agreement to refrain from hostile activities while territorial
disputes are discussed.
	   ``This is a provocative action on the part of the Chinese,''
Mercado told a news conference. He said the Chinese activity was a
``potential security threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the
Philippines.''
	   He presented photographs taken from Philippine air force
reconnaissance planes of the Chinese ships off the reef, 215 miles
(345 kilometers) from the western Philippine island of Palawan.
	   President Joseph Estrada ordered officials to file a diplomatic
note with China to protest the Chinese actions, his spokesman said.
	   Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Leonides Caday later handed
the note to Chinese Ambassador Guan Dengming, who was summoned to
the Department of Foreign Affairs.
	   In a statement, the Chinese Embassy said it is China's sovereign
right to reinforce the structures because they had been damaged by
natural forces and were endangering the lives of Chinese staff
based on the reef.
	   It said the reinforcements were being done to the original
facility ``and it serves completely the purpose of peaceful use.''
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, however, said the Chinese
activities would ``create another ripple on our relations with
China,'' and that the Philippines would insist the Chinese
structures be dismantled.
	   He said the issue may be discussed between either him and his
Chinese counterpart or Estrada and Chinese President Jiang Zemin on
the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Malaysia this month.
	   The Philippines protested in 1995 when China built concrete
platforms on Mischief Reef, one of several areas in the Spratlys
claimed by both Manila and Beijing.
	   China said the platforms were shelters for fishermen but the
Manila government said they could be used militarily.
	   China's behavior caused suspicion among countries in the region
that it might be trying to gradually seize the Spratlys, which are
believed to lie atop vast deposits of oil, minerals and natural
gas.
	   Siazon said the Philippine ambassador in Beijing, Romualdo Ong,
was notified on Oct. 15 by Chinese officials that they planned to
renovate the platforms on Mischief Reef.
	   Even with such notification, China still violated an agreement
signed in 1995 forbidding such renovations and massive military
presence or movement in contested Spratlys areas, he said.
	   Mercado said the Chinese vessels entered the area Oct. 28 and
included large military cargo and supply ships with helipads to be
used in transporting construction materials to the reef.
	   He said Philippine military planes were carefully monitoring
Chinese activities in the reef but there was no need to send troops
to the area.
	   In 1992, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations issued a
statement advocating a peaceful resolution of the territorial
disputes.
	   A visit by Jiang to Manila in 1995 helped ease strains caused by
China's structures at Mischief Reef, but subsequent incidents have
strained relations again.
	   The Spratly Islands are also claimed in whole or in part by
Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei.

Bomb rips through market wounding 15 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A powerful bomb ripped through a crowded
market in a small town in eastern Punjab province Thursday, while
nearby 200,000 orthodox Muslims held a conference, police said.
	   At least 15 people were seriously hurt in the explosion in
Muridke, some 10 kilometers (six miles) from the Punjab capital of
Lahore.
	   The blast was apparently caused by a homemade explosive device
hidden in a paper bag and left near a shop in the congested market,
police said.
	   Ambulance sirens screamed, and many resident helped transport
the wounded to hospitals in Lahore.
	   No one took responsibility for the explosion and police
officials refused to speculate.
	   Barely one kilometer (mile) from the explosion an orthodox
Islamic group known as Lashkar-e-Tayyaba was holding its annual
conference, with an estimated 200,000 participants.
	   The organization, which professes to have links with Islamic
militant groups worldwide, says several of its participants belong
to radical groups operating in countries like Egypt, Jordan and
Israel.
	   There was no indication that the explosion was linked to the
conference, and authorities said they still were investigating the
blast.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite increasing signs of a
political peace deal for Kosovo, tension smoldered Thursday
following a shootout between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said prospects for
peace in the troubled Serbian province _ though distant _ were
promising and there was progress toward a political solution.
	   Visiting Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, meanwhile, called
for a ``lasting democratic solution for Kosovo.''
	   The village of Priluzje, 20 kilometers (13 miles) northwest of
the provincial capital Pristina, came under small-arms fire for
several hours during the night but no one was injured, the Serb
Media Center reported.
	   The center, which carries official Serb views, said several
houses were damaged in the ensuing shootout, and blamed the attack
on ethnic Albanian extremists fighting for independence.
	   Although the report could not be independently confirmed, there
have been frequent reports of violence and gunfire exchanges since
last month's U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
	   Separately, Belgrade's independent B-92 radio reported that a
Serb policeman was taken off a passenger bus near Suva Reka by
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels, presumably kidnapped.
	   Tension on a different front was generated by a dispute between
Yugoslav authorities and the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
	   Chief Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald and other tribunal members
canceled a planned visit to Belgrade for an international war
crimes conference, complaining that the Yugoslav government had
refused to issue tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbor with a visa that
would enable her to visit Kosovo.
	   Arbour had planned to gather evidence on suspected atrocities
committed during the nearly eight-month crackdown on the armed
Albanian independence struggle in Kosovo that killed hundreds,
mostly ethnic Albanians, and made refugees of hundreds of
thousands.
	   The tribunal argues that it has been authorized by the U.N.
Security Council to investigate war crimes in all of Yugoslavia,
which includes Kosovo, an Albanian-majority province of Serbia,
Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
	   Serbian President Milutinovic arrived in Pristina on Thursday
and held talks with local Serb officials.
	   After his meetings, Milutinovic stressed that Albanian
``terrorism'' has been defeated and that it was time to turn to
political issues rather than armed conflicts.
	   ``We have passed the point when the problems in Kosovo were
treated exclusively as a security matter,'' Milutinovic was quoted
as saying by the state Tanjug news agency.
	   Serb police in Kosovo tightened security around a coal mine and
power plant outside Pristina following an attack Tuesday in which
three Serb coal mine workers were injured, the independent Beta
news agency reported.
	   Despite occasional skirmishes, NATO said Wednesday that a
cease-fire in Kosovo seems to be holding in the wake of an Oct. 12
agreement committing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to scale
back police and army forces in the province.
	   Hill's view of Kosovo on Thursday was relatively upbeat.
	   ``We have made some serious progress, not only in reducing
violence ... but also in coming around to a political solution that
would meet basic interests of the two sides,'' he said.
	   He said the aim of the U.S.-drafted agreement on Kosovo is to
``push the responsibility downwards to lower levels'' of authority,
and thus introduce democracy and protection of human rights in the
Serbian province.
	   ``We are very much on the road and moving ahead,'' he told
reporters. ``Both sides understand that the status quo is
unacceptable and that we have to move on.''
	   Albanians make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
population. As many as 300,000 ethnic Albanian civilians were
driven from their homes by Serb police and army forces.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency said Thursday roughly
150,000 displaced people remain in Kosovo but only a couple hundred
are still living in the open.

Honduras finds more victims, scope of disaster growing

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Hondurans buried more of their dead
and formed blocks-long lines to get rationed water and gasoline,
while officials struggled to feed and shelter a population in shock
from Hurricane Mitch.
	   Another huge task loomed: Accounting for the estimated 13,000
people missing after the storm rampaged across Central America.
	   Medical workers buried 13 flood victims in a common grave
Wednesday in Tegucigalpa, placing two wooden crosses among the
plastic-shrouded bodies before a bulldozer plowed earth over them.
	   Authorities have buried about 100 bodies in common graves in and
around the city since the storm struck last week. The victims,
recovered from receding floodwaters or found in debris, couldn't be
identified and posed a health threat, interim Mayor Nahum
Balladeres said.
	   The government estimates as many 6,500 people died, and up to 1
million are homeless. All told, officials say Hurricane Mitch
killed nearly 9,000 people in the region.
	   ``We really don't know what the numbers are. There are places we
haven't reached yet,'' said Col. Rene Osorio of Honduras' national
emergency committee.
	   A revived Tropical Storm Mitch plowed across the Gulf of Mexico
and hit southern Florida today with heavy rain, 55 mph (89 kph)
winds, flooding and tornadoes. Officials reported that buildings
were damaged and at least seven people suffered minor injuries.
	   The storm was expected to move over the state and out over the
Atlantic by this afternoon. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches (10 to
20 centimeters) were forecast.
	   While Honduran officials previously had estimated 7,000 dead,
President Carlos Flores said late Wednesday that 6,500 people were
confirmed dead and more than 11,000 were missing. Mitch destroyed
more than 60 percent of the nation's infrastructure, he said,
adding that the government was seeking aid from Europe and the
United States.
	   ``We have receded many years'' in terms of national development,
Flores said. ``The capital of the republic is in a precarious
condition.''
	   Fearing the spread of disease in overcrowded shelters, the
government announced plans today to vaccinate shelter refugees
against cholera.
	   The first foreign relief aid trickled in _ Hondurans in Texas
sent 15,000 pounds (6,800 kilos) of supplies Wednesday. Mexico sent
helicopters and the first of a promised 500 tons (450 metric tons)
of food, along with 500 soldiers to help in relief operations.
	   France said it will send 250 rescue workers, half of them
soldiers, to help out in Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and
Guatemala. The French navy also is sending a ship loaded with
construction materials, trucks and equipment to help reopen
communication lines.
	   Honduran roads sustained dlrs 2 billion in damage, nearly a
third of the country's gross domestic product and double the
government's budget, said Finance Minister Gabriela Nunez.
	   In northern Nicaragua, the grisly task of burying or burning
bodies continued in mudslides near the Casitas volcano where a
crater lake collapsed Friday. Two hundred more corpses were found
there Wednesday, boosting the confirmed death toll there to 1,568.
As many as 2,000 were feared dead.
	   More than 750,000 people lost their homes or possessions across
Nicaragua, and 1,804 are listed as missing nationwide.
	   Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman turned aid distribution over
to the Roman Catholic Church on Wednesday after government relief
efforts were heavily criticized. He also said he would ``respect
the will of local residents'' in deciding whether to declare the
Casitas area a national cemetery.
	   A magnitude-3.2 earthquake centered near the Casitas peak was
reported Wednesday, and lava flows from the nearby Cerro Negro
volcano appeared to have stopped. No injuries or damages were
reported from either incident.
	   At the base of the Casitas volcano, about two dozen people
marched along the Pan American Highway today pushing a 4-foot-tall
(1.2-meter) image of the Virgin of the Rosary on a wheel barrow.
The worshippers _ refugees staying at a school near Posoltega _
sang a hymn to the Virgin Mary.
	   ``We're doing this for those who have died and for those in
difficulty,'' said Felicita Calderon, 70. ``For those poor people
up there who couldn't get out.''
	   In Honduras, main highways connecting Tegucigalpa, a city of
800,000, to the rest of the country were cut, creating shortages of
gasoline, drinking water and food in the hard-hit capital. Without
gasoline, aid can't be delivered by truck. Nearly all aircraft are
being used in continuing searches for survivors.
	   ``The people's desperation is growing,'' said Andres Aguiriano
Duarte of the emergency committee.
	   Between Monday and late Wednesday, police said they had arrested
some 800 people _ most in the capital _ for violating an overnight
curfew imposed to prevent looting.
	   At Tegucigalpa's city morgue _ operating from a refrigerated
trailer after flooding swept through the morgue building _ anxious
residents awaited word of missing loved ones.
	   And along the banks of the Choluteca River, residents shoveled
muck from debris-packed homes and stores, trying to salvage
whatever they could. Bulldozers cleared mounds of rock, mud and
garbage from the streets.
	   All too often, there was nothing left to save.
	   ``How do we continue, without water, without food, without
sleep?'' said Yolanda Marvella Arraya, 35, who has spent the last
week outside on a soggy mattress next to the river since flooding
destroyed her home.
	   Faced with shortages of food and water, the U.S. Embassy in
Tegucigalpa let dependents of embassy personnel leave the country,
while the U.S. Peace Corps ordered its 207 members in Honduras out.
	   About 4,000 people crowded into a shelter Wednesday at a trade
school in Tegucigalpa. Sitting on mattresses, some mothers cried
silently, trying to hide their grief from their children.
	   ``I'm fighting to control my nerves,'' said Santos Antonio
Perez, 57, whose family of 10 was uprooted by the storm. ``I lost
all I have. This dress was given to me.''

U.N. says drug use in Europe, U.S. has dropped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Drug use in Western Europe and the United
States has dropped in recent years but problems persist worldwide
in the fight against drug use, the U.N. drug control czar said
Thursday.
	   Experts from 20 European countries gathered in Vienna for the
start of the two-day European Conference on Drug Prevention and
Policy to examine drug abuse prevention policy.
	   ``Of course, there are still serious drug problems in all parts
to the world,'' Pino Arlacchi said in his opening address.
	   He said international drug fighters are ``seeing positive
results from many years of hard work aimed at finding solutions to
the drug problem.''
	   In June, representatives from about 150 governments pledged at a
United Nations drug conference in New York to implement new
strategies and programs to considerably reduce drug demand by 2003.
	   Discussions Thursday stressed the need to develop a data bank of
information based on individual countries' most successful
strategies, and to fight global laundering of drug money.
	   Demand for drugs in the two largest consumer markets, the United
States and Western Europe, is less than half what it was during its
peak years in the 1960s and '70s, Arlacchi said.
	   Cocaine is still the biggest problem in the U.S. market, but the
number of abusers has dropped by more than two-thirds since the mid
1980s.
	   In Europe, heroin has been the main drug concern, accounting for
85-95 percent of all treatment cases and the overwhelming majority
of drug-related deaths. Here, too, recent data shows that use has
stabilized, Arlacchi said.
	   In Germany, both drug-related mortality and the number of new
heroin users has dropped by 30 percent since 1991. Both Switzerland
and Austria also showed 30 percent drops in the number of
drug-related deaths over the past four years.

After many delays, Cabinet meets to debate peace agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu saying he was confident of Cabinet
approval, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After several delays, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Thursday presented the land-for-security agreement
with the Palestinians to his Cabinet for approval and moved a step
closer to carrying out the accord.
	   Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others. The vote was not likely before Friday
or even Sunday, said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.
	   Asked whether he would begin the West Bank withdrawal on Nov.
16, as stipulated in the accord, he said it was up to the
Palestinians.
	   ``If they implement, we will implement. If they don't implement
it, we won't carry it out,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV's Channel Two
during a brief Cabinet recess called after seven hours of debate.
	   In an attempt to blunt the criticism of hard-liners, Netanyahu
told the Cabinet that Jewish settlers would be given a say in
deciding from what West Bank areas Israel would withdraw. However,
this will not hold up ratification, Bar-Illan said.
	   As part of the peace accord, Israel has pledged to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank over the next 12 weeks, in exchange for
Palestinian steps to improve Israeli security.
	   Netanyahu also told the ministers that he would only give 1
percent of the land in an additional pullback.
	   In the past week, Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet meeting three
times amid claims that the Palestinians had not completed their
anti-terror plan as promised.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
accused Netanyahu of trying to please hard-liners at the expense of
the Palestinians and the majority of Israelis who back the deal
negotiated last month at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   ``The government will approve the agreement, but it is being
delivered to the Israeli public as a bad and dangerous agreement,
with a negative atmosphere,'' Tibi told The Associated Press.
	   ``Is this the spirit that we wanted to emerge from the Wye River
talks?'' Tibi said.
	   The latest dispute centered on the fate of 30 Palestinians
suspected in the killings of nearly 100 Israelis.
	   Netanyahu demanded that he receive a time table for the arrest
of the wanted men before convening the Cabinet. Bar-Illan said
Israel received written assurances from the United States on the
issue late Wednesday, thus paving the way for the Cabinet meeting.
	   However, the Palestinians said they had not provided any new
assurances. Arafat said 12 of the wanted men were already in
detention, and that he would make an effort to round up the others.
	   A Palestinian police official said Thursday that in all, 14 were
in jail. Several of the suspects have been in Palestinian jails for
months or years, but Palestinian security officials in the past
refused to provide exact figures.
	   The acrimony over every detail of the accord highlighted the
need for close U.S. supervision. U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was
to arrive in the region Thursday to start watching implementation,
but his trip was moved up to the weekend.
	   While the dispute over the wanted men appeared to have been
settled, the next crisis already loomed on the horizon.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials have widely divergent views of
the procedure that will lead to the annulment of clauses in the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. The paragraph in
the peace agreement addressing the issue is vaguely worded,
allowing for somewhat different interpretations.
	   The agreement says members of the Palestine National Council,
along with those of other Palestinian organizations, will be
invited to a meeting in mid-December during which an Arafat letter
to U.S. President Bill Clinton concerning the revoking of the
offending clauses will be reaffirmed.
	   The PLO charter itself says it can only be amended by a vote of
two-thirds of the PNC members, but the agreement does not
specifically refer to holding a vote or a required majority.
	   Israel says the charter must be annulled with a vote by the PNC,
not by affirmation. ``Okay, so you can say, what does it mean for a
body to affirm?'' Netanyahu said. ``Will it affirm by stomping feet
or nodding heads? Of course not. There will be a vote.''
	   ``And if not, we simply won't give them the territory,'' he
said.

Cuban group files suit for genocide probe in Spain against Castro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Cuban exile group accused Fidel Castro of
genocide, terrorism and torture in a suit filed Thursday in Spain,
citing the efforts of a Spanish judge to try Chile's former
dictator for human rights abuses.
	   The Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba said it filed suit after
last week's National Court allowed a Spanish judge to try to bring
former Gen. Augusto Pinochet to trial for crimes committed during
his 1973-90 regime.
	   ``Spain's National Court has ruled that it is competent to
investigate crimes of genocide, terrorism and torture in the case
against Pinochet,'' said Guillermo Alonso Olarra, a lawyer for the
Miami-based exile group. ``This case is identical.''
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon had Pinochet arrested last month in London
as a first step toward his extradition. A court there ruled that
Pinochet was entitled to immunity as a former head of state, but
the case is pending before Britain's House of Lords.
	   Alonso said they had submitted papers to Spain's National Court
detailing cases of some 120 people who were allegedly tortured,
executed died while in Cuban jails or in police custody.
	   The lawyers added that the suit also contained the names of
18,000 people allegedly killed or disappeared in Cuba since Castro
took power in 1959. Most of the 18,000 on the list are Cubans but
there are also several North Americans and Spaniards, Alonso said.
	   ``Spain has opened the door to the victims of Argentina and
Chile,'' said Clara Maria del Valle, vice president of the
foundation. ``Today we come to knock on the door of Spanish justice
in the name of the victims the crimes of Fidel Castro.''
	   The court is likely to name a judge to review the case by the
weekend and decide whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant
a formal probe within the next two weeks, said Javier Barrilero,
another lawyer for the foundation.
	   Earlier Thursday, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said the
``the case had no chance of succeeding'' given that Castro was a
head of state and entitled to diplomatic immunity.
	   The suit cites the case of a 72 Cuban would-be exiles on a raft
allegedly rammed by Cuban police boats on July 13, 1994. Forty-one
people, mostly women and children, drowned.
	   ``I demand justice in my name and that of my son, for the murder
of our family, and the punishment of those to blame for this
massacre,'' a tearful 42-year-old Sergio Perodin said at a Madrid
press conference.
	   He and another son survived the incident but he lost his wife
and his eldest boy.
	   Alonso said last week's Spanish court ruling accepted that the
definition of genocide could include ``the elimination of a social
group, which is the case in Cuba.''
	   The suit also names Castro's brother Raul, Cuban Tourism
Minister Osmani Cienfuegos, and Carlos Amat, Cuba's ambassador in
Geneva.
	   The Foundation for Human Rights is part of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, a Miami-based group vehemently opposed to
Castro. It is well funded by Cuban exiles living in Florida and
politically influential both in that state and in Washington.

Police launch search for regional parliament speaker in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Police in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula on
Thursday announced a search for the former speaker of the regional
parliament, saying he was suspected of several serious crimes.
	   Crimea's top prosecutor issued a warrant for the arrest of the
ex-speaker, Yevhen Supruniuk, Crimea's branch of Ukraine's Interior
Ministry reported.
	   Police promised a reward for information about Supruniuk's
whereabouts and published hotline numbers in Simferopol, the
capital of the Black Sea peninsula.
	   Supruniuk served as Crimea's parliamentary speaker from July
1995 until he resigned in October 1996.
	   Police gave no details about Supruniuk's alleged crimes. The
Interfax news agency quoted sources close to the case as saying he
was suspected of being involved in a killing and organizing an
attack on a fellow ex-parliament speaker in Crimea, as well as of
staging his own kidnapping.
	   In 1996, Supruniuk was involved in a bizarre kidnapping incident
in which, aides said, Supruniuk was seized by three unidentified
people from his home but later managed to escape. Supruniuk then
underwent treatment in a local hospital.
	   According to Interfax, Supruniuk served as Crimea's chief
firefighting official before being elected to the parliament post
and until recently was a senior instructor at the Interior Ministry
University in Crimea.
	   Crimean politics and business long have been plagued by violence
and several senior regional officials have been killed in recent
years. Police have attributed some of the killings to a group of
suspected bandits who were arrested recently.

Brussels struggles through day without public transport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - A 24-hour public transport strike over
working conditions clogged up the streets of Brussels Thursday
reducing traffic to a snail's pace.
	   All bus, tram and subway services ceased as transport workers
belonging to a christian trade union walked off the job to protest
against staff shortages.
	   Strikers picketed seven bus, tram and subway depots. They
demanded an increase in staff, including at least 81 more bus
drivers.
	   Union spokesman Geert Witterzeel said management has promised
additional hirings but was dragging its feet on the issue.
	   Armand Ferrail, a subway driver, said the one-day strike was a
warning and that further action was possible. Bus drivers complain
increasing road congestion cause delays and make for ever more

New German government reaffirms commitment to prepare EU for

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ On his first visit to the EU head
office, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer reiterated his
country's commitment to European integration but also its
insistence on paying less for European Union membership.
	   Like the government of ex-chancellor Helmut Kohl, Germany's new
leadership believes the EU's plans to bring in 11 new countries can
only happen on the basis of a fairer distribution of membership
fees, Fischer said.
	   Fischer also visited NATO headquarters. His Green Party was long
opposed to NATO's Cold War policies, but Fischer has since
expressed support for the alliance.
	   At the EU, Fischer said the new Bonn government will continue to
seek a significant cut in its membership payments.
	   He signaled that Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland must
relinquish financial perks and free up money for poorer potential
newcomers.
	   Over the 1993-1999 period, the EU is spending dlrs 18 billion in
special development aid _ known as `Cohesion Funds' _ to its four
poorest members. They want to retain special funding, even if
Cyprus and 10 East European nations join the EU in the decade
ahead.
	   ``I wouldn't say the cohesion funds were created for eternity,''
Fischer told a joint press conference with European Commission
President Jacques Santer.
	   ``These questions must be addressed by partners in a spirit of
mutual confidence. A spirit of compromise is going to be needed
from everybody ... to share the burden of enlargement.''
	   The money dispute is part of as yet fruitless efforts to
overhaul the EU budget and institutions ahead of enlargement.
Germany assumes the EU's rotating presidency on Jan. 1 and must
bring the EU reform negotiations to conclusion.
	   Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden insist on changing
the way the EU is financed. They don't object to being net
contributors but to the size of their overpayments _ almost dlrs 45
billion a year in Germany's case.
	   Fischer said the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
favored enlarging the EU but he put no date on when the first new
countries would be expected to join. The European Commission is
using 2002 as a target year for cost-calculation purposes only.
	   ``I would be very happy if we can do it by 2002 but let's be
realistic,'' said Fischer.
	   He said maintaining the enlargement momentum ``to provide the
architecture of the future Europe'' would ``essential'' for his
government during its EU presidency in the first half of 1999.
	   On Wednesday, the European Commission said preliminary talks to
bring Cyprus and 10 East European nations into the EU were
``broadly on track'' and that candidate nations by and large
remained committed to economic and political reforms.
	   This year, the EU began preliminary talks with Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus and opened
``preparatory'' talks with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.

ETA says cease-fire could become permanent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS to remove garbled 8th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA said
Thursday its six-week-old cease-fire could be made definitive
depending on unspecified developments in the near future.
	   ETA's statement, published in the radical newspaper Euskadi
Informacion, said ``events and progress in the coming days'' would
shape the ``definitive nature of the cease-fire.'' It gave no
details as to what those developments might be.
	   The statement came two days after the conservative government of
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar proposed talks to resolve the
conflict in what was his administration's first move towards ETA
since the cease-fire.
	   However, the fact that ETA's statement was written before the
government's initiative prompted deputy premier Francisco Alvarez
Cascos to dismiss it as ``out of date.''
	   On Tuesday, Aznar authorized contacts with organizations linked
to what is referred to in Spain as ``ETA's World,'' and late
Wednesday his spokesman Josep Pique said the government was seeking
direct talks with the gunmen.
	   ``The next move must be made by ETA,'' Cascos told national
radio, stressing that the government had already done its bit to
ensure progress by seeking dialogue.
	   In its statement ETA backed the so-called Lizarra Agreement
signed in early September by a group of Basque political parties
which proposed talks between ETA and the government but also
all-party negotiations on the political future of the troubled
region.
	   So far the government has restricted its talks offer to an
exploration of ETA's willingness to give up violence for good.
	   Kai Saez, a spokesman for the Herri Batasuna party frequently
referred to as ETA's political wing, said the government's proposal
to talk directly to ETA was positive, but it had yet to be
complemented with a commitment to define a forum for talks on the
political roots of the conflict.
	   ``If the peace process is thought of as a 100-meter long road,
we have advanced about a meter,'' he said.

Zanardi bids emotional farewell to CART
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FONTANA, California (AP) _ The departure of Alex Zanardi from
Indy cars is more than just the story of a two-time champion moving
on.
	   In only three years in the CART FedEx Series, the talented and
witty Italian won the respect of his peers, the admiration of
thousands of fans _ and 15 races.
	   Now, as the open-wheel series searches for new heroes to build
on, Zanardi leaves for Formula One. He takes with him a little
piece of a lot of hearts.
	   In a sport where drivers come and go in bunches, Zanardi makes
an impression on nearly everyone.
	   Crusty Chip Ganassi, who in 1996 hired a virtually unknown
Zanardi for his Target-sponsored race team, became emotional about
the 32-year-old driver.
	   ``I'm not going to talk about his on-track successes,'' Ganassi
said, clearing his throat several times. ``Those are all well
documented.
	   ``I look much more at the person, the character. That's what I'm
impressed with.''
	   Despite losing Zanardi, Ganassi plans to remain close. In fact,
they will go snowmobile riding in December.
	   ``You meet few people in this world, in any business, that you
can enjoy and share a particular goal,'' Ganassi said. ``We've
enjoyed certain things together that I don't think either one of us
will ever forget.
	   ``That brings out a special bond in people that no one or
anything can ever take away.''
	   Bryan Herta won't ever forget Zanardi, either.
	   Zanardi bedeviled his American rival with racing aggressiveness
and beat him in 1996 in Monterey, California, with a spectacular
last-lap pass. Herta, however, got even two months ago with his
breakthrough victory in Monterey.
	   ``It meant something to beat Alex,'' Herta said. ``I wanted my
first win so bad, but it was even more satisfying when it was Alex
that I beat.
	   ``Having him out there to push you meant a lot. The series will
be poorer without him.''
	   Last Sunday, Zanardi was ecstatic when teammate Jimmy Vasser won
the season-ending Marlboro 500 in Fontana, and finished second in
the series by beating Canadian Greg Moore and Zanardi in a
final-lap shootout.
	   ``My boy, he comes through,'' Zanardi said, giving Vasser a big
hug.
	   The low-key Vasser and the jokester Zanardi somehow meshed as
almost-perfect teammates, prodding each other to new heights.
Beyond the competition, they are close.
	   ``Jimmy is not a teammate for me, he is a friend,'' Zanardi
said. ``I have learned a lot from him technically ... that is now
part of my driving style. It has made me a better driver.''
	   ``And maybe Jimmy has learned something from me. I think next
year Jimmy will drive with fire in his eyes.''
	   Zanardi has helped him immensely, concedes Vasser, the 1996
series champion.
	   ``Alex is so awfully determined,'' Vasser said. ``He never gives
up. It's just win or else. I've never been around somebody quite
like that before, and some of it maybe rubs off.''
	   A good example came as the two drove around behind leader Moore
during a caution period before the dramatic, final restart last
Sunday.
	   ``Alex pulled up next to me and he gave me one of these,''
Vasser said, smiling and pumping both fists in the air. ``I know
him so well, I could practically see his expression under his
facemask.
	   ``He was telling me, `Let's go. Let's win this thing.'''
	   With all this love and friendship flying around, why did Zanardi
make the decision to return to Formula One, where he served a short
and unhappy apprenticeship with some lowly teams in the early
1990s?
	   ``It was a very, very hard decision to make,'' he said. ``I had
to think about all the things I have done in the last three years
and what I could do in the future in this series, and balance that
against racing closer to home and doing Formula One when I have the
opportunity to go with a strong team and be successful.
	   ``I can assure you it was not the money that made the
difference. Chip and Target were very generous.''
	   But Zanardi reportedly will make dlrs 15 million _ far more than
he would earn in CART _ from Team Williams over the next two years.
	   Whatever happens in Formula One, Zanardi has not entirely ruled
out Indy-car racing. He would consider a return if CART and the
rival Indy Racing League settled their differences and raced
together in the Indianapolis 500.
	   ``That would be something special,'' said Zanardi, who never got
to run at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The jailed former third-ranking member
of the Cali drug cartel was shot dead Thursday while playing soccer
in a prison yard.
	   Elmer Herrera, alias ``Pacho,'' was killed by at least one
gunman in Palmira prison in Cali, a National Prison Service
spokesman said.
	   Herrera, 40, surrendered to authorities in September 1996 and
was convicted of drug trafficking earlier this year.
	   Herrera was playing soccer inside the prison, located 180 miles
(290 kilometers) west of Bogota, when he was shot. The assassin was
captured by prison guards, said the spokesman, Javier Suarez.
	   The United States made a formal extradition request for Herrera
in July 1996, but Colombian law forbade his extradition.

French company Lafarge buys majority stake in cement company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ The French construction giant LaFarge
is infusing concrete cash into a Moldovan state cement company,
paying dlrs 200,000 for a majority stake, the companies announced
Thursday.
	   LaFarge plans to invest dlrs 12.7 million in the next few years
in Ciment, which has been struggling since 1992.
	   LaFarge now owns 52 percent of the company, based in the
northern Moldovan city of Rezina.
	   The French company will also pay off 37 million lei (dlrs 5.8
million) of Ciment's debts, said Jean Touati, LaFarge's director
for relations with former Soviet republics.
	   The aims of the company under French management include boosting
cement production from 140,000 tons a year to at least 1.1 million
tons.
	   Since Moldova, a small agricultural nation sandwiched between
Romania and Ukraine, declared independence from the Soviet Union
seven years ago it has attracted only a few hundred million dollars
of foreign investment.

Dublin set to complete move to Aston Villa

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Striker Dion Dublin Thursday was set
to sign with Aston Villa on a 5.75-million pound (dlrs 9.5 million)
transfer from Coventry, ending a several-week saga that saw him
turn down moves to Blackburn and Leeds.
	   The 29-year-old Dublin _ with Villa set to announce his signing
at a Thursday press conference _ was expected to play Saturday for
the English league leaders against Tottenham Hotspur.
	   Coventry chairman Bryan Richardson confirmed deal after turning
down Villa's initial offer of 5 million pounds (dlrs 8.25 million).
	   ``I feel we have got a good price in the end,'' he said.
	   ``I think people have got to understand that back in March we
would have only got 3 million (dlrs 5 million) to 3.5 million (dlrs
5.8 million) for Dublin when he was close to going out of
contract.''
	   Coventry manager Gordon Strachan said he was sure the deal would
be wrapped up quickly.
	   ``Dion has been to Villa for talks and I am sure the deal would
have taken all of 90 seconds to complete.''

Swissair flight 111 before it crashed, an in-house publication of
the airline said Thursday.
	   There still is no indication of the source of the heat, said the
publication, ``News.'' It described as ``pure speculation''
theories that a fire was caused by an electrical short that ignited
insulation material.
	   Investigators, who have found that the high heat melted plastic
in the first 10 meters (40 feet) of the plane, were surprised that
the heat was in the upper part of the plane and not below the
cockpit floor, where most of the wiring is located, the newsletter
said.
	   Previous reports have said the heat was high enough to damage
plastic, but the newsletter gave the first indication of just how
much heat there was.
	   The newsletter, published for the staff by the airline's parent
SAirGroup, said the findings by Canadian investigators were
disclosed by Hans Ulrich Beyeler, Swissair head of technology, in a
speech to the Technical Society of Zurich.
	   The MD-11 airliner flying from New York to Geneva crashed Sept.
2 off the coast of Canada, killing all 229 people aboard. The crew
reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash.
	   Last week the airline announced it was switching off a
state-of-the-art entertainment system on its remaining 15 MD-11s
and three Boeing 747s as a precautionary measure.
	   Swissair said the video-on-demand system for first and business
class was being disconnected from a power supply network routed
through the cockpit because it was nonessential and because that is
the area where the investigation is concentrated.
	   Other onboard entertainment systems were unaffected.
	   The newsletter said 90 percent of the wreckage has been
recovered so far.

NK Varteks 4, SC Heerenveen 2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VARAZDIN, Croatia (AP) _ Miljenko Mumlek scrambled onto a loose
ball in the box at the end of extra time to lift Varteks to a 4-2
victory over SC Heerenveen Thursday in a Cup Winners Cup
second-round, second-leg match.
	   Varteks advanced 5-4 on aggregate.
	   The ``Bumble Bees'' rose from a 1-0 deficit after Radoslav
Samardzic gave Heerenveen an early lead in the 18th, when he
pounced on a defensive error and tucked the ball in goal.
	   Mumlek, who scored for Varteks in the first leg, equalized 1-1
against the run of play with a diving header on the blind side in
the 65th minute.
	   Spurred on by the sellout crowd of 6,000, Varteks soldiered
forward valiantly on the muddy pitch and bounced into the lead in
the 80th minute when Faik Karamberovic came off the bench to head
home in a congested penalty area.
	   The goal squeezed Varteks into extra-time where Karamberovic
again joined in on the thick end of the action, sliding onto a low
cross for what looked like the winner in the 117th minute.
	   Jan de Visser momentarily dashed Varteks' hopes of a spot in the
quarterfinals after he fired a rocket from long range two minutes
later, giving Heerenveen a 4-4 aggregate and a key away-goal
advantage.
	   But Mumlek grabbed the elusive winner, and a ticket to the next
round, with his second goal in the 119th minute.

International aid sanctions on Sarajevo to be lifted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The European Union on
Thursday said it will resume reconstruction aid to Sarajevo after a
months-long suspension, imposed to force authorities to speed up
the repatriation of non-Muslims to the capital.
	   The suspension was announced in July by the two main
reconstruction funders, the U.S. Agency for International
Development and the European Union. Construction worth dlrs 20
million was postponed in an attempt to pressure city officials to
allow 20,000 non-Muslims to return to their prewar homes.
	   The European Union lifted its construction aid moratorium on
recommendation of Carlos Westendorp, Bosnia's senior international
administrator. US-AID was expected to follow suit.
	   Under pressure from international officials, the Sarajevo
government signed an agreement in March pledging to help up to
20,000 Bosnian Serbs and Croats come back to prewar homes, now
occupied by Muslims, by the middle of this year.
	   Although still disappointed with the number of non-Muslims
returning to the Muslim-held Bosnian capital, Westendorp decided to
recommend the lifting of suspension, said a statement from his
office.
	   ``While estimates of how many minority returns have taken place
vary, it is clear that return is happening,'' the statement said
adding that the available housing space in Sarajevo needs to be
expanded to make room for more returns.
	   City officials argued the town was crowded by Muslim refugees
from Serb-held areas and said return should go both ways, with
Muslims also being allowed to settle in former home regions now
dominated by Serbs.
	   According to the independent International Crisis Group, fewer
than 52,000 minority returns have been registered throughout the
country since the end of war in 1995. In the Bosnian Serb part of
the country, only 2,000 non Serbs have come home.
	   Westendorp said the authorities will have to redouble their
efforts to reach the 20,000 minority goal.

Out of UEFA Cup and League Cup, Villa could lose league lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Aston Villa, eliminated from the UEFA Cup earlier
this week, could lose its place at the top of the English Premier
League this weekend.
	   Reeling from Tuesday's 3-1 home defeat to Celta Vigo which
knocked the Birmingham club out of the second round of the UEFA Cup
3-2 on aggregate, Villa puts its unbeaten Premiership record on the
line Saturday against resurgent Tottenham.
	   Second-place Manchester United, coming off a spectacular 5-0
Champions League win against Broendby, is poised to go top of the
table. Trailing Villa by just one point, United is home Sunday to
Newcastle.
	   Villa, with six wins and four draws, has 22 points. United, at
6-3-1, has 21.
	   In the span of less than a week, Villa has been dumped from the
English League Cup (4-1 by Chelsea) and from Europe.
	   ``We have put such a lot of work into the season so far that
it's vital we win against Spurs and don't throw away all the things
we've worked so hard at this term,'' Villa manager John Gregory
said.
	   ``This is the hardest test we've had and it's all about
everybody digging deep and showing what they can really do. I have
helped to rebuild the self-belief of the players, but this is a
test for all of us.
	   ``People have been looking at us as a surprise packet and
waiting for us to slip up for the last six months, but we are
determined to get our season back on track.''
	   Striker Stan Collymore, who scored Villa's only goal Tuesday,
said the players need to put the disappointment behind them
quickly.
	   ``We have built our season so far on everybody working for one
another and the graft element,'' he said. ``The gaffer (coach) has
told us to roll up our sleeves and make sure we get a positive
result on Saturday, and there is no time to be down and feeling
sorry for ourselves.''
	   Collymore's place in the Villa lineup could come under threat
from Dion Dublin, who, after weeks of speculation, left Coventry to
join the Midlands club Thursday in a 5.75-million-pound (dlrs 9.6
million) deal.
	   Tottenham, meanwhile, was trying to complete a
1.75-million-pound (dlrs 2.9 million) move for Ipswich's Argentine
fullback Mauricio Taricco in time for Saturday's game at Villa.
	   Spurs have found consistency since George Graham replaced
Christian Gross as manager, moving to mid-table with 15 points.
	   Manchester United goes into its game against Newcastle on a high
after its goal spree against Broendby, having outscored the Danish
side 11-2 in two Champions League games.
	   United manager Alex Ferguson said his team's performance in the
first half Wednesday was one of the best ever during his helm. The
club is now rated as the bookmakers' favorite to win the Champions
Cup.
	   ``At the moment we're on the crest of a wave and we're scoring
goals for fun,'' defender Phil Neville said.
	   There was no fun this week for Arsenal, the reigning league and
F.A. Cup holders, as the Gunners were beaten 3-1 in Ukraine by
Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League on Wednesday.
	   Arsenal was depleted by injuries to Dennis Bergkamp, Marc
Overmars, Tony Adams and Nicolas Anelka.
	   Among those, Adams will definitely be out for Sunday's home game
against Everton. The Gunners are third in the league with 20
points.
	   Fifth-place Liverpool, which pulled out a dramatic 2-2 tie with
Valencia in the UEFA Cup to advance on away goals, is at home
against Derby on Saturday.
	   Midfielders Paul Ince and Steve McManaman face three-match
suspensions from European competition after being sent off for red
cards near the end of the Valencia match. But they both will be
eligible to play against Derby.
	   In other games Saturday, it's Blackburn vs. Coventry, Charlton
vs. Leicester, Nottingham Forest vs. Wimbledon and Southampton vs.
Middlesbrough.
	   On Sunday, Leeds is home to Sheffield Wednesday, while Chelsea
travels to West Ham for what could be Brian Laudrup's last game for
the Blues before his expected move back to Denmark with FC
Copenhagen.
	   In Division One, Sunderland, which leads by two points with 31,
is home to Grimsby. Second-place Birmingham, with 29 points, plays
at West Bromwich Albion. Huddersfield and Ipswich, each with 28,
meet at Huddersfield.
	   In Scotland, first-place Glasgow Rangers play Sunday at St.
Johnstone, while second-place Kilmarnock is away Saturday at
Hearts.

Eleven suspects arrested for allegedly smuggling immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Authorities said Thursday they
have arrested 11 people suspected of smuggling immigrants to the
Netherlands and later sneaking them into Britain, the United States
and Canada.
	   They were arrested Wednesday after police raided several
locations in four cities, including Amsterdam. The suspects, 10 men
and one woman, came from Afghanistan, Morocco, Iraq and Sudan, said
Dutch military police spokesman Hans Hovens.
	   The group was also suspected of forging passports, which were
used to smuggle people out of the Netherlands and into other
countries, he added.
	   Because of the ongoing investigation, Hovens declined to say how
many people have been smuggled into the country by the group or
where its customers came from.
	   The investigation was launched in August after police in the
Dutch-German border city of Enschede arrested a carload of people
who were trying to enter the country illegally.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission threatened to
take Sweden and Britain to the EU high court on Thursday for
allegedly flouting EU rules on proper waste disposal and recycling.
	   In Sweden's case, it said in a statement, the majority of 288
municipal waste disposal plans did not meet EU guidelines on
several points, including proper waste packaging.
	   It said in a statement of the 106 British waste disposal plans
studied ``only eight appeared to conform to all requirements of (EU
regulations).''
	   Also, ``many did not contain the requisite information relating
to hazardous waste.''
	   ``The decisions now taken by the Commission form part of a
concerted effort to ensure that the necessary waste management
plans are in place right across the EU,'' the Commission said.
	   Sweden and Britain now have a month to reply to the Commission's
charges.

Brezhnev's grandson aspires to be Russian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The grandson of late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev
said Thursday he may run for Russian presidency, riding public
nostalgia about the stability of the Soviet times.
	   ``There was more good than bad under Brezhnev,'' Andrei
Brezhnev, 37, said at a news conference, according to the Interfax
news agency. ``In those days, 98 percent of people were satisfied
with their lives and only 2 percent expressed dissatisfaction.''
	   Russia's next presidential elections are scheduled for the
summer of 2000.
	   The younger Brezhnev made his political debut last month when he
set up the All-Russia Communist Socio-Political Movement. He
claimed Thursday that his party already has more than 5,700 members
and would first concentrate on next year's parliamentary elections.
	   Brezhnev, who once worked for the Soviet Foreign Trade Ministry
and later was a businessman, said his party would not cooperate
with other movements, including the powerful Communist Party.
	   Russia's latest economic crisis, on top of months of unpaid
wages and widespread disillusionment with the government, has
revived many Russians' nostalgia for the stability and social
safety net of the Soviet era.
	   Brezhnev's grandfather led the Soviet Union as general secretary
of the Communist Party from 1964-1982.

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ A top U.S. envoy Thursday returned to
Zambia in an abrupt last minute move to confer with the Zambian
president, a key leader of negotiations to end Congo's three-month
war.
	   Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Susan Rice arrived to brief
President Frederick Chiluba on her seven-nation tour aimed at
persuading outsiders to withdraw from Congo, U.S. officials in the
Zambian capital said.
	   Zambia has chaired two rounds of failed Congolese peace talks
and is seen as sympathetic to Rice's mission. In late October,
Chiluba was asked by African leaders to arrange fresh talks leading
to direct negotiations between Kabila and rebels fighting to oust
him.
	   Kabila has refused to meet with rebel leaders.
	   ``She came to give President Chiluba her impressions of her trip
and sum up her overall visit to the region,'' said U.S. embassy
spokesman George Newman.
	   Rice has acknowledged her nine-day trip achieved little
progress. She received a frosty reception from Kabila and President
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who has dispatched 6,000 troops to back
Kabila.
	   Angola and Namibia also sent troops and tanks to help stop rebel
advances and mount an offensive against rebel positions in the
dense jungles of eastern Congo.
	   ``We are encouraged by the recognition of all those with whom we
talked that there can be no viable military solution, and by the
expressed desire for peace,'' Rice said before leaving Entebbe,
Uganda, for Lusaka on Thursday.
	   ``However, we remain concerned about the continued buildup of
military forces, which underscores the importance of moving forward
to find a peaceful solution.''
	   Despite denials from the Ugandan and Rwandan governments, their
troops repeatedly have been seen fighting on the rebels' side.
	   U.S. diplomats said Rice, who already has visited Angola, Congo,
Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda, had a hard time convincing the
countries supporting Kabila that the United States was impartial in
the conflict.
	   On the last scheduled stop of her tour, Rice met with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni in Entebbe for two hours Wednesday night.
	   In a statement issued Thursday, Museveni said he told Rice the
conflict ``can and will be resolved,'' and that a cease-fire was
possible.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Rice met with Congolese rebels and Rwandan
officials.
	   ``We had a frank exchange of views,'' said Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition. ``The
Americans listened to our concerns, and we hope the contacts will
continue.''
	   Rice was expected to depart for London and Washington aboard a
scheduled commercial flight later Thursday.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela was to meet with Rwandan
vice president Paul Kagame on Friday in Pretoria to discuss the
Congo conflict.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Disgruntled high school students staged a third
round of nationwide marches Thursday, but the protest _ seen as a

	   Last month, before students went on a weeklong vacation,
hundreds of thousands of them took to the streets to protest
overcrowded classrooms, outmoded equipment, a lack of teachers and
other conditions they say leave them badly prepared for the future.

to police _ many apparently choosing to attend classes instead.

After many delays, Cabinet meets to debate peace agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu saying he was confident of Cabinet
approval, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After several delays, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Thursday presented the land-for-security agreement
with the Palestinians to his Cabinet for approval and moved a step
closer to carrying out the accord.
	   Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others. The vote was not likely before Friday
or even Sunday, said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.
	   Asked whether he would begin the West Bank withdrawal on Nov.
16, as stipulated in the accord, he said it was up to the
Palestinians.
	   ``If they implement, we will implement. If they don't implement
it, we won't carry it out,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV's Channel Two
during a brief Cabinet recess called after seven hours of debate.
	   In an attempt to blunt the criticism of hard-liners, Netanyahu
told the Cabinet that Jewish settlers would be given a say in which
West Bank areas Israel would vacate. However, this will not hold up
ratification, Bar-Illan said.
	   As part of the peace accord, Israel has pledged to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank over the next 12 weeks, in exchange for
Palestinian steps to improve Israeli security.
	   Netanyahu also told the ministers that he would only give 1
percent of the land in an additional pullback.
	   In the past week, Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet meeting three
times claiming that the Palestinians had not completed their
anti-terror plan as promised.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
accused Netanyahu of trying to please hard-liners at the expense of
the Palestinians and the majority of Israelis who back the deal
negotiated last month at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   ``The government will approve the agreement, but it is being
delivered to the Israeli public as a bad and dangerous agreement,
with a negative atmosphere,'' Tibi told The Associated Press.
	   ``Is this the spirit that we wanted to emerge from the Wye River
talks?'' Tibi said.
	   The latest dispute centered on the fate of 30 Palestinians
suspected in the killings of nearly 100 Israelis.
	   Netanyahu demanded that he receive a timetable for the arrest of
the wanted men before convening the Cabinet. Bar-Illan said Israel
received written assurances late Wednesday from the United States,
thus paving the way for the Cabinet meeting.
	   However, the Palestinians said they did not provide new
assurances. Arafat said 12 of the wanted men were already in
detention, and that he would make an effort to round up the others.
	   A Palestinian police official said Thursday that in all, 14 were
in jail. Several of the suspects have been in Palestinian jails for
months or years, but Palestinian security officials in the past
refused to provide exact figures.
	   The acrimony over every detail of the accord highlighted the
need for close U.S. supervision. U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was
to arrive in the region Thursday to start watching implementation,
but his trip was moved up to the weekend.
	   While the dispute over the wanted men appeared to have been
settled, the next crisis already loomed.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials have divergent views of the
procedure to annul clauses in the PLO charter calling for Israel's
destruction. The paragraph in the peace agreement addressing the
issue is vaguely worded, allowing different interpretations.
	   The agreement says members of the Palestine National Council,
along with those of other Palestinian organizations, will be
invited to a mid-December meeting to affirm an Arafat letter to
U.S. President Bill Clinton concerning the revoking of the
offending clauses.
	   The PLO charter says it can only be amended by a two-thirds vote
of the PNC members, but the agreement does not specifically refer
to holding a vote or a required majority.
	   Israel says the charter must be annulled with a vote by the PNC,
not by affirmation. ``Okay, so you can say, what does it mean for a
body to affirm?'' Netanyahu said. ``Will it affirm by stomping feet
or nodding heads? Of course not. There will be a vote.''
	   ``And if not, we simply won't give them the territory,'' he
said.

Police have suspect in UEFA Cup explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALERNO, Italy (AP) _ Police have a suspect in the explosion
that injured an off-field official and forced the suspension of a
UEFA Cup match between Fiorentina and Swiss club Grasshoppers,
Italian newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Police in this southern town, where Tuesday's game was played
because Fiorentina's home field was suspended, have questioned the
man, who is reportedly from Salerno, and released him.
Closed-circuit television tapes from the stadium allegedly show the
suspect and others preparing a device, reports said.
	   The injured official, Belgian Philippe Flament, was taken to a
hospital with a right knee injury. The incident occurred as players
and officials were walking to the dressing rooms at the end of the
first half, with Fiorentina leading 2-1.
	   Several players were temporarily deafened by the blast.
	   Florentine and Salerno fans have a history of rivalry. Before
the game, four people were hospitalized when groups of fans clashed
outside the stadium.
	   UEFA is expected to rule Monday on whether the match will be
replayed or if Fiorentina will be punished.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Hondurans buried more of their dead
and formed blocks-long lines to get rationed water and gasoline,
while officials struggled to feed and shelter a population in shock
from Hurricane Mitch.
	   Another huge task loomed: Accounting for the estimated 13,000
people missing after the storm rampaged across Central America.
	   Medical workers buried 13 flood victims in a common grave
Wednesday in Tegucigalpa, placing two wooden crosses among the
plastic-shrouded bodies before a bulldozer plowed earth over them.
	   Authorities have buried about 100 bodies in common graves in and
around the city since the storm struck last week. The victims,
recovered from receding floodwaters or found in debris, couldn't be
identified and posed a health threat, interim Mayor Nahum
Balladeres said.
	   The government estimates as many 6,500 people died, and up to 1
million are homeless. All told, officials say Hurricane Mitch
killed nearly 9,000 people in the region.
	   ``We really don't know what the numbers are. There are places we
haven't reached yet,'' said Col. Rene Osorio of Honduras' national
emergency committee.
	   A revived Tropical Storm Mitch plowed across the Gulf of Mexico
and hit southern Florida today with heavy rain, 55 mph (89 kph)
winds, flooding and tornadoes. Officials reported that buildings
were damaged and at least seven people suffered minor injuries.
	   The storm was expected to move over the state and out over the
Atlantic by this afternoon. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches (10 to
20 centimeters) were forecast.
	   While Honduran officials previously had estimated 7,000 dead,
President Carlos Flores said late Wednesday that 6,500 people were
confirmed dead and more than 11,000 were missing. Mitch destroyed
more than 60 percent of the nation's infrastructure, he said,
adding that the government was seeking aid from Europe and the
United States.
	   ``We have receded many years'' in terms of national development,
Flores said. ``The capital of the republic is in a precarious
condition.''
	   Fearing the spread of disease in overcrowded shelters, the
government announced plans today to vaccinate shelter refugees
against cholera.
	   The first foreign relief aid trickled in _ Hondurans in Texas
sent 15,000 pounds (6,800 kilos) of supplies Wednesday. Mexico sent
helicopters and the first of a promised 500 tons (450 metric tons)
of food, along with 500 soldiers to help in relief operations.
	   France said it will send 250 rescue workers, half of them
soldiers, to help out in Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and
Guatemala. The French navy also is sending a ship loaded with
construction materials, trucks and equipment to help reopen
communication lines.
	   Honduran roads sustained dlrs 2 billion in damage, nearly a
third of the country's gross domestic product and double the
government's budget, said Finance Minister Gabriela Nunez.
	   In northern Nicaragua, the grisly task of burying or burning
bodies continued in mudslides near the Casitas volcano where a
crater lake collapsed Friday. Two hundred more corpses were found
there Wednesday, boosting the confirmed death toll there to 1,568.
As many as 2,000 were feared dead.
	   More than 750,000 people lost their homes or possessions across
Nicaragua, and 1,804 are listed as missing nationwide.
	   Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman turned aid distribution over
to the Roman Catholic Church on Wednesday after government relief
efforts were heavily criticized. He also said he would ``respect
the will of local residents'' in deciding whether to declare the
Casitas area a national cemetery.
	   A magnitude-3.2 earthquake centered near the Casitas peak was
reported Wednesday, and lava flows from the nearby Cerro Negro
volcano appeared to have stopped. No injuries or damages were
reported from either incident.
	   At the base of the Casitas volcano, about two dozen people
marched along the Pan American Highway today pushing a 4-foot-tall
(1.2-meter) image of the Virgin of the Rosary on a wheel barrow.
The worshippers _ refugees staying at a school near Posoltega _
sang a hymn to the Virgin Mary.
	   ``We're doing this for those who have died and for those in
difficulty,'' said Felicita Calderon, 70. ``For those poor people
up there who couldn't get out.''
	   In Honduras, main highways connecting Tegucigalpa, a city of
800,000, to the rest of the country were cut, creating shortages of
gasoline, drinking water and food in the hard-hit capital. Without
gasoline, aid can't be delivered by truck. Nearly all aircraft are
being used in continuing searches for survivors.
	   ``The people's desperation is growing,'' said Andres Aguiriano
Duarte of the emergency committee.
	   Between Monday and late Wednesday, police said they had arrested
some 800 people _ most in the capital _ for violating an overnight
curfew imposed to prevent looting.
	   At Tegucigalpa's city morgue _ operating from a refrigerated
trailer after flooding swept through the morgue building _ anxious
residents awaited word of missing loved ones.
	   And along the banks of the Choluteca River, residents shoveled
muck from debris-packed homes and stores, trying to salvage
whatever they could. Bulldozers cleared mounds of rock, mud and
garbage from the streets.
	   All too often, there was nothing left to save.
	   ``How do we continue, without water, without food, without
sleep?'' said Yolanda Marvella Arraya, 35, who has spent the last
week outside on a soggy mattress next to the river since flooding
destroyed her home.
	   Faced with shortages of food and water, the U.S. Embassy in
Tegucigalpa let dependents of embassy personnel leave the country,
while the U.S. Peace Corps ordered its 207 members in Honduras out.
	   About 4,000 people crowded into a shelter Wednesday at a trade
school in Tegucigalpa. Sitting on mattresses, some mothers cried
silently, trying to hide their grief from their children.
	   ``I'm fighting to control my nerves,'' said Santos Antonio
Perez, 57, whose family of 10 was uprooted by the storm. ``I lost
all I have. This dress was given to me.''

Congolese police arrest four newspaper employees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese police arrested four employees
of a Kinshasa newspaper Thursday afternoon and seized thousands of
dollars worth of equipment.
	   The arrests came two days after Le Soft newspaper ran a story
about President Laurent Kabila's political problems, headlined
``Apocalypse at the door of the Congo.''
	   The article claimed the recent visit of Assistant U.S. Secretary
of State Susan Rice put Kabila into a position where he would have
to leave power.
	   The government, however, gave no explanation for the arrests of
the two journalists, an intern and another employee.
	   ``We don't yet know the reason for the accusation,'' said
Mukebayi Nkoso, a Le Soft reporter who slipped away during the
raid.
	   Newspaper officials said police seized computers, printers and
scanners valued at about dlrs 15,000.
	   Rice has been on a swing through Africa, including a visit to
Congo, pressing for a cease-fire in the Congolese civil war.
	   Le Soft was founded by Kin-Kiey Mulumba, who has since become a
spokesman for the Congolese rebels battling to unseat Kabila.
	   In mid-August, troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia
intervened in support of Kabila and stopped the rebels from
capturing Kinshasa. Since then, the rebels _ who are apparently
supported by Uganda and Rwanda _ have been fighting in eastern and
central Congo.

Gov't authorizes future talks with groups close to ETA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with prime minister confirming contacts,
details, background. No Pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's prime minister said Tuesday he had
authorized talks with groups linked to militant Basque separatists,
marking the first time the Spanish government has taken steps to
negotiate an end to the 30-year conflict.
	   ``There are news reports that I have authorized contacts. It's
true,'' Aznar said upon his return from a trip to London.
	   The contacts would be through the Basque National Liberation
Movement, a loose grouping of ETA and other militant separatist
organizations, a spokesman for Aznar's office said.
	   ``The contacts, that have not happened up until now, will take
place with the go-betweens of ETA's world,'' said the spokesman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We cannot say anything yet
about the how, who and when.''
	   An official government spokesman, Josep Pique, told reporters
that the contacts were to exploring new possibilities since the
cease-fire, ``to find out whether (ETA) is really willing to give
up violence for good.''
	   ETA, which is campaigning for a Basque homeland in northern
Spain and southern France, declared an indefinite cease-fire last
two months ago, ushering in the Basque peace process.
	   Groups close to ETA said the truce was modeled on the Northern
Irish process that led to the April peace accord and urged the
government to promote a negotiated settlement as British Prime
Minister Tony Blair had done in Northern Ireland.
	   Irish republican leader Gerry Adams visited the Basque region
last month and urged Aznar's government to respond positively to
the cease-fire by opening peace talks.
	   A group of Basque political parties and organizations known as
the Irish Forum secured Adams' backing for its proposal, known as
the Lizarra Declaration, for all-party peace talks, including the
government and ETA.
	   The Irish Forum includes Herri Batasuna, the political coalition
linked to ETA, as well as moderate Basque nationalist parties,
labor unions and civic groups.
	   The government's hard-line position of rejecting peace
negotiations with ETA or legal organizations linked to it has
softened gradually since the cease-fire and since regional
elections on Oct. 25.
	   Until then, the government took tough stand against ETA,
arresting many militants, dismantling a major ETA financial network
and closing an allied daily newspaper _ all of which is believed to
have contributed to the cease-fire.
	   Recently, the government let it be known ETA would not be
required to hand over weapons before talks could be held on the
future of 535 ETA prisoners being held in Spanish jails and other
issues.
	   Aznar's Popular Party and Euskal Herritarok, a political
coalition linked to ETA, came in second and third respectively in
last month's Basque regional elections. The moderate Basque
Nationalist Party that supports ETA aims but opposes its violence
placed first.
	   Euskal Herritarok said the elections showed that Basques wanted
to see political negotiations to resolve the dispute over Basque
independence _ one of the last armed conflicts in Western Europe.
	   The government said it interpreted the election results to mean
that many Basques do not want independence.
	   ETA, which stands in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   Before the truce, the group had been targeting town councilors
from Aznar's Popular Party in retaliation for the government's
hard-line policies, killing six in the past 15 months.

Parole board reduces sentence of woman who posted pig fliers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli woman who posted fliers portraying
the Prophet Mohammed as a pig won a reduction in her sentence for
good behavior and is scheduled for release Monday.
	   Tatiana Suszkin was sentenced to 24 months in prison after
posting drawings showing the Muslim prophet as a pig on the doors
of Arab-owned shops in the West Bank town of Hebron last year.
Muslims, as well as Jews, consider pigs to be unclean.
	   Suszkin's parole board on Wednesday reduced her sentence by a
third for good behavior, her lawyer, Sean Casper, said Thursday.
She will be released on Monday unless the prosecution appeals the
decision.
	   ``She's in good spirits,'' Casper said.
	   Israel radio reported that the Shin Bet security service opposed
the reduction in Suszkin's release and was discussing the issue
with the state attorney.
	   If Suszkin is released, she must contact the police twice a day,
according to Orit Messer-Harel, spokeswoman for the Prisons
Authority. Suszkin would also be prohibited from leaving the Tel
Aviv area and would have to observe an 8 p.m. curfew, Messer-Harel
said.
	   The posters set off clashes in Hebron, a town of 450 Jewish
settlers and 130,000 Palestinians. They also triggered outrage
throughout the Muslim world, including angry street protests in
Bangladesh and Iran, and rulings by Muslim clerics that insulting
the prophet should be punishable by death. Israeli leaders
condemned her actions.
	   Suszkin, a art school dropout and a supporter of the outlawed
anti-Arab Kach group, was convicted of committing a racist act,
supporting a terrorist organization, attempting to create religious
offense and attempted vandalism. She was also convicted of
endangering life by throwing rocks at Arab drivers.

Tajikistan troops retake northern city from rebels

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops claimed Thursday
they had largely driven rebel fighters out of a city in northern
Tajikistan after two days of heavy fighting that left dozens dead.
	   The fierce battle for Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125
miles) north of the capital, Dushanbe, was one of the most serious
outbursts of violence since a peace accord was signed last year,
ending five years of civil war in the small, impoverished Central
Asian nation.
	   The government press service said up to 100 government troops
have been killed, but presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov put the
death count at 39. He said 50 rebels had been killed, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The presidential press service said government soldiers were in
full control of the city, which the rebels stormed Wednesday. The
government troops have also surrounded the rebels' headquarters
near Khodzhand, the press service said.
	   However, the ITAR-Tass news agency said there was still fighting
in and around the old fortress in the center of Khodzhand.
	   Tajikistan's Vice Premier Abdurakhmon Azimov said in a radio
broadcast that ``there will be no negotiations or consideration of
the rebels' demands. The matter in question is to block and
liquidate them.''
	   The rebels were still in control of the northern town of Aini,
about 140 kilometers (87 miles) northeast of Dushanbe. They have
taken all government buildings, appointed a new police chief, and
confiscated large amounts of industrial explosives from a local
factory, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But a strategically important mountain pass, just below the
town, was still in government hands, and small groups of refugees
were moving along toward Dushanbe, Interfax said.
	   The attackers were led by Makhmud Khudoberdyev, a former army
colonel who turned against hardline President Emomali Rakhmonov
last year, authorities said. The rebel forces were estimated to
number several hundred, possibly as many as 1,000.
	   Khudoberdyev issued a statement Thursday, and said he would not
negotiate with the government until it broadcasts his demands on
national television and radio.
	   ``We have decided to enter the political arena ... to force the
Rakhmonov government to listen to the voice of its own people and
to end the terror against its political opponents,'' the statement
said.
	   Khudoberdyev said that ``Rakhmonov and his government do not
want peace in Tajikistan, preferring the use of force to
negotiations.''
	   Khudoberdyev claimed that his supporters had planted mines on a
dam of a local power plant, ``which if burst would flood huge
territories in Central Asia.''
	   ``Hot heads in Tajikistan and outside it should make a choice:
Either peace in Tajikistan, or millions of victims for the sake of
preserving Rakhmonov's ambitions,'' Khudoberdyev said.
	   Representatives of seven nations, along with the United Nations
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, met in
the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, to discuss potential solutions.
	   The civil war was waged between Rakhmonov's secular government
and the mostly Muslim opposition. Since the peace deal was signed,
the main opposition groups have been participating in a National
Reconciliation Commission.
	   However, a number of warlords have refused to recognize the deal
and continue to attack government forces.
	   Russia has about 25,000 troops in Tajikistan to support the
government, with most deployed along the country's southern border
with Afghanistan to prevent an influx of drugs and weapons. The
Russian forces were not involved in the latest fighting.

Bin Laden `hero' to some who warn U.S. against his capture

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An Islamic militant group threatened
Thursday to retaliate if Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden is
arrested, and described Washington's No. 1 enemy as a ``hero'' to
Muslims worldwide.
	   Bin Laden, believed to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were
indicted Wednesday by a U.S. court in the U.S. embassy bombings in
Africa and are accused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the
United States. The U.S. State Department also announced a reward of
up to dlrs 5 million for bin Laden's capture.
	   ``It is a challenge to the entire Muslim world. ... Bin Laden is
a hero of the Muslim world,'' said Omar Warsi, a leader of
Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or
Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet. ``If anything happens to
him, America will be responsible.''
	   Many Sipah-e-Sahaba followers are fighting in neighboring
Afghanistan alongside the Taliban army, which rules 90 percent of
Afghanistan and has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
those areas.
	   Warsi's group is well-armed with everything from machine guns to
rocket launchers. In Pakistan, it has been blamed in the killings
of hundreds of Shiite Muslims, whom it reviles as non-Muslims based
on a centuries-old dispute over who was the proper successor to the
Prophet Mohammed.
	   In Afghanistan, a Taliban spokesman vowed to protect bin Laden
``at any cost.''
	   ``We cannot allow any harm to come to Osama because he is a
Muslim and a guest,'' said Abdul Hai Muttmayan, who was reached by
satellite telephone in the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar.
	   Harakat-ul-Ansar, a Pakistan-based organization labeled a
terrorist group by the United States, said, however, that
foreigners in Pakistan ``have nothing to fear from us.''
	   Harakat is considered a strong supporter of bin Laden's, and
several Harakat followers were killed in the U.S. missile attack on
alleged bin Laden terror sites in Afghanistan.
	   ``What the United States does is their business,'' said Abdul
Bassit, a Harakat follower. He added, however, that the United
States should know bin Laden ``is a good Muslim, and all the Muslim
world thinks he is a good Muslim.''
	   The Taliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not be
extradited. However, they have set up a judicial inquiry to accept
evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity and have
promised to prosecute him if the evidence warrants it.
	   ``The United States is hostile to Osama and it is wrong for them
to do anything without any proof and they have no case against
Osama,'' Muttmayan said.
	   Washington blames bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, for the Aug. 7
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224
people, including 12 Americans, and injured an estimated 5,000
people.
	   The United States retaliated Aug. 20, firing Tomahawk cruise
missiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in eastern
Afghanistan. At least 26 people were killed, but damage to the area
was not considered extensive.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan evacuated nonessential staff and
family members prior to the August bombing of Afghanistan, fearing
retaliation. While some embassy workers are back, their dependents
and about 30 percent of the staff have not been allowed to return.
	   Embassy officials said no fresh security warnings followed
Wednesday's indictment. Security measures already in place include
cement barricades blocking the road leading to the U.S. Embassy in
Islamabad and razor-sharp barbed wire topping the brick-walled
compound.
	   In the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, on the border
with Afghanistan, the U.S. consulate is surrounded by barbed wire
and protected by an armored personnel carrier and dozens of armed
police.

Report: labor costs in Singapore five times higher than some

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's labor costs have risen to levels
five times those of some of its regional rivals, putting
manufacturers here at a distinct disadvantage, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Information gathered by the Singapore National Employers
Federation show labor costs, comprising regular wages and pension
payments but excluding bonuses, now average dlrs 7 an hour in the
affluent city-state.
	   The figure contrasts sharply with some of Singapore's principal
competitors, said The Straits Times. For example, hourly labor
costs average dlrs 1.40 in West Malaysia and dlrs 1.20 in Thailand,
the report said.
	   Entering its first economic slowdown since a recession in the
mid-1980s, Singapore is expected to unveil a host of cost-cutting
moves later this month to aid beleaguered businesses.
	   The government has said it will concentrate on slashing labor
costs, and is almost certain to include reductions in wages and a
major cut in company contributions to Singapore's mandatory
state-run pension fund.
	   But some economists say the measures to reduce business costs
will probably have greater success slowing Singapore's rise in
unemployment than improving competitiveness and luring investment.

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen met with the leaders of Oman and the United Arab
Emirates Thursday to press for support for possible strikes against
Iraq, but he appeared to gain little backing.
	   In Oman, Cohen met with Sultan Qaboos, who said he opposed any
unilateral U.S. strike against Iraq.
	   ``The issue must be handled through the United Nations,'' Qaboos
said, according to Omani officials. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Cohen earlier visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.
	   At least publicly, there appears to be little support for any
U.S. military action against Iraq.
	   ``We see no reason to provoke a crisis with Iraq other than to
distract attention from the president's personal problems,'' the
Dubai-based Al-Bayan newspaper said in an editorial.
	   Reflecting the feeling in the Arab world that Washington is
tough on Iraq and soft on Israel, Egypt's Al-Akhbar said that ``the
giant United States has become a lion before Iraq but an ostrich
and a helpless rat before Israel.''
	   ``Can the United States imagine that there is a country, whether
Arab or not, except its subservient Britain, which can say `yes' to
striking Iraq?'' Al-Akhbar, a state-owned newspaper, asked in a
front-page editorial.
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to try and force Baghdad to rescind its Saturday
decision to end cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. The U.N.
Security Council has condemned the Iraqi decision.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.
	   It is not clear, however, whether the United States' Gulf allies
would allow the use of bases on their territory.
	   On Tuesday, a Saudi official said King Fahd told the defense
secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks
on Iraq.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   But the Pentagon said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq.
	   During the standoff between Iraq and the U.N. over weapons
inspectors in February, Kuwait was the only Arab state that opened
its air bases to U.S. and British warplanes.
	   Cohen earlier visited Bahrain and Kuwait.

China scorns Dalai Lama, warns Washington over contacts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With the Dalai Lama readying peace overtures to
Beijing while on a U.S. tour, China scorned the exiled Tibetan
leader as a separatist Thursday and warned Washington not to
support him.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao accused the Dalai
Lama of having agitated for Tibet's independence from China for
years.
	   ``There are no facts to prove that he is repentant,'' Zhu said
at a twice-weekly media briefing.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin offered to restart a dialogue with
the Dalai Lama in June as long as the Tibetan leader renounced
separatism and stated that Tibet and Taiwan are part of China. A
spokesman for the Chinese government was quoted Thursday by state
media as saying those conditions still stand.
	   Aides to the Dalai Lama have said he will deliver a response to
the Chinese offer during a current 10-day visit to the United
States, possibly during his four-day stay in Washington, which
starts Saturday.
	   It was unclear how far the Dalai Lama was willing to go to
satisfy Chinese demands. He has argued for years that he wants true
autonomy, not independence for Tibet. Many exiled Tibetans have
also grown impatient with his support for non-violent struggle
against China's often harsh 47-year rule of their fervently
Buddhist homeland.
	   The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet amid a failed anti-Chinese
uprising in 1959, has since gained a worldwide following, won the
Nobel Peace Prize and met with world leaders _ prominence that has
stung China.
	   Zhu, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, warned Washington
not to arrange any meetings between the Dalai Lama and senior U.S.
officials.
	   If Washington does so, ``it plays a role in conniving and
supporting his activities which will seriously hurt the feelings of
the Chinese people,'' Zhu said. He added that recently warm
Chinese-U.S. ties would be at risk.
	   During a nationally televised news conference in Beijing in
June, U.S. President Bill Clinton suggested to Chinese President
Jiang that Jiang meet with the Dalai Lama and said the two might
even like each other.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan discussed a water
sharing dispute Thursday, part of an attempt to improve relations
between the nuclear rivals even as they continued skirmishes along
the Kashmir border.
	   Thursday was the first day of weeklong talks on a range of
issues that have been overshadowed by the neighbors' main dispute:
their competing claims to the Himalayan border region of Kashmir.
	   India had hoped progress on other issues could improve the
atmosphere and enable a breakthrough on Kashmir. But Pakistan
maintains that no progress can be made without a Kashmir
resolution.
	   Since their twin independence in 1947, India and Pakistan have
fought two wars over Kashmir, a border region divided between them
that both claim in its entirety. The two sides regularly skirmish
over Kashmir _ Indian police reported Thursday that three civilians
were killed by a Pakistani shell that landed in a northwestern
region of Indian-held Kashmir Wednesday night.
	   Their enmity and Kashmir's central role in it became an
international concern in May, when India and Pakistan conducted
underground tests, declared themselves nuclear powers and generated
global fears of a nuclear confrontation.
	   Hopes were raised when Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif met in July and
agreed to resume peace negotiations that had been suspended in
1997. But when Pakistan's top foreign office bureaucrat and his
Indian counterpart met last month in the Pakistani capital to
discuss Kashmir, their consultations yielded little more than
pledges to meet again in February.
	   Like those talks, Thursday's meeting between water ministry
officials from India and Pakistan ended inconclusively, with a
promise to meet again on an as yet undetermined date.
	   Z. Hasan, who led India's delegation, told reporters the two
sides merely ``exchanged views'' and reviewed negotiations last
held in 1992 on the use of the Jhelum River, which flows through
Kashmir.
	   ``The differences remain but we shall try to work on them. It is
a complex issue,'' Hasan said. ``We said we should begin at he
point at which we left during the last series of talks, but they
wanted everything afresh.''
	   Under a 1960 agreement, Pakistan was to have unrestricted use of
the waters of the Jhelum. India wants to construct a dam to control
the Jhelum's flow to make the river navigable in the dry season.
India says the dam would not affect the water flow to Pakistan, but
Pakistan has argued that the plan conflicts with the 1960
agreement.
	   The dispute is all the more difficult because it involves a
river in Kashmir. Hasan acknowledged the problem had more to do
with politics than water.
	   Six days of talks are scheduled through Nov. 13 in New Delhi.
Friday, defense ministry officials take up the tangled issue of
Siachen, a glacier battlefield in Kashmir.
	   An Indian foreign ministry official had indicated the best that
could be hoped for was an agreement to stop the almost daily
skirmishing across Siachen. The two countries cannot even agree on
whether they agreed to withdraw troops from the glacier when they
last met on the issue, in 1992.
	   Other issues on the New Delhi agenda include a proposal to start
bus service between the Indian capital and the Pakistani border
city of Lahore, and a possible deal for Pakistan to sell
electricity to India. Officials from both sides have said they
expect few breakthroughs in New Delhi.

losses &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Facing a big loss this year, Singapore's
government-linked Keppel conglomerate announced Thursday it will
reduce its work force by 10 percent and sell, merge or close 50 of
its 600 companies.
	   Keppel Chairman Sim Kee Boon told reporters without elaboration
that the group, which now has 9,000 workers, faces ``quite a big
loss.'' He added that the group, which includes banking, shipyard
and property development divisions among others, should return to
profits in 1999.
	   ``We have decided on severe cost-cutting measures leading to
about 100 million Singapore dollar (dlrs 60 million) savings per
year, or about 12 percent of the group's overhead,'' he said.
	   The savings don't include relief expected to come from
government measures such as a cut in mandatory company contribution
to employees' retirement programs, he said.
	   ``Since the Asian financial crisis (began) last year, few in the
region have been spared,'' Sim said. ``For the Keppel group, it
seems 1985 has revisited us.'' That year was the beginning of
Singapore's last recession.
	   As part of ``some serious spring cleaning,'' Keppel will sell,
merge or close about 50 companies that either don't fit into the
group's core business or have ``persistently underperformed,'' he
said.
	   ``We have to energetically prune and remove deadwood,'' Sim
said.
	   Among the companies being sold will be the regional liner
shipping business of Keppel Telecommunication and Transportation
Ltd., the U.S. leisure and aviation businesses of Keppel Marine
Industries Ltd. as well as trading and general contracting
businesses under Keppel Integrated Engineering Ltd.
	   ``Some of these divestments will not be immediate,'' he said.
``We will dispose of them over time, at prices we are happy with.
If not next year, then maybe the year after.''

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Computer hackers can finally come out in this
law-abiding island state. They are wanted to test software at a
Singapore exhibition next June that will promote cyber security.
	   ``We are looking for individuals or teams who are interested in
taking up the challenge of infiltrating firewalls set up by our
sponsors,'' said Jimmy Lau, president of Reed Exhibition Companies
and one of the organizers of the exhibition.
	   ``This will provide our sponsors an opportunity to demonstrate
the effectiveness of their products at Infosecurity Asia '99,'' Lau
said in a statement.
	   Firewalls are programs designed to protect software from
hackers, or unauthorized infiltrators.
	   The exhibition is co-organized by National Computer Systems, a
subsidiary of the Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. group.
	   ``In this age of e-commerce, we need to protect the information
and network infrastructure of our customers against possible
corruption,'' said Lee Kwok Cheong, chief executive officer of NCS.
	   The exercise will be carried out in a controlled environment,
where hackers will attempt to penetrate various demonstration
sites.
	   Said Lau: ``Rest assured, there will be no hacking of computer
systems outside of the demonstration environment.''

Burkina Faso defends decision to shelter Algerian militant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ President Blaise Campaore on
Thursday defended Burkina Faso's decision to shelter an Algerian
Islamic militant recently expelled from Switzerland.
	   ``Burkina is an African land where Africans who have found
shelter on other continents are welcomed,'' Compaore said, calling
his country's decision to give refuge to Ahmed Zaoui a
``humanitarian act.''
	   Algeria has laid a diplomatic complaint with Burkina Faso's
ambassador in Algiers, accusing Zaoui of being a planner of
terrorist acts.
	   Zaoui, a former leading member of Algeria's banned Islamic
Salvation Front who has since formed a dissident faction of the
party, arrived with his family in Burkina Faso a week ago after
being deported from Switzerland.
	   French authorities have linked him to the radical Armed Islamic
Group blamed for most massacres in Algeria, where some 75,000
people have been killed in an Islamic insurgency, now in its
seventh year.
	   Switzerland had been reluctant to deport him to Algeria, and
waited until it found a third country to accept him.
	   About 20 other Muslim militants have been in Burkina Faso for
years after being deported by France.

	   MERSEBURG, Germany (AP) _ About 800 people were evacuated
Thursday in the eastern German city of Merseburg while explosives
experts defused an old World War II bomb, police said.
	   The U.S.-made bomb was found on Wednesday when workmen excavated
a construction site, police said. Merseburg is located about 20
kilometers (12 miles) west of Leipzig.
	   Explosives experts needed several hours to successfully disarm
the bomb because water had seeped into the pit and had to be pumped
out, police said.
	   Old bombs from the war are regularly found to this day in
Germany. With the extensive reconstruction in eastern Germany
following the fall of communist barriers, most recent finds have
been uncovered there.

US envoy sees progress in Kosovo peace efforts

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite reports of a new shoot-out
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants, the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo said Thursday that peace prospects appeared good _ if
distant _ with both sides tired of the bloodshed.
	   International efforts to bolster peace gathered momentum. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced that
the first 46 verifiers of an international mission of unarmed
observers would arrive in Kosovo next week. And France said it
would provide up to half of an armed intervention force meant to
protect the observers from attack.
	   In the latest clash, the village of Priluzje, 20 kilometers (13
miles) northwest of the provincial capital Pristina, came under
small-arms fire for several hours during the night but no one was
injured, the Serb Media Center reported.
	   The center, which spreads official Serb viewpoints, said several
houses were damaged in the ensuing shoot-out, and blamed the attack
on ethnic Albanian extremists fighting for independence.
	   Although the report could not be independently confirmed, there
have been frequent reports of violence and gunfire exchanges
despite last month's U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
	   Belgrade's independent B-92 radio reported that a Serb policeman
was abducted from a passenger bus early Thursday by members of the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army at Suva Reka, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) south of Pristina
	   Tension on a different front was generated by a dispute between
Yugoslav authorities and the U.N. war crimes tribunal. Chief Judge
Gabrielle Kirk McDonald and other tribunal members canceled a
planned visit to Belgrade for an international war crimes
conference, complaining that the Yugoslav government had refused to
issue tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbour with a visa that would
enable her to visit Kosovo.
	   Arbour had planned to gather evidence on suspected atrocities
committed during the nearly eight-month crackdown on the armed
Albanian independence struggle in Kosovo that killed hundreds,
mostly ethnic Albanian civilians, and made refugees of hundreds of
thousands.
	   The tribunal argues that it has been authorized by the U.N.
Security Council to investigate war crimes in all of Yugoslavia,
which includes Kosovo, an Albanian-majority province of Serbia,
Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
	   Kirk McDonald said authorities' refusal to issue a proper visa
represented the actions of a ``rogue state that holds the
international rule of law in contempt.'' She told reporters in The
Hague, Netherlands, that she would ask the Security Council for
``forceful action'' to make Belgrade toe the line.
	   In Pristina, Mons Nyberg of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said 46 verifiers will arrive next week and
set up operations in the southern city of Prizren.
	   The 2,000-strong Verification Mission, part of an Oct. 12 peace
agreement for Kosovo, isn't expected to be officially launched
before the second half of November. It will report on whether
Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic fully complies with the
provisions of the accord, committing him to end the assault on
militant Kosovo Albanians and substantially reduce police and
military forces in Kosovo.
	   After meeting with Kosovo's Serbian officials, Serbian President
Milan Milutinovic suggested the need for a massive military
presence was over, because ``Albanian terrorism has been
defeated.''
	   But he indicated a new crackdown could be ordered if needed ``to
defend the peace and safety ... of our citizens.''
	   France's defense minister, Alain Richard, said in Paris that
France would provide up to half of the rapid intervention force of
up to 1,800 troops assigned to protect the verifiers. The troops,
armed with tanks and helicopters, will be based in neighboring
Macedonia.
	   Despite occasional skirmishes, the U.S. envoy for Kosovo,
Christopher Hill, said there was ``serious progress'' toward a
permanent solution, although that goal remained far away.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador in Macedonia, spoke in Belgrade only
hours before a meeting with Milosevic.
	   ``We have made some serious progress, not only in reducing
violence ... but also in coming around to a political solution that
would meet basic interests of the two sides.''
	   ``We are very much on the road and moving ahead,'' he told
reporters. ``Both sides understand that the status quo is
unacceptable.''

Embassy bombing victims welcome indictment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyans and Tanzanians, angered by the
terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in their countries, Thursday
welcomed the American indictment against the alleged mastermind.
	   Exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden was charged Wednesday
with plotting the bombings and authorities offered a record dlrs 5
million reward for his capture.
	   A federal indictment charged bin Laden and Muhammad Atef, the
military commander of bin Laden's alleged terrorist organization,
with conspiracy in the Aug. 7 bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, that killed 224 people, including a dozen
Americans.
	   Judith Makamwe, a Tanzanian whose brother and mother were
wounded in the bombing, said bin Laden should be tried.
	   ``The United States has made the right decision to open charges
against the man,'' Makamwe said. ``The world will know for sure his
role in the twin bombing once he stands on the dock to answer
charges against him.''
	   Joshua Opanga, the acting permanent secretary in the Foreign
Affairs Ministry, said bin Laden deserved punishment.
	   ``Let him face the full brunt of the law,'' Opanga said.
	   But Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed, saying he feared
retaliation, refused to comment.
	   ``If we comment on the guy, we may be inviting trouble. So, in
that case, I'd rather reserve my comment.''
	   Kenyans expressed no such reservations.
	   ``He should be arrested and tried as a murderer,'' said Nairobi
taxi driver Leonard Njoroge, 30. ``I am very happy with the efforts
the Americans are making so far.''
	   More than 5,400 people were injured in Kenya and some of the
injuries led to blindness and paralysis.
	   ``If they have enough proof he is the one who masterminded the
bombing in Nairobi, then he should be arrested and asked why he did
it here if his target were Americans,'' Njoroge said.
	   Foreign Affairs spokesman David Kikaya said the indictment could
disrupt bin Laden's operations.
	   ``If he, as they allege, is really the nexus, the axis of the
terrorism, then one hopes that before they put the machinery in
place for another group to emerge the world will be much more wiser
and perhaps able to counter it,'' Kikaya said.

region. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Heavy rains in western Ukraine in recent
days have flooded 39 small towns and villages in the Zakarpattia
region, authorities said Thursday.
	   About 3,000 people were evacuated from the settlements, but no
casualties were reported, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   Floods and landslides also have damaged several roads and
railroads in the area, including those connecting smaller towns
with the regional capital of Lviv, the ministry said.
	   President Leonid Kuchma ordered Emergency Situations Minister
Valery Kalchenko to visit the flooded area Thursday and provide
``as much assistance as possible'' to the people who suffered from
the disaster, presidential spokesman Oleksandr Martynenko said.
	   Kuchma also said he himself would visit the flood-stricken
region Friday along with several ministers who are to participate
in a meeting there to assess the situation.
	   State emergency officials were also ordered to calculate losses
incurred by the floods so that the Cabinet can allocate money from
its reserve fund to help the region.
	   The ministry said nearly 1,400 people were working in
Zakarpattia to repair the damages.

Local lawmaker convicted for insulting Polish women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A politician was convicted and fined
2,000 kroner (dlrs 325) on Thursday for saying most Polish women
resemble prostitutes.
	   Uno Larsson, a member of the town council in Randers, 220
kilometers (135 miles) northwest of Copenhagen, was found guilty of
violating Denmark's law against insulting people on the basis of
race or nationality.
	   Larsson made the statement in the campaign for last March's
national elections, during a debate on removing border controls
within the European Union.
	   ``When you travel in Poland, you feel _ and pardon my French _
like 80 percent of the women are whores,'' said Larsson, a
candidate of the Danish People's Party.
	   He was not elected, but the party won 13 seats in the 179-person
legislature.

NK Varteks 4, SC Heerenveen 2; Varteks advance 5-4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VARAZDIN, Croatia (AP) _ Miljenko Mumlek scored the deciding
goal a minute from the end of extra time to give Varteks to a 4-2
win Thursday over SC Heerenveen, advancing the club 5-4 on
aggregate from the second round, second leg of the Cup Winners Cup.
	   Heerenveen won the first leg in the Netherlands 2-1.
	   Radoslav Samardzic gave Heerenveen a 1-0 lead in the 18th when
he took advantage of a defensive error, but Mumlek equalized in the
65th off a header.
	   Encouraged by a 6,000 sellout, Varteks grabbed a 2-1 lead in the
80th on a header by substitute Faik Karamberovic. That goal put the
clubs even on total goals _ and away goals _ and forced 30 minutes
of extra time.
	   Karamberovic got into the action again and appeared to get the
deciding goal in the 117th.
	   But Jan de Visser momentarily dashed Varteks' hopes with a goal
a minute later _ which would have advanced the Dutch on the
away-goal rule _ setting the stage for Mumlek's decider in the
119th.

Remaining West Indies cricket players want to leave South Africa

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Seven remaining West Indies cricket
players want to leave South Africa on Thursday, a move that would
scuttle plans for a long-awaited series here, officials said.
	   ``The situation is very serious. The players are keen to return
to London this evening,'' said Ali Bacher, managing director of the
United Cricket Board of South Africa, on Thursday.
	   Only seven of the team's 16 players arrived in Johannesburg on
Wednesday. The rest defied the West Indies Cricket Board's order to
travel to South Africa because of a money dispute with the board,
and remained in London to discuss their demands.
	   The West Indies board on Wednesday fired Brian Lara as team
captain and Carl Hooper as deputy for the three-month tour of South
Africa, which begins Tuesday. Lara and Hooper were in London.
	   It is the West Indies' first official tour of South Africa.
	   West Indies team manager Clive Lloyd said Thursday in
Johannesburg that the seven players have been discussing the idea
of leaving for ``a couple'' of days, the South African Press
Association reported.
	   ``It is one of many things that have been discussed,'' Lloyd
said. ``But hopefully we will still be able to sort everything
out.''
	   Bacher said the problem must be resolved for the sake of world
cricket, not just the two-nation competition.
	   He said he was awaiting a statement from the West Indies board
and had talked by telephone with Curtly Ambrose, another senior
player holed up in London.
	   ``There is definitely an impasse,'' Bacher said.
	   The West Indies board's decision to demote Lara and Hooper
provoked protest in Barbados, where callers to a radio show called
the actions draconian and demanded the board resign or be fired.
	   The rebel players are demanding above their tour fees for
one-day internationals and for a one-week training camp; increased
meal allowances; and some guarantee of security in crime-ridden
Johannesburg, where two Pakistani players were mugged while on tour
last year.
	   The team had a 15-year winning streak after the last major
financial dispute in the late 1970s that netted players better
contracts.

Austrian parliament enacts law to return looted and forcibly

donated art &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Sixty years after its 1938 ``Anschluss''
with Nazi Germany, Austria enacted a law providing for the return
of Jewish artworks plundered by the Nazis or donated under coercion
from postwar Austrian governments.
	   The law was adopted unanimously Thursday and covers art that
entered state-run Austrian museums and art collections under
questionable circumstances during the seven years of Nazi rule and
during Austria's occupation by the four wartime Allies immediately
after WWII.
	   Austria was annexed by the Nazis in March 1938, but for decades
after the war it cultivated the role of the first victim of Nazi
aggression. Not until 1991 did an Austrian leader, Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky, publicly acknowledged that ``not a few'' Austrians
participated in wartime atrocities.
	   Austria's first postwar government also effectively confiscated
hundreds of paintings from Jewish owners and their heirs, using a
1923 law preventing the export of artworks. The government allowed
some Jews to reclaim their artworks and take them out of the
country, but forced them to ``donate'' many others in exchange.
	   Last February, Austrian Culture Minister Elisabeth Gehrer made
an unprecedented government promise to shed light on how the state
kept back works after 1945. She decreed that museums must clarify
``beyond any doubt'' the origin of their works.
	   According to Gehrer, who is in charge of museums, about 500 art
objects were held back after 1945 under the controversial export
ban and remained as ``donations'' in Austrian museums and
galleries.
	   Up for restitution under the new law are also those artworks
museums purchased ``in good faith'' on the postwar art market, but
whose origin is in doubt. The number of these items has not yet
been determined, Gehrer said.
	   In the debate in parliament, the minister made clear the first
restitution will be made before the end of this year. She did not
elaborate.
	   While the law cannot right all wrongs, Gehrer said, it shows ``a
bit more justice'' from the government. She said Austria was
issuing a signal for a new awareness in dealing with this infamous
part of its history.
	   Andreas Kohl, the conservatives' floorleader, said the
restitution of the artworks would make the republic ``not poorer
but richer.''
	   Parliament also unanimously passed the so-called ``looted gold
law'' Thursday. Under it, Austria will distribute the equivalent of
about dlrs 8 million among Holocaust victims, thus disbursing the
value of gold looted by the Nazis which was allotted to it this
year by the so-called Tripartite Gold Commission (TGC).
	   The TGC administers those gold holdings which were confiscated
by the Nazis from the Austrian National Bank in 1938.

Hawking chooses women and scientists as ``most important''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge theoretical
physicist who wrote ``A Brief History of Time,'' said Thursday that
women and scientists are the most important people of the 20th
century.
	   Hawking said that ``although I didn't admire many of her
policies,'' former prime minister Margaret Thatcher along with
geneticist Francis Crick and physicist Paul Dirac are among his
choices of Britons who best represented British life this century.
	   He was speaking at the National Portrait Gallery which has asked
10 men and women from the media, arts, fashion, science and
business to each choose 10 ``impressive quality'' photographs of
famous and unknown Britons for a ``Faces of the Century''
millennium exhibition in October 1999.
	   The panel has to try to cover each decade and consider who might
be remembered 100 years hence. It is now selecting its images.
	   Lord Sainsbury, grocery magnate and arts benefactor, said his
choices were all of writers and artists ``because over the
centuries they are the people who are best remembered.'' His named
first choice was writer Thomas Hardy.
	   Helena Kennedy, attorney and chairman of the British Council
which promotes British culture overseas, said a photo of
demonstrators against the Vietnam War is among her choices. Film
director David Puttnam picked a photo of 1930s fascist leader Sir
Oswald Mosley saluted by his blackshirts.
	   ``In present-day multiracial, multicultural Britain, the thought
of being sure that Britain won't slip back to that has to govern
everything we do,'' Puttnam said.

Rios to quit Tour ``in a couple of years''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World No. 2 Marcelo Rios said Thursday he will
retire from the professional tennis circuit in the next couple of
years.
	   ``I think I will play for a couple more years,'' he told
reporters after beating Vincent Spadea in the third round of the
dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open.
	   ``I want to do other things in life in my late 20s,'' the
Chilean said. ``I would hate to have ten more years of playing and
traveling. I would love to do something else.''
	   Rios, 23 next month, turned pro in 1994, and briefly held the
world No. 1 spot earlier this year.
	   Last year he became the first South American to finish in the
top 10 of the ATP Tour since Ecuador's Andres Gomez in 1990.
	   But he said that life on the road is becoming a bore.
	   ``I get sick of all the traveling. I want to live in my country
like a normal guy,'' he said. ``I get tired of talking to the press
every day after every match.''

Former Kazak premier ousted from presidential race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan's former prime minister cannot run for
president because he attended an unauthorized gathering, the
country's Central Election Commission announced Thursday.
	   Akezhan Kazhegeldin was fined 6,600 tenge (dlrs 800) for
attending the founding meeting of the Movement for Fair Elections
on Oct. 2. That cost him his eligibility for the Jan. 10, 1999
presidential vote, the head of the election commission said in
Astana, the new Kazak capital, Interfax reported.
	   Four other candidates, including incumbent President Nursultan
Nazarbayev, are eligible, commission Chairwoman Zagipa Baliyeva
said.
	   Under the terms of a presidential decree, she said, people who
have been penalized for criminal offenses within the past 12 months
cannot run for president.
	   Baliyeva said Kazhegeldin could still re-enter the race if a
higher court reverses his conviction.
	   Nazarbayev remains a clear favorite in the race to lead the
former Soviet republic in Central Asia. His government has been
criticized by international human rights groups for restricting
Kazakstan's opposition and the media.

ETA says cease-fire could become permanent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with statement from government
and Herri Batasuna, background. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Basque separatist group ETA said
Thursday its six-week cease-fire could soon could be made
definitive, which would bring to a close its violent 20-year
campaign for a homeland independent of Spain.
	   ETA's statement, published in the radical newspaper Euskadi
Informacion, said ``events and progress in the coming days'' would
shape the ``definitive nature of the cease-fire.'' It gave no
details about those developments.
	   The statement came two days after the conservative government of
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar proposed talks to resolve the
conflict, his administration's first move toward ETA since the
cease-fire.
	   However, the fact that ETA's statement was written before the
government initiative prompted deputy premier Francisco Alvarez
Cascos to dismiss it as ``out of date.''
	   On Tuesday, Aznar authorized contacts with organizations linked
to what is referred to in Spain as ``ETA's World,'' and late
Wednesday his spokesman Josep Pique said the government was seeking
direct talks with the gunmen.
	   ``The next move must be made by ETA,'' Cascos told national
radio, stressing that the government had already done its bit to
ensure progress by seeking dialogue.
	   In its statement, ETA backed the so-called Lizarra Agreement
that a group of Basque political parties signed in September, which
proposed talks between ETA and the government and all-party
negotiations on the political future of the troubled region.
	   So far the government has restricted its talks offer to an
exploration of ETA's willingness to give up violence for good.
	   Kai Saez, a spokesman for the Herri Batasuna party, frequently
referred to as ETA's political wing, said the government's proposal
to talk directly to ETA was positive, but it had yet to be
complemented with a commitment to define a forum for talks on the
political roots of the conflict.
	   ``If the peace process is thought of as a 100-meter (yard) long
road, we have advanced about a meter,'' he said.

ETA says cease-fire could become permanent

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Basque separatist group ETA said
Thursday its six-week cease-fire could soon could be made
definitive, which would bring to a close its violent 20-year
campaign for a homeland independent of Spain.
	   ETA's statement, published in the radical newspaper Euskadi
Informacion, said ``events and progress in the coming days'' would
shape the ``definitive nature of the cease-fire.'' It gave no
details about those developments.
	   The statement came two days after the conservative government of
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar proposed talks to resolve the
conflict, his administration's first move toward ETA since the
cease-fire.
	   However, the fact that ETA's statement was written before the
government initiative prompted deputy premier Francisco Alvarez
Cascos to dismiss it as ``out of date.''
	   On Tuesday, Aznar authorized contacts with organizations linked
to what is referred to in Spain as ``ETA's World,'' and late
Wednesday his spokesman Josep Pique said the government was seeking
direct talks with the gunmen.
	   ``The next move must be made by ETA,'' Cascos told national
radio, stressing that the government had already done its bit to
ensure progress by seeking dialogue.
	   In its statement, ETA backed the so-called Lizarra Agreement
that a group of Basque political parties signed in September, which
proposed talks between ETA and the government and all-party
negotiations on the political future of the troubled region.
	   So far the government has restricted its talks offer to an

	   Kai Saez, a spokesman for the Herri Batasuna party, frequently

complemented with a commitment to define a forum for talks on the
political roots of the conflict.
	   ``If the peace process is thought of as a 100-meter (yard) long

French-speaking countries press fight against English domination

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The French-speaking world Thursday launched a new
effort to curb the domination of English in the United Nations and
other international organizations.
	   The campaign is no less than a struggle for a ``new humanism'',
said former U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in the
keynote address to a two day symposium on ``plurilingualism''.
	   The conference was dedicated to promoting use of all six U.N.
languages _ including Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Spanish _ but
first-day speeches were only in French, with interpretation only
into English.
	   ``To be French-speaking is to struggle, beyond the defense of
the French language, for tolerance, respect of linguistic and
cultural diversity, for the preservation of a plural civilization _
in a word, for a new humanism,'' said Boutros-Ghali,
secretary-general of La Francophonie, the host organization.
	   Boutros-Ghali, who speaks fluent French, English and Arabic, is
the first secretary-general of the organization, whose name means
the French-speaking world. It groups 49 countries with linguistic
or cultural ties to France.
	   French has ``the most beautiful words in the world,'' but the
cause is wider than that, he said.
	   Diversity is a fact of nature, and linguistic and cultural
diversity is part of the richness of humanity, Boutros-Ghali said.
	   ``To choose to defend plurilingualism when faced with the
growing temptation of unilingualism is not born of a jealous
corporatism or a nostalgia for power,'' he said.
	   ``It is a profound, essential and natural necessity.''
	   The United States vetoed Boutros-Ghali for a second term in the
U.N. post in 1996. He took over the Francophonie post a year ago.
	   There are more than 3,000 languages spoken in the world, but
countries share only around 60 official languages, according to
conference organizers.
	   Although the languages of the U.N. cover most of the world,
there are still 40 countries where none of the six is officially
spoken.
	   Mounir Zahran, Egyptian ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva,
insisted that the symposium was not just about pressing the cause
of French.
	   ``We have the same problem with Arabs. It can be a source of
worry for them when they have to conduct business in English,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Aleksandras Lileikis, charged with
sending scores of Jews to their deaths during the Nazi occupation,
appeared in court Thursday in a wheelchair and proclaimed his
innocence, but was rushed away in an ambulance minutes later.
	   Doctors said the 91-year-old Lileikis may have suffered a heart
attack and the judge postponed the court proceedings until Monday.
	   The Baltic News Service reported that Lileikis had an attack of
stenocardia, but the hospital to which he was taken refused comment
on his condition to The Associated Press.
	   Lileikis' trial was to have begun in September, but was delayed
when his lawyers said he was too ill to come to court. The court
appointed a panel of doctors to examine him, which said he was in
poor health but fit to stand trial.
	   Lileikis was head of the security police in Vilnius during the
1941-44 Nazi occupation. He is charged with genocide for allegedly
turning over more than 70 Jews to a Nazi execution squad.
	   ``I was working for my nation and my country for all my life and
now I am old and weak. But I can still say I did nothing wrong in
my lifetime,'' Lileikis told the court from his wheelchair.
	   Minutes later, his hands began trembling, he started reciting
the Lord's Prayer and he asked for more air. His daughter rushed to
his side, crying and handing pills to her father.
	   The judge called for a recess and asked doctors to examine
Lileikis, who was taken to an adjoining room and then rushed away
in an ambulance.
	   It is the first Nazi war-crimes trial in the countries of the
former Soviet Union. Some Jewish groups have criticized Lithuania
for being slow in beginning the trial, alleging that officials hope
Lileikis will die before the start of proceedings that would bring
painful reminders of the slaughter of the occupation years.
	   About 90 percent of Lithuania's 240,000 pre-war Jews died during
the occupation.
	   ``With Liliekis' statement that all his actions stemmed from his
Lithuania patriotisms, it should be obvious to Lithuanian
authorities how important it is for Lithuania's future that such
patriots be tried and punished in a Lithuania court of law,''
Efraim Zuroff of the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Jerusalem commented to The AP.
	   Lileikis emigrated to the United States in 1955, and lived in
Norwood, Massachusetts, where he worked for a publishing house. He
returned to Lithuania in 1996 as a U.S. court took steps to revoke
his citizenship and deport him.

Northern Ireland presses for EU funding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium's (AP) _ Northern Ireland's Nobel Peace
Prize-winning first minister pressed the European Union Thursday to
retain the province's high-priority status for EU funding.
	   ``We obviously want to get the best deal we can for Northern
Ireland,'' David Trimble told reporters during a fact-finding
mission to EU headquarters by members of the new Northern Ireland
Assembly.
	   In recent years, the EU has contributed dlrs 2.1 billion to
Northern Ireland in economic and social support through a special
Peace and Reconciliation fund and regular funding earmarked for the
Union's poorest regions.
	   EU Regional Development Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies on
Wednesday said aid would remain at current levels until at least
2003. But EU Commission President Jacques Santer warned the EU's
generosity may not last.
	   ``The European Union is not a rubber stamping check book,''
Santer said in a speech to the Northern Irish representatives
Thursday. ``Entrepreneurship and enterprise need to replace
subsidies and grants as fast as possible.''
	   EU officials say Northern Ireland, although still facing serious
economic and social difficulties, on longer qualifies for the
highest priority funding which is only available to regions with
wealth per head below 75 percent of the Union's average.
	   With up to 10 nations among the EU's poor neighbors in Eastern
Europe seeking to join the EU in the next decade, Northern Ireland
will face even tougher competition for a share of European
handouts.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments after visit to NATO headquarters &QL;

 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ On his first visit to the EU head
office, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer reiterated his
country's commitment to European integration but also its
insistence on paying less for European Union membership.
	   Like the government of ex-chancellor Helmut Kohl, Germany's new
leadership believes EU plans to bring in 11 new countries can only
happen on the basis of a fairer distribution of membership fees,
Fischer said.
	   Fischer also visited the NATO headquarters where he met with
Secretary General Javier Solana.
	   Fischer's Green Party was long opposed to NATO's Cold War
policies, but Fischer has since expressed support for the alliance.
After meeting with Solana, he joked to reporters:
	   ``We did not talk about the dissolution of NATO. I would like to
point out that that was not a demand I made here today.''
	   He said he briefed Solana on the decision, announced Wednesday,
letting Germany participate in NATO air surveillance of
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province. Germany has committed 350 soldiers
and 16 unmanned spy planes to help monitor an Oct. 12 peace deal
under which Serb forces must leave Kosovo.
	   At the EU, Fischer said the new Bonn government will continue to
seek a significant cut in membership payments.
	   He signaled that Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland must
relinquish financial perks and free up money for poorer potential
newcomers.
	   Over the 1993-1999 period, the EU is spending dlrs 18 billion in
special development aid _ known as `Cohesion Funds' _ to its four
poorest members. They want to retain special funding, even if
Cyprus and 10 East European nations join the EU in the decade
ahead.
	   ``I wouldn't say the cohesion funds were created for eternity,''
Fischer told a joint press conference with European Commission
President Jacques Santer.
	   ``These questions must be addressed by partners in a spirit of
mutual confidence. A spirit of compromise is going to be needed
from everybody ... to share the burden of enlargement.''
	   The money dispute is part of as yet fruitless efforts to
overhaul the EU budget and institutions ahead of enlargement.
Germany assumes the EU's rotating presidency on Jan. 1 and must
bring the EU reform negotiations to conclusion.
	   Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden insist on changing
the way the EU is financed. They don't object to being net
contributors but to the size of their overpayments _ almost dlrs 45
billion a year in Germany's case.
	   Fischer said the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
favored enlarging the EU but he put no date on when the first new
countries would be expected to join. The European Commission is
using 2002 as a target year for cost-calculation purposes only.
	   ``I would be very happy if we can do it by 2002 but let's be
realistic,'' said Fischer.
	   He said maintaining the enlargement momentum ``to provide the
architecture of the future Europe'' would ``essential'' for his
government during its EU presidency in the first half of 1999.
	   On Wednesday, the European Commission said preliminary talks to
bring Cyprus and 10 East European nations into the EU were
``broadly on track'' and that candidate nations by and large
remained committed to economic and political reforms.
	   This year, the EU began preliminary talks with Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus and opened
``preparatory'' talks with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.

New conservative daily hits Spanish newsstands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A new daily hit Spanish newsstands
Thursday, the brainchild of a prominent conservative journalist who
also sits on Spain's Royal Language Academy.
	   The newspaper is called La Razon _ which translates as sense or
reason.
	   Behind its creation is Luis Maria Anson, editor of the
conservative daily ABC which he left in 1997 to become chairman of
the Televisa Spain, a subsidiary of the Mexican media conglomerate.
	   The new paper has a tabloid format and a promotional launch
price of 50 pesetas (dlrs .30). Eventually it will go up to 125
pesetas the price of most other dailies.
	   It joins a field of about half-a-dozen major national dailies in
Spain.

Fifteen people given death sentences by Sierra Leonean judge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Fifteen civilians convicted of
treason for collusion with Sierra Leone's ousted military junta
were on Thursday condemned to death by hanging.
	   The sentences were passed by Justice Sydney Warne a day after
the 15 were convicted by jury for treason. Several of the condemned
wept as they heard their sentences being read.
	   The judge also handed down a 5-year jail sentence to former
President Joseph Saidu Momoh, who headed a one-party state from
1985 until his ouster in 1992 and who had close ties to the junta,
for conspiracy to commit treason.
	   Five people were found not guilty of treason and other offenses
and were released Wednesday.
	   With the rulings, 43 civilians have been convicted of treason.
Most face death by hanging. Last month, hundreds of people cheered
during the public execution of 24 army officers convicted of
participating in the bloody May 1997 coup that brought the junta to
power.
	   While President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's elected government has been
returned to power, fighting continues between Sierra Leonean forces
and ousted junta fighters and their rebel allies.
	   The rebels have killed, raped and maimed villagers as part of a
brutal campaign against the government. They have also threatened
mass killings in retaliation for the arrest of their leader, Foday
Sankoh, and other rebels. Sankoh was recently sentenced to death
but has appealed his conviction.

Indonesia, Malaysia take territorial dispute to World Court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Hoping to end a decades-long
squabble, Indonesia and Malaysia have taken their territorial
dispute over two small islands to the World Court.
	   The southeast Asian neighbors both claim sovereignty over the
Celebes Sea islands of Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan, located in
a small bay off the northeast coast of Borneo.
	   Their request, filed jointly Monday before the United Nations'
highest judicial arm, did not say whether the disputed islands are
inhabited or rich in minerals.
	   By agreeing to take the case to the World Court and promising to
respect its ruling as final, the case should be resolved more
quickly. Even so, written and oral arguments still are expected to
take about two years, court spokesman Laurence Blairon said
Thursday.
	   Over the next several weeks, the court will set a time limit for
the written pleadings from the parties, Blairon said.
	   The argument over the islands dates back to 1969, when Indonesia
and Malaysia failed to reach agreement during technical discussions
about the overlapping continental shelf that borders the
neighboring countries.
	   Leaders of the two nations decided in October 1996 to take their
case to the World Court after failing to resolve the dispute after
years of bilateral talks.
	   The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice,
has no enforcement powers and relies on nations to voluntarily
comply with its rulings.

Flooding engulfs hundreds of homes across Eastern Europe

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Floods engulfed hundreds of houses
across Eastern Europe Thursday, forcing thousands to be evacuated
as rivers from Slovenia to Romania burst their banks.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
	   Floods hit Slovenia hardest, with heavy rains inundating large
parts of the country, sending water pouring into hundreds of homes
and causing the closure of main traffic corridors.
	   Slovene state radio reported the area of Celje, northeast of the
capital Ljubljana, suffered the most severe damage. About 2,000
firemen and rescue teams were sent to help thousands of people
whose houses were flooded, as water up to a half-meter (nearly two
feet) high, flowed through streets.
	   The railway and highway linking Ljubljana and the northern city
of Maribor were closed due to the storm and flooding. Several other
areas were left without electricity and water. The situation was
worse in Slovenia where the state-run news agency STA reported that
a number of local roads have been closed for traffic due to floods
or slides.
	   Officials warned that the level of the Sava River, which runs
across the country and through Ljubljana, would reach a critical
level in the evening.
	   The government held an emergency session, approving funds for
repairing destroyed infrastructure.
	   In Romania, border police evacuated 6,000 people from nine
villages after the Tisa (Tisza) River overflowed following days of
heavy rain, which took local officials by surprise.
	   People were forced to spend the night outdoors in the pouring
rain, said Col. Teodor Cristea of the border police in the city of
Baia Mare, some 450 kilometers (281 miles) northwest of Bucharest.
He said the army would send in supplies of food and tents.
	   The Tisa flows from western Ukraine, along the Romanian border
through Hungary and Yugoslavia into the Danube.
	   Some places in the Czech Republic also suffered from high water.
In the town of Usti nad Labem, 100 kilometers (62 miles) northwest
of Prague, a few houses were partially flooded and farther
downstream on the Elbe River, several cellars were reported under
water near the town of Litovel.
	   In Hungary, there were flood alerts, but water levels were
reported to be subsiding.

 &UR; U.S. Defense Secretary in Egypt after wrapping up Gulf tour &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Cohen ending Gulf tour, meeting Emirates
leader, arriving in Egypt. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen ended a
six-nation tour of the Gulf on Thursday, saying the United States
has ``the support it needs.'' But he appeared to gain little public
backing for possible military strikes against Iraq.
	   In the United Arab Emirates, his last stop, President Sheik
Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan called for a political solution to the
crisis with Iraq, the official Emirates News Agency reported.
	   Earlier, in Oman, Sultan Qaboos reportedly told Cohen that he
opposed any unilateral American strike against Iraq, which ended
its cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Saturday.
	   ``The issue must be handled through the United Nations,'' Qaboos
was quoted as saying by Omani officials.
	   Cohen also visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. He
arrived later Thursday in Egypt, where he met President Hosni
Mubarak and Egypt's defense and foreign ministers in the Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-Sheik, the Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Cohen, said the secretary had
completed ``successful consultations'' with Gulf leaders.
	   ``Based on his meetings, Secretary Cohen is confident that the
United States will have the support it needs to take appropriate
action to uphold the United Nations Security Council resolutions,''
Bacon said in a statement released by the Pentagon.
	   It did not detail what the responses might be.
	   Cohen was still expected to visit Jordan and Turkey.
	   At least publicly, there has been little support across the
region for any U.S. military action against Iraq, which has gained
sympathy for its worsening plight under sweeping U.N. sanctions.
	   ``We see no reason to provoke a crisis with Iraq other than to
distract attention from the president's personal problems,'' the
Dubai-based Al-Bayan newspaper said in an editorial.
	   Reflecting the feeling in the Arab world that Washington is
tough on Iraq and soft on Israel, Egypt's Al-Akhbar said that ``the
giant United States has become a lion before Iraq but an ostrich
and a helpless rat before Israel.''
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to try and force Baghdad to rescind its decision to
end cooperation with U.N. inspectors. The U.N. Security Council has
condemned the Iraqi decision.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.
	   It is not clear, however, whether the United States' Gulf allies
would allow the use of bases on their territory.
	   On Tuesday, a Saudi official said King Fahd told the defense
secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks
on Iraq.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   But the Pentagon said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq.
	   During the standoff between Iraq and the U.N. over weapons
inspectors in February, Kuwait was the only Arab state that opened
its air bases to U.S. and British warplanes.

US envoy sees progress in Kosovo peace efforts

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite reports of a new shoot-out
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants, the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo said Thursday that peace prospects appeared good _ if
distant _ with both sides tired of the bloodshed.
	   International efforts to bolster peace gathered momentum. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced that
the first 46 members of an international mission of unarmed
observers would arrive next week in Kosovo. And France said it
would provide up to half of an armed intervention force meant to
protect the observers from attack.
	   In the latest clash, the village of Priluzje, 20 kilometers (13
miles) northwest of the provincial capital Pristina, came under
small-arms fire for several hours during the night but no one was
injured, the Serb Media Center reported.
	   The center, which spreads official Serb viewpoints, said several
houses were damaged in the ensuing shoot-out, and blamed the attack
on ethnic Albanian militants fighting for independence.
	   Although the report could not be independently confirmed, there
have been frequent reports of violence and gunfire exchanges
despite last month's U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
	   Despite occasional skirmishes, the U.S. envoy for Kosovo,
Christopher Hill, said there was ``serious progress'' toward a
permanent solution, although that goal remained far away.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador in Macedonia, spoke in Belgrade only
hours before a meeting with Milosevic.
	   ``We have made some serious progress, not only in reducing
violence ... but also in coming around to a political solution that
would meet basic interests of the two sides.''
	   ``We are very much on the road and moving ahead,'' he told
reporters. ``Both sides understand that the status quo is
unacceptable.''
	   Belgrade's independent B-92 radio reported that a Serb policeman
was abducted from a passenger bus early Thursday by members of the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army at Suva Reka, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) south of Pristina
	   Tension on a different front was generated by a dispute between
Yugoslav authorities and the U.N. war crimes tribunal. Chief Judge
Gabrielle Kirk McDonald and other tribunal members canceled a
planned visit to Belgrade for an international war crimes
conference, complaining that the Yugoslav government had refused to
issue tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbour with a visa that would
enable her to visit Kosovo.
	   Arbour planned to gather evidence on suspected atrocities
committed during the nearly eight-month crackdown on the armed
ethnic Albanian independence struggle in Kosovo that killed
hundreds, mostly ethnic Albanian civilians, and made refugees of
hundreds of thousands more.
	   The trlic.
	   Kirk McDonald said authorities' refusal to issue a proper visa
represented the actions of a ``rogue state that holds the
international rule of law in contempt.'' She told reporters in The
Hague that she would ask the Security Council for ``forceful
action'' to make Belgrade toe the line.
	   In Pristina, Mons Nyberg of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said 46 verifiers will arrive next week and
set up operations in the southern city of Prizren.
	   The 2,000-strong Verification Mission, part of an Oct. 12 peace
agreement for Kosovo, isn't expected to be officially launched
before the second half of November. It will report on whether
Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic fully complies with the
accord, which commits him to end the assault on militant Kosovo
Albanians and substantially reduce police and military forces in
Kosovo.
	   After meeting with Kosovo's Serbian officials, Serbian President
Milan Milutinovic suggested the need for a massive military
presence was over, because ethnic ``Albanian terrorism has been
defeated.''
	   But he indicated a new crackdown could be ordered if needed ``to
defend the peace and safety ... of our citizens.''
	   France's defense minister, Alain Richard, said in Paris that
France would provide up to half of the rapid intervention force of
up to 1,800 troops assigned to protect the verifiers. The troops,
armed with tanks and helicopters, will be based in neighboring
Macedonia.

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ A youth who knocked down and killed
two elderly sisters while speeding in the Porsche he had received
for his 18th birthday just days before was sentenced to four years'
detention Thursday.
	   Satvinder Nijjer, now 19, was convicted last month of two counts
of causing death by dangerous driving.
	   In ordering Nijjer confined to the youth facility, Judge John
Warner said he was traveling at ``grossly excessive'' speed when he
knocked down and killed Lavinia and Winifred Carrington, 78 and 76,
during a school lunch break last year.
	   ``I am sure you were showing your friends just what the car
could do,'' the judge said.
	   Of the Carrington sisters, he said, ``Mercifully, it would
appear they did not know what had happened to them.''
	   The sisters, who were hit from behind when the red convertible
Porsche 944 jumped the curb going 70 mph (112 kph), had been
returning home from a lunch celebrating Winifred's 76th birthday.
	   The judge noted a number of mitigating factors in Nijjer's case,
including the ``immaturity and lack of judgment'' that come with
his young age.
	   He added that Nijjer's father, Surinder, who bought him the car,
``had a lot to answer for'' and shared the blame for the tragedy.
	   ``You were provided with a very powerful car by your father
which was well beyond your capabilities,'' Warner said. ``You were
given no tuition.
	   ``He may bear no legal responsibly, but in my view he has a lot
to answer for. If he had thought about this, he would have known
this was an accident waiting to happen.''

 &UR; Parole board reduces sentence of woman who posted pig fliers
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with woman's release &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli woman who posted fliers
portraying the Prophet Mohammed as a pig won a reduction in her
sentence for good behavior and was released Thursday.
	   Tatiana Suszkin was sentenced to 24 months in prison after
posting drawings showing the Muslim prophet as a pig on the doors
of Arab-owned shops in the West Bank town of Hebron last year.
Muslims, as well as Jews, consider pigs to be unclean.
	   Suszkin's parole board on Wednesday reduced her sentence by a
third for good behavior, said her lawyer, Sean Casper. She was
originally scheduled for release Monday but Thursday she left a
women's prison facility outside of Tel Aviv, accompanied by her
mother and her lawyer.
	   ``She's in good spirits,'' Casper said.
	   Israel radio reported that the Shin Bet security service opposed
the reduction in Suszkin's release and was discussing the issue
with the state attorney.
	   Under the terms of her release, Suszkin must contact the police
twice a day, according to Orit Messer-Harel, spokeswoman for the
Prisons Authority. Suszkin would also be prohibited from leaving
the Tel Aviv area and would have to observe an 8 p.m. curfew,
Messer-Harel said.
	   The posters set off clashes in Hebron, a town of 450 Jewish
settlers and 130,000 Palestinians. They also triggered outrage
throughout the Muslim world, including angry street protests in
Bangladesh and Iran, and rulings by Muslim clerics that insulting
the prophet should be punishable by death. Israeli leaders
condemned her actions.
	   Suszkin, a art school dropout and a supporter of the outlawed
anti-Arab Kach group, was convicted of committing a racist act,
supporting a terrorist organization, attempting to create religious
offense and attempted vandalism. She was also convicted of
endangering life by throwing rocks at Arab drivers.

Victory in Congress gives Brazil's government renewed hope
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With a show of strength and a key
victory in Congress, the government suddenly seems in better shape
to fix Brazil's battered economy.
	   Cajoling, horse-trading and promising favors, government allies
on Wednesday beat back attempts to weaken a social security reform
bill that would reduce a dlrs 65 billion budget deficit.
	   The victory gave a badly needed boost to President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso.
	   With the government steamroller in high gear, there's a better
chance legislators will approve the tough austerity package he
unveiled last week.
	   ``It shows the government has got its game together,'' political
scientist David Fleischer said by telephone from Brasilia, the
capital. ``This heralds well for fiscal reforms. The package
definitely looks easier.''
	   Brazilians hope the message wasn't lost on the International
Monetary Fund, which says the reforms are needed to obtain an aid
package expected to total some dlrs 30 billion.
	   The IMF on Thursday said it will announce details of the package
this month.
	   But the victory was not without strings. Cardoso's allies had to
attend a long wish-list, especially job appointments for lame-duck
legislators who lost in October elections.
	   ``It will be interesting to see what all those concessions cost
the government,'' said Antonio Alkmin, head of the Research and
Studies Division at the government-run Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics.
	   ``What we're hearing is that the horse-trading is getting very
serious,'' said Walter Stoeppelwerth, head of research at the
Flemings bank in Sao Paulo. ``The government is mobilizing like
never before.''
	   Some analysts warned that the optimism could be premature.
	   ``Although it is an important first step, much still needs to be
done,'' said Peter West, head economist at BBV Latinvest in London.
``Excitement about what happened yesterday will quickly fade if the
process doesn't advance.''
	   Still, Cardoso's allies were justifiably excited at the end of
an impasse that had stalled the bill in Congress for more than
three years.
	   The 513-seat Chamber of Deputies approved a ceiling of (1,200
reals) a month for civil service pensions. It also created minimum
retirement ages of 53 for men and 48 for women. The government
agreed to drop a third measure that would have limited special
pensions for people working under hazardous or adverse conditions,
such as in coal mines or oil rigs.
	   The measures are expected to save dlrs 2.5 billion (3 billion
reals) next year. By comparison, the austerity package proposes
savings in 1999 of nearly dlrs 24 billion, or 28 billion reals.
	   ``One victory doesn't necessarily guarantee a second one,'' said
political analyst Carlos Lopes of the Santa Fe Institute in
Brasilia.
	   Still, he said the government should be heartened by the fact
that 480 legislators stayed until midnight to vote the final point.
	   ``It's an indication Congress will play the game for the rest of
the year,'' he said. ``And that's good news for the fiscal
measures.''

German politician, central bankers meet as unemployment sinks

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's chronically high
unemployment dropped slightly Thursday, even as its central bank
rebuffed demands by Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine to cut
interest rates, a move he says will help tackle 10.1 percent
joblessness.
	   Lafontaine met Thursday morning with the policy-making central
council of the central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, in a meeting
billed as a ``courtesy call.''
	   The meeting saw ``an intense exchange of views'' about fiscal
and monetary policy, the ministry said in a statement, hinting
talks were heated.
	   Discussion focused particularly on interest rates in Europe,
which were showing a ``falling tendency,'' the statement said.
	   Lafontaine has repeatedly demanded the Bundesbank factor in
goals such as cutting unemployment and boosting growth in deciding
monetary policy.
	   Many central bankers regard that as heresy, saying their task is
to keep prices steady and inflation low. The rest is up to the
government's economic and social policies, they say.
	   The meeting follows weeks of sniping and speculation whether
Germany's new center-left government was trying to exert political
pressure on the bank. The government has repeatedly denied that.
	   Rebuffing the finance minister's demands, the bank said after
the regular biweekly meeting that its core 3.3 percent securities
repurchase rate would stay the same. The meeting normally decides
interest rates.
	   The much-anticipated meeting almost overshadowed an announcement
by the Federal Labor Office in the eastern city of Nuremberg that
unemployment dropped again in October to 10.1 percent, down from
September's 10.3 percent.
	   Nearly 74,000 Germans found jobs last month, leaving 3.89
million unemployed, the office said.
	   Unemployment in former East Germany remained almost twice that
in the west: 15.7 percent in October compared to 8.7 percent in the
west. Still, conditions in the east improved slightly more than in
the west, with 43,900 people finding jobs there, compared to 29,800
in the west.
	   It's news that should cheer the new government of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, which has made fighting joblessness its key
priority.
	   Schroeder has backed his finance minister's demands for lower
rates, though recently has appeared to distance himself, saying he
believes the discussion should be conducted in private.
	   Several central bankers, including its president, Hans
Tietmeyer, say dropping rates isn't necessary just now, because
Germany's core interest rate is already the lowest in the G-7 group
of industrial nations, bar Japan.
	   Many analysts say Lafontaine has hurt his cause by appearing to
pressure the bank, which is fiercely independent.

Temperature reached 300 degrees (570F) in doomed Swissair Flight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Temperatures rose to 300 degrees (570
degrees F) without leaving traces of fire in the front part of
Swissair Flight 111 before it crashed, an in-house publication of
the airline said Thursday.
	   There still is no indication of the source of the heat, said the
publication, ``News.'' It described as ``pure speculation''
theories that a fire was caused by an electrical short that ignited
insulation material.
	   The MD-11 airliner flying from New York to Geneva crashed Sept.
2 off the coast of Canada, killing all 229 people aboard. The crew
reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash.
	   Investigators, who have found that high heat melted plastic in
the first 40 feet (12 meters) of the plane, were surprised that the
heat was in the upper part of the plane and not below the cockpit
floor, where most of the wiring is located, the newsletter said.
	   Previous reports have said the temperature was high enough to
damage plastic, but the newsletter gave the first indication of
just how hot it was.
	   The newsletter, published for the staff by the airline's parent
SAirGroup, said the findings by Canadian investigators were
disclosed by Hans Ulrich Beyeler, Swissair head of technology, in a
speech to the Technical Society of Zurich.
	   Last week, the airline announced it was switching off a
state-of-the-art entertainment system on its remaining 15 MD-11s
and three Boeing 747s as a precautionary measure.
	   Swissair said the video-on-demand system for first and business
class was being disconnected from a power supply network routed
through the cockpit because it was nonessential and because that is
the area where the investigation is concentrated.
	   The newsletter said 90 percent of the wreckage has been
recovered.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ With Real Madrid at the top of the Spanish
first division, two other clubs, Mallorca and FC Barcelona, are
fighting for a chance to oust it this week.
	   After a hectic week of Europe competition, the Spanish clubs are
concentrating their efforts again in the domestic league eager to
make a run at Madrid.
	   Mallorca and Barcelona both have 16 points, just one less than
Real, although Mallorca has the edge on goal difference.
	   On Sunday, Barcelona, the defending first division champions,
will need to defeat Oviedo in order to recuperate prestige lost
after going down 2-1 against Bayern Munich 2-1 on Wednesday in the
European Champions League, a defeat that left the Catalan side
almost out of the competition.
	   Mallorca, meanwhile, was to face Belgium's Genk in the Cup
Winners Cup later Thursday before meeting lowly Villareal Sunday in
the Spanish Primera's ninth round.
	   Real Madrid was also scheduled to play its European Champions
League game against Austria's Sturm Graz after the game was
suspended Wednesday because of rain. On Sunday, the side has an
apparently easy bout against weak first-division newcomer Alaves.
	   Last week it thrashed fellow newcomer Extremadura 5-1 to take
the league's top spot.
	   Led by top scorer Raul Gonzalez with six goals, Madrid's record
so far this season is five victories, two draws and one defeat,
although its players have been sharply criticized for their scrappy
play and poor defense.
	   Meanwhile, Madrid's cross-town rival, Atletico de Madrid,
currently in fifth place with 13 points, appears to be playing
better than a month ago but catching Real won't be easy.
	   Atletico comes off a 1-0 win over CSKA Sofia this week in the
UEFA cup and will try to repeat the victory Sunday when it hosts
No. 7 Deportivo de La Coruna.
	   In Saturday's only game, Espanyol welcomes 16th-placed Betis.
Despite a dismal start this season, Betis is the clear favorite
this weekend as it looks to build on a two-game winning streak
since former national coach Javier Clemente took over a week ago.
It's most recent feat was a 3-0 victory Tuesday in the UEFA Cup
against Dutch side Willem II.
	   In other games Sunday: Tenerife receives Valladolid, Real
Sociedad meets Athletic de Bilbao, Salamanca hosts Zaragoza,
Valencia welcomes Racing de Santander and Celta faces Extremadura.

Iraq courting Arab, neighboring countries with oil money

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Under a glossy portrait of the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iraqi women dragging small children
elbowed their way through the crowd Wednesday for some Iranian
cookies and chocolates.
	   A group of Iraqi businessmen haggled over prices with Syrian
counterparts below an imposing picture of Syria's President Hafez
Assad.
	   Such scenes would have been unthinkable only two years ago. But
the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal is allowing Baghdad to woo friends
and former foes into trade deals that Iraq hopes will gain backing
for its political views.
	   Iraq has given preference to Arab countries in contracts, and
it's paying off _ at least in rhetoric.
	   At a trade fair this week, not only old allies but even
representatives from Jordan and Egypt, whose recent ties to Iraq
have been testy, had warm words for the Iraqis in their latest
stand-off with the United Nations.
	   ``It goes without saying that the Jordanian people will fully
back Iraq in any crisis,'' said Maher Ureibat, who is heading
neighboring Jordan's exhibit at the fair.
	   Some 30 countries and more than 70 multinational companies are
taking part, vying for contracts from the oil program whose current
six-month phase, due to end November 25, should put more than dlrs
2 billion at Iraq's disposal.
	   Most conspicuous among the participants were 17 Arab countries
plus Iraq's non-Arab neighbors _ Turkey and Iran.
	   The Iranians seem to have put their 1980-1988 war with Iraq
behind them. The Islamic Republic brought 32 state-run companies
and 25 private firms, Abbas Razavi, head of Iran's pavilion, told
The Associated Press.
	   Razavi admitted that trade was still meager but added ``Tehran
is determined to do business and catch up with others under the oil
deal.''
	   Syria occupies 2,000 square meters in the fair with 84 companies
taking part. Iraq and Syria, ruled by rival factions of the Baath
party, opened their borders last year after an 18-year shut-down.
	   ``We are doing business within the oil program and also sending
items allowed under the (U.N.) sanctions,'' said Amer Kharboutli,
head of the Syrian exhibit.
	   Some Arab countries at the fair showed clear support for Iraq in
the crisis over U.N. arms inspectors who must declare Iraq is free
of dangerous weapons before the sanctions, imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.
	   T-shirts with pictures of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were
displayed at the Palestinian pavilion.
	   ``We all will go to streets if America attacks Iraq,'' said
Fareed Hammouda, representing the 20 Palestinian companies at the
fair.
	   At the Sudanese exhibit, one pamphlet read: ``Khartoum and
Baghdad are in the same trench against America.''

Jailed Cali drug trafficker assassinated in Colombian prison yard

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with background on sentence,
Herrera's role in wiping out Medellin cartel, with sentence
increased in September. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A jailed leader of the Cali drug cartel
was shot and killed Thursday while playing soccer in a Colombian
prison yard, authorities said.
	   Helmer ``Pacho'' Herrera was the former No. 3 of the cartel. He
was killed by a lone gunman with a 9 mm pistol in Palmira prison in
Cali on Thursday morning, said National Prison Service spokesman
Javier Suarez. Authorities said the gunman was captured.
	   Long wanted by U.S. officials, the 47-year-old Herrera
surrendered to authorities in September 1996, the last of seven
major Cali cartel members to either turn themselves in or be
arrested.
	   He was convicted of drug trafficking in March and sentenced to
six years and eight months in prison. In September, the sentence
was increased to 14 years and eight months on appeal by prosecutors
who considered the original sentence too light.
	   When he surrendered, Herrera said he was tired of being on the
run from multiple enemies _ he had dodged hundreds of police raids
and had his share of rivals _ and thought he would be safer behind
bars.
	   Herrera played a key role in the Cali cartel's secret alliance
with the government to wipe out the more violent Medellin drug
gang.
	   His lawyer, Gustavo Salazar, said in a radio interview Thursday
that Herrera's killing could have been related to that rivalry.
Herrera was believed to have been involved in a 1988 car bomb
attack on a building where the family of the late Medellin drug
boss Pablo Escobar was living. The family escaped unhurt.
	   The United States made a formal extradition request for Herrera
in July 1996, but Colombian law forbade his extradition.
	   In the 1980s, Herrera personally directed cocaine distribution
and money-laundering activities in the New York City area on behalf
of the Cali cartel, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
	   Gaining a reputation as a deft money-launderer, Herrera had by
1990 established his own family-run cocaine trafficking business
and later entered into closer cooperation with the Rodriguez
brothers, setting up and maintaining cocaine distribution networks
in Los Angeles, Houston and Miami, the DEA says.
	   Herrera is the second leading member of the Cali cartel killed
since 1995, when police captured the organization's top leaders,
Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. Both are currently serving
jail terms and are also wanted by the United States for
extradition.
	   Jose Santacruz Londono, at the time the cartel's No. 3 boss, was
killed by police in March 1996 after escaping from jail by bribing
guards.
	   In July, Herrera reportedly turned into police his
wheelchair-bound half brother, Jose Manuel Herrera, in return for a
sentence reduction.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Warsaw was hit with long traffic jams
Thursday after a main water pipe burst near the heavily-traveled
east-west thoroughfare.
	   Firefighters and rescuers waded in water up to their waists to
locate and seal the leak.
	   High water covered the thoroughfare and some 400 meters (yards)
of the Trasa Lazienkowska bridge, that spans the Vistula river,
causing kilometers-long (miles-long) jams, forcing police to
reroute traffic.

Iran's first private news agency to start operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has issued a license for the country's
first private news agency, the organization's director said
Thursday.
	   The Fars News Agency was issued a permit by the Ministry of
Culture and Islamic Guidance and will start operating within the
next two weeks, the agency's managing director, Saeed Nowbari, told
The Associated Press.
	   Iran currently has only one news agency, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency, which is considered allied with President
Mohammad Khatami and supports his reforms. The political leaning of
the new news agency, however, was unclear.
	   ``We will act independently and we are determined to be
reliable, accurate and fast in our reporting,'' Nowbari said.
	   The Farsi-language agency was founded by six investors and will
have 20 staffers, said Nowbari, an official with the Tehran
judiciary and a former IRNA employee. The judiciary is considered a
stronghold of hard-liners.
	   ``Over the next two weeks, we will have our first news item. We
do not in any way rely on any public department,'' he said.
	   The agency will later expand operations by equipping offices in
provincial centers, appearing on the Internet and ultimately
setting up offices outside the country, he said.
	   Khatami has been pushing for greater press and cultural freedoms
since his election last year. Hard-liners have opposed his moves.

Dutch TV show in hot water over `Teletubbies' spoof
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Note contents 3rd graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HILVERSUM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch spoof of the BBC
children's show ``Teletubbies'' showing the popular characters
simulating sex and violence could land its makers in court, a
programming director has warned.
	   ``Tuberculosistubbies,'' made by irreverent youth channel BNN,
features brightly colored characters bearing a more-than-passing
resemblance to Po, Laa-Laa, Tinky-Winky and Dipsy.
	   But instead of the happy, harmless storylines of the British
Broadcasting Corp. program, the Tuberculosistubbies are shown
simulating sexual intercourse and fighting.
	   As if that isn't bad enough, fans of the Tuberculosistubbies are
now posting obscene messages on a Dutch Teletubbies site on the
World Wide Web, shocking parents whose children visit the site.
	   ``In total, 30,000 adults and children visit our site,'' Cees
Schippers, programming director for Dutch broadcaster Teleac/Not,
told the daily Trouw newspaper for Thursday's editions.
	   ``Since the parody ... many people are visiting the site to pour
filthy language onto the screen. Parents are concerned because they
don't want their children exposed to that kind of language,'' he
said.
	   Schippers said BBC representatives had asked to see a videotape
of the show and may consider legal action against BNN. The BBC did
not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday.
	   The Tuberculosistubbies are shown on BNN's Sunday night program.
This week, the show agreed to remove the offending item from a
Monday afternoon repeat because it would have aired just before
Dutch children's programming got under way.

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ An explosion in a parking garage in the
Swiss capital Bern late Thursday heavily damaged buildings and
injured several people, police said. Dozens of rescuers searched
for further victims in the rubble.
	   Three people who had been working in an office hit by the blast
were missing, officials said, adding that the cause of the
explosion could not be determined immediately.
	   The force of the explosion tore the front off a nearby apartment
building. Nine injured people, one of them seriously hurt, were
taken to a hospital in the first hour after the explosion, which
occurred just before 5 p.m. (1600gmt).
	   ``It is a terrible scene, like from a bomb going off in
Beirut,'' said a police spokesman.
	   It was unknown how many people were in the building at the time
of the explosion.
	   Witnesses said windows were shattered in a wide area around the
explosion.

Egyptian militant leaders call for new strategy of nonviolence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two leaders of Egypt's main Muslim militant
group on Thursday urged their followers to abandon violence in
favor of spreading their ideology in public campaigns.
	   If their call is heeded by the grassroots of the Al-Gamma
al-Islamiya, or Islamic Group, it could mean a significant fall in
the eight-year insurgency that has killed more than 1,200 people.
	   ``Call for justice and God through speeches, lessons, advice and
dialogue,'' says the group's spiritual leader, Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, in a letter from prison that was given to the Cairo
bureau of The Associated Press.
	   Abdel-Rahman, a blind Egyptian cleric, is serving a life
sentence in Springfield, Missouri, for plotting to blow up several
New York landmarks.
	   A member of the Islamic Group's executive endorsed the sheik's
views in a telephone interview with The Associated Press from
outside Egypt.
	   The executive, who did not want to be identified, said the group
had developed a new policy in conjunction with Abdel-Rahman, who
called for nonviolent methods in a statement published in the
London-based newspaper Al-Hayat on Oct. 22.
	   ``The group's new strategy is to persuade people to follow the
Islamic principles peacefully and not by force,'' the executive
said.
	   In Cairo on Thursday, a lawyer who defends the group's militants
in court, Muntassar el-Zayyat, said there has already been a shift
in the group's strategy.
	   El-Zayyat said the Islamic Group has not carried out a major
attack since the massacre of 58 tourists and 4 Egyptians in Luxor,
southern Egypt, in November 1997.
	   ``The Luxor attack was a turning point in the group's history,''
he said.
	   The massacre provoked a wave of revulsion in Egyptian society.
While there continue to be clashes between the group's militants
and the police, particularly in the country districts of southern
Egypt, death tolls have tended to be in single figures and no
tourists have been attacked.
	   ``There must have been a decision to halt violence,'' el-Zayyat
said.
	   On Saturday, 19 leaders of the Islamic Group serving prison
terms in Egypt issued a statement declaring their ``full
compliance'' with the cease fire call of Abdel-Rahman.
	   The cleric's statements carry weight because his radical fatwas,
or religious rulings, have been the driving force behind the
Islamic Group's campaign.
	   El-Zayyat said the group's move could have been influenced by
the success of the police crackdown and the recent extradition to
Egypt of many of its members abroad. According to el-Zayyat, some
1,000 suspected Islamic Group supporters have been handed over to
Egypt, mainly from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Libya and Albania.
	   Asked why the group's leadership has not publicly announced its
change of direction, el-Zayyat said the leaders seemed to be
waiting for the government to stop its crackdown and conduct
negotiations.
	   The government has always turned down calls for a dialogue,
dismissing the group as a terrorist organization.

1999 Tour de France route shorter, less grueling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pantani unhappy about changes
 &UR; By JEAN-LUC COURTHIAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Tour de France, its image badly tarnished by a
doping scandal last year, will be shorter and less grueling next
summer.
	   But organizers of the prestigious cycling race, who unveiled the
route for next year's 20-stage race Thursday, emphasized that
despite last year's troubles, ``the Tour's popularity remains
intact.''
	   The 3,680-kilometer (2,286-mile) race will start in Puy du Fou
in central France with a short prologue on July 3 and will end with
its traditional ride up and down the Champs-Elysees on July 25.
	   The Tour, which will be about 200 kilometers (124 miles) shorter
than last year, will also include an extra day of rest.
	   One cyclist unhappy about the changes is reigning Tour de France
champion Marco Pantani who hinted Thursday that he might pull out
of the race next year.
	   Pantani said he was particularly concerned that there will be
less hill cycling at the event as of next year.

Talk show hosts son robbed while father leads show on violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ While a popular Norwegian talkshow host was
leading a televised debate about street violence in Oslo, his
teen-age son was robbed at knife point when shopping for school
books in the capital city.
	   ``I was furious,'' Per Staale Loenning told newspapers about
Wednesday's incident.
	   Norway's capital has seen a sharp increased in armed robberies
and muggings in recent months. On Wednesday alone, seven robberies
were reported in the traditionally safe city of 500,000 people,
including a woman who was mugged twice _ by different people _ at
the same outdoor automatic bank.
	   Loenning's program focused on such robberies and the deaths of
four innocent people in Oslo this year in street attacks.
	   His own 17-year-old son was robbed Wednesday of 100 kroner (dlrs
13.50) by three younger teens with knives.
	   ``I am frightened by the increase in senseless violence and
youth robberies in Oslo,'' Loenning was quoted as telling the Oslo
newspaper Dagbladet.
	   Loenning said he insisted on filing a police complaint about the
robbery, even though his son did not want to because he feared
reprisals.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Qatar and the United Arab Emirates ended
with a 0-0 tie Thursday in the six-nation Gulf Cup.
	   Qatar, which had better control at the ball, came close to
scoring several times in and outside the penalty area.
	   Mustafa Mubarak and Mohammed al-Enezi played aggressively for
Qatar, and Mubarak almost scored in the final minutes of a game
marred by injuries and referee whistles.
	   However, Thursday's match gave Qatar its first point in the
tournament after losing to Kuwait and Oman in earlier games.
	   Despite a draw, the United Arab Emirates, which has won two
games earlier, could do with an additional point to stay ahead in
the standings with 7 points.
	   Saudi Arabia plays Oman later Thursday.
	   Competition began Oct. 30 and ends Nov. 12. Also participating
in the tournament, held every two years, is Bahrain.

Russian court says Yeltsin can't run for a third term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES thruout with fresh quotes, potential
presidential candidates, other details. Trims. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ending months of speculation, Russia's highest
court ruled Thursday that Boris Yeltsin cannot use a legal loophole
to seek a third presidential term in 2000.
	   The ruling _ combined with Yeltsin's fragile health _ should
encourage several top political leaders to rev up their
presidential campaign preparations.
	   Russia's constitution puts a two-term limit on presidential
tenure. Yeltsin himself has hinted he would not seek re-election
when his current, second, term expires, and said he was satisfied
with Thursday's ruling.
	   Yet he had allowed aides to promote the idea of a third term
until recent months, when speculation resumed about his health and
his fitness to govern.
	   Yeltsin's first term began in 1991, when Russia was just a
republic within the Soviet Union. Also, the first term began before
the current constitution was adopted in 1993, and Kremlin aides
have argued that it should not count toward the constitutional
two-term limit. Yeltsin was re-elected in 1996.
	   The Communist-led opposition in parliament apparently wanted a
formal ban on Yeltsin running again, and had filed a petition for a
court ruling.
	   The Constitutional Court firmly ruled out the bid.
	   ``The constitution is clear, there is nothing to interpret, the
president is in office for the second term running,'' the court
said in a statement Thursday.
	   Yeltsin praised the decision as a ``victory of law over emotions
and passions,'' said his spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   With Yeltsin apparently out of the picture for 2000, fierce
jockeying is expected to ensue among presidential hopefuls.
	   ``The main thing is to thank the president for giving us
freedom, and ask him to go so that his place can be taken by
somebody who knows how to use this freedom,'' said liberal lawmaker
Alexei Zakharov, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The potential front-runners include:
	   _ Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. Runnerup in the 1996
election, he is short on charisma and long on disdain for Yeltsin's
government. Zyuganov recently accused Yeltsin of being a
``full-blown alcoholic'' unable to perform his duties. Zyuganov's
Communist Party is the largest in parliament, but there is discord
among his followers and the numbers of his elderly supporters seem
to be dwindling.
	   _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. A tremendously powerful and popular
man in Moscow, which he has turned into the country's only
boomtown, Luzhkov likes to exploit nationalist sentiments. But it
is unclear how much support he can muster in Russia's impoverished
hinterlands, which often resent Moscow's wealth.
	   _ Krasnoyarsk Governor Alexander Lebed. A gravel-voiced retired
general, Lebed has never claimed much understanding of the economy,
but stresses his plans to bring law and order. He came in third in
the 1996 election.
	   _ Grigory Yavlinsky. A liberal economist and lawmaker liked in
the West, he finished fourth in 1996 and has a loyal following
among liberal intellectuals. But his reformist ideas have little
appeal to the poor, desperate for a stable salary after months of
unpaid wages.
	   _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov could emerge as a contender,
but has so far denied presidential ambitions. A former spymaster
and diplomat, he has been carrying out most of the country's top
leadership duties since Yeltsin's latest ailments struck.
	   Primakov is widely admired in Russia as a conscientious worker
and a defender of the country's interests. But his unusually high
popularity ratings may dissipate fast if the economy shows no signs
of improving.
	   The Constitutional Court announcement Thursday came on the
second anniversary of Yeltsin's quintuple heart bypass surgery,
which sidelined him for months in 1996. The president has been ill
several times since then, and has been working only sporadically in
recent months.
	   Yeltsin is now recuperating from his latest illness at the Black
Sea resort of Sochi.

 &UR; U.S. Defense Secretary in Egypt after wrapping up Gulf tour &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Cohen ending Gulf tour, meeting
Emirates leader, arriving in Egypt. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen ended a
six-nation tour of the Gulf on Thursday, saying the United States
has ``the support it needs.'' But he appeared to gain little public
backing for possible military strikes against Iraq.
	   In the United Arab Emirates, his last stop, President Sheik
Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan called for a political solution to the
crisis with Iraq, the official Emirates News Agency reported.
	   Earlier, in Oman, Sultan Qaboos reportedly told Cohen that he
opposed any unilateral U.S. strike against Iraq, which ended its
cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Saturday.
	   ``The issue must be handled through the United Nations,'' Qaboos
was quoted as saying by Omani officials.
	   Cohen also visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. He
later flew to Egypt, where he met President Hosni Mubarak and
Egypt's defense and foreign ministers in the Red Sea resort of
Sharm el-Sheik, the Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Cohen, said the secretary had
completed ``successful consultations'' with Gulf leaders.
	   ``Based on his meetings, Secretary Cohen is confident that the
United States will have the support it needs to take appropriate
action to uphold the United Nations Security Council resolutions,''
Bacon said in a statement released by the Pentagon.
	   It did not detail what the responses might be.
	   Cohen was expected to visit Jordan and Turkey.
	   At least publicly, there has been little support across the
region for any U.S. military action against Iraq, which has gained
sympathy for its worsening plight under sweeping U.N. sanctions.
	   ``We see no reason to provoke a crisis with Iraq other than to
distract attention from the president's personal problems,'' the
Dubai-based Al-Bayan newspaper said in an editorial.
	   Reflecting the feeling in the Arab world that Washington is
tough on Iraq and soft on Israel, Egypt's Al-Akhbar said that ``the
giant United States has become a lion before Iraq but an ostrich
and a helpless rat before Israel.''
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to try to force Baghdad to rescind its decision to
end cooperation with U.N. inspectors. The U.N. Security Council has
condemned the Iraqi decision.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.
	   It is not clear, however, whether the United States' Gulf allies
would allow the use of bases on their territory.
	   On Tuesday, a Saudi official said King Fahd told the defense
secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks
on Iraq.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   But the Pentagon said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq.
	   During the standoff between Iraq and the U.N. over weapons
inspectors in February, Kuwait was the only Arab state that opened
its air bases to U.S. and British warplanes.

Student movement appears to fizzle with low protest turnout

	   PARIS (AP) _ Most high school students chose to hit the books
instead of the streets Thursday, as low turnout in a third round of
nationwide marches signaled a weakening of their fledgling
movement.
	   Only about 2,600 students marched through Paris, police said, in
a sharp contrast to two separate protests last month in which
hundreds of thousands poured into the streets. Some 10,000 marchers
had been expected Thursday.
	   Outside the capital, turnout was also low. Police said 1,500
students marched in both Lyon and Bordeaux, while smaller groups
gathered in Toulon, Nice, Grenoble and Rennes.
	   With French police in riot gear lining the boulevards, the Paris
protest was calm, lacking the violence that marred previous
marches. Students carried banners and linked arms, but the mood was
largely subdued.
	   ``We're here to show solidarity,'' said Jonas Pariente, 16, who
marched in Paris. ``We still have complaints, but it may be the
last march.''
	   The students are protesting overcrowded classrooms, outmoded
equipment, a lack of teachers and other conditions they say leave
them badly prepared for the future.
	   But a school vacation appeared to take the wind out of the
movement.
	   ``This is without a doubt the last protest,'' France Info radio
said.
	   Following last month's protests, Education Minister Claude
Allegre announced the addition of thousands of new teachers and
assistants.
	   Still, many students remain skeptical that the ministry's plans,
which also called for new equipment and a lighter work load, are
sufficient to improve conditions.
	   ``We have 35 students in every class, and that has to change,''
said Guillaume Thfoin, 17, who goes to school in Savigny-sur-Orge
south of Paris.
	   ``We started something, and now we want to finish it,'' said
Aline Doussin, 16, a Paris student. ``Allegre only gave us half of
what we asked for.''
	   Already France's biggest budget item, education funding is
limited by the leftist government's desire to remain qualified for
the euro single currency that debuts at the end of the year.
	   Last month's protests disintegrated into violent rock-throwing
demonstrations, resulting in injuries and property damage. Much of
the violence was caused by youths from troubled suburbs who were
not connected to the protests.
	   Anticipating further violence, police banned street parking as
of Wednesday evening, and some merchants shuttered their shops
along the march route from the Montparnasse train station to the
Education Ministry.

Flooding engulfs hundreds of homes across Eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Floods engulfed hundreds of houses
across Eastern Europe Thursday, forcing thousands to be evacuated
as rivers from Slovenia to Romania burst their banks.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
	   Floods hit Slovenia hardest, with heavy rains inundating large
parts of the country, sending water pouring into hundreds of homes
and causing the closure of main traffic corridors.
	   Slovene state radio reported the area of Celje, northeast of the
capital Ljubljana, suffered the most severe damage. About 2,000
firemen and rescue teams were sent to help thousands of people
whose houses were flooded, as up to a half meter (nearly two feet)
of water, flowed through streets.
	   The railway and highway linking Ljubljana and the northern city
of Maribor were closed due to the storm and flooding. Several other
areas were left without electricity and water. The situation was
worse in Slovenia where the state-run news agency STA reported that
a number of local roads have been closed for traffic due to floods
or slides.
	   Officials warned that the level of the Sava River, which runs
across the country and through Ljubljana, would reach a critical
level in the evening.
	   The government held an emergency session, approving funds to
repair destroyed infrastructure.
	   In Romania, border police evacuated 6,000 people from nine
villages after the Tisa (Tisza) River overflowed after days of
heavy rain, which took local officials by surprise.
	   People were forced to spend the night outdoors in the pouring
rain, said Col. Teodor Cristea of the border police in the city of
Baia Mare, 450 kilometers (280 miles) northwest of Bucharest. He
said the army would send in supplies of food and tents.
	   The Tisa flows from western Ukraine, along the Romanian border
through Hungary and Yugoslavia into the Danube.
	   A few homes in the Czech Republic were under high water.
	   In Hungary, there were flood alerts, but water levels were
subsiding.

Tudjman addresses corruption, abuse of office, unemployment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman on Wednesday
urged prosecution of those who abused their positions and set their
personal interests above the nation's _ wrongs he and his ruling
party are regularly accused of by their rivals.
	   ``All those to whom honesty, justice, freedom, equal rights and
responsibility for all ... are not prime objectives should step
down or be removed,'' Tudjman told the Cabinet.
	   ``Also, anyone who was involved in dubious businesses or abused
his position, must be prosecuted, no matter who that person is or
what position he holds,'' he said.
	   The popularity of Tudjman's ruling party has been steadily
fading, with independent media and the opposition repeatedly
accusing it and the businessmen Tudjman favors of using their
positions to get rich. By contrast, the majority of Croats live in
poverty after Tudjman's eight-year rule.
	   The president evidently realized that growing popular
dissatisfaction could seriously damage his party's standing in the
next parliamentary elections scheduled for late next year.
	   Tudjman castigated ``haughtiness' shown by some people within
the government and outside it, the habit of charging companies or
offices for one's personal expenses, as well as abuses in the
process of privatizing the previously state-owned economy.
	   ``That led to an erosion of public morale ... and is causing
wide dissatisfaction among people,'' he said.
	   Tudjman himself and his wife Ankica were in the middle of of a
financial scandal recently, when a bank employee told a newspaper
that Ankica Tudjman had deposited a huge amount of money that her
husband did not declare in a recent mandatory financial disclosure.
	   Mrs. Tudjman said the money came from Tudjman's books. Some
newspapers charged that Tudjman was thereby privileged compared to
other authors who have troubles getting their books published at
all. Tudjman earned thousands of dollars for each of about 27
books, many of them published or republished in the last few years
at home and abroad.
	   But Tujdman said those who have been subject to unwarranted
criticism must be protected.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Qatar wasted superior possession and a
late chance by Mustafa Mubarak but still held the United Arab
Emirates to a 0-0 draw Thursday for its first point in three games
at the Gulf Cup.
	   Qatar was plagued by poor finishing after creating several
chances inside and outside the penalty area.
	   Mohammed al-Enezi also had chances in a match marred by injuries
and fouls.
	   The draw left the Emirates atop the six-nation tournament with a

Parole board reduces sentence of woman who posted pig fliers

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli woman who posted fliers
portraying the Prophet Mohammed as a pig won a reduction in her
sentence for good behavior and was released Thursday.
	   Tatiana Suszkin was sentenced to 24 months in prison after
posting drawings showing the Muslim prophet as a pig on the doors
of Arab-owned shops in the West Bank town of Hebron last year.
Muslims, as well as Jews, consider pigs to be unclean.
	   Suszkin's parole board on Wednesday reduced her sentence by a
third for good behavior, said her lawyer, Sean Casper. She was
originally scheduled for release Monday but Thursday she left a
women's prison facility outside of Tel Aviv, accompanied by her
mother and her lawyer.
	   Asked by reporters if she regretted her actions, Suszkin just
smiled uncomfortably. After a prod by her lawyer, she said, ``What
I did was right for that moment, but I wouldn't do it again now.''

Iraq dismisses U.N. draft resolution, says sanctions must be lifted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Ramadan comments, ADDS byline. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will reject any Security Council
resolution demanding that it cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors
unless the resolution also calls for the removal of 8-year-old
sanctions, Iraq's vice president said Thursday.
	   ``Iraq's response is that it will not deal positively with the
members of the (Security) Council unless there is a clear stand
that the sanctions on Iraq will be lifted,'' the vice president,
Taha Yassin Ramadan, told AP Television News.
	   Ramadan spoke at the Baghdad International Fair, in which some
40 countries and 70 international companies are taking part.
	   Ramadan also said that Iraq would resume military training of
nearly 1 million volunteers in February as it did during another
crisis with the United Nations earlier this year.
	   Ramadan's remarks on the resolution echoed a front-page
editorial in the ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra.
	   The paper dismissed the draft U.N. resolution that demands
Baghdad cooperate with U.N. inspectors. It said any measure adopted
must include an explicit timetable for lifting economic sanctions.
	   If the resolution does not ``look positively and fairly at
Iraq's right to have the sanctions lifted'' it will be rejected
outright by Baghdad, it said.
	   ``Iraq shall not rescind its decision unless the council meets
its legitimate and just demands,'' said the newspaper, which
expresses government views on matters of national interest.
	   The United Nations imposed a sweeping economic embargo against
Iraq after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Council diplomats
have said they will not consider lifting of the sanctions until
Iraq fully cooperates with the arms inspectors.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen was in the Gulf Thursday
trying to rally Arab leaders for a united stand on Iraq.
	   Babel, Iraq's most influential newspaper, said Iraq was certain
that apart from Kuwait no other Arab country would back a U.S.
strike against Iraq.

Suspected bomb in Istanbul's historic center injures 2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A blast believed caused by a bomb hit
the Palace of Justice in Istanbul's historic district Thursday,
injuring two people.
	   Private television station NTV said an ``outlawed group''
claimed responsibility but did not specify the name of the group.
Banned Kurdish, leftist and Islamic militant groups are active in
the city.
	   The explosion occurred on the third floor of Istanbul's main
judicial headquarters, near the office of a senior prosecutor. He
was not in the office at the time.
	   A civil servant working in the building sustained slight
injuries to the head and knee, Istanbul Gov. Erol Cakir said. The
identity and condition of the second casualty was not immediately
known.
	   Police sealed off the area.
	   In April, nine people at a Sultanahmet park were injured by a
bomb suspected to have been planted by a Kurdish rebel group. The
Sultanahmet district, which boasts a number of old mosques, museums
and other attractions, is the city's main tourist area.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite reports of a new shootout
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants, the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo said Thursday that peace prospects appeared good _ if
distant _ with both sides tired of the bloodshed.
	   International efforts to bolster peace gathered momentum. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced that
the first 46 members of an international mission of unarmed
observers would arrive in Kosovo next week. And France said it
would provide up to half of an armed intervention force meant to
protect the observers from attack.
	   In the latest clash, the village of Priluzje, 20 kilometers (15
miles) northwest of the provincial capital Pristina, came under
small-arms fire for several hours during the night but no one was
injured, the Serb Media Center reported.
	   The center, which spreads official Serb viewpoints, said several
houses were damaged in the ensuing shoot-out, and blamed the attack
on ethnic Albanian extremists fighting for independence.
	   Although the report could not be independently confirmed, there
have been frequent reports of violence and gunfire exchanges
despite last month's U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
	   Belgrade's independent B-92 radio reported that a Serb policeman
was abducted from a passenger bus early Thursday by members of the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army at Suva Reka, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) south of Pristina
	   Despite occasional skirmishes, the U.S. envoy for Kosovo,
Christopher Hill, said there was ``serious progress'' toward a
permanent solution, although that goal remained far away.
	   ``We have made some serious progress, not only in reducing
violence ... but also in coming around to a political solution that
would meet basic interests of the two sides.''
	   ``We are very much on the road and moving ahead,'' he told
reporters in Belgrade. ``Both sides understand that the status quo
is unacceptable.''
	   Tension on a different front was generated by a dispute between
Yugoslav authorities and the U.N. war crimes tribunal. Chief Judge
Gabrielle Kirk McDonald and other tribunal members canceled a
planned visit to Belgrade for an international war crimes
conference, complaining that the Yugoslav government had refused to
issue tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbour with a visa that would
enable her to visit Kosovo.
	   Arbour had planned to gather evidence on suspected atrocities
committed during the nearly eight-month crackdown on the armed
Albanian independence struggle in Kosovo that killed hundreds,
mostly ethnic Albanian civilians, and made refugees of hundreds of
thousands.
	   The tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands, argues that it
has been authorized by the U.N. Security Council to investigate war
crimes in all of Yugoslavia, which includes Kosovo, an
Albanian-majority province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   Kirk McDonald said authorities' refusal to issue a proper visa
represented the actions of a ``rogue state that holds the
international rule of law in contempt.'' She told reporters in The
Hague that she would ask the Security Council for ``forceful
action'' to make Belgrade toe the line.
	   In Pristina, Mons Nyberg of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said 46 verifiers will arrive next week and
set up operations in the southern city of Prizren.
	   The 2,000-strong Verification Mission, part of an Oct. 12 peace
agreement for Kosovo, isn't expected to be officially launched
before the second half of November. It will report on whether
Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic fully complies with the
provisions of the accord, committing him to end the assault on
militant Kosovo Albanians and substantially reduce police and
military forces in Kosovo.
	   After meeting with Kosovo's Serbian officials, Serbian President
Milan Milutinovic suggested the need for a massive military
presence was over, because ``Albanian terrorism has been
defeated.''
	   But he indicated a new crackdown could be ordered if needed ``to
defend the peace and safety ... of our citizens.''
	   France's defense minister, Alain Richard, said in Paris that
France would provide up to half of the rapid intervention force of
up to 1,800 troops assigned to protect the verifiers. The troops,
armed with tanks and helicopters, will be based in neighboring
Macedonia. Four or five European nations will participate, but it
was unclear whether the United States also would take part.

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ A top U.S. envoy Thursday returned to
Zambia in an abrupt last minute move to confer with the Zambian
president, a key leader of negotiations to end Congo's three-month
war.
	   Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Susan Rice arrived to brief
President Frederick Chiluba on her seven-nation tour aimed at
persuading outsiders to withdraw from Congo, U.S. officials in the
Zambian capital said.
	   Zambia has chaired two rounds of failed Congolese peace talks
and is seen as sympathetic to Rice's mission. In late October,
Chiluba was asked by African leaders to arrange fresh talks leading
to direct negotiations between Kabila and rebels fighting to oust
him.
	   Kabila has refused to meet with rebel leaders.
	   ``She came to give President Chiluba her impressions of her trip
and sum up her overall visit to the region,'' said U.S. embassy
spokesman George Newman.
	   Rice has acknowledged her nine-day trip achieved little
progress. She received a frosty reception from Kabila and President
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who has dispatched 6,000 troops to back
Kabila.
	   Angola and Namibia also sent troops and tanks to help stop rebel
advances and mount an offensive against rebel positions in the
dense jungles of eastern Congo.
	   ``We are encouraged by the recognition of all those with whom we
talked that there can be no viable military solution, and by the
expressed desire for peace,'' Rice said before leaving Entebbe,
Uganda, for Lusaka on Thursday.
	   ``However, we remain concerned about the continued buildup of
military forces, which underscores the importance of moving forward
to find a peaceful solution.''
	   Despite denials from the Ugandan and Rwandan governments, their
troops repeatedly have been seen fighting on the rebels' side.
	   U.S. diplomats said Rice, who already has visited Angola, Congo,
Zambia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda, had a hard time
convincing the countries supporting Kabila that the United States
was impartial in the conflict.

Tajikistan troops retake northern city from rebels

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ A rebel commander, surrounded by
government troops in mountainous northern Tajikistan, threatened
Thursday to blow up a dam if the government doesn't meet his
demands.
	   ``It will flood vast territories of Central Asia,'' Col. Makhmud
Khudoberdyev warned in a statement received by the ITAR-Tass news
agency. He said his guerrillas had mined the dam on the Kairakkhum
channel as a ``deterrence measure.''
	   The government, which had no immediate reaction to the threat,
claimed that it had largely recaptured a city that Khudoberdyev's
forces had captured in northern Tajikistan and had surrounded his
headquarters.
	   The fierce battle for Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125
miles) north of the capital, Dushanbe, was one of the most serious
outbursts of violence since a peace accord was signed last year,
ending five years of civil war in the small, impoverished Central
Asian nation.
	   The civil war was between President Emomali Rakhmonov's secular
government and the mostly Muslim opposition. Since the peace deal
was signed, the main opposition groups have been participating in a
National Reconciliation Commission.
	   However, a number of warlords have refused to recognize the deal
and continue to attack government forces.
	   Khudoberdyev issued a statement Thursday saying he wouldn't
negotiate with the government until it broadcasts his demands on
national television and radio.
	   ``We have decided to enter the political arena ... to force the
Rakhmonov government to listen to the voice of its own people and
to end the terror against its political opponents,'' the statement
said.
	   The dam he threatened to destroy holds a reservoir large enough
that it is referred to locally as a ``sea.''
	   Referring to the threat, Khudoberdyev said, ``Hot heads in
Tajikistan and outside it should make a choice: Either peace in
Tajikistan, or millions of victims for the sake of preserving
Rakhmonov's ambitions.''
	   It is not clear whether his forces are capable of destroying the
dam or, if they do, how much damage it would cause.
	   Zafar Saidov, a spokesman for the president, said government
forces had taken full control of downtown Khodzhand, leaving rebel
soldiers hemmed in around the airport and their own headquarters.
	   However, ITAR-Tass said fighting was continuing, and Russian
television said the rebels had blown up a bridge in the center of
the city.
	   The government press service said up to 100 government soldiers
had been killed, but Saidov put the death count at 39. He said 50
rebels had been killed, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Tajik Vice Premier Abdurakhmon Azimov said in a radio broadcast
that ``there will be no negotiations or consideration of the
rebels' demands. The matter in question is to block and liquidate
them.''
	   The rebels were still in control of the northern town of Aini,
about 140 kilometers (87 miles) northeast of Dushanbe. They have
taken all government buildings, appointed a new police chief, and
confiscated large amounts of industrial explosives from a local
factory, Interfax reported.
	   But a strategically important mountain pass, just below the
town, was still in government hands, and small groups of refugees
were moving along toward Dushanbe, Interfax said.

Madrid airport opens Europe's longest runway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish development minister
inaugurated Europe's longest runway Thursday in a bid to end
chronic delays at Barajas airport in Madrid.
	   The minister, Rafael Arias-Salgado, also fired the facility's
director, Jose Sedano, saying it was time for change.
	   The runway, the airport's third, is 4.4 kilometers (2.7 miles)
long and 67 meters (74 yards) wide.
	   It is designed to boost Barajas' flight-handling capacity by
half to 75 per hour.
	   The Spanish national airport authority said today's planes only
use 3.4 kilometers (two miles) to take off and land but engineers
added a kilometer for bigger, next-generation aircraft that will
need more room.
	   Part of a major expansion project at Barajas, the runway was 22
months in the making at a cost of 30 billion pesetas (dlrs 214
million).
	   It got off to an inauspicious start, however. The first plane to
use it, an Iberia flight bound for Montevideo, took off 45 minutes
late.
	   At the inauguration, Salgado also announced the surprise firing
of airport director Sedano. ``There are times it is necessary to
change personnel, when new periods begin,'' he said without
elaborating.
	   Sedano told the state-run news agency Efe he knew nothing of his
sacking until the minister told the media.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ If the United States and Russia agree on a food
aid package, the first shipments could start arriving next month, a
Russian official said Thursday.
	   Russian and American officials could wrap up a second round of
talks Thursday on details of the deal, said Leonid Cheshinsky,
president of the Roskhlebprodukt bakery company. He has been taking
part in the negotiations, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The United States plans to provide Russia with 3.1 million
metric tons of food, valued at around dlrs 500 million, the White
House said Wednesday.
	   About 1.6 million metric tons would be provided for free. The
rest would be sold to Russia under a 20-year loan.
	   Russia has been hit hard by economic problems coupled with the
worst grain harvest in 40 years. Food prices have risen about 50
percent due to the country's financial crisis, prompting worries
that the poor won't be able to afford food. Food imports have
dramatically fallen off.
	   The government Customs Committee announced Thursday that it was
temporarily cutting import duties on some food products, apparently
in an effort to get more food flowing into the country. The
reduction primarily targets meat, poultry, dairy products and
vegetable oil.
	   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has said the aid package
will include 100,000 tons of unspecified commodities, to be
distributed through non-governmental and private organizations to
some of the most vulnerable Russian citizens, especially the
elderly and poor.
	   The remaining 3 million metric tons would be made up of 1.5
million tons of wheat donated by the U.S. government and 1.5
million tons bought by the Russians with a U.S. loan.
	   The first shipment is expected to arrive in December, Cheshinsky
of Roskhlebprodukt said, according to Interfax.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday that U.S.
negotiators were working with the Russians to make sure the food
isn't diverted into the black market.
	   The United States is also working with Russia to make sure the
food is exempted from both taxes and import duties.
	   This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The United States provided
food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   In other economic news Thursday, Russia's Central Bank announced
that its gold and foreign-currency reserves rose by dlrs 300
million in the last week of October, reaching dlrs 13.6 billion on
Oct. 30.
	   Also, the tax service said it would like to crack down on tax
evasion by banning tobacco and alcohol sales at private kiosks and
wholesale markets, tax chief Georgy Boos said.
	   In the past, the government has tried to ban alcohol sales at
street kiosks. But kiosk owners responded by adding small sales
rooms, allowing them to pass for real stores, and thus continue
selling alcohol.

	    &UR; Some 300C (570F) in 111 before crash, in-house letter says
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS background from Canadian transportation board.
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Temperatures rose to 300 degrees
Celsius (572F) without leaving traces of fire in the front part of
Swissair flight 111 before it crashed, an in-house publication of
the airline said Thursday.
	   There still is no indication of the source of the heat, said the
publication, ``News.'' It described as ``pure speculation''
theories that a fire was caused by an electrical short that ignited
insulation material.
	   Investigators, who have found that the high heat melted plastic
in the first 10 meters (40 feet) of the plane, were surprised that
the heat was in the upper part of the plane and not below the
cockpit floor, where most of the wiring is located, the newsletter
said.
	   Previous reports have said the heat was high enough to damage
plastic, but the newsletter gave the first indication of just how
much heat there was.
	   The newsletter, published for the staff by the airline's parent
SAirGroup, said the findings by Canadian investigators were
disclosed by Hans Ulrich Beyeler, Swissair head of technology, in a
speech to the Technical Society of Zurich.
	   The MD-11 airliner flying from New York to Geneva crashed Sept.
2 off the coast of Canada, killing all 229 people aboard. The crew
reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash.
	   Last week the airline announced it was switching off a
state-of-the-art entertainment system on its remaining 15 MD-11s
and three Boeing 747s as a precautionary measure.
	   Swissair said the video-on-demand system for first and business
class was being disconnected from a power supply network routed
through the cockpit because it was nonessential and because that is
the area where the investigation is concentrated.
	   The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said last week that
recovered materials from the plane revealed that ``some of the
wiring and structure, located in the ceiling in the vicinity of the
cockpit, showed signs of heat damage.'' Some of the wiring was
associated with the aircraft`s in-flight entertainment system, it
said.
	   Other onboard entertainment systems were unaffected.
	   The newsletter said 90 percent of the wreckage has been
recovered so far.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will reject any U.N. Security Council
resolution demanding that it cooperate with international arms
inspectors unless the resolution also calls for the removal of
8-year-old sanctions, Iraq's vice president said Thursday.
	   ``Iraq's response is that it will not deal positively with the
members of the (Security) Council unless there is a clear stand
that the sanctions on Iraq will be lifted,'' the vice president,
Taha Yassin Ramadan, told Associated Press Television News.
	   Ramadan spoke at the Baghdad International Fair, in which some
40 countries and 70 international companies are taking part.
	   Ramadan also said that Iraq would resume military training of
nearly 1 million volunteers in February as it did during a crisis
earlier this year with the United Nations.
	   Ramadan's remarks on the resolution echoed a front-page
editorial in the ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra.
	   The paper dismissed the draft U.N. resolution that demands
Baghdad cooperate with inspectors. It said any measure adopted must
include an explicit timetable for lifting economic sanctions.
	   If the resolution does not ``look positively and fairly at
Iraq's right to have the sanctions lifted'' it will be rejected
outright by Baghdad, it said.
	   ``Iraq shall not rescind its decision unless the council meets
its legitimate and just demands,'' said the newspaper, which
expresses government views on matters of national interest.
	   The United Nations imposed a sweeping economic embargo against
Iraq after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Council diplomats
have said they will not consider lifting of the sanctions until
arms inspectors certify that Iraq has fully dismantled its weapons
of mass destruction.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen was in the Gulf Thursday
trying to rally Arab leaders for a united stand on Iraq.
	   Babel, Iraq's most influential newspaper, said Iraq was certain
that apart from Kuwait no other Arab country would back a U.S.
strike against Iraq.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United States and Russia were on the verge of
signing a food aid agreement Thursday, and a Russian official said
the first shipments could start arriving next month.
	   By mid-evening Thursday, ``there were just a couple of loose
ends'' in the negotiations and the two countries were expected to

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A powerful bomb ripped through a crowded
market in an eastern Pakistani town on Thursday, while 200,000
orthodox Muslims held a conference nearby.
	   At least 15 people were seriously hurt in the explosion in
Muridke, six miles (10 kilometers) from the Lahore, capital of the
eastern Punjab province.
	   The blast apparently was caused by an explosive device hidden in
a paper bag and left near a shop in the market, police said.
	   No one claimed responsibility.
	   Barely a mile (kilometer) from the explosion, an orthodox
Islamic group known as Lashkar-e-Tayyaba was holding its annual
conference with an estimated 200,000 participants.
	   The organization, which claims to have links with Islamic
militant groups worldwide, says several of its participants belong
to cells operating in countries like Egypt, Jordan and Israel.
	   There was no indication that the explosion was linked to the
conference. Authorities said they were investigating.

UN 'disappointed' at pace of Taliban probe into killings

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The United Nations welcomed the
release of one of its employees by Afghanistan's Taliban army, but
said it was worried about a second worker and ``disappointed'' with
the pace of an investigation into the killings of three other
workers, an official said Thursday.
	   Last month the Taliban and the United Nations reached an
11-point agreement that would allow the world body to return its
foreign staff to the beleaguered country, ravaged by two decades of
war.
	   The agreement has faltered over a report into the killings
demanded by the United Nations.
	   The United Nations withdrew its international staff on Aug. 21
when an Italian aid worker was gunned down apparently in
retaliation for the U.S. missile attack a day earlier on suspected
terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   In July two Afghan workers were killed.
	   The Taliban authorities say they have arrested two Pakistanis in
connection with the Italian's death, said Sarah Russell, a U.N.
spokeswoman in Pakistan.
	   As well as the report, the United Nations also is waiting for
the Taliban to fulfill other requirements like releasing imprisoned
U.N. workers.
	   While one worker was released earlier this week, Russell said
the fate of a second worker still is unknown.
	   ``The longer it takes them to fulfill the requirements, the
longer we have to wait to do the security assessment before we can
get the international staff back in there,'' she said.
	   And with the onset of Afghanistan's usually cold winter that's
bad news for Kabul's 750,000 inhabitants, many of whom live well
below the poverty level.
	   More bad news came from the World Food Program on Thursday which
announced the theft of 1,500 tons of food from its warehouses in
Afghanistan's central Bamyan province along with six trucks.
	   The food was to be distributed to some of the country's poorest
people, who spent the summer caught in the crossfire of a battle
between the Taliban and the Shiite Muslim Hazaras who dominate
Bamyan province.
	   The Taliban now rule the area and have occupied WFP offices.
	   ``The food, mostly wheat, . . . had been prepositioned for an
anticipated emergency situation in the region this winter,'' said
the WFP release.
	   ``The WFP has demanded that the Taliban authorities return the
food stocks, trucks offices an assets immediately,'' said the
statement.
	   Getting the food to the area had been a difficult task, from
Uzbekistan, along often treacherous routes controlled by bands of
thieves, the release said.
	   ``Every grain delivered was an achievement, every truck which
arrived was a victory,'' said WFP regional manager, Bronek
Szynalski. ``It is all the more disappointing not to be able to
distribute it to the people in need.
	   The WFP estimates that about 160,0000 people will need about
5,300 tons of food to survive the bitterly cold winter ahead.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Bill Clinton's brother says the president's
daughter Chelsea has been deeply affected by the Monica Lewinsky
sex scandal and has done her utmost to survive the ordeal.
	   In an interview published in this week's Paris Match, Clinton's
younger brother Roger said his niece was conducting her life
business as usual, but that things weren't easy.
	   ``She's going to class every day and I imagine that, in her
milieu, there's no shortage of talk ...,'' Clinton was quoted as
telling the weekly magazine which hit the newsstands Thursday.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With his Cabinet debating the latest
Mideast peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured
skeptical hard-liners Thursday he would walk away from the deal if
he feels the Palestinians are not keeping their commitments.
	   After several delays, Netanyahu's Cabinet began a marathon
session expected to go through the weekend, before a vote is taken
to approve the new land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others.
	   Leaks from Thursday's meeting indicated the session was stormy,
with hard-liners accusing the government of selling out and signing
a vague agreement lacking tough security clauses.
	   In an attempt to blunt the criticism, Netanyahu told the Cabinet
that Jewish settlers would be given a say in deciding from what
West Bank areas Israel would withdraw.
	   Asked whether he would begin the troop pullback on Nov. 16, as
stipulated in the accord, Netanyahu said it was up to the
Palestinians.
	   ``If they implement, we will implement. If they don't implement
it, we won't carry it out,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV's Channel Two
during a brief Cabinet recess called after seven hours of debate.
	   ``That includes of course arresting prisoners, that includes of
course, annulling the charter by vote. We won't accept any
diversion,'' Netanyahu said.
	   But Ahmed Qureai, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature
told Israel TV ``There will be no such thing as a vote,'' over the
Charter.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
accused Netanyahu of trying to please hard-liners at the expense of
the Palestinians and the majority of Israelis who back the deal.
	   ``Netanyahu is looking much more toward the settlers, expressing
understanding for their demands rather than for the interests of
the majority of the Israeli public,'' Tibi said.
	   As part of the new accord signed last month in Washington,
Israel pledged to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank over the
next 12 weeks, in exchange for Palestinian steps to improve Israeli
security.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region
Thursday to supervise implementation of the agreement, but his trip
was moved up to the weekend, likely because of the delayed Cabinet
vote.
	   Netanyahu delayed convening his Cabinet for two days over the
issue of Palestinian fugitives, but the matter seemed cleared up
Thursday. Netanyahu said he had received American assurances that
the Palestinians would arrest 30 men wanted by Israel.
	   But other disputes between the sides remained, chiefly over the
procedure that will lead to the annulment of clauses in the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. The paragraph in
the peace agreement addressing the issue is vaguely worded,
allowing for somewhat different interpretations.
	   The agreement says members of the Palestine National Council,
along with those of other Palestinian organizations, will be
invited to a meeting in mid-December during which an Arafat letter
to U.S. President Bill Clinton concerning the revoking of the
offending clauses will be reaffirmed.
	   The PLO charter itself says it can only be amended by a vote of
two-thirds of the PNC members, but the agreement does not
specifically refer to holding a vote or a required majority.
	   Israel says the charter must be annulled with a vote by the PNC,
not by affirmation. Netanyahu said. ``There will be a vote.''
	   ``And if not, we simply won't give them the territory,'' he
said.

UN report details massacres by Taliban, including torture,
</HEADLINE>
suffocation &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations on Thursday detailed
what it called horrific massacres of civilians in Afghanistan _
including mass suffocation, execution and torture _ by the Taliban
militia during the capture of a northern city in August.
	   An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 people, including women, children
and the elderly, were killed during the takeover of Mazar-e-Sharif
_ either randomly shot or hunted down by Taliban forces, according
to the report from the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.
	   The slayings of Iranian diplomats by Taliban soldiers during the
takeover prompted Tehran to beef up its military presence along the
border and threaten military retaliation.
	   The Taliban, in a response contained in the report, called the
U.N. claims ``imaginary'' and propaganda based on anecdotes, press
reports and false opposition claims ``which only provokes baseless
prejudices and brainwashes the people.''
	   Mazar-e-Sharif had been a stronghold of the northern alliance
opposed to the Taliban, which has conquered roughly 90 percent of
the Central Asian nation and installed its strict brand of Islamic
rule that forbids women from working outside the home.
	   In the first week after the Taliban's Aug. 8 takeover, hundreds
of people were summarily executed on the streets of the city or
inside their homes. Still others were tortured to death. Others
suffocated after being crowded into metal containers _ which were
left in the sunshine during Afghanistan's harsh summer _ and
transported to another city for questioning, the report said.
	   ``One witness saw the opening of three containers carrying 120
persons, of whom only three had survived the trip to Shebergan,''
80 miles (125 kilometers) west of Mazar-e-Sharif, the report said.
	   One survivor had his fingernails torn out, the report said.
Others were repeatedly beaten with steel cables.
	   The United Nations has persistently criticized the Taliban's
human rights record, but the details from the August massacres went
far beyond the traditional U.N. complaints about the Taliban's
restrictive treatment of women and girls.
	   The report's author, Special Rapporteur Choong Hyun Paik, said
he was ``horrified by the latest reports from Afghanistan, which
are profoundly disturbing and indicate a worsening pattern of grave
human rights violations.''
	   The scale of violations warrants the urgent attention of the
world community, he said in urging a more thorough investigation of
the slayings.
	   The bulk of those slain in Mazar-e-Sharif _ an estimated 3,000
people _ belonged to the minority Hazara group. Surviving Hazaras,
who are Shiite Muslims like most Iranians, were warned to practice
the Sunni Muslim tradition of the Taliban if they wanted to
survive, the report said.
	   The report also detailed massacres of about 1,800 people carried
out during the Taliban takeover of central Bamiyan province and
surrounding areas, which also contain large Hazara communities.
	   ``The pattern of the killings observed showed that men, women
and male children were shot, while baby girls were kicked or beaten
to death,'' the report said.
	   Regarding the slayings of the Iranians, the Taliban has said
rogue soldiers carried out the killings, but the report said group
responsible for the slayings was led by a senior Taliban commander.
	   The U.N. envoy for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, recently
visited the region and eased tensions between Iran and Afghanistan
by securing the release of 26 Iranians in detention since the
takeover of Mazar-e-Sharif.

Mandela gets 26 percent pay increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela, the
anti-apartheid hero who renounced some of his pay in 1994, on
Thursday got a 26.5 percent salary boost.
	   The National Assembly voted to pay Mandela 699,000 rand (dlrs
125,000), which represents 26.5 percent more than his current
annual salary.
	   In 1994, after the country's first democratic elections, Mandela
renounced 20 percent of his 690,000 rand (dlrs 124,000) salary to
set an example of belt tightening. That reduced his income to
552,000 rand (dlrs 99,000).

Blair's government weathers first sex scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A high-ranking government minister resigns after
being picked up by a stranger and robbed in an area of south London
notorious for prowling homosexuals.
	   He says he didn't do anything wrong, admitting only to ``a
serious lapse in judgment.''
	   In a speech to the House of Commons, he offers no further
explanation, instead railing about the intrusive media, talking of
his abusive childhood and offering the cryptic observation that
``we are all different.''
	   Said government official then goes into hiding with his family.
Rumors are left to circulate, tongues to wag, tabloid headlines to
blare, and Prime Minister Tony Blair's administration to grapple
with its first full-blown sex scandal.
	   Before Welsh Secretary Ron Davies' resignation became public
last week, Blair's lieutenants had managed to avoid the kind of
embarrassing sexual predicaments that plagued the previous
Conservative government and kept the tabloids snapping at Tory
heels.
	   But because of Davies' failure to be forthcoming about his
clandestine adventure on Clapham Common on Oct. 26, this particular
story has not lost its steam.
	   Now, it's the Tories' turn to watch gleefully as each day's
newspapers bring a new round of twists and speculation about what
might or might not have happened the night Ron Davies decided to go
for a walk to clear his mind.
	   Most stories have speculated that Davies was out for gay sex,
but others said drugs, too. Some said he was set up for blackmail.
	   The Sun tabloid, the country's best-selling newspaper, cited
anonymous sources this week in reporting that Davies had sexual
encounters with two men on Clapham Common and was seeking a third
partner when he was robbed at knifepoint.
	   The flames soared ever higher when Matthew Parris, a columnist
for the Times of London who happens to be gay, speculated about
Davies' sexuality on a British Broadcasting Corp. television
program.
	   As an afterthought, Parris threw in that Blair's government was
full of homosexuals, citing openly gay Culture Secretary Chris
Smith and then naming Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson, who prefers
not to make an issue of his sexuality.
	   The BBC promptly apologized to Mandelson and added to the
controversy by ordering staff members never to repeat Parris'
remark.
	   In Davies' case, Blair has avoided any substantial criticism.
	   He swiftly accepted Davies' resignation when it was offered the
morning after the incident, immediately appointed a successor, and
convinced the disgraced lawmaker not to run for the post of leader
of the new Welsh Assembly, a job for which he had been the
favorite.
	   On Monday, Davies stood before the hushed House of Commons and,
on national television, delivered his unusual personal statement.
	   ``We are what we are,'' he said. ``We are all different, the
product of our genes and our experiences.''
	   As his colleagues and the nation were left to ponder his speech
and the bizarre events of the previous week, he went back to Wales.
He has had no comment since.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen ended
a six-nation tour of the Gulf on Thursday, saying the United States
has ``the support it needs.'' But he appeared to gain little public
backing for possible military strikes against Iraq.
	   In the United Arab Emirates, his last stop, President Sheik
Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan called for a political solution to the
crisis with Iraq, the official Emirates News Agency reported.
	   Earlier, in Oman, Sultan Qaboos reportedly told Cohen that he
opposed any unilateral American strike against Iraq, which ended
its cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Saturday.
	   ``The issue must be handled through the United Nations,'' Qaboos
was quoted as saying by Omani officials.
	   Cohen also visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.
	   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Cohen, said the secretary had
completed ``successful consultations'' with Gulf leaders.
	   ``Based on his meetings, Secretary Cohen is confident that the
United States will have the support it needs to take appropriate
action to uphold the United Nations Security Council resolutions,''
Bacon said in a statement released by the Pentagon.
	   He did not detail what the responses might be.
	   Cohen later traveled to Egypt, where he met President Hosni
Mubarak and Egypt's defense and foreign ministers in the Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-Sheik, the Middle East News Agency reported.
	   He then left the same day for Jordan, where he met Crown Prince
Hassan. He did not make public comments during either stop.
	   Cohen was scheduled to leave for Turkey on Friday.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A jailed leader of the Cali drug cartel
was shot and killed Thursday while watching a soccer game in a
Colombian prison yard.
	   Helmer ``Pacho'' Herrera, 47, was killed by a gunman dressed in
a suit and tie inside Palmira prison in Cali, prison authorities
said. He was formerly the No. 3 of the cocaine cartel.
	   Herrera was seated in the stands at halftime of a national
prison championship match when the gunman fired six times at
point-blank range, said prison service chief Carmen Lucia
Tristancho. He died on the way to the hospital.
	   The assailant, grabbed and roughed up by prisoners and guards,
entered the prison half an hour before identifying himself as a
lawyer for another inmate, Tristancho said.
	   It was unclear whether the gunman, who identified himself as
32-year-old Rafael Angel Uribe, had smuggled the weapon into the
penitentiary or whether the gun was already inside, she said.
	   Herrera surrendered to authorities in September 1996 and was
convicted of drug trafficking earlier this year.
	   The United States made a formal extradition request for Herrera
in July 1996, but Colombian law forbade his extradition.
	   In the 1980s, Herrera personally directed cocaine distribution
and money laundering activities in the New York City area on behalf
of the cartel, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
	   Gaining a reputation as a deft money-launderer, Herrera had by
1990 established his own family-run cocaine trafficking business
and set up and maintained cocaine distribution networks in Los
Angeles, Houston and Miami, the DEA says.
	   Herrera is the second-leading member of the Cali cartel killed
since 1995, when police captured the organization's top leaders,
Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. Both are currently serving
jail terms.
	   Jose Santacruz Londono, another top cartel boss, was killed by
police in March 1996.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian man who blew up his explosives-laden car
at the Kremlin gates was diagnosed as mentally ill and remained in
a Moscow hospital Thursday with minor injuries, officials said.
	   Ivan Orlov, a 65-year old freelance journalist for a right-wing
political magazine, drove his car across Red Square on Wednesday
evening, and then jumped out and detonated a bomb just outside
Spassky Gate, which sports a tall red clock tower that is one of
Russia's most distinctive symbols.
	   Spassky Gate, the main pedestrian entrance to the Kremlin, is
heavily guarded.
	   A soldier and two officers of the Kremlin guard, who rushed to
stop Orlov, suffered numerous injuries and remained hospitalized
Thursday.
	   Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Orlov once
belonged to his party but had been expelled for ``extremism.''
	   Zhirinovsky, speaking to reporters in parliament, described
Orlov as a ``loser.''
	   ``He was an enraged man, whose whole life went wrong,''
Zhirinovsky said. ``He had family problems and was criticized at
work.''
	   Orlov worked for the magazine Russian Pravda, which carried
anti-Semitic and nationalist articles, the Interfax news agency
said. Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said Stalinist slogans and
portraits were found in Orlov's apartment.
	   Stepashin said the incident raised questions about whether
security needed to be tightened around the Kremlin, although to the
casual observer, it already appears quite daunting.
	   Still, he downplayed the seriousness of the incident.
	   ``There was no assassination attempt in Red Square,'' he said,
according to ITAR-Tass. ``There was just an attempt by a certain
Mr. Orlov to drive there in an old Moskvich-412 car.''
	   The editor of Russian Pravda, Alexander Aratov, told Interfax
that Orlov ``hated President Boris Yeltsin because Yeltsin's policy
had driven him to despair.''
	   Orlov also authored two books, ``The Country of Yeltsin'' and
``Russia Is Moaning from Its Leaders.''
	   Yeltsin's office is inside the Kremlin walls, but the president
has been been in the Black Sea resort of Sochi since last Friday
recovering from an illness.
	   Aratov also said that Orlov had personal problems. He said Orlov
was divorced, but had to share the same apartment with his former
wife and her numerous relatives.
	   After the car explosion, Orlov tried to shoot himself with a
pistol, but was apprehended by police, authorities said.
	   A psychiatrist examined him at a hospital on Wednesday and
issued a preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said, citing the Federal Security Service, which carries out
the investigation.
	   The Security Service said the self-made bomb contained about 500
grams (1.1 pounds) of explosives. Earlier reports said the bomb
contained 6 kilograms (13 pounds) of dynamite.

U.N. diverting ships to get food shipments to Mitch victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The U.N. World Food Program said Thursday it was
diverting ships, some already at sea, to rush their cargoes of
donated food to Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch.
	   The relief agency also was pulling food from warehouses at its
base in Rome, probably for delivery by emergency relief flights,
spokesman Trevor Rowe said.
	   ``We're trying to move food as fast as possible to help people
as soon as possible,'' Rowe said.
	   He estimated the numbers of hurricane victims the agency would
feed in ``the hundreds of thousands, if not the high hundreds of
thousands.''
	   Authorities in Central America say the hurricane killed 9,000
with thousands more missing and 1 million or more homeless.
	   The World Food Program by Tuesday had already distributed more
than 100,000 tons of food initially earmarked for development
projects in Nicaragua. Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala also got
their first WFP emergency food shipments over the weekend.
	   The agency said it was able to feed 125,000 victims from stocks
already in the area.
	   In the meantime, the WFP rerouted ships from their intended
destination for the crisis and was assessing diverting more ships
now at docks in the United States and elsewhere, Rowe said.
	   Once the food gets there, devastation to bridges and roads will
make distribution a ``huge challenge,'' he said.
	   And given the destruction of farmers' seed stocks, animals and
tools, relief supplies will have to see victims through ruined
harvests.
	   ``It's a short-term crisis and ... at least a medium-term crisis
as well,'' he said.

US envoy sees progress in Kosovo peace efforts

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite reports of a new shoot-out
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants, the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo said Thursday that peace prospects appeared good _ if
distant _ with both sides tired of the bloodshed.
	   International efforts to bolster peace gathered momentum. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced that
the first 46 verifiers of an international mission of unarmed
observers would arrive in Kosovo next week. And France said it
would provide up to half of an armed intervention force meant to
protect the observers from attack.
	   In the latest clash, the village of Priluzje, 20 kilometers (13
miles) northwest of the provincial capital Pristina, came under
small-arms fire for several hours during the night but no one was
injured, the Serb Media Center reported.
	   The center, which spreads official Serb viewpoints, said several
houses were damaged in the ensuing shoot-out, and blamed the attack
on ethnic Albanian extremists fighting for independence.
	   State-run Radio Pristina reported late Thursday one ethnic
Albanian, believed to belong to KLA, was killed in a shoot-out with
Serbian security foces this morning on the Klina-Srbica road west
of the capital.
	   Although neither report could be independently confirmed, there
have been frequent reports of violence and gunfire exchanges
despite last month's U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.

Austrian parliament enacts law to return looted and forcibly

donated art &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Sixty years after its annexation by Nazi
Germany, Austria enacted a law for the return of Jewish-owned
artworks plundered by the Nazis or donated under coercion from
postwar Austrian governments.
	   The law was adopted unanimously Thursday and covers art that
entered state-run Austrian museums and art collections under
questionable circumstances during the seven years of Nazi rule and
Austria's subsequent occupation by Allied forces immediately after
WWII.
	   Austria was annexed by the Nazis in March 1938, but for decades
after the war it cultivated the role of the first victim of Nazi
aggression. Not until 1991 did an Austrian leader, Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky, publicly acknowledge that ``not a few'' Austrians
participated in wartime atrocities.
	   Austria's first postwar government also effectively confiscated
hundreds of paintings from Jewish owners and their heirs, using a
1923 law preventing the export of artworks. The government let some
Jews reclaim their artworks and take them out of the country, but
forced them to ``donate'' many others in exchange.
	   In February, Austrian Culture Minister Elisabeth Gehrer made an
unprecedented government promise to shed light on how the state
kept works after 1945. She decreed that museums must clarify
``beyond any doubt'' the origin of their works.
	   According to Gehrer, who is in charge of museums, about 500 art
objects were held back after 1945 under the controversial export
ban and remained as ``donations'' in Austrian museums and
galleries.
	   The new law even allows restitution of artworks museums
purchased ``in good faith'' on the postwar art market, but whose
origin is in doubt. It is not known how many items this includes,
Gehrer said.
	   In the parliamentary debate, the minister made clear the first
restitution will be made before the end of this year. She did not
elaborate.
	   While the law cannot right all wrongs, Gehrer said, it shows ``a
bit more justice'' from the government. She said Austria was
issuing a signal for a new awareness in dealing with this infamous
part of its history.
	   Conservative leader Andreas Kohl said the restitution of the
artworks would make the republic ``not poorer but richer.''
	   Parliament on Thursday also unanimously passed the so-called
``looted gold law,'' under which Austria will distribute the
equivalent of about dlrs 8 million among Holocaust victims, the
value of gold looted by the Nazis allotted to Austria this year by
the so-called Tripartite Gold Commission (TGC).
	   The TGC administers those gold holdings which were confiscated
by the Nazis from the Austrian National Bank in 1938.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ An explosion near the center of the
Swiss capital Bern killed three people and injured 17 late
Thursday, police said.
	   Dozens of rescuers, backed by a helicopter, searched for further
victims in the rubble of the five-story building, about a 10-minute
walk from the main train station.
	   The cause of the explosion could not be determined immediately.
Police said they couldn't tell immediately if there had been a gas
leak or even whether the building was on the city's gas network.
	   The building had a car-repair garage on the ground floor and
apartments on the floors above.
	   The force of the explosion tore the front off the building,
leaving the roof hanging. Nine injured people, one of them
seriously hurt, were taken to a hospital in the first hour after
the explosion, which occurred just before 5 p.m. (1600gmt).
	   ``It is a terrible scene, like from a bomb going off in
Beirut,'' said police spokesman Beat Gross.
	   Witnesses said windows were shattered in a wide area around the
explosion.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's fiercely independent central
bank rebuffed demands Thursday from the country's new finance
minister, Oskar Lafontaine, to cut interest rates in a bid to spur
job growth.
	   Separately, the government announced that unemployment dropped
again in October to 10.1 percent, down from 10.3 percent in
September.
	   Lafontaine, who took office last week, met with the Bundesbank's
key policy board, which has made clear it won't buckle to political
pressure to lower rates to tackle unemployment.
	   In a clear rejection of Lafontaine's position, the Bundesbank
said after the regular biweekly meeting that its core 3.3 percent
securities repurchase rate would stay the same.
	   The central bank's independence is considered critical to
ensuring smooth entry to the single European currency, or euro,
which will be launched Jan. 1. From then, monetary policy for the
11 nations joining the currency union will be set by the
Frankfurt-based European Central Bank, modeled on the independent
Bundesbank.
	   The Bundesbank did not issue a statement about the meeting with
Lafontaine, billed as a ``courtesy call'' by the new finance
minister.
	   But the Finance Ministry issued a statement reporting ``an
intense exchange of views.'' Discussion focused particularly on
interest rates in Europe, which were showing a ``falling
tendency,'' the statement said.
	   Lafontaine has repeatedly demanded the Bundesbank factor in
goals such as cutting unemployment and boosting growth in deciding
monetary policy.
	   Many central bankers regard that as heresy, saying their task is
to keep prices steady and inflation low. The rest is up to the
government's economic and social policies, they say.
	   The meeting follows weeks of sniping and speculation whether
Germany's new center-left government was trying to exert political
pressure on the Bundesbank, and would in turn on the European
Central Bank when it takes over monetary policy _ including setting
euro zone-wide interest rates _ with the euro's introduction. The
government has repeatedly denied that.
	   German central banker Ernst Weltke, however, said Thursday that
damage already is being done.
	   The discussion over the independence of the Bundesbank and
Lafontaine's comments were influencing the ``psychology of the
euro,'' Welteke warned in an interview with Berlin's InfoRadio.
	   ``Independence from political influence'' was key to a stable
euro and a stability-oriented monetary policy, Welteke said,
calling for the Europe-wide rate to be set at 3.3 percent.
	   Speaking late Thursday, Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said
the level of the rate depended on economic developments, noting
that unsettled global markets posed a danger for the euro zone.
	   The much-anticipated meeting between Lafontaine and Germany's
central bankers almost overshadowed an announcement by the Federal
Labor Office in the eastern city of Nuremberg that unemployment
dropped again in October to 10.1 percent, down from September's
10.3 percent.
	   Nearly 74,000 Germans found jobs last month, leaving 3.89
million unemployed, the office said.
	   Unemployment in former East Germany remained almost twice that
in the west: 15.7 percent in October compared to 8.7 percent in the
west. Still, conditions in the east improved slightly more than in
the west, with 43,900 people finding jobs there, compared to 29,800
in the west.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's spokesman said the drop was too
small, and called for ``a new alliance for reason and jobs
creation,'' a reference to the new government's plans to bring
together industry, union and political leaders to fight
joblessness.
	   Schroeder has backed his finance minister's demands for lower
rates, though recently has appeared to distance himself, saying he
believes the discussion should be conducted in private.
	   Several central bankers, including Hans Tietmeyer, say dropping
rates isn't necessary just now, because Germany's core interest
rate is already the lowest in the G-7 group of industrial nations,
bar Japan.
	   Many analysts say Lafontaine has hurt his cause by appearing to
pressure the bank, which is fiercely independent.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A spokesman for Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki was convicted Thursday of homicide and
drunken and reckless driving.
	   At the judgement in Randburg Regional Court, Thami Ntenteni
apologized for killing one woman and seriously injuring three
people in the December 1997 accident.
	   Ntenteni pleaded guilty to the charges in September.
	   Police said Ntenteni's BMW was travelling at high speed when it
collided with a Volkswagen Passat from behind, igniting the gas
tank.
	   ``I want to ask the families of the victim and survivors to let
me adopt them as my family and accept me as their son,'' Ntenteni
said.
	   The three survivors said in court they forgave Ntenteni and
pleaded that he be given a fine, not a prison sentence.
	   Mbeki, who is expected to become president of South Africa after
President Nelson Mandela retires next year, has suspended Ntenteni
as spokesperson.
	   Sentencing is expected on Nov. 9.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The president of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal Thursday called on the Security Council to force
Belgrade authorities to allow war crimes investigations in Kosovo.
	   President Gabrielle Kirk McDonald made the appeal after
Yugoslavia refused late Wednesday to allow tribunal staff to probe
alleged atrocities in the southern Yugoslav province.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and a team of
investigators had been planning to start a week-long mission Friday
to visit the sites of alleged atrocities and interview witnesses.
	   ``This conduct is a further example of the FRY's utter disregard
for the norms of the international community,'' Kirk McDonald said
angrily.
	   ``Essentially, it has become a rogue state, one that holds the
international rule of law in contempt,'' she added.
	   Arbour would not disclose her next move. The Canadian judge
insisted she has a legal right to carry out investigations
throughout the former Yugoslavia _ a claim refuted by Belgrade.
	   Arbour was granted a visa to attend a conference in Belgrade,
but she rejected it. She vowed to continue investigating ``using
all means available to us,'' but did not elaborate.
	   Hundreds have been killed and hundreds of thousands made
homeless in seven months of fighting between Serb forces and
secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo. U.N. investigators
want to check reports of atrocities on both sides.
	   Alleged war crimes include summary executions, reprisal killings
and the wanton destruction of villages.
	   Kirk McDonald said she would report the non-issuance of visas to
the Security Council, which set up the tribunal in 1993, and urge
it to take ``forceful'' action to push Belgrade into line.
	   Soon after hostilities broke out in Kosovo, the Security Council
ordered a tribunal investigation of alleged atrocities and told
Yugoslav authorities to cooperate.
	   The visa refusal prompted Kirk McDonald, of Texas, to cancel a
planned visit to Belgrade to speak to a conference on war crimes
trials.
	   ``This move by the Yugoslav government will have serious legal
consequences,'' said Natasa Kandic, chairwoman of the Humanitarian
Law Center organizing the conference.
	   ``With it, the Yugoslav government acted directly contrary to
the U.N. Security Council Resolution demanding free access to
international investigators to Kosovo,'' she said.

	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   The Times of India, New Delhi, on papal encyclical:
	   In his latest encyclical, John Paul II implicitly addresses two
of the principal debates that have marked his reign: The conflict
between religion and science, and the relative status of other
faiths vis-a-vis Catholic belief. In this extraordinary document he
accepts the long-anathematised Galileo as an exemplar of the quest
for truth in a bewildering world; during John Paul II's papacy, the
celebrated astronomer and physicist has gradually been transformed
from an enemy of belief to a quester acknowledged by the Church.
Significantly, the Pope quotes from Buddhist scriptures. ...
	   Wisdom, as St. Thomas Aquinas and Friar Robert Bacon _ both of
whom studied with Arab masters _ knew, does not confine itself to
particular races and religions. Nor does it confine itself to
particular disciplines, and we may well look forward to the
re-marriage of science and theology, complementary quests that were
divorced at the dawn of modernity.
	    &UR; ___
	   Liberation, Paris, on French NATO official suspected of spying
for Serb authorities:
	   Always searching for credibility, French diplomacy had no need
for an espionage affair benefiting the Serbs. ... The (Pierre
Bunel) affair is even more delicate for Paris because it can only
reinforce the bad reputation of the French army in former
Yugoslavia, a view held notably by the American and British
services.
	   Jacques Chirac certainly showed uncustomary firmness toward the
Serbs in Bosnia. But the shadow zones have not disappeared _
notably, in the case of Serbian war criminals in Bosnia, who live
peacefully in the zone controlled by the French army. The British
forces, on the other hand, have not hesitated to make arrests.
	   It's been whispered that Paris may have closed its eyes to the
movement of (former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan) Karadzic and (his
wartime military chief Gen. Ratko) Mladic in order to obtain
freedom for two French pilots shot down over Serbian Bosnia.
	    &UR; ___
	   La Repubblica, Rome, on Middle East peace:
	   In just a few days President Bill Clinton switched from a
successful peace negotiation in the Middle East to making war plans
in the same region.
	   Following Saddam Hussein's refusal to cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors, Clinton threatened a military reprisal against
Iraq.
	   Maybe this is only a coincidence. But what if it's not?
	   Saddam might have in mind to sabotage the Wye Plantation
agreement, in an attempt to paralyze a peace process which is
already difficult.
	   Whatever his real intentions, and besides legitimate debates
over what would be the best way to dismantle the Iraqi arsenal,
Saddam's new challenge reminds the West that there can only be one
single strategy in the Middle East. It's not possible to ignore or
to neglect a question in order to concentrate on another one. ...
	   The coincidence might only be accidental, but it's certain that
every step to peace aggravates the conflict between moderates and
extremists in the whole region.
	    &UR; ___
	   Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on John Glenn:
	   John Glenn was 40 years old when he first ventured into space 36
years ago. Now 77, he was allowed to fulfill his dream because
space flight today is much safer and less taxing than it was in
1962.
	   Concern for its public image may be the real reason that NASA
relented to Glenn's requests for a second space flight. NASA's
strategy seems to have hit the mark, as Glenn's flight has
attracted enormous public interest.
	   But even space programs need vitamin shots on occasion. We hope
that the experiments on aging conducted by Glenn and Chiaki Mukai,
the flight's two payload specialists, will succeed and make Glenn's
second flight a meaningful one.
	   NASA believes that it is appropriate that Glenn, who ushered in
America's first space era, will also draw the curtains on that era.
The new age, which will revolve around the international space
station, gets under way in November.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Telegraph, London, on selecting a new poet laureate:
	   The government may be in grave danger of making a fool of itself
_ and more important, of Britain _ in its choice of a new poet
laureate. After the death of Ted Hughes, this newspaper immediately
warned against any attempt to make capital out of the appointment
by subordinating literary to political criteria. Since then,
alarming rumors have circulated; that Downing Street wants a
``people's laureate''; that the public must be consulted; and that
Sir Paul McCartney is a serious candidate for the post. What price
the rigorous scrutiny of potential laureates on their own merits?
	   In the end, honesty is the best policy, and the only one the
nation will respect. To choose a pop singer would be a fraud; the
new laureate must be respected by his peers. The most popular poet
laureate is most likely to be the best poet.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Independent, London, on the Church of England:
	   The bishops of Oxford and Southwark have argued that (Prince
Charles) and Camilla Parker Bowles should not be subjected to any
further indignities by being pressurized into marriage. Their
forgiving nature may be applauded. But the opposition of other
clerics to any hint that the church might be softening its attitude
on extra-marital relations is yet another worrying sign of decline.
	   Very few seem now to know where our national church stands on
anything. It is not just marriage on which churchmen are divided:
homosexuality and women priests also cause bitter argument.
	   You do not have to be a religious conservative to pine for a
strong social voice to counterbalance the selfish amorality of too
much public debate.

	   Frankfurter Rundschau, Frankfurt, on England and the euro:
	   Great Britain is beginning to realize the realities. In consort
with the (German) chancellor's visit in London, Tony Blair's Labor
government has given its clearest signal to date for Britain
joining the euro. Possibly the island will do it in time to meet
the year 2002 _ the target year of farewell for old currencies.
Finance Minister Gordon Brown's plans for the change, at least in
rough form, were made known on Monday, and indicate that Brown and
Blair are in agreement that further loss of time for the United
Kingdom would be damaging. Many businessmen and labor unions have
been telling them that much for years.

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Iraq:
	   Iraq's decision to suspend cooperation with U.N. Special
Commission weapons inspectors does not come as good news to any
party in the region.
	   The question then arises as to how unified the Council is on
what steps, specifically, have to be met before any embargoes will
be lifted. It is not fair to introduce new conditions on a deal at
a point when the old ones have been met to almost all the concerned
parties' satisfaction.
	   But it is still difficult to see why Baghdad chose this moment
to sever cooperation with the UNSCOM team in Iraq.
	   In addition, popular opinion the world has now tilted in favor
of lifting the sanctions. People everywhere, even in the U.S.,
where former officials are now speaking out against the sanctions.
	   Eight years under sanctions that have claimed over one million
lives is a long time indeed. But Iraq can't give the U.S. and
Britain, whose policies have already proven that the entire
populace of Iraq can go to hell until every last question is
answered to their satisfaction, another excuse to prolong the
sanctions. Too many lives depend on it.

	   The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, Louisiana, on South Africa's
Truth Commission:
	   Even after all-race elections in 1994 ended South Africa's long
struggle over apartheid, vanished relatives didn't come back and
the perpetrators of political violence still went unidentified.
Failing to confront that history directly would have allowed it to
fester forever.
	   No one believes that the work of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission will soothe all the enmity from years of white-minority
rule in South Africa. But the commission's report ... is the first
step in helping citizens of a deeply divided nation establish a
shared memory of the past. ...
	   The commission accused South Africa's judiciary, religious
leaders and media for appeasing or directly supporting apartheid.
In the end, though, the commission put most of the blame for
political violence where it belongs: on South Africa's white
rulers, especially former President P.W. Botha, who used the
nation's police forces, killed opponents and sponsored bombings to
preserve apartheid. ...
	   Yet the commission implicated anti-apartheid forces, too. ...
	   Stung by those findings, the ANC sought to block the report's
release. One official maintained that faulting the party's actions
would essentially ``criminalize the whole liberation struggle.''
	   Fortunately, a judge rejected that argument. The release of the
report two hours later raises the possibility that, after years of
terror, that South Africa can hope to live at least in a nation of
laws.

	   San Antonio Express-News, San Antonio, on Middle East peace:
	   Not to belittle President Clinton's efforts to forge peace in
the Middle East peace _ they have been Herculean _ but it is not
yet time to boast.
	   Clinton went to California after personally dragging Benjamin
Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat into the next phase of the peace
process and declared there will be more diplomatic heroism if
voters elect more Democrats.
	   That could come back to bite Clinton on the posterior.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu didn't give up much at the Wye
summit _ less, in fact, than the Oslo accords had previously
dictated.
	   Even at that, he returned to Israel facing a no-confidence vote
in the Knesset and a near-uprising by Jewish settlers in the region
Palestinians want for their homeland.
	   And Palestinian leader Arafat, who also has zealots with whom to
contend, got little more than Netanyahu's grudging OK to keep
negotiating.
	   The next phase begins Monday, and the issues are the most
virulent: Palestinian statehood, which Netanyahu has decried, and
the status of Jerusalem, which both Arabs and Jews covet as a
capital.
	   Wye was a picnic compared to what's up next. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Corpus Christi Caller-Times, Corpus Christi, Texas, on economic
good times:
	   The bad news the Federal Reserve Board has been fearing may be
here: The American worker is profiting from the economic boom. ...
	   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's baleful gaze has been alert for
the slightest sign of wage-push inflation, an expected, if still
overdue, consequence of the 28-year lows in unemployment.
	   The Fed had been poised to intervene by raising interest rates
if that occurred, but labor shortages have been slow to drive up
wages as recession-scarred and downsize-scared workers opted for
job security instead.
	   In August, the Fed had to reverse course, with two interest rate
cuts already this fall, to forestall another, potentially graver
problem: the spread of the slump afflicting a large part of the
globe to the American economy.
	   The wage figures came out on the heels of two other encouraging
economic measures: vehicle sales are good and durable goods orders
are strong, meaning that, despite hints of shaky confidence,
consumers are still spending and businesses still investing.
	   All told, this is good news, even for the Fed.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin wouldn't have lived for
more than six months beyond the fall of 1996 if he hadn't had heart
surgery, one of his doctors said in a documentary broadcast
Thursday, the anniversary of the operation.
	   Yeltsin had quintuple heart bypass surgery on Nov. 5, 1996,
which sidelined him for months but, doctors said, enabled him to
eventually return to work.
	   ``The fact that he had to be (operated on) is absolutely
proven,'' one of Yeltsin's surgeons, Dr. Sergei Korolyov, said in
the documentary ``The President's Heart'' by Russia's independent
NTV television station.
	   ``Otherwise, he simply wouldn't be alive. He definitely wouldn't
be alive now. At most, it would have been 6 more months for him,''
Korolyov said.
	   The surgery, conducted by a 12-person team led by Russia's Dr.
Renat Akchurin, lasted seven hours and involved five bypasses.
Renowned American cardiologist Dr. Michael DeBakey consulted on the
surgery and was also interviewed in the documentary.
	   Yeltsin regained consciousness about five hours after surgery,
and within 24 hours of the operation he reclaimed his presidential
powers, including control over Russia's nuclear weapons. But it
took him months to return to work full-time.
	   The documentary came as speculation about Yeltsin's health have
flared anew. The president is recuperating at the Black Sea resort
of Sochi for what aides describe as exhaustion and high blood
pressure.
	   The president's critics have been saying that Yeltsin is not
physically fit to govern and should resign. Yeltsin insists he does
not have any serious health problems and will serve out his tenure,
which ends in 2000.

<TEXT>
	   PERUGIA, Italy (AP) _ Hidetoshi Nakata was already a super hero
to plenty of soccer fans in the small, central Italian city of
Perugia. Now, the Japanese player has a comic book to prove it.
	   The first issue, based on Nakata's early months in Italy, will
hit newsstands and be sold outside Perugia's stadium Sunday, when
the Italian League club hosts Vicenza.
	   The 32-page, black-and-white comic costs 5,000 lire (dlrs 3),
and will have text in both Italian and Japanese.
	   Hundreds of Japanese fans have been attending Perugia's home
games this season to cheer on their countryman, a skilled
midfielder who has scored three goals.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A former Lithuanian security chief,
charged with sending scores of Jews to their deaths during the Nazi
occupation, proclaimed his innocence in court Thursday from a
wheelchair.
	   He was rushed from court minutes later in an ambulance.
	   Doctors said Aleksandras Lileikis, 91, may have suffered a heart
attack and the judge postponed the trial until Monday. Hospital
officials refused to comment.
	   The trial, the first Nazi war crimes proceedings in the former
Soviet Union, has been repeatedly delayed by Lileikis' health
problems.
	   Lileikis, who has been stripped of his U.S. citizenship, faces
genocide charges for allegedly turning over more than 70 Jews to a
German execution squad.
	   ``I was working for my nation and my country for all my life and
now I am old and weak. But I can still say I did nothing wrong in
my lifetime,'' Lileikis told the court.
	   Minutes later, his hands began trembling, he started reciting
the Lord's Prayer and he asked for more air. His daughter rushed to
his side, crying and handing pills to her father.
	   Lileikis, formerly of the Boston area who lived in the United
States for 40 years after World War II, returned to Lithuania in
1995 as the United States was moving to revoke his citizenship.
	   Some Jewish groups have criticized Lithuania for being slow in
beginning the trial, alleging that officials hope Lileikis will die
before the start of proceedings that would bring painful reminders
of the slaughter of the occupation years.
	   About 90 percent of Lithuania's 240,000 prewar Jews died during
the occupation.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS explanation on location of heat in relation to
passengers, makes more precise metric-feet conversation. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Temperatures rose to 300 degrees
Celsius (572F) without leaving traces of fire in the front part of
Swissair flight 111 before it crashed, an in-house publication of
the airline said Thursday.
	   There still is no indication of the source of the heat, said the
publication, ``News.'' It described as ``pure speculation''
theories that a fire was caused by an electrical short that ignited
insulation material.
	   Investigators, who have found that the high heat melted plastic
in the first 10 meters (33 feet) of the plane, were surprised that
the heat was in the ceiling area of the plane and not below the
cockpit floor, where most of the wiring is located, the newsletter
said.
	   The area covered would have extended into the first-class
section, the front row of which was just over 27 feet (8.23 meters)
back from the nose, according to Canadian documents.
	   Previous reports have said the heat was high enough to damage
plastic, but the newsletter gave the first indication of just how
much heat there was.
	   The newsletter, published for the staff by the airline's parent
SAirGroup, said the findings by Canadian investigators were
disclosed by Hans Ulrich Beyeler, Swissair head of technology, in a
speech to the Technical Society of Zurich.
	   The MD-11 airliner flying from New York to Geneva crashed Sept.
2 off the coast of Canada, killing all 229 people aboard. The crew
reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash.
	   Last week the airline announced it was switching off a
state-of-the-art entertainment system on its remaining 15 MD-11s
and three Boeing 747s as a precautionary measure.
	   Swissair said the video-on-demand system for first and business
class was being disconnected from a power supply network routed
through the cockpit because it was nonessential and because that is
the area where the investigation is concentrated.
	   The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said last week that
recovered materials from the plane revealed that ``some of the
wiring and structure, located in the ceiling in the vicinity of the
cockpit, showed signs of heat damage.'' Some of the wiring was
associated with the aircraft`s in-flight entertainment system, it
said.
	   Other onboard entertainment systems were unaffected.
	   The newsletter said 90 percent of the wreckage has been
recovered so far.

	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ West Indian and South African
cricket officials headed to London on Thursday in an attempt to
mediate a pay dispute with dissident West Indies players and solve
the worst crisis in Caribbean cricket in 20 years.
	   The dispute is threatening to wipe out the West Indies'
three-month South African tour, which is scheduled to begin with a
one-day international on Tuesday.
	   The West Indies Cricket Board's decision on Wedneday to dismiss
Brian Lara and Carl Hooper, the captain and vice captain, sparked
public outcries for the board to either resign or be fired.
	   Besides outraged fans calling radio talk shows, the Guardian
newspaper of Trinidad, where Lara is from, called for Caribbean
Community chairman, Prime Minister Kenneth Anthony of St. Lucia, to
``intervene and mediate in this sordid affair.''
	   Only seven of the 16 players selected for the team have flown to
South Africa, and on Thursday they said they wanted to leave.
	   ``The situation is very serious. The players are keen to return
to London this evening,'' said Ali Bacher, managing director of the
United Cricket Board of South Africa.
	   The other nine players are in London, including Lara, Hooper and
former captain Courtney Walsh. After its emergency meeting
Wednesday, the WICB said the players in London who decided to
continue with the tour would be fined between 5 and 10 percent of
their tour fees, which range up to about dlrs 60,000 for Lara.
	   Players have not reacted to the firing, but the West Indian
Players Association, the player's union, said it would make a
statement Thursday afteroon.
	   Many predicted they would abandon the tour.
	   ``I think there is every likelihood now that the players will
stand behind Lara and Hooper, in which case it would lead to a
total strike of all top players and you are back to virtually the
Packer affair,'' said Peter Short of Barbados, the WICB's immediate
past chairman.
	   He referred to the last major revolt, in 1978, when then
islanders snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.
	   Clive Lloyd, the manager of this year's team that is to tour
South Africa, captained the renegade team and led the pay revolt 20
years ago.
	   When it was resolved, the West Indians negotiated substantially
better contracts with the board and began a 15-year winning streak
that earned it a reputation as the best team in the world.
	   Today, the West Indians are ranked in the top three.
	   Lloyd, Bacher and West Indies Cricket Board member Joel Garner
were to fly to London Thursday night to try to negotiate with the
players, the South African and West Indian cricket boards announced
in a joint statement.
	   But there was no sign Thursday of the board relenting in what
some consider a personal vendetta against Lara, a record-holding
but controversial batsmen who has walked out on the West Indies
twice in the past.
	   ``Regardless of what happens, there will be no compromise on
this. Lara and Hooper will not be going,'' Guayana Cricket Board
chairman and WICB member Chetram Singh said.
	   He added that the board would meet Nov. 13 to decide ``if any
further punishment will be imposed on them. Whether they will be
banned from any other tours ...''
	   Also in Guyana, officials of the 15-member Caribbean Community
were calling heads of state. ``It is safe to say that moves are
afoot to involve the heads ... in the crisis,'' spokesman Leonard
Robertson said.
	   Alloy Lequay, president of the Trinidad and Tobago Cricket Board
of Control, suggested the dispute might go all the way to the
courts _ and that the players might win. He recalled that the
English cricketers took their board to court in a pay dispute some
years ago and won.
	   Lequay implied that the board might have violated ``principles
of natural justice'' codified by the International Cricket
Conference, by firing Lara and Hooper without giving them a
hearing.
	   The board had invited the two to attend their emergency meeting
Wednesday at their Antigua headquarters. But Lara and Hooper
remained in London.
	   The West Indian Players' Association, the players' union, said
it had asked the board to meet in London, but had been turned down.
	   While many supported the players, the board also had its
backers.
	   ``A message must be sent, and the Board is sending one of
discipline,'' Trinidadian Sports Minister Manohar Ramsaran said.
	   In England, Warwickshire chief executive Dennis Amiss warned
Lara that he was putting his playing future at risk. Lara also is
captain of the Warwickshire side.
	   Former Warwickshire stalwart Jack Bannister, now a cricket
journalist, suggested Lara maybe ``thinks he has become bigger than
the game.''
	   ``As a cricketing superstar, he's unique, and I'm afraid he has
become almost a law unto himself,'' Bannister said.

 &UR; U.S. Defense Secretary in Egypt after wrapping up Gulf tour &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cohen arrival in Jordan, Edits throughout. No
Pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen on
Thursday ended a six-nation tour of Mideast, saying the United
States has ``the support it needs.'' But he appeared to gain little
public backing for possible military strikes against Iraq.
	   In the United Arab Emirates, Cohen's last stop, President Sheik
Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan called for a political solution to the
crisis with Iraq, the official Emirates News Agency reported.
	   Earlier, in Oman, Sultan Qaboos reportedly told Cohen that he
opposed any unilateral U.S. strike against Iraq, which ended its
cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Saturday.
	   ``The issue must be handled through the United Nations,'' Qaboos
was quoted as saying by Omani officials.
	   Cohen also visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. He
later flew to Egypt, where he met President Hosni Mubarak and
Egypt's defense and foreign ministers in the Red Sea resort of
Sharm el-Sheik, the Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Cohen, said the secretary had
completed ``successful consultations'' with Gulf leaders.
	   ``Based on his meetings, Secretary Cohen is confident that the
United States will have the support it needs to take appropriate
action to uphold the United Nations Security Council resolutions,''
Bacon said in a statement released by the Pentagon. It did not
detail what the responses might be.
	   He then left the same day for Jordan, where he met Crown Prince
Hassan. He did not make public comments during either stop.
	   Cohen was scheduled to leave for Turkey on Friday.
	   At least publicly, there has been little support across the
region for any U.S. military action against Iraq, which has gained
sympathy for its worsening plight under sweeping U.N. economic
sanctions.
	   ``We see no reason to provoke a crisis with Iraq other than to
distract attention from the president's personal problems,'' the
Dubai-based Al-Bayan newspaper said in an editorial.
	   Reflecting the feeling in the Arab world that Washington is
tough on Iraq and soft on Israel, Egypt's Al-Akhbar said that ``the
giant United States has become a lion before Iraq but an ostrich
and a helpless rat before Israel.''
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to try to force Baghdad to rescind its decision to
end cooperation with U.N. inspectors. The U.N. Security Council has
condemned the Iraqi decision.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.
	   It is not clear, however, whether the United States' Persian
Gulf allies would allow the use of bases on their territory.
	   On Tuesday, a Saudi official said King Fahd told the defense
secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks
on Iraq.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   But the Pentagon said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq.
	   During the standoff between Iraq and the U.N. over weapons
inspectors in February, Kuwait was the only Arab state that opened
its air bases to U.S. and British warplanes.

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Qatar and the United Arab Emirates ended
with a 0-0 tie and Saudi Arabia topped Oman 1-0 on Thursday in the
six-nation Gulf Cup.
	   Qatar, which had better control at the ball, came close to
scoring several times in and outside the penalty area.
	   Mustafa Mubarak and Mohammed al-Enezi played aggressively for
Qatar, and Mubarak almost scored in the final minutes of a game
marred by injuries and referee whistles.
	   However, Thursday's match gave Qatar its first point in the
tournament after losing to Kuwait and Oman in earlier games.
	   Despite a draw, the United Arab Emirates, which has won two
games earlier, was helped with an additional point to stay tied at
the top of the standings with 7 points.
	   Saudi, the tournament favorites, beat Oman in the other match.
	   Saudi forward Obaid al-Dossary, who came close to scoring
several goals, finally scored the winning goal in the 79th minute,
capitalizing on a mistake by an Omani defender.
	   Al-Dossary's goal lifted Saudi Arabia to the top of standings in
a tie with the United Arab Emirates.
	   Saudi Arabia beat defending champion Kuwait and drew with
Bahrain in earlier matches.
	   The competition, held every two years, began Oct. 30 and ends
Nov. 12.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will reject any U.N. Security Council
resolution demanding that it cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors
unless the resolution also calls for the end of 8-year sanctions,
Iraq's vice president said Thursday.
	   ``Iraq's response is that it will not deal positively with the
members of the (Security) Council unless there is a clear stand
that the sanctions on Iraq will be lifted,'' the vice president,
Taha Yassin Ramadan, told Associated Press Television News.
	   Ramadan spoke at the Baghdad International Fair, in which some
30 countries and 70 international companies are taking part.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite reports of a new shootout
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants, the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo said Thursday that peace prospects appeared good _ if
distant _ with both sides tired of the bloodshed.
	   International efforts to bolster peace gathered momentum. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced that
the first 46 members of an international mission of unarmed
observers would arrive in Kosovo next week. And France said it
would provide up to half of an armed intervention force meant to
protect the observers from attack.
	   In the latest clash, the village of Priluzje, 20 kilometers (15
miles) northwest of the provincial capital Pristina, came under
small-arms fire for several hours during the night but no one was
injured, the Serb Media Center reported.
	   The center, which spreads official Serb viewpoints, said several
houses were damaged in the ensuing shoot-out, and blamed the attack
on ethnic Albanian extremists fighting for independence.
	   State-run Radio Pristina reported late Thursday one ethnic
Albanian, believed to belong to KLA, was killed in a shootout with
Serbian security forces Thursday morning on the Klina-Srbica road
west of the capital.
	   Although neither report could be independently confirmed, there
have been frequent reports of violence and gunfire exchanges
despite last month's U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.

Court rejects appeal of one of Britain's most notorious murderers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Court of Appeal on Thursday ruled it was
lawful to keep Myra Hindley, one of the most notorious murderers in
modern British history, in jail for the rest of her life.
	   The decision was a victory for Home Secretary Jack Straw, whose
lawyers argued that ``pitiless and wicked'' killers such as
Hindley, 56, ``should be punished for the rest of their days'' and
never released.
	   After a series of murders that shocked the nation, Hindley and
her lover Ian Brady were convicted in 1966 of killing three
children and burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor in northern
England.
	   The pair, known as the Moors Murderers, later confessed to
killing two more children.
	   ``It seems to me with offenses as horrendous as these it is
perfectly reasonable for a Secretary of State to adopt the position
that this is a case which is so bad that it would not be
appropriate to fix a tariff,'' the court said.
	   The tariff is the recommended minimum sentence that a judge
recommends a prisoner must serve.
	   The court ruled that Straw was legally bound to keep Hindley's
case under review in case ``exceptional circumstances'' arise,
entitling her to parole.
	   In 1966, Hindley was given a 30-year minimum sentence, but in
1990, the previous Conservative government imposed a whole life
sentence on her.
	   Hindley's lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald, said that leaving her
without a realistic hope of parole ``offended against basic
principles of sentencing and justice.''
	   Brady, also sentenced to life imprisonment, is in a hospital for
the criminally insane and has not sought release.
	   Campaigners for Hindley said that she would continue to fight
the ruling, and may take her case to the House of Lords, Britain's
highest court, and the European Court of Human Rights.
	   Anne West, the mother of one of the murdered children, called
the Court of Appeal decision ``absolutely wonderful.''

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The president of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal on Thursday urged the U.N. Security Council to
force Belgrade authorities to allow war crimes investigations in
Kosovo.
	   President Gabrielle Kirk McDonald made the appeal after
Yugoslavia refused late Wednesday to allow tribunal staff to probe
alleged atrocities in the southern Yugoslav province.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and a team of
investigators had been planning a weeklong mission starting Friday
to visit the sites of alleged atrocities and interview witnesses.
	   ``This conduct is a further example of the FRY's utter disregard
for the norms of the international community,'' Kirk McDonald said
angrily.
	   ``Essentially, it has become a rogue state, one that holds the
international rule of law in contempt,'' she added.
	   Arbour would not disclose her next move. The Canadian judge
insisted she has a legal right to carry out investigations
throughout the former Yugoslavia _ a claim refuted by Belgrade.
	   Arbour was granted a visa to attend a conference in Belgrade,
but she rejected it. She vowed to continue investigating ``using
all means available to us,'' but did not elaborate.
	   Hundreds have been killed and hundreds of thousands made
homeless in seven months of fighting between Serb forces and
secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo. U.N. investigators
want to check reports of atrocities on both sides.
	   Alleged war crimes include summary executions, reprisal killings
and the wanton destruction of villages.
	   Kirk McDonald said she would report the lack of visas to the
Security Council, which set up the tribunal in 1993, and urge it to
take ``forceful'' action to push Belgrade into line.
	   Soon after hostilities broke out in Kosovo, the Security Council
ordered a tribunal investigation of alleged atrocities and told
Yugoslav authorities to cooperate.

 &UR; EDS: STANDS as 1st Ld-Writethru to some lines to RECAST, include
details on Celta, Mallorca and Celta. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ It's a season for the meek and modest.
	   After a hectic week of Europe competition, three of Spain's
heretofore weakling teams _ Celta, Betis and Mallorca _ appear to
be making giant strides both in the continent and at home in the
Primera Division.
	   Beating all predictions so far is Celta, who defeated English
league leader Aston Villa Tuesday 3-1 to advance to the third round
of the UEFA Cup, the furthest it has ever been in a European
competition.
	   Celta (3-5-0) has climbed to fourth in the 20-team Spanish
league, just three points behind perennial powerhouse and
league-leader Real Madrid (5-2-1), which has 17.
	   Celta could climb even higher on Sunday when it hosts
last-placed Extremadura.
	   ``I'm thoroughly proud of my team,'' coach Victor Fernandez
said. ``This is the triumph for all Celta fans.''
	   Two points ahead of Celta, in second, is Mallorca, which plays
lowly Villareal on Sunday wants to return to the top.
	   Mallorca, coached by Argentine Hector Cuper and which rose from
the second division two season ago, headed into Thursday's European
Cup Winner's Cup second-round, second-leg match at home with
Belgium's Genk in good position having drawn the first leg 1-1 in
Belgium two weeks ago.
	   And then there is Betis.
	   Two weeks ago it had plunged to the bottom of the Primera
Division after a 5-1 thrashing by Valencia. Seeking a sharp change
of fortune, the club fired Chilean coach Vicente Cantatore and
hired former Spanish national team manager Javier Clemente.
	   In just over a week the tough-talking Basque _ who was fired
because of Spain's poor performances both during and after the
World Cup in France this summer _ has led Betis to two victories.
	   The first pushed it four places off the bottom and the second, a
3-0 drubbing of Dutch side Willem II on Tuesday, sent it to the
third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   In Saturday's only game, Clemente gets a chance to prove it
hasn't all been luck when Betis meets next-to-last Espanyol.
	   Meanwhile, Real Madrid will be looking to strengthen its
one-point advantage when it takes on newcomer Alaves. Last week it
thrashed fellow newcomer Extremadura 5-1 to take the league lead.
	   Madrid, the defending European champion, was also scheduled to
play its Champions League game against Austria's Sturm Graz on
Thursday after the match was suspended Wednesday because of heavy
rain.
	   Also trailing Real by one point is FC Barcelona, which had its
morale seriously punctured Wednesday when it was defeated 2-1 at
home by Bayern Munich, all but killing the side's European Cup
title hopes. Barcelona plays in Oviedo on Sunday.
	   In other games Sunday, Atletico Madrid receives Deportivo,
Tenerife hosts Valladolid, Real Sociedad meets Athletic de Bilbao,
Salamanca hosts Zaragoza and Valencia welcomes Racing Santander.

Russian court says Yeltsin can't run for a third term

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ending months of speculation, Russia's highest
court ruled Thursday that Boris Yeltsin cannot use a legal loophole
to seek a third presidential term in 2000.
	   The ruling _ combined with Yeltsin's fragile health _ should
encourage several top political leaders to rev up their
presidential campaign preparations.
	   Russia's constitution puts a two-term limit on presidential
tenure. Yeltsin himself has hinted he would not seek re-election
when his current, second, term expires, and said he was satisfied
with Thursday's ruling.
	   Yet he had allowed aides to promote the idea of a third term
until recent months, when speculation resumed about his health and
his fitness to govern.
	   Yeltsin's first term began in 1991, when Russia was just a
republic within the Soviet Union. Also, the first term began before
the current constitution was adopted in 1993, and Kremlin aides
have argued that it should not count toward the constitutional
two-term limit. Yeltsin was re-elected in 1996.
	   The Communist-led opposition in parliament apparently wanted a
formal ban on Yeltsin running again, and had filed a petition for a
court ruling.
	   The Constitutional Court firmly ruled out a third-term bid.
	   ``The constitution is clear, there is nothing to interpret, the
president is in office for the second term running,'' the court
said in a statement Thursday.
	   Yeltsin praised the decision as a ``victory of law over emotions
and passions,'' said his spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   With Yeltsin apparently out of the picture for 2000, fierce
jockeying is expected to ensue among presidential hopefuls.
	   ``The main thing is to thank the president for giving us
freedom, and ask him to go so that his place can be taken by
somebody who knows how to use this freedom,'' said liberal lawmaker
Alexei Zakharov, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The potential front-runners include:
	   _ Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. Runnerup in the 1996
election, he is short on charisma and long on disdain for Yeltsin's
government. Zyuganov recently accused Yeltsin of being a
``full-blown alcoholic'' unable to perform his duties. Zyuganov's
Communist Party is the largest in parliament, but there is discord
among his followers and the numbers of his elderly supporters seem
to be dwindling.
	   _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. A tremendously powerful and popular
man in Moscow, which he has turned into the country's only
boomtown, Luzhkov likes to exploit nationalist sentiments. But it's
unclear how much support he can muster in Russia's impoverished
hinterlands, which often resent Moscow's wealth.
	   _ Krasnoyarsk Governor Alexander Lebed. A gravel-voiced retired
general, Lebed has never claimed much understanding of the economy,
but stresses his plans to bring law and order. He came in third in
the 1996 election.
	   _ Grigory Yavlinsky. A liberal economist and lawmaker liked in
the West, he finished fourth in 1996 and has a loyal following
among liberal intellectuals. But his reformist ideas have little
appeal to the poor, desperate for a stable salary after months of
unpaid wages.
	   _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov could emerge as a contender,
but has so far denied presidential ambitions. A former spymaster
and diplomat, he has been carrying out most of the top leadership
duties since Yeltsin's latest ailments struck. Primakov is widely
admired in Russia as a conscientious worker and a defender of the
country's interests. But his unusually high popularity ratings may
dissipate fast if the economy shows no signs of improving.
	   Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, praised the
Constitutional Court ruling, the Interfax news agency reported.
Gorbachev won less than 1 percent of the vote in the 1996 election,
and has said he will not run in 2000.
	   The Constitutional Court announcement Thursday came on the
second anniversary of Yeltsin's quintuple heart bypass surgery,
which sidelined him for months. The president has been ill several
times since then, and has been working only sporadically in recent
months.
	   Yeltsin, 67, is recuperating from his latest illness at the
Black Sea resort of Sochi.
	   To mark the anniversary of the 1996 surgery, independent NTV
television ran a documentary in which one of Yeltsin's doctors said
the president wouldn't have lived another six months if he hadn't
had the operation.

Russia accepting bids for Gazprom sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government began accepting bids
Thursday for a 2.5 percent stake in the natural gas giant Gazprom,
the world's largest gas company, and will make its choice Dec. 19,
a news report said.
	   The government set a starting price Wednesday for the stake at
dlrs 651 million, less than many had expected. It will accept bids
from Thursday through Dec. 16, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Desperate to plug holes in its budget, the government has been
trying to boost its revenues through privatization, but was
recently forced to cancel planned auctions of oil company Rosneft
and telecommunications concern Svyazinvest because of lack of
interest.
	   The anticipated proceeds from the Gazprom stake sale have
already been included in the government's revenues in the final
quarter of 1998.
	   The government, which holds 40 percent of Gazprom shares, had
put off a sale of a Gazprom stake after the company's share prices
plunged in the wake of the August devaluation of the ruble.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said this week the government will sell
up to 5 percent of Gazprom shares. It hasn't announced yet when it
will offer the additional 2.5 percent.
	   Private investors in Russia and abroad hold the remaining
shares.
	   Also Thursday, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said the
government plans to print no more than 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.6
billion) in the fourth quarter, although the amount could be less
if Russia receives funds from unspecified ``investment contests.''
	   Russia has been printing money to pay off mounting wage and
pension debts. Many fear the emissions will lead to even higher
inflation.
	   Zadornov said the government fulfilled its obligations to pay
workers' salaries and pensions for October, totalling 4 billion
rubles (dlrs 260 million), the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   On Wednesday, the government admitted that it would not be able
to pay its staggering foreign debts and said it would seek to
reschedule them. The Russian government owes dlrs 3.5 billion this
year and dlrs 17.5 billion next year to foreign creditors.

Aid agencies withdraw 42 staff after attacks in southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Forty-two aid workers were evacuated from
southern Sudan after a series of thefts and attacks over a week on
their operations, a U.N. statement said Thursday.
	   Operation Lifeline Sudan, a U.N. umbrella organization of aid
agencies, said the non-essential staff were withdrawn Tuesday and
Wednesday from Western Equatoria province, a region that has seen
less fighting than other regions of southern Sudan.
	   The attacks occurred between Oct. 28 and Monday.
	   Twenty aid workers remain in the region, it said.
	   In one incident, assailants attacked a truck carrying food for
the World Food Program and seriously wounded its two passengers.
Assailants also broke into three medical clinics, stealing drugs
and medical equipment, the U.N. statement said.
	   There was no word on when the workers might return.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in a 15-year civil war
that pits the Arabized, Muslim government in the north against
rebels seeking more autonomy for the long-neglected south.

Saudis climb into share of lead with Emirates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Saudi Arabia-Oman. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Obaid al-Dossary finally converted in the
79th minute on one of his several chances and gave Saudi Arabia a
share of the lead at the Gulf Cup with a 1-0 victory over Oman on
Thursday.
	   Al-Dossary capitalized on a mistake by an Omani defender and
scored to lift the Saudis to a 2-1-0 record, same as the United
Arab Emirates which drew 0-0 with Qatar earlier in the day.
	   Qatar wasted superior possession and a late chance by Mustafa
Mubarak but still held the Emirates to the draw for its first point
in three games.
	   Qatar was plagued by poor finishing after creating several
chances inside and outside the penalty area.
	   Mohammed al-Enezi also had chances in a match marred by injuries
and fouls.

 &UR; After many delays, Cabinet meets to debate peace agreement
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with fresh quotes, details,
changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With his Cabinet debating the latest
Mideast peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured
hard-liners Thursday that he would walk away from the deal if he
feels the Palestinians are not keeping their commitments.
	   After several delays, Netanyahu's Cabinet began a marathon
session expected to go through the weekend, before a vote is taken
to approve the new land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others.
	   Leaks from Thursday's meeting indicated the session was stormy,
with hard-liners accusing the government of selling out and signing
a vague agreement lacking tough security clauses.
	   In an attempt to blunt the criticism, Netanyahu told the Cabinet
that Jewish settlers would be given a say in deciding from what
West Bank areas Israel would withdraw.
	   Asked whether he would begin the troop pullback on Nov. 16, as
stipulated in the accord, Netanyahu said it was up to the
Palestinians.
	   ``If they implement, we will implement. If they don't implement
it, we won't carry it out,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV's Channel Two
during a brief Cabinet recess called after seven hours of debate.
	   ``That includes, of course, arresting prisoners. That includes,
of course, annulling the charter by vote. We won't accept any
diversion,'' Netanyahu said.
	   But Ahmed Qureai, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature
told Israel TV ``There will be no such thing as a vote,'' over the
Charter.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
accused Netanyahu of trying to please hard-liners at the expense of
the Palestinians and the majority of Israelis who back the deal.
	   ``Netanyahu is looking much more toward the settlers, expressing
understanding for their demands rather than for the interests of
the majority of the Israeli public,'' Tibi said.
	   As part of the new accord signed last month in Washington,
Israel pledged to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank over the
next 12 weeks, in exchange for Palestinian steps to improve Israeli
security.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was visit the region Thursday to
supervise implementation of the agreement, but his trip was moved
up to the weekend, likely because of the delayed Cabinet vote.
	   Netanyahu delayed convening his Cabinet for two days over the
issue of Palestinian fugitives, but the matter seemed cleared up
Thursday. Netanyahu said he had received American assurances that
the Palestinians would arrest 30 men wanted by Israel.
	   But other disputes between the sides remained, chiefly over the
procedure that will lead to the annulment of clauses in the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. The paragraph in
the peace agreement addressing the issue is vaguely worded,
allowing for different interpretations.
	   The agreement says members of the Palestine National Council,
along with those of other Palestinian organizations, will be
invited to a meeting in mid-December to affirm an Arafat letter to
U.S. President Bill Clinton on revoking the offending clauses.
	   The PLO charter itself says it can only be amended by a
two-thirds vote of the PNC members, but the agreement does not
specifically refer to holding a vote or a required majority.
	   Israel says the charter must be annulled with a vote by the PNC,
not by affirmation. Netanyahu said. ``There will be a vote.''
	   ``And if not, we simply won't give them the territory,'' he
said.

 &UR; Settlers seek replacement for Netanyahu &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Angry over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
intention to turn over West Bank land to the Palestinians, Jewish
settlers are searching for their own candidate to challenge the
premier in the next elections, a settler leader said Thursday.
	   Last week, the Jewish settler council began a telephone survey
to gauge public opinion among the over 150,000 settlers, said Ahron
Domb, a spokesman for the council.
	   ``The prime minister has disappointed us, and we think that we
need to submit a candidate from the nationalist camp,'' Domb said.
He said that the settlers will choose a candidate to support within
the next two months but will not set-up a new political party.
	   The settler movement was instrumental in helping Netanyahu
narrowly win the 1996 election, based on his promises to slow-down
the peace process.
	   But the settlers became increasingly unhappy with Netanyahu, as
he signed agreements with the Palestinians to cede West Bank
territory. Under the latest accord which calls for Israel to
withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank, some 18 settlements
will become geographically isolated and surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory.
	   Settler supports in Netanyahu's coalition have threatened to
topple the premier and force new elections if Netanyahu carries
through with the latest deal to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the
West Bank.
	   Hanan Porat, a member of the National Religious Party and a
popular figure among the settlers, said a settler candidate could
help shape policy.
	   ``Truthfully, I think the chance of winning the election would
be small,'' Porat said. ``But there is a chance to make a
significant showing and influence the (government's) next move.''
	   Porat also said his party would consider other coalition options
in the next elections.
	   ``The Likud has given up on the vision of Israel and its
wholeness,'' Porat said. ``We're not discounting any possibility.''

Iraq courting Arab, neighboring countries with oil money

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Under a glossy portrait of Iran's late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iraqi women dragging small children
elbowed their way through the crowd Thursday for some Iranian
cookies and chocolates.
	   A group of Iraqi businessmen haggled over prices with Syrian
counterparts below an imposing picture of Syria's President Hafez
Assad.
	   Such scenes would have been unthinkable only two years ago. But
the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal is letting Baghdad woo friends and
former foes into trade deals that Iraq hopes will gain backing for
its political views.
	   Iraq has given preference to Arab countries in contracts, and
it's paying off _ at least in rhetoric.
	   At a trade fair this week, not only old allies but even
representatives from Jordan and Egypt, whose recent ties to Iraq
have been testy, had warm words for the Iraqis in their latest
standoff with the United Nations.
	   ``It goes without saying that the Jordanian people will fully
back Iraq in any crisis,'' said Maher Ureibat, who is heading
neighboring Jordan's exhibit at the fair.
	   Some 30 countries and more than 70 multinational companies are
taking part, vying for contracts from the oil program whose current
six-month phase, due to end November 25, should put more than dlrs
2 billion at Iraq's disposal.
	   Most conspicuous among the participants were 17 Arab countries
plus Iraq's non-Arab neighbors _ Turkey and Iran.
	   The Iranians seem to have put their 1980-1988 war with Iraq
behind them. The Islamic Republic brought 32 state-run companies
and 25 private firms, Abbas Razavi, head of Iran's pavilion, told
The Associated Press.
	   Razavi admitted that trade was still meager but added ``Tehran
is determined to do business and catch up with others under the oil
deal.''
	   Syria occupies 2,000 square meters in the fair with 84 companies
taking part. Iraq and Syria, ruled by rival factions of the Baath
party, opened their borders last year after an 18-year shutdown.
	   ``We are doing business within the oil program and also sending
items allowed under the (U.N.) sanctions,'' said Amer Kharboutli,
head of the Syrian exhibit.
	   Some Arab countries at the fair showed clear support for Iraq in
the crisis over U.N. arms inspectors who must declare Iraq is free
of dangerous weapons before the sanctions, imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.
	   T-shirts with pictures of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were
displayed at the Palestinian pavilion.
	   ``We all will go to streets if America attacks Iraq,'' said
Fareed Hammouda, representing the 20 Palestinian companies at the
fair.
	   At the Sudanese exhibit, one pamphlet read: ``Khartoum and
Baghdad are in the same trench against America.''

E. Timor rebel chief's poems, drawings published in Lisbon

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Jailed East Timorese guerrilla leader
Xanana Gusmao has not been idle during his past four years in an
Indonesian prison cell.
	   A collection of poems and paintings which he has rendered behind
bars at Cipinang jail, in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, went on
sale Thursday in Lisbon.
	   ``My Sea of Timor'' _ a bilingual edition in Portuguese and
English _ expresses his dreams of freedom and hope for the future
of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded
in 1975 and annexed the following year, according to top Mozambican
writer Mia Couto.
	   In the book ``we find not only poetry, but the epic story of a
people,'' he wrote in the preface.
	   Gusmao, 51, headed East Timor's pro-independence guerrilla
movements from 1979 until he was captured in 1991 by Indonesian
troops.
	   The charismatic guerrilla leader was later sentenced to 20 years
in prison for plotting against former President Suharto's
government.

US envoy sees progress in Kosovo peace efforts

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of shoot-out near Klina in grafs 5-6 &QL; 
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite reports of a new shoot-out
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants, the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo said Thursday that peace prospects appeared good _ if
distant _ with both sides tired of the bloodshed.
	   International efforts to bolster peace gathered momentum. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced that
the first 46 verifiers of an international mission of unarmed
observers would arrive in Kosovo next week. And France said it
would provide up to half of an armed intervention force meant to
protect the observers from attack.
	   In the latest clash, the village of Priluzje, 20 kilometers (13
miles) northwest of the provincial capital Pristina, came under
small-arms fire for several hours during the night but no one was
injured, the Serb Media Center reported.
	   The center, which spreads official Serb viewpoints, said several
houses were damaged in the ensuing shoot-out, and blamed the attack
on ethnic Albanian extremists fighting for independence.
	   State-run Radio Pristina reported one ethnic Albanian, believed
to be a KLA member, was killed in a shoot-out with Serbian security
forces early Thursday.
	   According to the Serb Media Center, suspected KLA activists
fired at a police patrol car on the Klina-Srbica road, about 35
kilometers (22 miles) west of Pristina. The man, who was dressed in
camouflage gear with the KLA insignia, has not yet been identified.
	   Although none of the incidents could be independently confirmed,
there have been frequent reports of violence and gunfire exchanges
despite last month's U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
	   Belgrade's independent B-92 radio reported that a Serb policeman
was abducted from a passenger bus early Thursday by members of the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army at Suva Reka, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) south of Pristina
	   Tension on a different front was generated by a dispute between
Yugoslav authorities and the U.N. war crimes tribunal. Chief Judge
Gabrielle Kirk McDonald and other tribunal members canceled a
planned visit to Belgrade for an international war crimes
conference, complaining that the Yugoslav government had refused to
issue tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbour with a visa that would
enable her to visit Kosovo.
	   Arbour had planned to gather evidence on suspected atrocities
committed during the nearly eight-month crackdown on the armed
Albanian independence struggle in Kosovo that killed hundreds,
mostly ethnic Albanian civilians, and made refugees of hundreds of
thousands.
	   The tribunal argues that it has been authorized by the U.N.
Security Council to investigate war crimes in all of Yugoslavia,
which includes Kosovo, an Albanian-majority province of Serbia,
Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
	   Kirk McDonald said authorities' refusal to issue a proper visa
represented the actions of a ``rogue state that holds the
international rule of law in contempt.'' She told reporters in The
Hague, Netherlands, that she would ask the Security Council for
``forceful action'' to make Belgrade toe the line.
	   In Pristina, Mons Nyberg of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said 46 verifiers will arrive next week and
set up operations in the southern city of Prizren.
	   The 2,000-strong Verification Mission, part of an Oct. 12 peace
agreement for Kosovo, isn't expected to be officially launched
before the second half of November. It will report on whether
Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic fully complies with the
provisions of the accord, committing him to end the assault on
militant Kosovo Albanians and substantially reduce police and
military forces in Kosovo.
	   After meeting with Kosovo's Serbian officials, Serbian President
Milan Milutinovic suggested the need for a massive military
presence was over, because ``Albanian terrorism has been
defeated.''
	   But he indicated a new crackdown could be ordered if needed ``to
defend the peace and safety ... of our citizens.''
	   France's defense minister, Alain Richard, said in Paris that
France would provide up to half of the rapid intervention force of
up to 1,800 troops assigned to protect the verifiers. The troops,
armed with tanks and helicopters, will be based in neighboring
Macedonia. Four or five European nations will participate, but it
was unclear whether the United States also would take part.
	   Despite occasional skirmishes, the U.S. envoy for Kosovo,
Christopher Hill, said there was ``serious progress'' toward a
permanent solution, although that goal remained far away.
	   ``We have made some serious progress, not only in reducing
violence ... but also in coming around to a political solution that
would meet basic interests of the two sides.''
	   ``We are very much on the road and moving ahead,'' he told
reporters in Belgrade. ``Both sides understand that the status quo
is unacceptable.''

German federal prosecutor investigating fundamentalist Turkish

leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ The federal prosecutor's office said
Thursday it was investigating an Islamic fundamentalist Turkish
leader living in exile in Germany on suspicion he had prepared his
group to carry out attacks in Turkey.
	   A statement from the prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe,
identified the suspect as Metin Kaplan, a leader of the Islamic
group ``Hilafet Devleti,'' which it said planned to carry out the
attacks.
	   Information concerning the planned attacks was obtained from
authorities in Turkey, the statement said.
	   According to the statement, the group was already under
investigation in Germany for allegedly setting up a terrorist
organization that killed a former member who quit after he declared
himself a religious leader and was rejected.
	   The Imam of the group who had called for the rejected man's
murder, was convicted of inciting the May 1997 killing and
sentenced to three years in prison, the statement said.
	   Kapan, who resides in Cologne, has been accused by Turkey of
ordering a kamikaze attack on the tomb of Turkey's founder, Mustafa
Kemal Atatuerk.
	   Turkish police arrested 23 alleged members of Kaplan's group the
day before Turkey's Oct. 29 anniversary celebrations of its
founding by Atatuerk, under whom overwhelmingly Muslim Turkey got a
strictly secular constitution.
	   Turkish officials say those arrested confessed they had planned
to mark the anniversary by crashing a plane into Atatuerk's
mausoleum, where Turkish leaders, foreign dignitaries and thousands
of others were paying their respects.
	   Kapan has denied he ordered an attack ,
	   Turkey has been weighing asking for Kaplan's extradition,
however, German officials say he has political refugee status in
Germany, where he heads the German-based Association of Islamic
Groups and Communities.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ An explosion near the center of the
Swiss capital Bern killed three people and injured 17 late
Thursday, police said.
	   Dozens of rescuers, backed by a helicopter, searched for further
victims in the rubble of the five-story building, about a 10-minute
walk from the main train station.
	   The cause of the explosion could not be determined immediately.
	   The building had a car-repair garage on the ground floor and
apartments on the floors above.
	   The force of the explosion tore the front off the building,
leaving the roof hanging.
	   Witnesses said windows were shattered in a wide area around the
explosion.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Temperatures rose to 300 degrees (570
C) without leaving traces of fire in the cockpit and part of the
first-class section of Swissair Flight 111 before it crashed, an
in-house publication of the airline said Thursday.
	   There still is no indication of the source of the heat, said the
publication, ``News.'' It described as ``pure speculation''
theories that a fire was caused by an electrical short that ignited
insulation material.
	   The MD-11 airliner flying from New York to Geneva crashed Sept.
2 off the coast of Canada, killing all 229 people aboard. The crew
reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash.
	   Investigators, who have found that the high heat melted plastic
in the first 10 meters (35 feet) of the plane, were surprised that
the heat was in the ceiling area and not below the cockpit floor,
where most of the wiring is located, the newsletter said.
	   The area involved would have extended into the first-class
section, the front row of which was a little more than 8 meters (27
feet) back from the nose, according to Canadian documents.
	   Previous reports have said the temperature was high enough to
damage plastic, but the newsletter gave the first indication of
just how hot it was.
	   The newsletter, published for the staff by the airline's parent
SAirGroup, said the findings by Canadian investigators were
disclosed by Hans Ulrich Beyeler, Swissair head of technology, in a
speech to the Technical Society of Zurich.
	   Last week, the airline announced it was switching off a
state-of-the-art entertainment system on its remaining 15 MD-11s
and three Boeing 747s as a precautionary measure.
	   Swissair said the video-on-demand system for first and business
class was being disconnected from a power supply network routed
through the cockpit because it was nonessential and because that is
the area where the investigation is concentrated.
	   The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said last week that
recovered materials from the plane revealed that ``some of the
wiring and structure, located in the ceiling in the vicinity of the
cockpit, showed signs of heat damage.'' Some of the wiring was
associated with the aircraft's in-flight entertainment system, it
said.
	   The newsletter said 90 percent of the wreckage has been
recovered.

Denmark's national art museum reopens with new wing after
</HEADLINE>
renovation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Queen Margrethe on Thursday reopened
the Danish National Art Gallery after a two-year renovation that
included erecting a new wing at the rear of the 102-year-old main
building.
	   The addition adds one-third more exhibition space to the
downtown Copenhagen museum, totalling 29,500 square meters (35,400
sq. yards). Sculptures from the 20th century will be on exhibit in
the area between the two buildings which are tied by a glass and
steel construction.
	   In the early 1990s, it was decided to enlarge the National Art
Gallery because its collection, including Danish and European art
from the 14th century to the present, lacked space. The cost for
the renovation of Denmark's largest art museum was 245 million
kroner (dlrs 40 million).

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The French-speaking world Thursday launched a new
effort to curb the domination of English in the United Nations and
other international organizations.
	   The campaign is no less than a struggle for a ``new humanism'',
said former U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in the
keynote address to a two day symposium on ``plurilingualism''.
	   The conference was dedicated to promoting use of all six U.N.
languages _ including Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Spanish _ but
first-day speeches were only in French, with interpretation only
into English.
	   ``To be French-speaking is to struggle, beyond the defense of
the French language, for tolerance, respect of linguistic and
cultural diversity, for the preservation of a plural civilization _
in a word, for a new humanism,'' said Boutros-Ghali,
secretary-general of La Francophonie, the host organization.
	   Boutros-Ghali speaks fluent French, English and Arabic. He is
the first secretary-general of La Francophonie, which means the
French-speaking world. It groups 49 countries with linguistic or
cultural ties to France.
	   French has ``the most beautiful words in the world,'' but the
cause is wider than that, he said.
	   Diversity is a fact of nature, and linguistic and cultural
diversity is part of the richness of humanity, Boutros-Ghali said.
	   ``To choose to defend plurilingualism when faced with the
growing temptation of unilingualism is not born of a jealous
corporatism or a nostalgia for power,'' he said.
	   ``It is a profound, essential and natural necessity.''
	   There are more than 3,000 languages spoken in the world, but
countries share only about 60 official languages, according to
conference organizers.
	   Although the languages of the United Nations cover most of the
world, there are still 40 countries where none of the six is
officially spoken.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Angry over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
intention to turn over West Bank land to the Palestinians, Jewish
settlers are searching for their own candidate to challenge the
premier in the next elections, a settler leader said Thursday.
	   Last week, the Jewish settler council began a telephone survey
to gauge public opinion among the over 150,000 settlers who live in
the West Bank, said Ahron Domb, a spokesman for the council.
	   ``The prime minister has disappointed us, and we think that we
need to submit a candidate from the nationalist camp,'' Domb said.
He said the settlers will choose a candidate to support within the
next two months but will not set-up a new political party.
	   The settler movement was instrumental in helping Netanyahu
narrowly win the 1996 election, based on his promises to slow-down
the peace process.
	   But the settlers have become increasingly unhappy with Netanyahu
as he signed agreements with the Palestinians to cede West Bank
territory.
	   The latest accord, which calls for Israel to withdraw from 13.1
percent of the West Bank, will cause an estimated 18 settlements to
become isolated and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United States and Russia failed to reach an
expected food aid agreement Thursday despite several days of talks,
though a Russian official said the first shipments could start
arriving next month.
	   The two sides were close to agreement but adjourned their talks
until Friday because of a few outstanding disputes, a U.S. Embassy
official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. delegation had
expected to reach an accord Thursday and leave Friday, but extended
its stay.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael Hurley said that by evening
Thursday, ``there were just a couple of loose ends'' in the
negotiations. Neither Hurley nor the other embassy official would
elaborate on the disputed issues.
	   Leonid Cheshinsky, president of the Roskhlebprodukt bakery
company, also said he expected the deal to be signed. He has been
taking part in the negotiations, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The United States plans to provide Russia with 3.1 million
metric tons of food, valued at around dlrs 500 million, the White
House said Wednesday.
	   About 1.6 million metric tons would be provided for free. The
rest would be sold to Russia under a 20-year loan.
	   Russia has been hit hard by economic problems coupled with the
worst grain harvest in 40 years. Food prices have risen about 50
percent due to the country's financial crisis, prompting worries
that the poor won't be able to afford food. Food imports have
dramatically fallen off.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik, who led the Russian
delegation to the talks, said the sides had basically agreed on the
food plan, but that they were still debating conditions the
Americans want to place on the aid.
	   Among the conditions are strict guidelines on how the food is
distributed, and a requirement that the profits from any food aid
that the Russian government sells go to the Pension Fund, Kulik
told reporters. Russia has indicated it wants to use some of the
profits to support the ailing agricultural sector.
	   Kulik also said there was some debate over U.S. demands that the
food is exempted from both taxes and import duties.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday that U.S.
negotiators were working with the Russians to make sure the food
isn't diverted into the black market.
	   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has said the aid package
will include 100,000 tons of unspecified commodities, to be
distributed through non-governmental and private organizations to
some of the most vulnerable Russian citizens, especially the
elderly and poor.
	   The remaining aid would be made up of 1.5 million tons of wheat
donated by the U.S. government and 1.5 million tons bought by the
Russians with a U.S. loan.
	   The first shipment is expected to arrive in December, Cheshinsky
of Roskhlebprodukt said, according to Interfax.
	   This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The United States provided
food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   The Russian government's Customs Committee announced Thursday
that it was temporarily cutting import duties on some food
products, apparently in an effort to get more food flowing into the
country. The reduction primarily targets meat, poultry, dairy
products and vegetable oil.

Inspired Martin ousts Rafter; Kafelnikov squeezes past Henman

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Todd Martin won a thrilling final set tie break to
eliminate No. 3 seed Patrick Rafter from the dlrs 2.55 million
Paris Open on Thursday.
	   Martin, who beat No. 14 seed Goran Ivanisevic in the second
round, beat the U.S. Open Champion 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6) to
advance to the quarterfinals _ the first time in six attempts that
he has reached that stage of the Paris Open.
	   After losing the first set, Martin was a break of service behind
in the second, but came back to force a tiebreak.
	   In the third, Rafter was 0-3 behind and was at his athletic best
to force another tiebreak.
	   Rafter looked to have taken the initiative in the decisive game
with a high backhand volley played at full stretch.
	   But Martin kept his consistency, saved a match point and ran out
an 8-6 winner in the tiebreak.
	   In a tight match between two players striving to qualify for the
ATP World Championship, Yevgeny Kafelnikov saved a match point
before beating Tim Henman 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-2).
	   After taking the first set and leading 4-2 in the second, the
big-serving Russian, seeded No. 8 here, was pulled back to one set
all by a determined fightback by the British No. 1.
	   In the third, No. 9 seed Henman led 5-1. But despite serving
three aces and having a match point while leading 5-4, the Briton
couldn't finish off Kafelnikov, and was overrun in the decisive
tiebreak.
	   The match was made more important by Richard Krajicek's knee
injury, sustained Wednesday.
	   Krajicek was competing with Kafelnikov and Henman to finish in
the top eight _ and thereby qualify for the world championship in
Hanover _ but has now ruled himself out of the event.
	   ``I was outclassed for most of the first two sets. But I got a
chance and took it and played great in the third,'' Henman said.
	   ``The damage was done at the 5-2 game. I played a couple of
loose points early on and that's a break of serve gone and his
motivation was right back.''
	   Kafelnikov agreed that the match turned when Henman failed to
hold serve at 5-2 in the final set.
	   ``At 5-1 down I thought I would go off the court a loser. When I
broke back, I thought I would win the match,'' he said.
	   But the Russian was upset that Henman didn't apologize for
several fortunate net cords in the final set.
	   ``I got so frustrated, maybe I said something bad to him at the
changeover. I got so mad I didn't know where I was. When you go on
the court you should respect each other.''
	   In another third round match, No. 2 seed Marcelo Rios had two
tough sets against Vincent Spadea, but won 7-5, 6-4.
	   Mark Philippoussis of Australia continued his fine run, beating
No. 7 seed Karol Kucera 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.
	   Greg Rusedski and Magnus Gustafsson each won third round
matches, and will play each other in Friday's quarterfinals.

U.N. chief calls for expanded human rights presence in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan called
Thursday for an expanded international human rights presence in
Kosovo, where conflict between Serb security forces and ethnic
Albanians has left about 700 people dead.
	   Despite the Oct. 12 peace agreement for Kosovo, brokered by U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke, Annan said ``the human rights situation in
the region continues to be a grave cause for concern.''
	   In a report on the human rights situation in Kosovo, the
secretary-general cited examples of massacres and abductions, and
noted reports of arbitrary arrests, torture, deaths in police
custody and violent searches of the houses of political activists.
	   He said Holbrooke's agreement with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic provided the basis for increasing the international
community's monitoring capability in the region.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
announced that the first 46 members of a 2,000-strong international
mission of unarmed observers would arrive in Kosovo next week to
start the long-term verification of the Oct. 12 accord.
	   But Annan noted that the OSCE mission does not have an explicit
human rights mandate. He said the organization is consulting with
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on ways to cooperate on
human rights.
	   In the report, the secretary-general said ``some 700 people are
believed to have lost their lives since hostilities began in the
spring, while more than 240,000 people were estimated to be
internally displaced in Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia.''
	   Another 14,000 people fled across the border to Albania, he
said.
	   According to a U.N. inter-agency update on Kosovo released
Thursday, thousands of displaced people have returned to their
villages since the Serb military withdrawal on Oct. 27.
	   Many who found their houses intact said they would stay, others
are repairing their dwellings, and some are preparing to plant the
winter crop of wheat, the U.N. update said.
	   Several returnees were killed by anti-personnel land mines or
booby-traps laid around houses, buildings or wells, it said.
	   ``Although there were some reports of harassment and obstruction
by the security forces, most returnees encountered few problems,''
the update said.
	   While most Serb security forces have withdrawn from Kosovo, the
report said humanitarian personnel had seen security forces in the
hills near the towns of Komarane, Dulje and Prcevo.

Maccabi Haifa beats Ried Austria 4-1, advances 5-3

<TEXT>
	   HAIFA, Israel (AP) _ Maccabi Haifa became the first Israeli
soccer team to reach the quarterfinals of a European competition
when it defeated SV Ried of Austria 4-1 Thursday, advancing 5-3 on
aggregate in the second round, second leg of the Cup Winners Cup.
	   The goalscorers for Maccabi Haifa were Alon Mizrahi, Adoram
Keisi, Yossi Benayun, and Ibrahim Duro. Austria's scorer was
Michael Anicic in the 69th minute.
	   Ofir Koppel of Haifa was ejected in the 8th minute on his second
yellow card, but two minute later the sides were even as Ried's
Gunter Steininger was shown a red card.
	   Haifa took the lead in the 32nd when Benayun broke down the left
side and slid the ball to Mizrahi leaving goalkeeper Milav Oraze
with no chance.
	   Haifa moved ahead 2-0 in the 62nd when Keisi headed in Benayun's
free kick. But Ried rallied and made it 2-1 when Anicic found a gap
in the home defense and scored from 20 meters (yards).
	   Benayun made it 3-1 three minutes later and Duro got the last
goal in the final minutes.
	   Ried substitute Faruk Hljtruvic was ejected on a red card in the
90th minute for striking a ball boy in the chest as he took the
ball from him.

Pope welcomes proposal for moratorium on death penalty in Jubilee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Italian lawmakers urged a world moratorium
on the death penalty during the Roman Catholic Church's 2000
Jubilee, getting an enthusiastic response Thursday from Pope John
Paul II.
	   The multiparty group of Parliament members also urged an easing
of poor countries' debt for the Jubilee, echoing the Vatican's own
call to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
	   John Paul cited both ideas at a Vatican concert celebrating his
20th anniversary as pope.
	   ``I'm happy that the proposal for the reduction of the foreign
debt of the poorest countries and for a moratorium on executions is
supported by people who have high office and can, therefore,
contribute effectively to its reception,'' he said.
	   Reflecting John Paul's own opposition, the church has narrowed
the grounds for which it considers capital punishment morally
acceptable.
	   John Paul has made personal appeals against at least six
executions in the United States, galvanizing an Italian campaign
against capital punishment. Italy has no death penalty.
	   He has tied other social issues to the upcoming Jubilee as well,
saying a worldwide amnesty for most illegal immigrants would be an
appropriate way to mark Christianity's third millennium

Cuban group files suit for genocide probe in Spain against Castro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reaction from Cuban government, developments in
Washington
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Encouraged by the Pinochet case, a Cuban
exile group filed a suit before a Spanish court Thursday accusing
Fidel Castro of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   ``Spain's National Court has ruled that it is competent to
investigate crimes of genocide, terrorism and torture in the case
against Pinochet,'' said Guillermo Alonso Olarra, a lawyer for the
Miami-based Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba. ``This case is
identical.''
	   The foundation said the suit was inspired by a National Court
decision last week that gave Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon a green
light to try to bring former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to
trial for crimes committed during his 1973-90 regime.
	   Garzon had Pinochet arrested in London last month as a first
step toward his extradition. The case is pending in Britain's House
of Lords after a court there ruled that Pinochet was entitled to
immunity as a former head of state.
	   Alonso said they had submitted papers to Spain's National Court
detailing the cases of some 120 people who allegedly suffered
torture or other abuses by Castro's government, were executed or
died while in Cuban jails or in police custody.
	   The lawyers added that the suit also included the names of
18,000 people who they say were killed or disappeared in Cuba since
1959 when Castro took power.
	   ``Spain has opened the door to the victims of Argentina and
Chile,'' Clara Maria del Valle, vice president of the foundation,
told a press conference in Madrid. ``Today we come to knock on the
door of Spanish justice in the name of the victims the crimes of
Fidel Castro.''
	   Alonso said last week's Spanish court ruling accepted that the
definition of genocide could include ``the elimination of a social
group, which is the case in Cuba.''
	   Most of the 18,000 on the list are Cubans but there are also
several people of other nationality including North Americans and
Spaniards, Alonso said he was unable to give a precise breakdown.
	   The court is likely to name a judge to review the case by the
weekend. The judge in turn should decide whether there is
sufficient evidence to warrant a formal probe within the next two
weeks, said Javier Barrilero, another lawyer for the foundation.
	   In Havana, Cuban Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez
was asked about the suit. ``I am not going to respond to such
ridiculous humbug,'' he said.
	   Earlier Thursday, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said the
``the case had no chance of succeeding'' given that Castro was a
head of state and entitled to diplomatic immunity.
	   Alongside Castro, those accused include his brother Raul, Cuban
Tourism Minister and former army commander Osmani Cienfuegos and
Carlos Amat, Cuba's ambassador in Geneva and also a former military
member.
	   Once case cited in suit was that of a raft carrying 72 Cuban
would-be exiles which was allegedly rammed by Cuban police boats on
July 13, 1994 leading to the drowning of 41 people, mostly women
and children.
	   The Foundation for Human Rights is part of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, a Miami-based group vehemently opposed to
Castro. It is well funded by Cuban exiles living in Florida and
politically influential both in that state and in Washington.
	   Hours after the suit was filed in Madrid, in Washington the
Cuban-American National Foundation renewed a request to the Clinton
administration to begin a criminal prosecution against Castro and
his associates for the murder of three U.S. citizens in 1996.
	   The three, all Cuban exiles, were aboard two light planes that
were shot down by Cuban MiGs off Cuba's coast in 1996. Also killed
was a fourth exile who was not an American citizen.
	   Foundation vice chairman Jorge Mas Santos told a news conference
that Castro's victims are asking the world ``not to differentiate
between dictators of the right and dictators of the left.''

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite reports of a new shoot-out
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants, the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo said Thursday that peace prospects appeared good _ if
distant _ with both sides tired of the bloodshed.
	   International efforts to bolster peace gathered momentum. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced that
the first 46 verifiers of an international mission of unarmed
observers would arrive in Kosovo next week. And France said it
would provide up to half of an armed intervention force meant to
protect the observers from attack.
	   In the latest clash, the village of Priluzje, 20 kilometers (13
miles) northwest of the provincial capital Pristina, came under
small-arms fire for several hours during the night but no one was
injured, the Serb Media Center reported.
	   The center, which spreads official Serb viewpoints, said several
houses were damaged in the ensuing shoot-out, and blamed the attack
on ethnic Albanian extremists fighting for independence.
	   State-run Radio Pristina reported one ethnic Albanian, believed
to be a KLA member, was killed in a shoot-out with Serbian security
forces early Thursday.
	   According to the Serb Media Center, suspected KLA activists
fired at a police patrol car on the Klina-Srbica road, about 35
kilometers (22 miles) west of Pristina. The man, who was dressed in
camouflage gear with the KLA insignia, has not yet been identified.
	   Although none of the incidents could be independently confirmed,
there have been frequent reports of violence and gunfire exchanges
despite last month's U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
	   Belgrade's independent B-92 radio reported that a Serb policeman
was abducted from a passenger bus early Thursday by members of the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army at Suva Reka, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) south of Pristina
	   Tension on a different front was generated by a dispute between
Yugoslav authorities and the U.N. war crimes tribunal. Chief Judge
Gabrielle Kirk McDonald and other tribunal members canceled a
planned visit to Belgrade for an international war crimes
conference, complaining that the Yugoslav government had refused to
issue tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbour with a visa that would
enable her to visit Kosovo.
	   Arbour had planned to gather evidence on suspected atrocities
committed during the nearly eight-month crackdown on the armed
Albanian independence struggle in Kosovo that killed hundreds,
mostly ethnic Albanian civilians, and made refugees of hundreds of
thousands.
	   In Pristina, Mons Nyberg of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said 46 verifiers will arrive next week and
set up operations in the southern city of Prizren.
	   The 2,000-strong Verification Mission, part of an Oct. 12 peace
agreement for Kosovo, isn't expected to be officially launched
before the second half of November. It will report on whether
Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic fully complies with the
provisions of the accord, committing him to end the assault on
militant Kosovo Albanians and substantially reduce police and
military forces in Kosovo.
	   In New York Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called
for an expanded international human rights presence in Kosovo,
because the OSCE mission lacks an explicit human rights mandate.

Eiffel Tower to open again after strike ends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Eiffel Tower, closed to the public during a
weeklong strike, was set to open again early Friday after
management agreed to workers' demands to hire more staff.
	   ``The Eiffel Tower will be open as normal to the public on
Friday morning,'' a management statement said Thursday evening
after the latest round of talks.
	   Some 200 workers at the Eiffel Tower have been demanding more
personnel, rejecting as insufficient the recent hiring of 20
people, with plans to recruit five more workers next year.
	   In addition, workers were demanding seven more staff.
	   The strike, which began last Friday, cost the Eiffel Tower an
estimated 300,000 francs (dlrs 55,000) per day.
	   November is a slack period for tourists. Some 310,000 people
visited the Eiffel Tower in November 1997, compared to 850,000

Three more legal actions against Pinochet in Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES a fourth complaint filed and groups announcing
demonstrations, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ More Chilean exiles filed complaints
against former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet in German courts
Thursday, hoping to pressure Germany to demand his extradition, a
spokesman for a coordinating group said.
	   The four latest complaints allege Pinochet was responsible for
the attempted murder of plaintiffs, deprivation of liberty, bodily
harm and the murder of friends, said Rainer Patz, spokesman for the
Office for Coordinating Complaints against Pinochet.
	   The latest complaint in a Berlin court was filed by a person who
was a German citizen living in Chile at the time of the alleged
crimes, Patz said.
	   It brings to seven the number of complaints lodged, representing
a total of nine people.
	   Courts are reviewing the complaints to see if they have
jurisdiction, as all but one of the plaintiffs were Chilean
citizens at the time of the alleged crimes. They have since all
gained German citizenship.
	   Courts also are investigating if the statue of limitations could
have expired in the 25 years since the alleged crimes.
	   In other developments, a group identifying itself as the
``Chile-Initiative Frankfurt,'' and the Berlin-based ``Research and
Documentation Center Chile-Latin America,'' said they would hold
demonstrations in those two cities on Saturday to demand Pinochet
be prosecuted.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Norway's Valerenga rallied for three
second-half goals and drew with Turkey's Besiktas 3-3 in the second
round, second leg of the Cup Winners Cup Thursday, advancing to the

again in the 42nd on a cross from Christopher Ohen.

Bank of England cuts interest rates by 0.5 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: for AMs; EDITS, UPDATES with London stock market closing
price, comment.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hoping to stave off a threatened recession, the
Bank of England cut a key lending rate by one-half of a percentage
point Thursday.
	   Businessmen welcomed the decision _ the first time the
independent bank has cut rates by more than 0.25 percent _ but
London's stock market fell back sharply amid traders' fears that
the bank believes Britain's economic outlook was gloomier than
expected.
	   ``The market presumes that if the bank is prepared to make a cut
of 0.5 percent, they may be more concerned about the outlook than
previously stated,'' said Peter Hensman, assistant global
strategist at Newton Fund Managers.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed down 143.1 points, or 2.54 percent, at 5,479.8 points.
	   The cut brings the bank's base lending rate for loans to
commercial banks to 6.75 percent and follows a drop of 0.25
percentage points last month.
	   The bank's monetary policy committee, responsible for setting
interest rates, said that the cut in the so-called repo rate was
needed to hit the 2.5 percent inflation target and that news about
international economic conditions had prompted it to moderate its
growth forecasts for next year and downgrade its projection for
inflation over the next two years.
	   Britain's finance chief, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
Brown, also welcomed the move, saying it showed Britain was
steering a course of stability. One of Brown's first actions as
chancellor was to give the Bank of England independence in setting
interest rates.
	   The move was welcomed by business leaders and hailed as
``brave'' by analysts, while mortgage companies immediately moved
to cut lending rates by the same amount.
	   Kate Barker, chief economic adviser for the Confederation of
British Industry, said that as inflationary pressures eased there
should be scope for further reductions in the coming months.
	   ``Business will welcome this decision as the right response to
our warnings on the increasing risk of a U.K. recession,'' she
said. ``Similar cuts are still likely to be necessary in the months
ahead if we are to head off the dangers of recession next year.''
	   But the cut would not save the economy single-handedly, with the
global financial crisis far from over, said Julian Jessop,
economist at Nikko Europe.
	   Geoffrey Dicks, economist at Greenwich NatWest, said that while
he welcomes the break with precedent in the face of international
economic turmoil, rates still need to come down to about 6 percent.

Sweden ties Czechs 2-2; Finland edges Russia 3-2 in opening round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Jan Larsson scored a power-play goal
midway through the third period to give Sweden a 2-2 tie against
the Czech Republic in Thursday's opening round of the Karjala Cup
ice hockey tournament.
	   Sweden, which won the World Championships in Switzerland in May,
extended its unbeaten streak to 21 games.
	   Host Finland edged Russia 3-2 in the other game as defenseman
Marko Kiprusoff, who had a brief stint with the Montreal Canadiens
three years ago, notched the game-winner at 4:26 in the third
period.
	   The Czechs took a 2-0 lead in the first period on goals by Radek
Martinek and Pavel Patera. With 50 seconds left of the period,
Edvin Frylen cut the score with a power-play goal for the Swedes.
	   ``It was my first goal on the national team and that's always
very special,'' said Frylen, a defenseman who has played only four
games for Sweden and replaced an injured player in this tournament.
	   Larsson, who is second in scoring behind American Tom Bissett in
the Swedish Elite League, tied it at 7:22 in the third. Former
NHLer Christer Olsson set up both Swedish goals.
	   Two referees worked the game for the first time in a major
European tournament.
	   The tournament is the second in the European Hockey Tour. Sweden
won the first tournament in the Czech Republic two months ago and
leads the overall standings with five points, one ahead of Finland.
	   Juha Rihijarvi and Marko Tuomainen scored the other goals for
Finland. Sergej Petrenko and Andrei Markov scored Russia's goals.

After many delays, Cabinet meets to debate peace agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with settlers searching for challenger grafs 5-6;
CORRECTS to back step up in graf 14 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With his Cabinet debating the latest
Mideast peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured
skeptical hard-liners Thursday he would walk away from the deal if
he feels the Palestinians are not keeping their commitments.
	   After several delays, Netanyahu's Cabinet began a marathon
session expected to go through the weekend before approving the new
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others.
	   Leaks from Thursday's meeting indicated the session was stormy,
with hard-liners accusing the government of selling out and signing
a vague agreement lacking tough security clauses.
	   In an attempt to blunt the criticism, Netanyahu told the Cabinet
that Jewish settlers would be given a say in deciding from what
West Bank areas Israel would withdraw. Israel TV said some 18
settlements would become geographically isolated and surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory as a result of the deal.
	   Settler leaders said they were looking for an alternative
candidate to challenge Netanayahu in the next elections.
	   Asked whether he would begin the troop pullback on Nov. 16, as
stipulated in the accord, Netanyahu said it was up to the
Palestinians.
	   ``If they implement, we will implement. If they don't implement
it, we won't carry it out,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV's Channel Two
during a brief Cabinet recess called after seven hours of debate.
	   ``That includes of course arresting prisoners, that includes of
course, annulling the charter by vote. We won't accept any
diversion,'' Netanyahu said.
	   But Ahmed Qureai, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature
told Israel TV ``There will be no such thing as a vote,'' over the
Charter.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
accused Netanyahu of trying to please hard-liners at the expense of
the Palestinians and the majority of Israelis who back the deal.
	   ``Netanyahu is looking much more toward the settlers, expressing
understanding for their demands rather than for the interests of
the majority of the Israeli public,'' Tibi said.
	   As part of the new accord signed last month in Washington,
Israel pledged to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank over the
next 12 weeks, in exchange for Palestinian steps to improve Israeli
security.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region
Thursday to supervise implementation of the agreement, but his trip
was moved back to the weekend, likely because of the delayed
Cabinet vote.
	   Netanyahu delayed convening his Cabinet for two days over the
issue of Palestinian fugitives, but the matter seemed cleared up
Thursday. Netanyahu said he had received American assurances that
the Palestinians would arrest 30 men wanted by Israel.
	   But other disputes between the sides remained, chiefly over the
procedure that will lead to the annulment of clauses in the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. The paragraph in
the peace agreement addressing the issue is vaguely worded,
allowing for somewhat different interpretations.
	   The agreement says members of the Palestine National Council,
along with those of other Palestinian organizations, will be
invited to a meeting in mid-December during which an Arafat letter
to U.S. President Bill Clinton concerning the revoking of the
offending clauses will be reaffirmed.
	   The PLO charter itself says it can only be amended by a vote of
two-thirds of the PNC members, but the agreement does not
specifically refer to holding a vote or a required majority.
	   Israel says the charter must be annulled with a vote by the PNC,
not by affirmation. Netanyahu said. ``There will be a vote.''
	   ``And if not, we simply won't give them the territory,'' he
said.

Miners, other workers hold unsanctioned protest in Belarus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ More than 2,000 miners, businessmen and
other workers from around Belarus protested food and medicine
shortages Thursday and demanded an increase in the dlrs 46 monthly
minimum wage.
	   About 1,000 people then marched seven kilometers (four miles) to
authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko's residence, calling
him a ``disgrace'' and urging him to negotiate with the disgruntled
workers. Hundreds of riot troops escorted the unsanctioned march.
	   Eight people were arrested, but no violence was reported, said
Oleg Bebenin of the Charter-97 human rights group.
	   Workers from the largest private and state-run factories and
businesses in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, joined the rally,
organized by the Belarusian Free Trade Unions. Miners and workers
from other regions also took part.
	   ``A Decent Salary for a Working Man'' read one poster. Another
said ``We Are Fed up with you (Lukashenko).''
	   The demonstrators complained about shortages of medicine, eggs,
milk, sugar, chicken and cheese.
	   Lukashenko has resisted free-market reforms and relied on
Soviet-era price controls and food rationing to manage the economy
of the former Soviet republic of 10 million people. But the fixed
prices have spurred exports to neighboring Russia, where food
prices are much higher, and caused food shortages in Belarus.
	   The protesters also demanded that the minimum wage be raised to
dlrs 100 a month from the current dlrs 46. They promised to go on a
one-day strike Dec. 7 if their demands aren't met.
	   The leader of the Free Trade Union, Maria Aliyeva, demanded that
the president start talks with the workers and that the talks be
shown on live television. Lukashenko, who keeps a tight rein on
opposition and the media, is unlikely to consent.

 &UR; Swiss report says anti-Semitism revived by Holocaust controversy &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from commission, Jewish officials. No
pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Long-buried prejudice against Jews in
Switzerland has surfaced over the last two years as the country's
wartime past came under international scrutiny, Swiss anti-racism
experts said Thursday.
	   ``We were struck by the speed with which the situation
deteriorated last year,'' said Boel Sambuc, deputy head of the
government's Federal Commission against Racism.
	   The problem has not yet fully receded, chairman Georg Kreis
added as the panel released a 72-page report on anti-Semitism in
Switzerland.
	   But the Swiss are at last dealing with anti-Semitism after
ignoring it since the end of World War II, the authors said.
	   The study cautioned that the August settlement in which
Switzerland's two biggest banks agreed to pay Holocaust survivors
dlrs 1.25 billion in compensation for wartime losses ``may arouse
new signs of anti-Semitism in Switzerland.''
	   The accord followed prolonged international pressure, notably
from Jewish groups.
	   An outspoken Swiss Jewish leader commended the report.
	   ``It's an accurate reflection,'' although the problem is not
exceptionally large in Switzerland, said Thomas Lyssy, vice
president of the Swiss Confederation of Hebrew Congregations.
	   Lyssy said that, despite initial resentment, the settlement in
August helped dampen anti-Semitism.
	   Like its European neighbors, Switzerland has a long tradition of
underlying anti-Semitism, the panel said. However, it found
prejudice against Jews is unorganized and rarely has links to
right-wing extremism.
	   But accusations that Switzerland acted as banker to Nazi Germany
and other criticism of its wartime record caused widespread
resentment.
	   ``Comments by various politicians and a few flame-fanning
newspaper headlines helped to heat up the situation,'' the
commission said.
	   In early 1997 then-President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz drew
accusations of anti-Semitism by labeling as ``blackmail'' Jewish
demands for a dlrs 250 million Holocaust compensation fund.
	   Delamuraz eventually apologized but his comments were supported
by a large number of Swiss, the report said.
	   ``A wave of anti-Semitism'' followed, the report said, citing
letters to newspapers, threats to Jewish figures and groups and
``everyday situations in which Jews were and continue to be
insulted and ostracized.''
	   It noted, however, that Jewish organizations received many
sympathetic letters.
	   Switzerland has a Jewish community of some 19,000 in a
population of 7 million.
	   Its 1995 anti-racism law outlaws the belittling of the
Holocaust. Of some 100 cases have so far made it to court, 55
involved anti-Semitism charges.
	   The report, commissioned last year by the government, estimated
that one-tenth of the population holds anti-Semitic views, but more
could be influenced by propaganda.
	   The commission called on politicians to take a clear position
against anti-Semitism and that schools, workplaces and the army
must also deal with the issue.
	   The government said it would do ``everything in its power'' to
implement the recommendations.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Explosives believed to be a
time-controlled bomb exploded in Istanbul's Palace of Justice on
Thursday, injuring two people.
	   An outlawed leftist group claimed responsibility. A woman
calling news outlets on behalf of the Revolutionary People's
Salvation Party-Front said the attack was carried out to avenge
four comrades who allegedly disappeared in police custody earlier
this week.
	   The explosives went off on the third floor of Istanbul's
judicial headquarters in Sultanahmet, a historic district of
mosques, palaces and museums that is the city's main tourist draw.
	   Prosecutor Ferzan Citici said the explosives were planted in
steel cabinets, Turkey's Anatolia news agency said. Citici said
they were believed to be a time-controlled bomb.
	   A civil servant in the building suffered slight wounds to the
head and knee. No details were immediately available on the
injuries of the other victim.
	   The explosion occurred near the office of a senior prosecutor.
He was gone at the time.
	   The leftist group has claimed responsibility for a number of
terrorist attacks around the country. Banned Kurdish and Islamic
militant groups also are active in the city.

	   BRAGA, Portugal (AP) _ Braga defeated Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0 in a
Cup Winners' Cup second-round, second-leg game Thursday, but the
Russian club advanced 3-2 on aggregate.
	   Braga scored in the 11th minute with a powerful shot from
Croatian Karoglan Mladen that bounced off Lokomotiv keeper Ruslan
Nigmatullin's chest and into the net.
	   Two minutes later Adelino Jordao appeared to have extended
Braga's lead, but his goal was disallowed when he was ruled
off-sides.
	   Braga dominated the game, pushing Lokomotiv onto the defensive.
	   Only Lokomotiv's Zaza Dzhanashia came close to equalizing, his
best chance arriving three minutes into the second half with a
close-range header.
	   Braga cranked up the pressure in the second half, moving more
players into attack and firing a long series of shots, but the
Russians held out and advanced thanks to their 3-1 home victory in
the first leg two weeks ago.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The head of the OSCE verification mission
for Kosovo said Thursday he will start next week setting up an
infrastructure for its 2,000 members and begin preparing next
year's elections in the troubled Yugoslav province.
	   William Graham Walker, a U.S. diplomat, was appointed to the
post in October by the head of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Poland's Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek,
who holds the rotating job this year.
	   Walker was in Warsaw to meet Geremek and his newly-appointed
deputies.
	   He told reporters that the hardest tasks at the start in Kosovo
will be ``surviving the winter and finding accommodations and
setting up an infrastructure to support the mission'' of 2,000
people.
	   Another difficult task will be ``putting together and
supervising the electoral process as the key to finding out what
the Kosovo people really want,'' Walker said. The elections are due
in less than nine months.
	   Geremek said the mission was already successful in preventing a
``humanitarian crisis'' in Kosovo, where nine in ten residents are
ethnic Albanians. Conflict with Yugoslav authorities over Kosovo's
drive for independence has left hundreds killed and more than
250,000 driven from their homes.

	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ A rebel commander, surrounded by
government troops in mountainous northern Tajikistan, threatened
Thursday to blow up a dam if the government doesn't meet his
demands.
	   ``It will flood vast territories of Central Asia,'' Col. Makhmud
Khudoberdyev warned in a statement received by the ITAR-Tass news
agency. He said his guerrillas had mined the dam on the Kairakkhum
channel as a ``deterrence measure.''
	   The government, which had no immediate reaction to the threat,
claimed that it had largely recaptured a city that Khudoberdyev's
forces had captured in northern Tajikistan and had surrounded his
headquarters.
	   Dozens have been killed in two days of fierce fighting over
Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital,
Dushanbe. The battle has been one of the most serious outbursts of
violence since a peace accord was signed last year, ending five
years of civil war in the small, impoverished Central Asian nation.
	   The civil war was between President Emomali Rakhmonov's secular
government and the mostly Muslim opposition. Since the peace deal
was signed, the main opposition groups have been participating in a
National Reconciliation Commission.
	   However, a number of warlords have refused to recognize the deal
and continue to attack government forces.
	   Khudoberdyev issued a statement Thursday saying he wouldn't
negotiate with the government until it broadcasts his demands on
national television and radio.
	   ``We have decided to enter the political arena ... to force the
Rakhmonov government to listen to the voice of its own people and
to end the terror against its political opponents,'' the statement
said.
	   The dam he threatened to destroy holds a reservoir large enough
that it is referred to locally as a ``sea.''
	   Referring to the threat, Khudoberdyev said, ``Hot heads in
Tajikistan and outside it should make a choice: Either peace in
Tajikistan, or millions of victims for the sake of preserving
Rakhmonov's ambitions.''
	   It is not clear whether his forces are capable of destroying the
dam or, if they do, how much damage it would cause.
	   Zafar Saidov, a spokesman for the president, said government
forces had taken full control of downtown Khodzhand, leaving rebel
soldiers hemmed in around the airport and their own headquarters.
	   However, ITAR-Tass said fighting was continuing, and Russian
television said the rebels had blown up a bridge in the center of
the city.
	   The government press service said up to 100 government soldiers
had been killed, but Saidov put the death count at 39. He said 50
rebels had been killed, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Red Cross was sending medicine via neighboring Uzbekistan,
and said that at least 60 people were hospitalized, Russia's
independent NTV television reported.
	   Tajik Vice Premier Abdurakhmon Azimov said in a radio broadcast
that ``there will be no negotiations or consideration of the
rebels' demands. The matter in question is to block and liquidate
them.''
	   The rebels were still in control of the northern town of Aini,
about 140 kilometers (87 miles) northeast of Dushanbe. They have
taken all government buildings, appointed a new police chief, and
confiscated large amounts of industrial explosives from a local
factory, Interfax reported.
	   But a strategically important mountain pass, just below the
town, was still in government hands, and small groups of refugees
were moving along toward Dushanbe, Interfax said.
	   The U.N. Security Council expressed concern Thursday over the
fighting and said it hopes the hostilities will end quickly, said
council president Peter Burleigh, the deputy U.S. ambassador.

	   DANBURY, Conn. (AP) _ The industrial gases company Praxair Inc.
said Thursday it will open a carbon dioxide plant in Puerto Rico
later this month to produce the gas for companies in the Caribbean.
	   The plant, in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, will produce up to 110 tons
of carbon dioxide a day by purifying byproducts from the nearby Sun
Oil production facility.
	   The gas is used to carbonate beverages and is used by food
companies to cool and package foods and extend shelf life. Carbon
dioxide also can be used to treat industrial waste, process
drinking water and improve the growth of vegetables in greenhouses.

Parole board reduces sentence of woman who posted pig fliers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to clarify details of prison time served, 3rd graf

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli woman who posted fliers
portraying the Prophet Mohammed as a pig won a reduction in her
sentence for good behavior and was released Thursday.
	   Tatiana Suszkin was sentenced to 24 months in prison after
posting drawings showing the Muslim prophet as a pig on the doors
of Arab-owned shops in the West Bank town of Hebron last year.
Muslims, as well as Jews, consider pigs to be unclean.
	   Suszkin's parole board on Wednesday reduced her sentence by a
third for good behavior, said her lawyer, Sean Casper. She has
spent 17 months in prison, including six months of jail time before
her sentencing last January.
	   Suszkin was originally scheduled for release Monday but Thursday
she left a women's prison facility outside of Tel Aviv, accompanied
by her mother and her lawyer.
	   Asked by reporters if she regretted her actions, Suszkin just
smiled uncomfortably. After a prod by her lawyer, she said, ``What
I did was right for that moment, but I wouldn't do it again now.''
	   Israel radio reported that the Shin Bet security service opposed
the reduction in Suszkin's release and was discussing the issue
with the state attorney.
	   Under the terms of her release, Suszkin must contact the police
twice a day, according to Orit Messer-Harel, spokeswoman for the
Prisons Authority. Suszkin would also be prohibited from leaving
the Tel Aviv area and would have to observe an 8 p.m. curfew,
Messer-Harel said.
	   The posters set off clashes in Hebron, a town of 450 Jewish
settlers and 130,000 Palestinians. They also triggered outrage
throughout the Muslim world, including angry street protests in
Bangladesh and Iran, and rulings by Muslim clerics that insulting
the prophet should be punishable by death. Israeli leaders
condemned her actions.
	   Suszkin, a art school dropout and a supporter of the outlawed
anti-Arab Kach group, was convicted of committing a racist act,
supporting a terrorist organization, attempting to create religious
offense and attempted vandalism. She was also convicted of
endangering life by throwing rocks at Arab drivers.

After many delays, Israeli Cabinet meets to debate peace agreement

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With his Cabinet debating the latest
Mideast peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured
skeptical hard-liners Thursday he would walk away from the deal if
he feels the Palestinians are not keeping their commitments.
	   After several delays, Netanyahu's Cabinet began a marathon
session expected to last through the weekend, before a vote is
taken to approve the new land-for-peace agreement with the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others.
	   Leaks from Thursday's meeting indicated the session was stormy,
with hard-liners accusing the government of selling out and signing
a vague agreement lacking tough security clauses.
	   In an attempt to blunt the criticism, Netanyahu told the Cabinet
that Jewish settlers would be given a say in deciding from what
West Bank areas Israel would withdraw.
	   Settler leaders said they were looking for an alternative
candidate to challenge Netanayahu in the next elections.
	   Asked whether he would begin the troop pullback on Nov. 16, as
stipulated in the accord, Netanyahu said it was up to the
Palestinians.
	   ``If they implement, we will implement. If they don't implement
it, we won't carry it out,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV's Channel Two
during a brief Cabinet recess after seven hours of debate.
	   ``That includes, of course, arresting prisoners. That includes,
of course, annulling the charter by vote,'' Netanyahu said,
referring to clauses in the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destruction. ``We won't accept any diversion.''
	   But Ahmed Qureai, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature,
told Israel TV, ``There will be no such thing as a vote'' over the
charter.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
accused Netanyahu of trying to please hard-liners at the expense of
the Palestinians and the majority of Israelis who back the deal.
	   ``Netanyahu is looking much more toward the settlers, expressing
understanding for their demands rather than for the interests of
the majority of the Israeli public,'' Tibi said.
	   As part of the new accord signed last month in Washington,
Israel pledged to hand over 13 percent more of the West Bank over
the next 12 weeks, in exchange for Palestinian steps to improve
Israeli security.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region
Thursday to supervise implementation of the agreement, but his trip
was moved back to the weekend, most likely because of the delayed
Cabinet vote.
	   Netanyahu delayed convening his Cabinet for two days over the
issue of Palestinian fugitives, but the matter seemed cleared up
Thursday. Netanyahu said he had received American assurances that
the Palestinians would arrest 30 men wanted by Israel.
	   But other disputes between the sides remained, chiefly over the
procedure that will lead to the annulment of clauses in the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. The paragraph in
the peace agreement addressing the issue is vaguely worded,
allowing for somewhat different interpretations.
	   The agreement says members of the Palestine National Council,
along with those of other Palestinian organizations, will be
invited to a meeting in mid-December during which an Arafat letter
to President Clinton concerning the revocation of the offending
clauses will be reaffirmed.
	   The PLO charter itself says it can only be amended by a vote of
two-thirds of the PNC members, but the agreement does not
specifically refer to holding a vote or a required majority.
	   Israel says the clauses in the charter must be annulled with a
vote by the PNC, not by affirmation. Netanyahu said. ``There will
be a vote.''
	   ``And if not, we simply won't give them the territory,'' he
said.

Former slave laborers plan to fight German government-industry

 &UR; Eds: ADDS more details, estimated number of slave laborers under
Nazis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Former World War II slave laborers
under the Nazis said on Thursday they would fight a plan by
Germany's government and industry to set up a compensation fund,
saying the proposed settlement was an attempt to bypass their
claims.
	   ``The survivors are ready to work toward a solution _ but they
will not be shut out and the German government cannot stop their
claims,'' the group said in a statement faxed from their lawyer's
office in the United States.
	   Before taking office last month, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
government said a group comprising government and industry will
work out a plan to settle back-wage claims from World War II-era
slave laborers.
	   Among those participating in the group are the bosses of Allianz
insurance company, Dresdner and Deutsche banks, Volkswagen, BMW,
Siemens, Krupp, Degussa and BASF. It will be headed by Schroeder's
chief of staff, Bodo Hombach.
	   The plan is an attempt to ``bargain away our claims,'' survivor
Paul Frenkel said in the statement. He did not elaborate on how
that was being done, and the German government has not announced
any specifics on a payment plan.
	   An alternative group comprising class action claimants, slave
labor survivors, the Jewish Claims Conference, German industry and
banks and the German government should meet and agree on a
settlement, group lawyer Michael Witti said in the statement.
	   The survivors called on the German government to recognize their
right to settle their claims individually or on a class action
basis, pointing to the recent 1.25 billion dollar settlement
reached with Swiss banks on Holocaust victims' accounts there that
had never been settled.
	   New York-based lawyer Ed Fagan and Munich-based Witti will
accompany representatives of the group on a two-day trip to
Frankfurt Friday and Saturday, where they will press their claims.
	   Estimates on the number of slave laborers used by the Nazis run
as high as 9 million, many of the them from eastern Europe.

	   GRAZ, Austria (AP) _ Defender Christian Panucci scored two goals
as defending champion Real Madrid hammered Sturm Graz 5-1 on
Wednesday to storm to the top of Group C of the Champions League.
	   The match had been postponed from Wednesday because of a
waterlogged field and heavy rain.
	   Mario Haas headed Graz into an early lead in the third minute.
	   But it took only five minutes for Real to reply, with the
Italian international Panucci also scoring with a header in the
eighth to equalize.
	   Real went ahead for good in the 35th on a free kick goal by
Yugoslav striker Predrag Mijatovic.
	   Clarence Seedorf, a Dutch World Cup star, made it 3-1 in the
57th and Panucci added his second four minutes later.
	   Davor Suker, the Croatian star who was the top scorer at this
summer's World Cup, notched Real's fifth in the 74th.
	   With three victories form four matches, Real leads the group
with nine points, two more than Spartak Moscow and Inter Milan.
	   Graz is still without a point after four matches.
	   A crowd of 14,500 saw the match in the Arnold Schwarzenegger
stadium.
	   Real had beaten Graz 6-1 at home and has scored 11 goals in two
matches against the hapless Austrian champion.

1999 Tour de France route shorter, less grueling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pantani quote in 7th graf
 &UR; By JEAN-LUC COURTHIAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Tour de France, its image badly tarnished by a
doping scandal last year, will be shorter and less grueling next
summer.
	   But organizers of the prestigious cycling race, who unveiled the
route for next year's 20-stage race Thursday, emphasized that
despite last year's troubles, ``the Tour's popularity remains
intact.''
	   The 3,680-kilometer (2,286-mile) race will start in Puy du Fou
in central France with a short prologue on July 3 and will end with
its traditional ride up and down the Champs-Elysees on July 25.
	   The Tour, which will be about 200 kilometers (124 miles) shorter
than last year, will also include an extra day of rest.
	   One cyclist unhappy about the changes is reigning Tour de France
champion Marco Pantani who hinted Thursday that he might pull out
of the race next year.
	   Pantani said he was particularly concerned that there will be
less hill cycling at the event as of next year.
	   ``It's not a course to my liking,'' Pantani said Thursday night.
``There's too much against-the-clock racing.''
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the race director, sought to play down last
year's doping scandal.
	   ``Since my arrival in 1989, there has been a trend toward making
the route easier,'' Leblanc told reporters.
	   He said the fact that none of the host towns have backed out of
the Tour in the wake of the scandal, proof that France's most
beloved sporting event has not lost its appeal.
	   The Tour de France was rocked last year by a doping scandal that
saw the Festina team expelled following revelations of the
systematic use of EPO, a performance-enhancing drug.
	   Festina's team director, doctor and masseur were jailed during a
preliminary investigation after banned substances were found in a
team car.
	   Seeking to repair cycling's tattered image, three top French
sponsors said last month they have signed a charter aimed at
clamping down on the use of banned drugs among cyclists with stiff
provisions for members of their teams.
	   Next year's course includes the usual two time trials _ the
first in Metz on July 11 before arrival in the Alps, and the second
in Poitiers on July 24.
	   In its only stage outside France, the route will take riders to
Sestrieres in the Italian Alps on July 13.
	   The racers will then head south to the Pyrenees mountains,
climbing to the Piau-Engaly Pass _ the Tour's highest ever at 1,810
meters (5,938 feet) _ on July 20.
	   In all, the racers will climb 23 mountain passes.
	   Looking toward the year 2000, organizers said the Tour could
start on the island of Guadeloupe.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Jan Larsson scored a power-play goal
midway through the third period to give Sweden a 2-2 tie against
the Czech Republic in Thursday's opening round of the Karjala Cup
ice hockey tournament.
	   Sweden, which won the World Championships in Switzerland in May,
extended its unbeaten streak to 21 games.
	   Host Finland edged Russia 3-2 in the other game as defenseman
Marko Kiprusoff notched the game-winner at 4:26 in the third
period.
	   The Czechs took a 2-0 lead in the first period on goals by Radek
Martinek and Pavel Patera. With 50 seconds left of the period,
Edvin Frylen cut the score with a power-play goal for the Swedes.
	   ``It was my first goal on the national team and that's always
very special,'' said Frylen, a defenseman who has played only four
games for Sweden and replaced an injured player in this tournament.
	   Larsson, who is second in scoring behind American Tom Bissett in
the Swedish Elite League, tied it at 7:22 in the third. Christer
Olsson set up both Swedish goals.
	   Two referees worked the game for the first time in a major
European tournament.
	   The tournament is the second in the European Hockey Tour. Sweden
won the first tournament in the Czech Republic two months ago and
leads the overall standings with five points, one ahead of Finland.
	   Juha Rihijarvi and Marko Tuomainen scored the other goals for
Finland. Sergej Petrenko and Andrei Markov scored Russia's goals.

UN report details massacres by Taliban, including torture,
</HEADLINE>
suffocation &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS U.N. envoy requesting inquiry and human rights monitors
for country. INSERTS new 5th graf with further Taliban response,
noting rapporteur didn't visit country. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations on Thursday detailed
what it called horrific massacres of civilians in Afghanistan by
the Taliban militia during its capture of a northern city in
August, including mass suffocation, execution and torture.
	   An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 people, including women, children
and the elderly, were killed during the takeover of Mazar-e-Sharif
_ either randomly shot or hunted down by Taliban forces, according
to the report from a special rapporteur of the U.N. Commission on
Human Rights.
	   The slayings of Iranian diplomats by Taliban soldiers during the
takeover prompted Tehran to beef up its military presence along the
border and threaten military retaliation.
	   The Taliban, in a response contained in the report, called the
U.N. claims ``imaginary'' propaganda based on anecdotes, press
reports and false opposition claims ``which only provokes baseless
prejudices and brainwashes the people.''
	   The special rapporteur didn't visit Afghanistan because of
security concerns, and so based his report on ``reliable sources''
_ a fact which led the Taliban to conclude that he hadn't verified
any of the claims he had received.
	   Mazar-e-Sharif had been a stronghold of the northern alliance
opposed to the Taliban, which has conquered roughly 90 percent of
the Central Asian nation and installed its strict brand of Islamic
rule that forbids women from working outside the home.
	   In the first week after the Taliban's Aug. 8 takeover, hundreds
of people were summarily executed on the streets of the city or
inside their homes. Still others were tortured to death. Others
suffocated after being crowded into metal containers _ which were
left in the sunshine during Afghanistan's harsh summer _ and
transported to another city for questioning, the report said.
	   ``One witness saw the opening of three containers carrying 120
persons, of whom only three had survived the trip to Shebergan,''
80 miles (125 kilometers) west of Mazar-e-Sharif, the report said.
	   One survivor had his fingernails torn out, the report said.
Others were repeatedly beaten with steel cables.
	   The United Nations has persistently criticized the Taliban's
human rights record, but the details from the August massacres went
far beyond the traditional U.N. complaints about the Taliban's
restrictive treatment of women and girls.
	   The report's author, Special Rapporteur Choong Hyun Paik, said
he was ``horrified by the latest reports from Afghanistan, which
are profoundly disturbing and indicate a worsening pattern of grave
human rights violations.''
	   The scale of violations warrants the urgent attention of the
world community, he said in urging a more thorough investigation of
the slayings.
	   The bulk of those slain in Mazar-e-Sharif _ an estimated 3,000
people _ belonged to the minority Hazara group. Surviving Hazaras,
who are Shiite Muslims like most Iranians, were warned to practice
the Sunni Muslim tradition of the Taliban if they wanted to
survive, the report said.
	   The report also detailed massacres of about 1,800 people carried
out during the Taliban takeover of central Bamiyan province and
surrounding areas, which also contain large Hazara communities.
	   ``The pattern of the killings observed showed that men, women
and male children were shot, while baby girls were kicked or beaten
to death,'' the report said.
	   The U.N. envoy for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, recently
visited the region and eased tensions between Iran and Afghanistan
by securing the release of 26 Iranians in detention since the
takeover of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   On Wednesday, he asked the Security Council to approve sending
human rights monitors for Afghanistan to ensure that other
massacres are prevented.
	   The Taliban has agreed to an investigation of the massacres, but
Brahimi told reporters Thursday that the United Nations is awaiting
security guarantees.

Holder Chelsea wins 1-0 as Laudrup scores; advances 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Wouldn't you know it.
	   Brian Laudrup, expected to sign as early as Friday with FC
Copenhagen, got the deciding goal to advance Chelsea to the
quarterfinals of the Cup Winners Cup _ ousting what is expected to
be his new team.
	   Laudrup, a former Danish international, scored Thursday on a
header in the 32nd off a perfect cross from Graeme LeSaux to give
Chelsea _ the holders _ a 1-0 lead to advance 2-1. The clubs drew
two weeks ago in London 1-1.
	   LeSaux's cross was headed off the crossbar by teammate Pierluigi
Casiraghi, but it bounded out to Laudrup who headed it home to draw
applause at Parken Stadium.
	   Dan Petrescu substituted for Laudrup in the 66th.
	   The 29-year-old Laudrup said last week he wanted to return to
his native Denmark, and Chelsea gave him permission to go despite
only three months with the London club after moving from Glasgow
Rangers.
	   Copenhagen officials hoped to announce Laudrup's signing after
this match, although Laudrup said he planned to return to London
for a Sunday league match at West Ham.
	   The Danes, who challenged Chelsea on even terms in London, were
an even match for the Englishmen Thursday in a wide-open game with
both clubs missing several scoring chances as Chelsea's Ed De Goey
and opposite number Michael Stensgaard produced quality saves.
	   The Danes' best chance to score came in the 62nd when Chelsea
defender Celestine Babayaro, defending an open goal, stopped a
point-blank shot with his foot.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council met Thursday to adopt
a resolution condemning Iraq and demanding it resume cooperation
with U.N. arms inspectors, but threatening no explicit force if
Iraq ignores the demand.
	   During speeches before the vote, France's U.N. ambassador, Alain
Dejammet, said the only way Iraq can have sanctions lifted is if it
reverses its decision Saturday to sever all cooperation with
inspectors.
	   ``France appeals to Iraq to take the opportunity that the
council is ready to offer,'' _ a complete overview of Iraqi
compliance with U.N. resolutions that could lead to a lifting of
the oil embargo, Dejammet said.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, the council president,
said before the meeting that the United States was happy with the
resolution. ``It's strong, it's forceful, it's very clear that this
is a flagrant violation of the resolutions,'' he said.

Researchers take step toward growing heart, other tissues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Researchers have isolated and grown human
embryonic master cells in a laboratory, a key step toward possibly
someday creating heart, kidney and other tissue to replace diseased
parts of the body.
	   Reaching a goal sought by hundreds of scientists for years,
researchers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore independently cultured human stem
cells, the foundation source of cells that during gestation form
all of the body's parts.
	   The scientists also demonstrated that the cell lines would
transform into specific cell types, with specific functions, such
as muscle, bone or nerves.
	   ``It opens the possibility for some dramatic new transplantation
therapies,'' said Dr. James A. Thomson of the University of
Wisconsin, author of a study to be published in the journal
Science.
	   The research demonstrates for the first time that it's possible
to culture human cells that have the ability to develop into a wide
variety of human tissues, said John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins,
author of a study to be published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
	   ``For the first time we can start considering this as a source
of cell or tissue types for transplant,'' Gearhart said.
	   Although researchers long ago isolated stem cells from mice and
other laboratory animals, work on human stem cells has been slowed
by controversy. Some anti-abortion groups oppose human embryo
research because they consider such an embryo to be a human life.
	   Although it may be a decade or more before any patient benefits
from the work, Gearhart and Thomson said that stem cells
potentially could be used for such things as:
	   _Growing nerve cells to repair spinal injuries and restore
function to paralyzed limbs.
	   _Growing heart muscle cells to replace useless scar tissue after
a heart attack.
	   _Making brain cells that would secrete dopamine for the
treatment and control of Parkinson's disease.
	   _Growing bone marrow to replace blood-forming organs damaged by
disease or radiation. Bone marrow replacement has become an
increasingly common therapy for some types of cancers.
	   _Making the islet cells that produce insulin and, thus, creating
a lifelong treatment for diabetes. This, in effect, ``could be a
cure,'' said Thomson.
	   _Making blood cells genetically altered to resist specific
diseases, such as HIV, to replace diseased blood cells.
	   Growing entire whole organs is ``another ball game,'' and
science is far from ready to attempt that, said Gearhart.
	   Thomas Okarma, research vice president of Geron Corp., a drug
research company, said his company hopes to use stem cells to
regenerate failing tissues.
	   ``Because these cells do not age, they could be used to generate
virtually limitless supply of cells and tissue for
transplantation,'' Okarma said.
	   In his studies, Thomson isolated the stem cells from human
embryos created in a fertility clinic. He said the embryos were
``in excess'' of what was needed and the clinic patients approved
of the research.
	   The stem cells were grown in a culture in a way that kept them
alive perpetually, but unchanged. When the culture was altered
slightly, the cells transformed into basic body cell types, and
then into clusters of muscle, cartilage, bone, nerve and intestinal
cells.
	   Gearhart's group did similar work, but their starting cell mass
came from non-living fetal tissue that had been aborted. From this,
they extracted primordial germ cells that then were cultured into
stem cells. These, in turn, transformed into other body cell types.

Honduras lowers death toll, but search for victims continues

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Better information from Honduras'
ravaged countryside enabled officials to lower the confirmed death
toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 to about 6,100 on Thursday,
but leaders insisted the need for help was growing.
	   President Carlos Flores declared Hurricane Mitch had set back
Honduras' development by 50 years. He urged the more than 1.5
million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery
effort.
	   ``The county is semi-destroyed and awaits the maximum effort and
most fervent and constant work of every one of its children,'' he
said.
	   In the capital, Tegucigalpa, Mexican rescue teams began
searching for avalanche victims. Honduran doctors dispensed
vaccinations to prevent disease outbreaks in shelters crammed with
refugees.
	   As of Thursday, Mitch had killed 6,076 people in Honduras _ down
from officials' earlier estimate of 7,000. The numbers of missing
dropped from an estimated 11,000 to 4,621, Government Minister
Delmer Urbizo said.
	   ``We have more access to places affected by the storm,'' Urbizo
explained. ``Until now, we have had a short amount of time and few
resources to get reliable information.''
	   In Nicaragua, around 2,000 people were killed, most of those
swept away when a volcano crater lake collapsed a week ago. El
Salvador reported 239 dead; Guatemala said 194 of its people had
been killed. Six people died in southern Mexico and seven in Costa
Rica.
	   Aid groups and governments have called for other countries to
send medicine, water, canned food, roofing materials and equipment
to help deliver supplies.
	   In Washington on Thursday, President Bill Clinton ordered dlrs
30 million in Defense Department equipment and services and dlrs 36
million in food, fuel and other aid be sent to Honduras, Nicaragua,
El Salvador and Guatemala.
	   The White House also said Clinton was dispatching Tipper Gore,
wife of Vice President Al Gore, to Central America on a mission to
show the U.S. commitment to providing humanitarian relief.
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton also will travel to the region, visiting
Nicaragua and Honduras on Nov. 16. She later will stop in El
Salvador and Guatemala before continuing on to Haiti and the
Dominican Republic for a visit that had been canceled due to
Hurricane Georges, which struck the Caribbean in October.
	   Mitch, which sat off the Honduran coast for several days last
week, destroyed scores of Central American communities before
moving northwest. The weakened storm crossed southern Florida on
Thursday, damaging mobile homes and buildings and injuring at least
seven people.
	   Countries overwhelmed by the storm's devastation have only just
begun to calculate the damage. Honduran authorities still don't
know how many shelters have been set up across the Central American
country.
	   Surveyors have yet to evaluate roughly 10 percent of the most
affected areas _ the departments of Cortes, Atlantida, Colon and
Yoro in the north, southern Choluteca and Valle, and the central
department of Francisco Morazan, which includes the capital.
	   Numbers still can vary wildly. The estimated number of homeless
dropped from 580,000 to 569,000 Thursday.
	   Mitch damaged or destroyed at least 90 bridges on major
highways, including most spans on Highway 5, the main north-south
route, officials said.
	   Urbizo said Honduran officials hoped the scale of need in
next-door Nicaragua wouldn't overshadow Honduras' plight. ``Our
problem is that all of the country has been affected,'' he said.
	   Thursday's relief operations paled in comparison to the scope of
the disaster. A total of 14 helicopter relief missions were
delivering aid to stricken towns, said Col. Roger Antonio Caceres
of the government's Operation Mitch emergency response task force.
	   ``We can manage with the number of aircraft we have because
there is little to distribute,'' Caceres said.
	   More help was on the way. Mexico was sending 700 tons of food,
11 tons of medicine, at least 12 helicopters, four cargo planes and
475 soldiers to help in relief operations.
	   The United States committed 19 Blackhawk and Chinook
helicopters, two C-27 aircraft and one C-130 cargo plane. France
said it was sending 250 rescue workers to Central America, along
with a ship loaded with construction material and equipment.
	   The U.N. World Food Program said Thursday it was diverting
ships, some already at sea, to rush their cargoes of donated food
to Central America. It also was pulling food from warehouses at its
base in Rome, probably for delivery by emergency relief flights,
spokesman Trevor Rowe said.
	   ``We're trying to move food as fast as possible to help people
as soon as possible,'' Rowe said.
	   Searches for the missing continued, and some decomposed bodies,
once found, were being buried in common graves. About 100 victims
had been buried around Tegucigalpa, Mayor Nahum Valladeres said.
	   In the flood-ravaged Tegucigalpa neighborhood of Nueva
Esperanza, Mexican military rescuers loaded search dogs on their
backs and forded a muddy river to look for people believed buried
in a 200-foot (60-meter) avalanche that occurred last Friday.
Dozens of homes were swept into the river.
	   ``This is the first place we've been'' with the dogs, Honduran
army Maj. Freddy Diaz Celaya said. ``From here we'll continue
searching downriver.''
	   Concerned that crowded shelter conditions could produce
outbreaks of hepatitis, respiratory infections and other ailments,
the Health Ministry announced an inoculation campaign, especially
for children.
	   Doctors volunteering at a shelter housing 4,000 people at
Tegucigalpa's Polytechnic Development Institute said they'd heard
of the campaign but had yet to receive word or medicines from the
Health Ministry.
	   ``We have to vaccinate the children,'' said Dr. Mario Soto, who
has treated at least 300 children at the shelter for diarrhea,
conjunctivitis and bacterial infections.

Numbers in Honduran disaster vary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Mitch &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Determining an accurate casualty count from Hurricane Mitch has
been complicated because of downed communications links, duplicate
reporting of victims, shifting populations and the general
confusion surrounding an international disaster.
	   As the storm hovered over Honduras for five days last week,
officials said dozens, then hundreds, then possibly 2,000 had died
in widespread flooding. That estimate rocketed to as high as 7,000
but was based on reports from multiple and sometimes duplicate
sources, including local mayors, radio stations and army helicopter
crews.
	   Government Minister Delmer Urbizo said Thursday that 6,076
Hondurans had died.
	   The number of missing had been estimated at 11,000 but was
lowered to 4,621 on Thursday. The government lowered its number of
homeless from 1 million to 569,007.
	   The movement of people escaping flooding and moving into and out
of shelters made a precise count impossible, officials said.
	   Meanwhile, Nicaragua's death toll climbed Thursday from an
estimated 2,400 to 4,000, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman told
the Mexican television network Televisa.
	   El Salvador's numbers remained the same: 239 dead and 135
missing. Guatemala said it had 194 dead and an unknown number of
people missing.
	   When a precise death count can be made is unknown. In Mexico
City, there still is uncertainty over how many died in the 1985
earthquake: The government has said 6,000 killed, while unofficial
estimates put the number at 9,500 or more.
	   An engineering firm was helping Honduras' Ministry of Government
create a computer database to compile more reliable statistics
based on reports from the military, the Red Cross, non-governmental
agencies, and state and local officials. The amount of information
has increased as telephone lines and access to remote towns is
restored, but some areas have yet to be reached, and searches
continue for more victims.
	   Reporting from hard-hit capital of Honduras, Tegucigalpa, also
was affected by the death in a helicopter crash of Mayor Cesar
Armando Castellanos, which provoked confusion in an
already-overwhelmed municipal government.

Laudrup scores for Chelsea, ousting his likely new club
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ If Brian Laudrup's story with Chelsea ended
Thursday, it was an memorable finish.
	   Laudrup, expected to sign as early as Friday with FC Copenhagen,
got the deciding goal to move Chelsea to the quarterfinals of the
Cup Winners Cup _ ousting what is almost sure to be his new team.
	   Laudrup, a former Danish international, scored on a header in
the 32nd off a perfect cross from Graeme LeSaux to give Chelsea _
the holders _ a 1-0 lead to advance 2-1. The clubs drew two weeks
ago in London 1-1.
	   LeSaux's cross was headed off the crossbar by teammate Pierluigi
Casiraghi, but it bounded out to Laudrup who headed it home to draw
applause at Parken Stadium.
	   Dan Petrescu substituted for Laudrup in the 66th.
	   In other Cup Winners Cup matches, the clubs making the
quarterfinals in March were Valerenga of Norway, Croatia's Varteks,
Greek club Panionios, Israel's Maccabi Haifa, and Lokomotiv Moscow.
	   Partizan faced Lazio in a late match after a 0-0 first leg, and
Spain's Mallorca played late against Genk after a 1-1 draw two
weeks ago.
	   In Graz, Austria, Sturm Graz and Real Madrid were to play a
fourth rotation, Champions League match washed out Wednesday.
	   In Glasgow, Scotland, Rangers held a 2-1 advantage of Bayer
Leverkusen in the second round, second leg of the UEFA Cup.
	   The 29-year-old Laudrup said last week he wanted to return to
his native Denmark, and Chelsea gave him permission to go despite
only three months with the London club after moving from Glasgow
Rangers.
	   Copenhagen officials hoped to announce Laudrup's signing after
this match, although Laudrup said he planned to return to London
for a Sunday league match at West Ham.
	   In Varazdin, Croatia, Miljenko Mumlek scored the decider a
minute from the end of extra time to give Varteks a 4-2 win over SC
Heerenveen, advancing 5-4. Tied 1-1, Faik Karamberovic gave Varteks
a 2-1 lead in the 80th. That put the clubs even on total goals _
and away goals _ and forced extra time.
	   Karamberovic scored what appeared to be the decider in the
117th. But Jan de Visser momentarily dashed Varteks' hopes with a
goal a minute later _ which would have advanced the Dutch on the
away-goal rule _ setting the stage for Mumlek's decider in the
119th.
	   In Haifa, Israel, Maccabi Haifa became the first Israeli team to
reach the quarterfinals of a European competition, beating SV Ried
of Austria 4-1 to move on 5-3. The goalscorers for Maccabi Haifa
were Alon Mizrahi, Adoram Keisi, Yossi Benayun, and Ibrahim Duro.
Austria's scorer was Michael Anicic in the 69th minute.
	   Ofir Koppel of Haifa was ejected in the 8th minute on his second
yellow card, but two minutes later the sides were even as Ried's
Gunter Steininger got a red card. Ried substitute Faruk Hljtruvic
was ejected in the 90th minute for striking a ball boy in the chest
as he took the ball from him.
	   In Istanbul, Turkey, Norway's Valerenga rallied for three
second-half goals and drew with Turkey's Besiktas 3-3 to advance
4-3. Besiktas, trailing 1-0 after first leg, went ahead 3-0 on two
goals by Oktay Derelioglu and Tayfur Havutcu. But the Norwegians
evened with three second-half goals to qualify _ Knut Henry
Harladsen (63rd), Kjell Roar Kaasa (67th) and the decider from John
Carew (74th).
	   In Braga, Porgual, Braga defeated Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0, but the
Russians advanced 3-2. Braga scored in the 11th on a powerful shot
from Croatian Karoglan Mladen that bounced off Lokomotiv keeper
Ruslan Nigmatullin's chest and into the net.
	   In Limassol, Cyprus, Antonis Sapountzis scored in the 18th
mintue as Greek side Panionios defeated Apollon to advance on a 4-2
aggregate.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With his Cabinet debating the latest
Mideast peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured
skeptical hard-liners Thursday he would walk away from the deal if
he feels the Palestinians are not keeping their commitments.
	   After several delays, Netanyahu's Cabinet met for over 13 hours
Thursday to approve the land-for-peace agreement with the
Palestinians. Netanyahu's office said the cabinet would reconvene
Friday at 9:00 am (0700 gmt) to continue debating the accord.
	   Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others.

	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Glasgow's Rangers ousted Bayer
Leverkusen _ the last German team in the UEFA Cup _ drawing 1-1
Thursday to advance to the third round on a 3-2 aggregate.
	   Rangers took a 1-0 lead in the second-round, second-leg match on
a 56th minute goal by Jonatan Johansson, but Leverkusen evened in
the 78th with substitute Thomas Reichenberger scoring.
	   With Rangers advancing, it means no German team will be in the
UEFA third round for the first time since 1967-68. Stuttgart and
Werder Bremen were elimianted Tuesday when 15 of the 16 matches
were played.

Firing of Lara causes uproar, biggest row in 20 years

Grenadian leader to help mediate, Trinidadian union saying Lara
fired while acting as union representative &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ West Indian and South African
cricket officials headed to London on Thursday in an attempt to
mediate a pay dispute with dissident West Indies players and solve
the worst crisis in Caribbean cricket in 20 years.
	   The disagreement is threatening to wipe out the West Indies'
three-month South African tour, which is scheduled to begin with a
one-day international on Tuesday.
	   The West Indies Cricket Board's decision on Wedneday to dismiss
Brian Lara and Carl Hooper, the captain and vice captain, sparked
public outcries for the board to either resign or be fired.
	   Besides outraged fans calling radio talk shows, the Guardian
newspaper of Trinidad, where Lara is from, called for the Caribbean
Community chairman, Prime Minister Kenneth Anthony of St. Lucia, to
``intervene and mediate in this sordid affair.''
	   Anthony, who was visiting Trinidad and Tobago on Thursday, said
Caribbean leaders have decided to leave the two sides to ``sought
the matter out'' but that Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada,
a former captain of the Windward Islands cricket team, would ``work
with the board and players to arrive at a speedy resolution.''
	   Only seven of the 16 players selected for the team have flown to
South Africa, and on Thursday they said they wanted to leave.
	   ``The situation is very serious. The players are keen to return
to London this evening,'' said Ali Bacher, managing director of the
United Cricket Board of South Africa.
	   The other nine players are in London, including Lara, Hooper and
former captain Courtney Walsh. After its emergency meeting
Wednesday, the WICB said the players in London who decided to
continue with the tour would be fined between 5 and 10 percent of
their tour fees, which range up to about dlrs 60,000 for Lara.
	   ``Players in London and in South Africa are in solidarity and
are standing firm on the issues,'' the West Indian Players'
Association said in its first public comment Thursday.
	   Secretary Roland Holder said the issue ``is not about fees'' but
about the rights of players and the need for the board to recognize
the association as a bargaining agent for the players.
	   Holder, who spoke at the association's new office in Barbados,
said the board would not accept that Lara and Hooper had traveled
to London as representatives of their union.
	   That view was shared by the National Union of Government and
Federated Workers in Trinidad and Tobago, which charged that,
``Brian Lara, as a union representative, was sacked for going to
London to negotiate terms and conditions of employment for his
members.''
	   Many predicted the players would abandon the tour.

Parole board reduces sentence of woman who posted pig fliers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to clarify details of prison time served, 3rd graf

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli woman who posted fliers
portraying the Prophet Mohammed as a pig won a reduction in her
sentence for good behavior and was released Thursday.
	   Tatiana Suszkin was sentenced to 24 months in prison after
posting drawings showing the Muslim prophet as a pig on the doors
of Arab-owned shops in the West Bank town of Hebron last year.
Muslims, as well as Jews, consider pigs to be unclean.
	   Suszkin's parole board on Wednesday reduced her sentence by a
third for good behavior, said her lawyer, Sean Casper. She has
spent 17 months in prison, including six months of jail time before
her sentencing last January.
	   Suszkin was originally scheduled for release Monday but Thursday
she left a women's prison facility outside of Tel Aviv, accompanied
by her mother and her lawyer.
	   Asked by reporters if she regretted her actions, Suszkin just
smiled uncomfortably. After a prod by her lawyer, she said, ``What
I did was right for that moment, but I wouldn't do it again now.''
	   Israel radio reported that the Shin Bet security service opposed
the reduction in Suszkin's release and was discussing the issue
with the state attorney.
	   Under the terms of her release, Suszkin must contact the police
twice a day, according to Orit Messer-Harel, spokeswoman for the
Prisons Authority. Suszkin would also be prohibited from leaving
the Tel Aviv area and would have to observe an 8 p.m. curfew,
Messer-Harel said.
	   The posters set off clashes in Hebron, a town of 450 Jewish
settlers and 130,000 Palestinians. They also triggered outrage
throughout the Muslim world, including angry street protests in
Bangladesh and Iran, and rulings by Muslim clerics that insulting
the prophet should be punishable by death. Israeli leaders
condemned her actions.
	   Suszkin, a art school dropout and a supporter of the outlawed
anti-Arab Kach group, was convicted of committing a racist act,
supporting a terrorist organization, attempting to create religious
offense and attempted vandalism. She was also convicted of
endangering life by throwing rocks at Arab drivers.

	   BRAGA, Portugal (AP) _ Braga defeated Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0 in a
Cup Winners' Cup second-round, second-leg game Thursday, but the
Russian club advanced 3-2 on aggregate.

Croatian Karoglan Mladen that bounced off Lokomotiv keeper Ruslan

	   Two minutes later Adelino Jordao appeared to have extended
Braga's lead, but his goal was disallowed when he was ruled
off-sides.
	   Braga dominated the game, pushing Lokomotiv onto the defensive.
	   Only Lokomotiv's Zaza Dzhanashia came close to equalizing, his
best chance arriving three minutes into the second half with a
close-range header.
	   Braga cranked up the pressure in the second half, moving more
players into attack and firing a long series of shots, but the
Russians held out and advanced thanks to their 3-1 home victory in
the first leg two weeks ago.

Jailed Cali drug trafficker assassinated in prison yard
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with details on Herrera
incriminating at least 20 former associates, that assailant was an
apparent acquaintance, assailant beaten by other inmates. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A former top Cali cocaine boss was
assassinated while watching a soccer game in a prison yard
Thursday, two years after he surrendered and began fingering
ex-associates.
	   Helmer ``Pacho'' Herrera was shot at least five times in the
face by a man who gained entry to the Palmira prison outside Cali
by claiming to be a lawyer for another inmate, officials said.
	   Herrera, 47, had been the No. 3 man in the Cali cartel, one of
the world's biggest criminal organizations, and had set up and
managed cocaine distribution rings in major U.S. cities, beginning
in the 1980s.
	   The assailant appeared to be ``an acquaintance of Herrera
because he greeted him first,'' national police spokesman Carlos
Perdomo said.
	   Herrera died on the way to the hospital, emergency room director
Dr. Gustavo Paredes said.
	   The assassin, identified as Rafael Angel Uribe, 32, was beaten
by other inmates before guards took him away. He had entered the
prison a half hour before the attack, apparently while Herrera was
playing in the game's first half, national prisons director Carmen
Lucia Tristancho said.
	   She said it was unclear whether the murder weapon, a 9mm pistol,
was smuggled into the penitentiary or whether it was already
inside.
	   Herrera surrendered to authorities in September 1996, the last
of seven major cartel members to either turn themselves in or be
arrested.
	   He was convicted of drug trafficking in March and sentenced to
six years and eight months in prison after incriminating at least
20 former associates.
	   Herrera continued to seek sentence reductions, fingering his
wheelchair-bound half-brother from jail. But in September, his
prison term was increased to 14 years and eight months, following
an appeal by prosecutors.
	   When he surrendered, Herrera said he was tired of being on the
run from enemies and thought he would be safer behind bars. Known
as a man with a thousand faces, he had dodged hundreds of police
raids, even dressing up as a woman to elude authorities.
	   A decade ago, Herrera played a key role in the Cali cartel's
secret alliance with the government to wipe out the more violent
Medellin drug gang. His lawyer, Gustavo Salazar, said Thursday the
killing could have been related to that rivalry.
	   Herrera was believed responsible for a 1988 car bomb attack on a
building where the family of the late Medellin drug boss Pablo
Escobar was living. The family escaped unhurt.
	   He survived a September 1990 raid by Medellin cartel hit men on
a ranch he owned outside Cali in which 19 people were killed.
	   In the 1980s, Herrera directed cocaine distribution and
money-laundering in the New York City area for the cartel, which at
its peak exported about 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the
United States, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
	   Gaining a reputation as a deft money-launderer, Herrera had by
1990 established his own family-run cocaine trafficking business
and set up and maintained cocaine distribution networks in Los
Angeles, Houston and Miami, the DEA says.
	   The United States made a formal extradition request for Herrera
in July 1996, but Colombian law forbade his extradition.
	   Herrera is the second leading member of the Cali cartel killed
since 1995, when police captured the organization's top leaders,
Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. Both are currently serving
jail terms.
	   Jose Santacruz Londono, another top cartel boss, was killed by
police in March 1996 after escaping from prison.

Russia's secretive military intelligence agency turns 80
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top officer with Russia's secretive military
intelligence agency warned in an article Thursday that it needs to
undergo drastic reforms to survive the country's latest economic
crisis and called for closer cooperation with Western intelligence
services.
	   Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the general staff of the agency,
known by its Russian acronym GRU, was writing in the military
newspaper Red Star to mark the GRU's 80th anniversary.
	   In recalling the GRU's history, Kvashnin reiterated that it
wasn't the agency's fault that the Soviet Union fell victim to Nazi
invasion in World War II.
	   The GRU had ``specific and alarming information'' about the June
1941 invasion more than a month beforehand, but Stalin ignored the
warning, Kvashnin wrote. Similar accounts have been widely reported
in recent years.
	   Kvashnin also lamented cutbacks forced by Russia's financial
crisis.
	   ``Inadequate funding has forced the leadership of the Defense
Ministry to strictly define the main responsibilities of the GRU,
concentrate its forces and give funds only for high-priority ...
issues,'' he said. He did not say which issues.
	   He lashed out at the Untied States for ``destabilizing the
international arena by ... actively striving for a uni-polar world,
in which U.S. politicians would have the exclusive right to make
decisions on military interventions.
	   ``A glaring example of this is in the Balkans,'' he said,
referring to NATO's threatened airstrikes on Yugoslavia, which
Russia fiercely opposes.
	   Still, he said the GRU was pursuing ties with former Cold War
foes.
	   ``As strange as it sounds, Russian military intelligence has
begun cooperation with military intelligence of NATO countries.

	   The GRU was formed during the Russian Revolution in 1918. It has
come under criticism in recent years for Soviet-style secrecy and
alleged corruption.
	   Russian journalist Dmitry Kholodov was investigating corruption
in the GRU when he was killed in 1994 by a bomb in a briefcase
supposedly provided by his informant. Kholodov's employer, the
daily Moskovsky Komsomolets, linked his killing to his
investigation but has offered no proof.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council unanimously
demanded Thursday that Iraq immediately resume cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors, but Baghdad has already announced it won't
comply.
	   The legally binding resolution adopted by the council didn't
include a timetable for lifting crippling economic sanctions, which
Iraq has demanded as the price for reversing its decision to cut
all dealings with the inspectors.

	   Council members reaffirmed their readiness to hold ``a
comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions,
which could lead to the lifting of the oil embargo if U.N.
inspectors declare Iraq is disarmed. But this offer is contingent
on Iraq resuming cooperation with weapons inspectors.
	   The council agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' in
September, in an attempt to get Baghdad to allow U.N. weapons
inspectors to resume spot inspections, which it banned on Aug. 5.
	   But Iraq reacted angrily when the council sent a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan last Friday with the broad outlines of
a review that didn't explicitly mention the possibility of easing
or lifting sanctions.
	   Blaming the United States for cutting all references to ending
sanctions, Iraq on Saturday banned inspectors from monitoring
previously searched facilities _ leaving them with little to do but
change film and video cassettes on stationary cameras.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite reports of a new shootout
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants, the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo said Thursday that peace prospects appeared good _ if
distant _ with both sides tired of the bloodshed.
	   International efforts to bolster peace gathered momentum. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced that
the first 46 verifiers of an international mission of unarmed
observers would arrive in Kosovo next week.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said shuttle talks
between the two sides were producing hopeful signs in Kosovo
despite occasional skirmishes.
	   ``We have made some serious progress, not only in reducing
violence ... but also in coming around to a political solution that
would meet basic interests of the two sides,'' he said in Belgrade.
``We are very much on the road and moving ahead.''
	   Violence continued to flare, however. U.S. State Department
spokesman James Rubin, while noting an ``overall calm'' in the
Serbian province, said tensions between Serb police and the Kosovo
Liberation Army ``seem to be rising as the KLA operates more
overtly in many regions.''
	   In a clash early Thursday, state-run Radio Pristina reported
that one ethnic Albanian, believed to be a KLA member, was killed
in a shootout with Serbian security forces. Serb sources said
suspected KLA activists fired at a police patrol car on the
Klina-Srbica road, west of Pristina.
	   Belgrade's independent B-92 radio reported that a Serb policeman
was abducted from a passenger bus early Thursday by members of the
KLA at Suva Reka, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Pristina.
	   While calling Kosovo ``a hotbed of rumors and misreports,''
Rubin expressed concern at reports that the KLA had apparently
carried out three retribution killings in recent days, of ethnic
Albanians charged with collaborating with Serb authorities during
this year's fighting.
	   He also said Serb police appear to be hardening and winterizing
some of their positions in Kosovo, contrary to the agreement aimed
at ending the Serbs' crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatist
rebels.
	   Tension on a different front was generated by a dispute between
Yugoslav authorities and the U.N. war crimes tribunal. Tribunal
president Gabrielle Kirk McDonald called on the Security Council to
force Belgrade authorities to allow war crimes investigations in
Kosovo, which they refused this week to do.
	   Kirk McDonald branded Yugoslavia ``a rogue state, one that holds
the international rule of law in contempt.''
	   The head of the planned international Kosovo Verification
Mission, U.S. diplomat William Walker, said in Poland that next
week he will start setting up an infrastructure for its planned
2,000 members and begin preparing next year's elections in Kosovo.
	   In Pristina, Mons Nyberg of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is orchestrating the mission, said 46
verifiers will arrive next week and set up operations in the
southern city of Prizren.
	   The mission, part of an Oct. 12 peace agreement, isn't expected
to be officially launched before the second half of November.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for an
expanded international human rights presence in Kosovo because the
OSCE mission lacks an explicit human rights mandate.
	   After meeting with Serbian officials in Kosovo, Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic suggested the need for a massive
military presence was over because ``Albanian terrorism has been
defeated.''
	   But he indicated a new crackdown could be ordered if needed ``to
defend the peace and safety ... of our citizens.''

	   Iraq said Thursday it would reject any Security Council
resolution unless it calls for the end of 8-year-old sanctions,
imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
	   ``Iraq's response is that it will not deal positively with the
members of the council unless there is a clear stand that the
sanctions on Iraq will be lifted,'' Iraq's vice president, Taha
Yassin Ramadan, told Associated Press Television News at the
Baghdad International Fair.
	   Ramadan's remarks echoed a front-page editorial in the ruling
Baath party newspaper al-Thawra, which said Iraq would not abide by
any measure without an explicit timetable for lifting economic
sanctions.
	   Russian U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, whose country has been
sympathetic to Iraq's demand for an end to sanctions, said: ``The
way out of the crisis, the only way, is for Iraq to rescind.''
	   He said the resolution had two goals: to reiterate the council's
universal view that Iraq's decision was unacceptable, and reiterate
the council's ``willingness and readiness'' to conduct a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions
that could allow for the lifting of sanctions.
	   Lavrov has noted that the resolution by no means gives the
United States or anyone else a green light for military action.
Russia, traditionally more sympathetic to Baghdad, has opposed
using force.

Mallorca ties Genk 0-0 but advances on away-goal rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Spain (AP) _ Real Mallorca and Racing Genk
played to a scoreless draw Thursday in a Cup Winners' Cup game,
with the Spaniards advancing on the away-goal rule.
	   It marks the first time Mallorca has made it into the third
round of the tournament.
	   Genk, which played Mallorca to a 1-1 tie two weeks ago in
Brussels, came into the game needing to take risks but shied from
the challenge, concentrating instead on defense.
	   Played on a rain-slick pitch, the game was physical and tense,
especially in the second half when a goal for either side would
mean staying alive for the next round.
	   Mallorca had more shots on goal, including several blown
chances. Daniel Garcia sent a header just wide in the eighth minute
and Leonardo Biagini failed to slam home a loose ball in front of
the Genk goal in the 29th.
	   Around 15,000 people watched the game at Luis Sitjar Stadium.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With his Cabinet debating the latest
Mideast peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured
skeptical hard-liners Thursday he would walk away from the deal if
he feels the Palestinians are not keeping their commitments.
	   After several delays, Netanyahu's Cabinet met for more than 13
hours Thursday to approve the land-for-peace agreement with the
Palestinians. Netanyahu's office said the cabinet would reconvene
Friday morning to continue the debate.
	   Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others. It was unclear when the vote might
take place.

	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ World rally champion Tommi Makinen made
a strong start to be equal first after the short opening stage of
the Rally Australia Thursday night.
	   Makinen, from Finland, covered the 2.2-kilometer (1.36-mile)
stage in 1 minute, 32 seconds. Frenchman Didier Auriol had the same
time in his Toyota.
	   Rally Australia is the 12th round of the 13-race world
championship. Standings leader Carlos Sainz of Spain was 0.3
seconds slower than the leading pair in his Toyota. Scotsman Colin
McRae, who still has a chance to steal the world title from Makinen
or Sainz, was sixth in his Subaru.
	   The drivers take to gravel roads Friday before another night
stage at the purpose-built Langley Park.

	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Spain (AP) _ Real Mallorca and Racing Genk
played to a scoreless draw Thursday in a Cup Winners' Cup game,
with the Spaniards advancing on the away-goal rule.
	   It marks the first time Mallorca has made it into the third
round of the tournament.
	   Genk, which played Mallorca to a 1-1 tie two weeks ago in
Brussels, came into the game needing to take risks but shied from
the challenge, concentrating instead on defense.
	   Played on a rain-slick pitch, the game was physical and tense,
especially in the second half when a goal for either side would
mean staying alive for the next round.
	   Mallorca had more shots on goal, including several blown
chances. Daniel Garcia sent a header just wide in the eighth minute
and Leonardo Biagini failed to slam home a loose ball in front of
the Genk goal in the 29th.
	   Around 15,000 people watched the game at Luis Sitjar Stadium.

Parole board reduces sentence of woman who posted pig fliers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli woman who posted fliers
portraying the Prophet Mohammed as a pig was released from prison
Thursday after her sentence was reduced for good behavior.
	   Tatiana Suszkin was sentenced to 24 months in prison after
posting the drawings on the doors of Arab-owned shops in the West
Bank town of Hebron last year. Muslims, as well as Jews, consider
pigs to be unclean.
	   Suszkin's parole board on Wednesday reduced her sentence by a
third for good behavior, said her lawyer, Sean Casper. She had
served 17 months, including six months of jail time before her
sentencing last January.
	   She left a woman's prison outside of Tel Aviv, accompanied by
her mother and her lawyer.
	   Asked if she regretted her actions, Suszkin just smiled
uncomfortably. After a prod by her lawyer, she said, ``What I did
was right for that moment, but I wouldn't do it again now.''
	   Israel radio reported that the Shin Bet security service said it
had opposed the reduction in Suszkin's release and was discussing
the issue with the state attorney.
	   Under the terms of her release, Suszkin must contact the police
twice a day. She also must remain in the Tel Aviv area and observe
an 8 p.m. curfew, said Orit Messer-Harel, spokeswoman for the
Prisons Authority.
	   The posters set off clashes in Hebron, a town of 450 Jewish
settlers and 130,000 Palestinians. They also triggered outrage
throughout the Muslim world, including angry street protests in
Bangladesh and Iran. Israeli leaders condemned her actions.
	   Suszkin, an art school dropout and a supporter of the outlawed
anti-Arab Kach group, was convicted of committing a racist act,
supporting a terrorist organization, attempting to create religious
offense and attempted vandalism. She was also convicted of
endangering life by throwing rocks at Arab drivers.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Marcelo Salas scored twice as Lazio
Rome beat Partizan Belgrade 3-2 Thursday to advance into the third
round of the Cup Winners' Cup.
	   The first leg in Italy was tied 0-0.
	   Partizan, which dominated for most of the game, took the lead in
the 18th minute when Goran Trobok broke down the right flank and
slid the ball to Mladen Krstajic in the heart of the penalty area.
	   Krstajic fired the ball under the crossbar, leaving Lazio
goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani with no chance.
	   Lazio tied in the 44th minute after Chilean star forward Salas
was brought down by Partizan defender Branko Savic in the penalty
zone. Salas converted the penalty with a fierce shot under the bar.
	   Yugoslav midfielder Dejan Stankovic, who came in for Sergio
Conceicao in the second half, went past two Partizan defenders and
goalkeeper Nikola Damjanac to score into an empty net in the 67th
minute to make it 2-1 for the Italian team.
	   Salas scored his second in the 76th minute from a point-blank
range when he was left unchecked in front of Damjanac. Partizan
didn't give up and Ivica Iliev headed the ball home in the 84th
minute for the final 3-2 score.

	   BRAGA, Portugal (AP) _ Braga defeated Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0 in a
Cup Winners' Cup second-round, second-leg game Thursday, but the
Russian club advanced 3-2 on aggregate.
	   Braga scored in the 11th minute with a powerful shot from
Croatian Karoglan Mladen that bounced off Lokomotiv keeper Ruslan

	   Two minutes later Adelino Jordao appeared to have extended
Braga's lead, but his goal was disallowed when he was ruled
off-sides.
	   Braga dominated the game, pushing Lokomotiv onto the defensive.
	   Only Lokomotiv's Zaza Dzhanashia came close to equalizing, his
best chance arriving three minutes into the second half with a
close-range header.
	   Braga cranked up the pressure in the second half, moving more
players into attack and firing a long series of shots, but the
Russians held out and advanced thanks to their 3-1 home victory in
the first leg two weeks ago.

Laudrup scores for Chelsea, ousting his likely new club

 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ If Brian Laudrup's story with Chelsea ended
Thursday, it was an memorable finish.
	   Laudrup, expected to sign as early as Friday with FC Copenhagen,
got the deciding goal to move Chelsea to the quarterfinals of the
Cup Winners Cup _ ousting what is almost sure to be his new team.
	   Laudrup, a former Danish international, scored on a header in
the 32nd off a perfect cross from Graeme LeSaux to give Chelsea _
the holders _ a 1-0 lead to advance 2-1. The clubs drew 1-1 two
weeks ago in London.
	   LeSaux's cross was headed off the crossbar by teammate Pierluigi
Casiraghi, but it bounded out to Laudrup who headed it home to draw
applause at Parken Stadium.
	   Dan Petrescu substituted for Laudrup in the 66th.
	   The 29-year-old Laudrup said last week he wanted to return to
his native Denmark. Copenhagen officials hoped to announce
Laudrup's signing after this match, although Laudrup said he
planned to return to London for a Sunday league game.
	   In other Cup Winners Cup matches, the clubs reaching the
quarterfinals in March were: Valerenga of Norway, Croatia's
Varteks, Greek club Panionios, Israel's Maccabi Haifa, Lokomotiv
Moscow, Mallorca of Spain and Lazio.
	   In Graz, Austria, Real Madrid hammered Sturm Graz 5-1 in a
Champions Legaue match put off from Wednesday because of a drenched
pitch. The win moved Real Madrid atop Group C with nine points, two
more than Spartak Moscow and Inter Milan. Graz has lost all four
matches and was beaten two weeks ago in Madrid 6-1.
	   Defender Christian Panucci scored two goals. Mario Haas headed
Graz to an early lead in the third. But Panucci tied five minutes
later with subsequent goals from Predrag Mijatovic (35th), Clarence
Seedorf (57th), Panucci (61st) and Davor Suker (74th).
	   In Glasgow, Scotland, Rangers ousted Bayer Leverkusen _ the last
German team in the UEFA Cup _ drawing 1-1 to advance to the third
round on a 3-2 aggregate. Jonathan Johansson scored for Rangers and
Thomas Reichenberger for the Germans. No German team will be in the
UEFA Cup third round for the first time since 1967-68. Stuttgart
and Werder Bremen were elimianted Tuesday.
	   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Marcelo Salas scored twice as Lazio
Rome beat Partizan Belgrade 3-2 to advance after a scoreless first
leg. Mladen Krstajic gave Partizan a 1-0 lead in the 18th, but
Lazio tied on Salas' penatly kick in the 44th. Yugoslav midfielder
Dejan Stankovic, a second-half substitute, gave Lazio a 2-1 lead in
the 67th and Salas made it 3-1 in the 76th. Ivica Iliev got
Partizan's final goal.
	   In Varazdin, Croatia, Miljenko Mumlek scored the decider a
minute from the end of extra time to give Varteks a 4-2 win over SC
Heerenveen, advancing 5-4. Tied 1-1, Faik Karamberovic gave Varteks
a 2-1 lead in the 80th. That put the clubs even on total goals _
and away goals _ and forced extra time.
	   Karamberovic scored what appeared to be the decider in the
117th. But Jan de Visser momentarily dashed Varteks' hopes with a
goal a minute later _ which would have advanced the Dutch on the
away-goal rule _ setting the stage for Mumlek's decider in the
119th.
	   In Haifa, Israel, Maccabi Haifa became the first Israeli team to
reach the quarterfinals of a European competition, beating SV Ried
of Austria 4-1 to move on 5-3. The goalscorers for Maccabi Haifa
were Alon Mizrahi, Adoram Keisi, Yossi Benayun, and Ibrahim Duro.
Austria's scorer was Michael Anicic in the 69th minute.
	   Ofir Koppel of Haifa was ejected in the 8th minute on his second
yellow card, but two minutes later the sides were even as Ried's
Gunter Steininger got a red card. Ried substitute Faruk Hljtruvic
was ejected in the 90th minute for striking a ball boy in the chest
as he took the ball from him.
	   In Istanbul, Turkey, Norway's Valerenga rallied for three
second-half goals and drew with Turkey's Besiktas 3-3 to advance
4-3. Besiktas, trailing 1-0 after first leg, went ahead 3-0 on two
goals by Oktay Derelioglu and Tayfur Havutcu. But the Norwegians
evened with three second-half goals to qualify _ Knut Henry
Harladsen (63rd), Kjell Roar Kaasa (67th) and the decider from John
Carew (74th).
	   In Braga, Porgual, Braga defeated Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0, but the
Russians advanced 3-2. Braga scored in the 11th on a powerful shot
from Croatian Karoglan Mladen that bounced off Lokomotiv keeper
Ruslan Nigmatullin's chest and into the net.
	   In Limassol, Cyprus, Antonis Sapountzis scored in the 18th
mintue as Greek side Panionios defeated Apollon to advance on a 4-2
aggregate.
	   In Palma de Mallorca, Spain, Real Mallorca and Racing Genk
played a scoreless draw, with the Spaniards advancing on the
away-goal rule after a 1-1 draw in the first leg.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Ancient residents of the Andes Mountains
produced delicate gold and copper foils _ possibly for decorations
_ 1,000 years earlier than archeologists had thought they learned
to work metal.
	   ``This was astonishing,'' anthropologist Richard L. Burger of
Yale University said of the find.
	   Burger and Yale geologist Robert B. Gordon report their
discovery, made in the Lurin Valley south of Lima, Peru, in
Friday's edition of the journal Science.
	   The foils were produced between 1410 and 1090 B.C., roughly the
period when Moses led the Jews from Egypt and the era of such
pharaohs as Amenhotep III, Tutankhamen and Ramses.
	   The earliest previous evidence of metalworking in the Andes was
by the Chavin and Cupisnique cultures between 600 and 200 B.C.
	   ``These artifacts reveal a previously unknown stage of Andean
metalworking,'' Burger wrote.
	   The area is known as Mina Perdida, meaning lost mine, he said in
a telephone interview.
	   Local residents had asked the researchers if they were looking
for the area's legendary hidden treasures of gold, Burger said, but
he told them no, confident that the ancient people of the area had
done no metalworking. The researchers were simply studying the
ancient cultures of the area.
	   ``I was shocked,'' he said of finding several examples of copper
and gold foils. ``These early examples of Andean metalworking ...
show three patterns that were to characterize the Central Andean
metalworking tradition for the next three millennia.'' They include
``an unusual concern with the production of thin metal foils, the
gilding of copper, and the close association of metalworking with
religious ritual and the supernatural realm.''
	   Burger said he isn't sure how the foils were used, but noted
that later people had a tradition of beating metal into thin foils
and attaching it to cloth.
	   The bits of foil, none in a recognizable shape, were found in
one of six ceremonial centers in the valley. That particular
ceremonial center is on a natural terrace above a flood plain and
is topped by a flat-topped pyramid 71 feet (22 meters) high.
	   Elaborate carvings of supernatural beings on the walls of
buildings at the six centers, as well as the presence of ceremonial
paraphernalia, indicate the centers were used for religious rituals
as well as other civic purposes, the researchers said.
	   A nearby site contains unbaked clay relief sculptures painted
red and cream color which form a gigantic mouth with interlocking
teeth and giant fangs, Burger said. ``You walk into the mouth when
go into the sacred precinct.''
	   The foils were dated with tests on carbon atoms connected to
them. Similar dates were found in tests on fiber bags containing
fill found on top of the metal.
	   There were two lower mounds in the area with the remains of
dwellings and household refuse but no metals were found there.
	   The gold was worked cold, pounded with stone hammers into foils
between 0.004 to 0.002 inches (0.1 to 0.05 millimeters) thick. In
some cases there was evidence of gold foil glued to copper.
	   The metal was not smelted, but some of the copper had evidence
of heating when it was worked, Burger said.

Security Council demands Iraq resume cooperation with inspectors

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council Thursday
unanimously demanded that Iraq immediately resume cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors, but Baghdad has already announced it won't
comply.
	   The legally binding resolution adopted by the council did not
include a timetable for lifting crippling economic sanctions, which
Iraq had demanded as the price for reversing its decision to cut
all dealings with the inspectors.
	   The council put into international law its statement Saturday
that condemned Iraq's decision to halt cooperation with inspectors
as a ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. resolutions.
	   While the council stands united in its condemnation and demand
that Iraq reverse its decision to halt cooperation with the
inspectors, it remains divided on what to do if Baghdad refuses.
	   The Security Council resolution made no explicit threats to use
force if Baghdad doesn't comply.
	   But the United States and Britain say they already have
authorization to take military action against Iraq from previous
council resolutions _ a view rejected by other council members.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov warned that any attempt to use
force against Iraq would have ``highly unpredictable and dangerous
consequences'' for Middle East peace and future U.N. efforts to
monitor Baghdad's weapons programs.
	   ``The way to overcome this new crisis lies, we think,
exclusively in political and diplomatic efforts,'' he said, with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan playing an active role.
	   Appealing to all sides to restrain from any actions that might
exacerbate the problem, China's Ambassador Huasun Qin said: ``Only
through dialogue and through consultation and confidence building
can we resolve the present problem.''
	   But Acting U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh noted that U.S.
President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright ``have emphasized that all options are on the table and
the United States has the authority to act.''
	   ``Iraq should recognize the gravity of the situation it has
created,'' Burleign said. ``Iraq must turn back from the dangerous
and self-defeating course it has chosen. The United States
sincerely hopes Iraq will heed the clear message of this resolution
and take the necessary steps without delay.''
	   French Ambassador Alain Dejammet, whose country has been
sympathetic to lifting sanctions against Iraq, said the unanimous
vote demonstrated the council's ``unity in the face of an Iraqi
decision which was immediately described as irrational and
unacceptable.''
	   In the resolution, council members reaffirmed their readiness to
hold ``a comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions, which could lead to the lifting of the oil embargo if
U.N. inspectors declare Iraq is disarmed. But this offer is
contingent on Iraq resuming cooperation with weapons inspectors.
	   The council agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' in
September, in an attempt to get Baghdad to allow U.N. weapons
inspectors to resume spot inspections, which it banned on Aug. 5.
	   But Iraq reacted angrily when the council sent a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan last Friday with the broad outlines of
a review that didn't explicitly mention the possibility of easing
or lifting sanctions.
	   Blaming the United States for cutting all references to ending
sanctions, Iraq on Saturday banned inspectors from monitoring
previously searched facilities _ leaving them with little to do but
change film and video cassettes on stationary cameras.
	   Iraq said Thursday it would reject any Security Council
resolution unless it calls for the end of 8-year-old sanctions,
imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
	   ``Iraq's response is that it will not deal positively with the
members of the (Security) Council unless there is a clear stand
that the sanctions on Iraq will be lifted,'' Iraq's vice president,
Taha Yassin Ramadan, told Associated Press Television News at the
Baghdad International Fair.
	   Ramadan's remarks echoed a front-page editorial in the ruling
Baath party newspaper al-Thawra, which said Iraq would not abide by
any measure without an explicit timetable for lifting economic
sanctions.

TV station broadcasts video of American woman imprisoned in Peru
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ The smiling but pale-looking American serving
a life term for terrorism embraced her parents in her cold Andean
prison, television footage showed Thursday, revealing the first
public images of Lori Berenson since shortly after her arrest
nearly three years ago.
	   Pro-government Channel 2 said the video of the New York native
was taken secretly by an amateur photographer during her parents'
Oct. 24 visit to Socabaya prison, 465 miles (750 kms) southeast of
Lima.
	   Berenson, who has had health problems and looked pale and thin,
smiled as she hugged her parents on the prison's sunny patio. She
was wearing black pants, a long-sleeved, white shirt and glasses.
	   The video, taken at a distance and out of focus at times, showed
the American inmate shivering at the cold as she entered a prison
building with her parents, who brought her Chinese food from New
York.
	   Channel 2, which did not reveal who took the 40-second clip,
said it showed that the 28-year-old Berenson was healthy. But her
mother, Rhoda Berenson, disagreed.
	   ``Did the video show her hands? Can it show if a person has a
serious disease?'' she said in a telephone interview from her home
in New York.
	   Berenson was transferred a month ago to Socabaya prison from
frigid Yanamayo prison 12,700 feet (3,870 meters) high in the Andes
mountains for medical tests.
	   Doctors say she suffers from swollen, arthritic hands, bronchial
and throat problems, and chronic gastritis from the prison food.
	   Berenson was convicted in a 1996 secret military trial of
helping leftist rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
plan a thwarted assault on Peru's Congress.
	   She was presented to the news media on Jan. 8, 1996, after her
capture in a wild spectacle in which she shouted her support for
Peru's poor.
	   ``She has not been seen by the public since that date. She has
been hidden away,'' said her father Mark Berenson, also interviewed
by the AP.
	   Her parents say she is innocent and that her secret trial didn't
allow her a fair defense. Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has
said she is a terrorist and will not be given special treatment.
	   The U.S. government has asked Peru to give Berenson an open,
civilian trial, arguing that the secret proceedings denied her due
process.
	   In 1992, with Peru battling two leftist insurgent groups, the
government began holding secret trials for suspected rebels in
which judges wore hoods or sat behind one-way glass to hide their
identities. Officials claimed that civilian courts were releasing
too many suspects because judges feared reprisals.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with cabinet session over, cabinet to reconvene Friday

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With his Cabinet debating the latest
Mideast peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured
skeptical hard-liners Thursday he would walk away from the deal if
he feels the Palestinians are not keeping their commitments.
	   After several delays, Netanyahu's Cabinet met for over 13 hours
Thursday to approve the land-for-peace agreement with the
Palestinians. Netanyahu's office said the cabinet would reconvene
Friday at 9:00 am (0700 gmt) to continue debating the accord.
	   Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite reports of a new shootout
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants, the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo said Thursday that peace prospects appeared good _ if
distant _ with both sides tired of the bloodshed.
	   International efforts to bolster peace gathered momentum. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced that
the first 46 of 2,000 civilian observers would arrive in Kosovo
next week to help monitor the province's cease-fire.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said shuttle talks
between the two sides were producing hopeful signs in Kosovo
despite occasional skirmishes.
	   ``We have made some serious progress, not only in reducing
violence ... but also in coming around to a political solution that
would meet basic interests of the two sides,'' he said in Belgrade.
``We are very much on the road and moving ahead.''
	   Violence continued to flare, however. U.S. State Department
spokesman James Rubin, while noting an ``overall calm'' in the
Serbian province, said tensions between Serb police and the Kosovo
Liberation Army ``seem to be rising as the KLA operates more
overtly in many regions.''
	   In a clash early Thursday, state-run Radio Pristina reported
that one ethnic Albanian, believed to be a KLA member, was killed
in a shootout with Serbian security forces west of Pristina.
	   Belgrade's independent B-92 radio reported that a Serb policeman
was abducted from a passenger bus early Thursday by members of the
KLA at Suva Reka, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Pristina.
	   While calling Kosovo ``a hotbed of rumors and misreports,''
Rubin expressed concern at reports that the KLA had apparently
carried out three retribution killings in recent days, of ethnic
Albanians charged with collaborating with Serb authorities.
	   He also said Serb police appear to be digging in at their
positions in Kosovo, contrary to the agreement aimed at ending the
Serbs' crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatist rebels.
	   Tension on a different front was generated by a dispute between
Yugoslav authorities and the U.N. war crimes tribunal. Tribunal
president Gabrielle Kirk McDonald called on the Security Council to
force Belgrade authorities to allow war crimes investigations in
Kosovo, which they refused this week to do.
	   Kirk McDonald branded Yugoslavia ``a rogue state, one that holds
the international rule of law in contempt.''
	   The head of the planned international Kosovo Verification
Mission, U.S. diplomat William Walker, said in Poland that next
week he will start setting up an infrastructure for its planned
2,000 members and begin preparing next year's elections in Kosovo.
	   In Pristina, Mons Nyberg of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is orchestrating the mission, said 46
monitors would arrive next week and set up operations in the
southern city of Prizren.
	   The mission, part of an Oct. 12 peace agreement, isn't expected
to be officially launched before the second half of November.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for an
expanded international human rights presence in Kosovo because the
OSCE mission lacks an explicit human rights mandate.

Cuban group files suit for genocide probe in Spain against Castro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reaction from Cuban government, comments from Cuban
activists in Washington. &QL; 
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Cuban exile group accused Fidel Castro of
genocide, terrorism and torture in a lawsuit filed Thursday in
Spain, citing the efforts of a Spanish judge to try Chile's former
dictator for human rights abuses.
	   ``Spain's National Court has ruled that it is competent to
investigate crimes of genocide, terrorism and torture in the case
against Pinochet,'' said Guillermo Alonso Olarra, a lawyer for the
Miami-based Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba. ``This case is
identical.''
	   The foundation said the lawsuit was inspired by a National Court
decision last week that authorized Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon to
try to bring former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to trial for
crimes committed during his 1973-90 regime.
	   Garzon had Pinochet arrested in London last month as a first
step toward his extradition. The case is pending in Britain's House
of Lords after a court there ruled that Pinochet was entitled to
immunity as a former head of state.
	   Alonso said they had submitted papers to Spain's National Court
detailing the cases of some 120 people who allegedly suffered
torture or other abuses by Castro's government, were executed or
died while in Cuban jails or in police custody.
	   The lawyers added that the lawsuit also included the names of
18,000 people who they say were killed or disappeared in Cuba since
1959 when Castro took power.
	   ``Spain has opened the door to the victims of Argentina and
Chile,'' Clara Maria del Valle, vice president of the foundation,
told a press conference in Madrid. ``Today we come to knock on the
door of Spanish justice in the name of the victims the crimes of
Fidel Castro.''
	   Alonso said last week's Spanish court ruling accepted that the
definition of genocide could include ``the elimination of a social
group, which is the case in Cuba.''
	   Most of the 18,000 on the list are Cubans, but there are also
North Americans and Spaniards. Alonso said he was unable to give a
precise breakdown.
	   The court is likely to name a judge to review the case by the
weekend. The judge in turn should decide whether there is
sufficient evidence to warrant a formal probe within the next two
weeks, said Javier Barrilero, another lawyer for the foundation.
	   In Havana, Cuban Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez
was asked about the suit. ``I am not going to respond to such
ridiculous humbug,'' he said.
	   Earlier Thursday, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said the
``the case had no chance of succeeding'' given that Castro was a
head of state and entitled to diplomatic immunity.
	   Alongside Castro, those accused include his brother Raul, Cuban
Tourism Minister and former army commander Osmani Cienfuegos and
Carlos Amat, Cuba's ambassador in Geneva and also a former military
member.
	   Once case cited in suit was that of a raft carrying 72 Cuban
would-be exiles which was allegedly rammed by Cuban police boats on
July 13, 1994 leading to the drowning of 41 people, mostly women
and children.
	   The Foundation for Human Rights is part of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, a Miami-based group vehemently opposed to
Castro. It is well funded by Cuban exiles living in Florida and
politically influential both in that state and in Washington.
	   Hours after the suit was filed in Madrid, in Washington the
Cuban-American National Foundation renewed a request to the Clinton
administration to begin a criminal prosecution against Castro and
his associates for the murder of three U.S. citizens in 1996.
	   The three, all Cuban exiles, were aboard two light planes that
were shot down by Cuban MiGs off Cuba's coast in 1996. Also killed
was a fourth exile who was not an American citizen.
	   Foundation vice chairman Jorge Mas Santos told a news conference
that Castro's victims are asking the world ``not to differentiate
between dictators of the right and dictators of the left.''

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Health workers began a vaccination
campaign Thursday in crowded Honduran shelters and slums ravaged by
Hurricane Mitch, while the country's president said the storm's
fury had set back development by decades.
	   Officials estimated more than 10,000 people were killed in the
storm that pummeled the Central American coast for days last week.
	   Honduran officials revised the country's confirmed death toll
down to 6,076 on Thursday after getting better information from the
ravaged countryside. Another 4,621 people were missing. Earlier
estimates had put the number of dead at 7,000.
	   Nicaragua, meanwhile, raised its death toll to an estimated
4,000. The bodies of victims from a massive mudslide on the flanks
of the Casitas volcano have been turning up in fields and along
rivers and shorelines, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman said.
	   ``More than 200 victims appeared yesterday along the shore and
fishermen in the area between Leon and Chinandega tell us that the
stench along the ocean shore is unbearable,'' Aleman told the
Mexican television network Televisa.
	   El Salvador reported 239 dead and Guatemala said 194 of its
people had been killed. Six people died in southern Mexico and
seven in Costa Rica.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores urged the more than 1.5 million
Hondurans who lost loved ones, homes and property to help in the
recovery effort.
	   ``The county is semi-destroyed and awaits the maximum effort,
and most fervent and constant work of every one of its children,''
Flores said.
	   He said Mitch destroyed more than 60 percent of the country's
infrastructure, setting back development by 50 years.
	   In the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, Mexican rescue teams began
searching for avalanche victims, and decomposed bodies were being
buried in common graves. About 100 victims had been buried around
Tegucigalpa, Mayor Nahum Valladeres said.
	   In the flood-ravaged neighborhood of Nueva Esperanza, Mexican
military rescuers carrying search dogs on their backs crossed a
muddy river to look for people believed buried in a 200-foot
(60-meter) avalanche last Friday, when dozens of homes were swept
into the river.
	   ``This is the first place we've been'' with the dogs, Honduran
army Maj. Freddy Diaz Celaya said. ``From here we'll continue
searching downriver.''
	   The Health Ministry, concerned that crowded shelter conditions
could produce outbreaks of hepatitis, respiratory infections and
other ailments, announced an inoculation campaign, especially for
children.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton ordered dlrs 30 million in
Defense Department equipment and services and dlrs 36 million in
food, fuel and other aid sent to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador
and Guatemala.
	   The White House said Clinton was sending Vice President Al
Gore's wife, Tipper, on a mission to the region to show the U.S.
commitment to providing humanitarian relief.
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton also was to travel to Nicaragua and
Honduras on Nov. 16, and make stops in El Salvador and Guatemala
before continuing on to Haiti and the Dominican Republic for a
visit canceled due to Hurricane Georges, which struck the Caribbean
in October.
	   Hurricane Mitch sat off the Honduran coast for several days last
week, destroying scores of Central American communities before
moving northwest. It crossed southern Florida on Thursday, damaging
mobile homes and buildings and injuring at least seven people.
	   Countries overwhelmed by the storm's devastation have only just
begun to calculate the damage. Honduran authorities still don't
know how many shelters have been set up.
	   Surveyors have yet to evaluate some of the most affected areas _
the departments of Cortes, Atlantida, Colon and Yoro in the north,
southern Choluteca and Valle, and the central department of
Francisco Morazan, which includes the capital.
	   Numbers still can vary wildly. The estimated number of homeless
dropped from 580,000 to 569,000 Thursday. In Francisco Morazan,
there are 234,000 homeless and temporarily displaced people.
	   Mitch damaged or destroyed at least 90 bridges on major
highways, including most spans on the main north-south route,
officials said.
	   Thursday's relief operations paled in comparison to the scope of
the disaster. A total of 14 helicopter relief missions were
delivering aid to stricken Honduran towns, said Col. Roger Antonio
Caceres.
	   ``We can manage with the number of aircraft we have because
there is little to distribute,'' Caceres said.
	   However, more help was on the way. Mexico was sending 700 tons
of food, 11 tons of medicine, 12 helicopters, four cargo planes and
475 soldiers to help in relief operations.
	   The United States committed 19 helicopters, two C-27 aircraft
and one C-130 cargo plane. France said it was sending 250 rescue
workers, along with a ship loaded with construction material and
equipment.
	   The U.N. World Food Program announced it was diverting ships to
rush their cargoes of donated food to Central America and was
pulling food from warehouses at its base in Rome for delivery by
emergency relief flights.

After many delays, Cabinet meets to debate peace agreement

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With his Cabinet debating the latest
Mideast peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured
skeptical hard-liners Thursday he would walk away from the deal if
he feels the Palestinians are not keeping their commitments.
	   After several delays, Netanyahu's Cabinet met for over 13 hours
Thursday to approve the land-for-peace agreement with the
Palestinians. Netanyahu's office said the cabinet would reconvene
Friday at 9:00 am (0700 gmt) to vote on the accord.
	   But a dispute over annulling the articles of the Palestinian
Charter that call for Israel's destruction threatened to delay
Friday's vote.
	   ``Some of the ministers demanded to condition the time of the
vote in the Cabinet or the Knesset until clarifications from Yasser
Arafat are received,'' Aviv Bushinsky, Netanyahu's spokesman said.
``The subject will be discussed during the continuation of the
meeting tomorrow.''
	   Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others.
	   Leaks from Thursday's meeting indicated the session was stormy,
with hard-liners accusing the government of selling out and signing
a vague agreement lacking tough security clauses.
	   In an attempt to blunt the criticism, Netanyahu told the Cabinet
that Jewish settlers would be given a say in deciding from what
West Bank areas Israel would withdraw. After a meeting at the prime
minister's office in which settler leaders viewed maps of the
proposed withdrawal, settler spokesman Ahron Domb said some 18
settlements would become geographically isolated and surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory as a result of the deal.
	   Settler leaders said they were looking for an alternative
candidate to challenge Netanyahu in the next elections.
	   Asked whether he would begin the troop pullback on Nov. 16, as
stipulated in the accord, Netanyahu said it was up to the
Palestinians.
	   ``If they implement, we will implement. If they don't implement
it, we won't carry it out,'' Netanyahu told Israel TV's Channel Two
during a brief Cabinet recess called after seven hours of debate.
	   ``That includes of course arresting prisoners, that includes of
course, annulling the charter by vote. We won't accept any
diversion,'' Netanyahu said.
	   But Ahmed Qureai, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature
told Israel TV ``There will be no such thing as a vote,'' over the
Charter.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
accused Netanyahu of trying to please hard-liners at the expense of
the Palestinians and the majority of Israelis who back the deal.
	   ``Netanyahu is looking much more toward the settlers, expressing
understanding for their demands rather than for the interests of
the majority of the Israeli public,'' Tibi said.
	   As part of the new accord signed last month in Washington,
Israel pledged to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank over the
next 12 weeks, in exchange for Palestinian steps to improve Israeli
security.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region
Thursday to supervise implementation of the agreement, but his trip
was moved back to the weekend, likely because of the delayed
Cabinet vote.
	   Netanyahu delayed convening his Cabinet for two days over the
issue of Palestinian fugitives, but the matter seemed cleared up
Thursday. Netanyahu said he had received American assurances that
the Palestinians would arrest 30 men wanted by Israel.
	   But other disputes between the sides remained, chiefly over the
procedure that will lead to the annulment of clauses in the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. The paragraph in
the peace agreement addressing the issue is vaguely worded,
allowing for somewhat different interpretations.
	   The agreement says members of the Palestine National Council,
along with those of other Palestinian organizations, will be
invited to a meeting in mid-December during which an Arafat letter
to U.S. President Bill Clinton concerning the revoking of the
offending clauses will be reaffirmed.
	   The PLO charter itself says it can only be amended by a vote of
two-thirds of the PNC members, but the agreement does not
specifically refer to holding a vote or a required majority.
	   Israel says the charter must be annulled with a vote by the PNC,
not by affirmation. Netanyahu said. ``There will be a vote.''
	   ``And if not, we simply won't give them the territory,'' he
said.

Pastrana tours scene of recent rebel attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana on Thursday
visited a remote southeastern city that was left in shambles this
week after a bloody, three-day siege by Colombia's largest leftist
rebel group.
	   The president flew to Mitu, capital of Vaupes state near the
border with Brazil, which is still reeling from the fighting that
killed at least 50 police, soldiers, civilians and guerrillas
before the rebels withdrew on Wednesday.
	   Unofficial accounts have put the death toll as high as 150.
	   ``What they are doing is sowing pain and death in Colombia, ''
Pastrana said of the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC. ``All they are doing is giving reasons and more
arguments to those who oppose peace.''
	   Pastrana expressed condolences to the victims' families and
promised the government would rebuild a hospital and dozens of
homes destroyed in the attack.
	   Authorities are still trying to account for many of the
120-member police contingent that was stationed in Mitu when 1,400
rebels attacked on Sunday with a barrage of homemade missiles.
	   At least 45 police officers were feared to have been taken
prisoner, and civilians told local newspapers that the rebels had
summarily executed some of their victims.
	   Pastrana on Thursday also visited Machuca, a rural hamlet in
central Colombia where 67 villagers _ half of them children _ died
in an Oct. 18 attack by the National Liberation Army, a smaller
rebel group. The victims were consumed in a fire that erupted after
the guerrillas dynamited a nearby oil pipeline.
	   The two attacks, occurring as the government makes peace
overtures toward both groups, have repulsed Colombians and fueled
skepticism about the prospects for ending Colombia's 34-year civil
war.
	   Pastrana, who took office in August, is set to begin
negotiations in coming weeks with the FARC.

Al Fayed settles damages claim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mohamed Al Fayed agreed Thursday to pay damages to
the wife of a bitter business rival who sued after the Harrods boss
allegedly broke into their safe-deposit box.
	   While Al Fayed ``categorically denied'' allegations of criminal
behavior, his lawyers negotiated a settlement in which Al Fayed and
three Harrods employees have agreed to pay Josephine Rowland
damages for inducement of breach of the contract under which her
husband, business tycoon Tiny Rowland, had hired a safe-deposit box
in Harrods' basement vaults.
	   Al Fayed also agreed to pay the costs of the court case.
	   Mrs. Rowland continued with the civil case against Al Fayed,
whose son Dodi was killed with Princess Diana in a car crash in
Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, after the death of her husband in July.
	   The Rowlands claimed that the items missing from the box
included emeralds, rubies, rare Tibetan coins, a Tibetan stamp, a
gold cigarette case, plus documents and audio tapes.
	   Mrs. Rowland's attorney, Christopher Moger, had contended that
Al Fayed persuaded employees at Harrods to break into the Rowland's
safe-deposit box in 1995. The Harrods boss wanted to use material
he found to blackmail Rowland into helping him overturn a
Department of Trade and Industry report into his 1985 takeover of
Harrods, Moger said. The report was highly critical of Al Fayed.
	   Harrods said in a statement that Al Fayed did not want to
continue ``with a course of action which will further subject loyal
and honest employees and their families to a distressing and unfair
ordeal.''
	   The statement said that Harrods had ``never denied that the
safe-deposit box was opened. We regret that. It was not done at the
instigation of Mr. Al Fayed. Nothing was stolen. The allegations of
theft made to police were baseless.''
	   This summer, prosecutors decided not to pursue criminal charges
against Al Fayed, saying that there was no realistic prospect of
conviction.
	   Anthony Fincham, legal adviser to Mrs. Rowland, said that the
settlement proved Al Fayed had admitted ``the entirety'' of the
Rowland's claim.
	   ``Mr. Al Fayed escaped cross-examination by throwing in the
towel halfway through the case,'' Fincham said.

Jailed Cali drug trafficker assassinated in prison yard

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from U.S. drug official. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A former top Cali cocaine boss was
assassinated while watching a soccer game in a prison yard
Thursday, two years after he surrendered and began fingering
ex-associates.
	   Helmer ``Pacho'' Herrera was shot at least five times in the
face by a man who gained entry to the Palmira prison outside Cali
by claiming to be a lawyer for another inmate, officials said.
	   Herrera, 47, had been the No. 3 man in the Cali cartel, one of
the world's biggest criminal organizations, and had set up and
managed cocaine distribution rings in major U.S. cities, beginning
in the 1980s.
	   The assailant appeared to be ``an acquaintance of Herrera
because he greeted him first,'' national police spokesman Carlos
Perdomo said.
	   Herrera died on the way to the hospital, emergency room director
Dr. Gustavo Paredes said.
	   The assassin, identified as Rafael Angel Uribe, 32, was beaten
by other inmates before guards took him away. He had entered the
prison a half hour before the attack, apparently while Herrera was
playing in the game's first half, national prisons director Carmen
Lucia Tristancho said.
	   She said it was unclear whether the murder weapon, a 9mm pistol,
was smuggled into the penitentiary or whether it was already
inside.
	   Herrera surrendered to authorities in September 1996, the last
of seven major cartel members to either turn themselves in or be
arrested.
	   He was convicted of drug trafficking in March and sentenced to
six years and eight months in prison after incriminating at least
20 former associates.
	   Herrera continued to seek sentence reductions, fingering his
wheelchair-bound half-brother from jail. But in September, his
prison term was increased to 14 years and eight months, following
an appeal by prosecutors.
	   When he surrendered, Herrera said he was tired of being on the
run from enemies and thought he would be safer behind bars. Known
as a man with a thousand faces, he had dodged hundreds of police
raids, even dressing up as a woman to elude authorities.
	   U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency officials in Washington said
investigators believed Herrera had continued to traffic cocaine
from prison and could have been killed by a competitor.
	   The agency's South American operations chief, Ron Lard, said
Herrera had moved many tons of cocaine into the United States,
where he was wanted for trial on murder, drug trafficking, and
money laundering charges.

Security Council demands Iraq resume cooperation with inspectors

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council Thursday
unanimously demanded that Iraq immediately resume cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors, but Baghdad has already announced it won't
comply.
	   The legally binding resolution adopted by the council did not
include a timetable for lifting crippling economic sanctions, which
Iraq had demanded as the price for reversing its decision to cut
all dealings with the inspectors.
	   The council put into international law its statement Saturday
that condemned Iraq's decision to halt cooperation with inspectors
as a ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. resolutions.
	   While the council stands united in its condemnation and demand
that Iraq reverse its decision to halt cooperation with the
inspectors, it remains divided on what to do if Baghdad refuses.
	   The Security Council resolution made no explicit threats to use
force if Baghdad doesn't comply.
	   But the United States and Britain say they already have
authorization to take military action against Iraq from previous
council resolutions _ a view rejected by other council members.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov warned that any attempt to use
force against Iraq would have ``highly unpredictable and dangerous
consequences'' for Middle East peace and future U.N. efforts to
monitor Baghdad's weapons programs.
	   ``The way to overcome this new crisis lies, we think,
exclusively in political and diplomatic efforts,'' he said, with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan playing an active role.
	   Appealing to all sides to refrain from any actions that might
exacerbate the problem, China's Ambassador Huasun Qin said: ``Only
through dialogue and through consultation and confidence building
can we resolve the present problem.''
	   But Acting U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh noted that U.S.
President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright ``have emphasized that all options are on the table and
the United States has the authority to act.''
	   ``Iraq should recognize the gravity of the situation it has
created,'' Burleigh said. ``Iraq must turn back from the dangerous
and self-defeating course it has chosen. The United States
sincerely hopes Iraq will heed the clear message of this resolution
and take the necessary steps without delay.''
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said the council's
authority to use force ``may be revived if it decides that there
has been a sufficiently serious breach of the conditions laid down
by the council for the cease-fire'' ending the Gulf War in 1991.
	   In the resolution, council members reaffirmed their readiness to
hold ``a comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions, which could lead to the lifting of the oil embargo if
U.N. inspectors declare Iraq is disarmed. But this offer is
contingent on Iraq resuming cooperation with weapons inspectors.
	   French Ambassador Alain Dejammet, whose country has been
sympathetic to lifting sanctions against Iraq, urged Iraq to lift
its bans and ``take the opportunity that the council is ready to
offer it ... of an overall review.''
	   He said the unanimous vote demonstrated the council's ``unity in
the face of an Iraqi decision which was immediately described as
irrational and unacceptable.'' And he reiterated that Iraqi
cooperation with the weapons inspectors is the only way to make
progress to lifting sanctions.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Katarina Witt is trying out a new routine, and
she's not wearing skates _ or anything else, for that matter.
	   The two-time Olympic figure skating gold medalist is featured in
a 10-page photo layout in the December issue of Playboy, shown
prancing through woods and streams.
	   ``I'm sure that some of my skating audience, when they hear I've
taken off my clothes for Playboy, will be shocked,'' Witt writes in
the accompanying text. ``I don't know what to say except that I was
ready to do this.''
	   The pictures were shot in Hawaii and Witt received more than
dlrs 100,000. A Playboy spokeswoman said the skater was the first
athlete to pose for the magazine.
	   ``We're much more open about nudity in Europe anyway, and in
East Germany, where I grew up, there were nude beaches,'' Witt
said. ``I used to go to them _ until, of course, people started to
recognize me. They would see me on the beach, look at me and say,
`Nice to meet you,' but they wouldn't be looking at my face.''
	   Witt, who dazzled Italian ski champion Alberto Tomba at the 1988
Olympics, still skates in professional events. The 33-year-old star
next skates Friday night in Sunrise, Florida.
	   ``I'm proud of these photos, but when I start to talk about
them, I sometimes have to laugh and ask `Who cares what I think
about them? It's time to see what other people think,''' she said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Todd Martin won a thrilling final set tie break to
eliminate No. 3 seed Patrick Rafter from the dlrs 2.55 million
Paris Open on Thursday.
	   Martin, who beat No. 14 seed Goran Ivanisevic in the second
round, beat the U.S. Open Champion 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6) to
advance to the quarterfinals _ the first time in six attempts that
he has reached that stage of the Paris Open.
	   After losing the first set, Martin was a break of service behind
in the second, but came back to force a tiebreak.
	   In the third, Rafter was 0-3 behind and was at his athletic best
to force another tiebreak.
	   Rafter looked to have taken the initiative in the decisive game
with a high backhand volley played at full stretch.
	   But Martin kept his consistency, saved a match point and ran out
an 8-6 winner in the tiebreak.
	   ``It was an incredible match. I can't recall playing that well
and losing,'' Rafter said.
	   Pete Sampras played through the pain barrier to beat
little-known French player Jerome Golmard 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-4, and
line up a contest against surprise quarterfinalist Mark
Philippoussis.
	   Sampras, who needed intensive medical treatment on his
troublesome back three times during the match, always looked below
par against Golmard, a 25-year-old who came into the tournament
ranked a career-best 49.
	   In the first set, Sampras had saved two break points with the
scores at both 4-4 and 5-5.
	   But the world No. 1 didn't make the most of his chance, and was
overpowered in the tiebreak.
	   Early in the second set Sampras, who pulled out of the recent
Lyon Open with a vertebral problem, was in pain after stretching to
make a backhand.
	   Playing after midnight local time in the final set, Sampras
trailed 1-4, but found extra reserves of energy to break the
Frenchman's service twice, and win in two hours one minute.
	   Andre Agassi defeated Marc Rosset - the player that he beat in
the 1994 Paris Open final - in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4.
	   ``As far as how I am capable of playing, I think I have a margin
to go,'' Agassi said. ``I keep saying that it is important to play
well at the right time, not so much to play better than I have
played.''
	   Agassi faces Martin in Friday's quarterfinals.

United States beats Kazakhstan 3-0 in opening match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: repeating to some points to correct style on slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) _ Neal Broten, who played on the
``Miracle on Ice'' team at the 1980 Olympics, scored two goals and
set up another Thursday in leading the United States past Kazakstan
3-0 in a qualifying tournament for hockey's world championships.
	   The victory in Pool A kept alive American hopes of remaining
among hockey's international elite.
	   Broten and Michael Hartman accounted for all the U.S. scoring
and goaltender Parris Duffus recorded a shutout, guiding the
Americans to a key win in the qualifying event for next year's
championship in Norway.
	   The Americans were forced to requalify after a disastrous 1998
world championship in which an National Hockey League-packed team
produced just a single victory and finished 12th out of 16 nations.
	   Dangerously close to a return to Pool B for the first time since
1983, the United States' slip at last year's worlds came after its
embarrassing quarterfinal exit at the Winter Games and subsequent
room-trashing by players.
	   The United States and Kazakhstan must finish either first or
second in the four-team A group, which also includes Austria and
Estonia.
	   But with the NHL, college and minor leagues all in full swing,
coach Ben Smith, who led the American women's team to gold at the
Nagano Olympics, was forced to patch together a team from NHL
old-timers and players competing in European leagues.
	   Fifteen of the 23 players compete in professional European
teams, including 11 from Germany's national Bundesliga. The only
NHL player on the team is Hurricanes defenseman Mike Rucinski.
	   Broten, 38, retired from the NHL in 1997, while 41-year-old Mark
Johnson _ another ``Miracle on Ice'' worker who helped produce a
gold medal, retired nine years ago.
	   Joe Mullen, 41, who ended a 17-year NHL career in 1997, also
came out of retirement for the tournament.
	   One of the few under-30 players on the team is Duffus. He led
the United States to a bronze medal at the 1996 worlds in Austria,
the nation's first medal in 34 years.
	   ``This roster represents a blend of talented, veteran players
who understand the mission of this team,'' general manager Art
Berglund said.
	   ``Our goal is to strengthen the United States' position as one
of the elite hockey-playing nations in the world by qualifying for
the 1999 A Pool world championship.''
	   In other Pool A games, Austria beat Estonia 6-2. In nearby
Ljubljana, Slovenia, the host nation tied Germany 1-1 in Pool B
while Ukraine defeated France 4-1.
	   After a one-day break Friday, the tournament resumes Saturday
when the United States meets Estonia before facing Austria on
Sunday.

Irwin in front in Senior Tour Championship

<TEXT>
	   MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina (AP) _ Hale Irwin opened the Senior
Tour Championship on Thursday with a 6-under-par 66, giving him the
first-round lead in practically the only Senior PGA Tour event he
hasn't won.
	   Irwin has turned the 50-and-over circuit into his personal cash
machine, amassing more than half his career earnings of dlrs 13.18
million in his four senior seasons.
	   At The Dunes Golf and Beach Club, Irwin often has been no better
than a club pro. He was eighth in his first try in 1995 and 10th a
year later.
	   Last year, despite 11 victories and a pro record dlrs 2.3
million won, Irwin watched Gil Morgan blow by him for a two-stroke
victory.
	   Irwin, again the tour's top money winner at more than dlrs 2.5
million this year, struck first with seven birdies and a bogey for
a two-stroke lead over Bob Duval, who shot a 68.
	   Ray Floyd, the 1994 Tour Championship winner, and Bruce
Summerhays were another shot behind at 69.
	   Defending champion Morgan, who has tracked Irwin almost step for
step the past two seasons, was at 2-under with Larry Nelson.
	   ``If I happen to be lucky enough to win this, I'd have to say
that 1998, if not the best year ever, certainly one of the best
years that I've had in professional golf,'' said Irwin, the U.S.
Senior Open champion.
	   Whoever wins the dlrs 2 million tournament will receive dlrs
347,000, the biggest prize in Senior PGA Tour history.
	   Irwin led the 1996 tournament after one round, but faded with
rounds of 75 and 76. Last year, Irwin and Morgan were tied through
36 holes. But Morgan's 66 put him two shots in front, a lead he
didn't give back.
	   On Thursday, Irwin surged in front with birdie putts on No. 3,
No. 4 and No. 5. He pitched to two feet (0.6 meters) on the eighth
hole for his fourth birdie.
	   He got to 6-under with a birdie on No. 13, the Dunes' par-5
signature hole. He had his lone bogey on the 16th hole when he
drove into a divot, then slashed a 9-iron within six feet (1.8
meters) for a closing birdie on No. 18.
	   ``A lot of control shots. A lot of good putting. Just the kind
of game I'd hope to have starting out,'' Irwin said.
	   Duval holed a 97-yard (88-meter) sand wedge for an eagle-2 on
the par-4 seventh and creeped to a stroke of Irwin after his birdie
on No. 17. But then he rolled his second shot on the 18th into some
deep rough in front of the pond and took bogey.
	   Summerhays was at 1-over through 13 holes, then birdied the next
four to catch Floyd at 69.
	   Wind gusts of 25 mph (40 kmph) whipped through the course on a
cool day. Floyd and Jim Dent wore wool caps and Bob Murphy wrapped
a sweater around his neck.

On a day of no movement, key lockout questions linger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Is David Stern bluffing when he says he'll
cancel the season? Is Billy Hunter being held back by David Falk?
	   What is the final date for saving the 1998-99 National
Basketball Association season?
	   Those are the big questions in the NBA lockout, and none of the
answers was clear Thursday. Of course, the biggest question _ When
will it end? _ was the grandest mystery of all.
	   Although there have been no conciliatory signs from either side,
the league expects to hear from Hunter on Friday. A negotiating
session could be scheduled for Monday if the sides think it will
lead to progress.
	   ``We're just worlds apart, and NBA players are losing on average
dlrs 14 million per game,'' commissioner David Stern said.
	   ``When the owners show some willingness to engage in compromise
... we'll be glad to recommend the deal to our players,'' union
director Billy Hunter said.
	   The sides remain far apart on both the framework for a deal and
the percentage of revenue owners will be devoting to salaries. The
players, who received 57 percent last season, are asking for 60
percent. The owners, who wanted to pay no more than 51.8 percent
last season, want the percentage scaled back to 50 percent.
	   The compromise would seem to be 55 percent, yet Stern
practically recoiled in disgust when it was suggested the sides
simply meet in the middle.
	   Pointing out that the old deal didn't work for the owners at 52
percent, Stern said it will be hard to get him to budge.
	   ``If the question is whether to close things out the players
could squeeze me to pay a little more than 50 percent, first get me
to the close-out of the negotiations,'' he said. ``But we're
nowhere near that.''
	   Hunter had no answer when asked what was wrong with 55 percent,
but he has said in the past that the players shouldn't accept less
than what they are currently getting (57 percent), especially in
light of the other concessions the union has made (lengthened
rookie scale, possible decrease in cap growth, luxury tax, escrow
tax).
	   That leaves the sides apparently dug in for the long haul.
	   Stern is threatening to cancel the season, but Hunter and
several agents think the commissioner is bluffing and will do a
deal at the last possible moment, whenever that is.
	   Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik have refused to give
an exact ``drop dead'' date, but Granik said recently that it would
be somewhere in mid-December.
	   So if an agreement were reached Dec. 20, for example, the season
could start Jan. 14. Each team would have only 50 games left, but
an additional six could be squeezed in if the All-Star game were
canceled and an extra week was added on to the end of the regular
season. That would allow for a 56-game schedule in which each team
played every other team twice.
	   Stern has charged agents such as Falk, who represent the
highest-salaried players, with slowing the process. Hunter
responded by saying Stern was trying to divide the union. Hunter
further insists that he and union president Patrick Ewing have been
in charge of the negotiations since Day 1.

Jordan's brother: Shortened season may bring back Bulls star
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SPINDALE, North Carolina (AP) _ Michael Jordan's brother
believes the Bulls superstar is leaning toward returning to the
National Basketball Association.
	   Larry Jordan said the shortened season, caused by the lockout,
is more appealing to his brother than the regular 82-game grind,
plus playoffs.
	   ``Two months ago I would have said that there was no way he was
coming back,'' Larry Jordan said while visiting North Carolina for
his sports-card business. ``But over the last two weeks, and since
the season will be shortened by about 20 games, I think that would
give him the perfect opportunity to get it out of his system.
	   ``I think he's leaning toward coming back.''
	   But if the lockout wipes out the entire season, Jordan would
probably never play pro basketball again, his brother said.

Duke preseason No. 1 for fourth time in U.S. college poll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Duke, which returns three starters from the team
that fell one game shy of the Final Four last season, was voted No.
1 in The Associated Press U.S. college basketball poll Thursday,
the fourth time the Blue Devils have held the top spot in the
preseason rankings.
	   This is the first preseason No. 1 ranking for Duke since
1991-92, when it stayed on top all season on the way to a second
straight national championship. The other preseason No. 1 rankings
were in 1978-79 and 1988-89.
	   The Blue Devils, who were No. 1 for seven weeks last season and
finished 32-4, received 34 first-place votes and 1,747 points from
the 72-member national media panel.
	   ``I'm very comfortable with high expectations,'' Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski said. ``I have very high expectations for myself and my
team all the time. It is when you can't achieve high expectations
that pressure comes in.''
	   Connecticut, which has five starters back from its regional
final team that went 32-5 last season, was second with 25
first-place votes and 1,734 points, 82 more than Stanford, which
has all its starters back from the team that went 30-5 and reached
the Final Four. The Cardinal received 12 first-place votes.
	   Defending national champion Kentucky (35-4) was fourth with the
only other No. 1 votes and 1,509 points and was followed in the top
10 by Michigan State, Maryland, Temple, Kansas, Tennessee and Utah.
	   Duke has five players back who averaged at least 7.6 points per
game last season, led by senior guard Trajan Langdon, a two-time
all-Atlantic Coast Conference selection, and sophomore forward
Elton Brand, who impressed a lot of people despite missing 15 games
with a foot injury.
	   ``It's always an honor to be considered among the top teams in
the country,'' Krzyzewski said. ``We have high expectations for our
program every year and hope people's high opinions of us in
November are the same in March.''
	   North Carolina, which was No. 1 in the final poll last season,
was 11th followed by UCLA, Oklahoma State, Washington, Cincinnati,
Purdue, Xavier, Arizona and Arkansas. New Mexico and Syracuse tied
for 20th and the rest of the Top 25 was Indiana, Rhode Island,
Massachusetts and Texas Christian.
	   All but six of the teams in the preseason poll were ranked in
the final poll of last season, with No. 9 Tennessee being the
highest of this year's newcomers.
	   Only 15 of the teams in last year's preseason poll finished
ranked in the final Top 25. Last year's preseason No. 1 was
Arizona, which went on to the regional finals.
	   The Pac-10 (Stanford, UCLA, Washington and Arizona) and Atlantic
10 (Temple, Xavier, Rhode Island and Massachusetts) led the nine
conferences represented in the preseason poll with four teams each.
The ACC, Southeastern Conference, Big Ten and Western Athletic
Conference had three teams each.
	   Earlier Thursday, it was announced that No. 15 Cincinnati lost
three scholarships and was placed on two years' probation for
violating NCAA rules.

Jailed Cali drug trafficker assassinated in prison yard

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A former top Cali cocaine boss was
killed while watching a soccer game in a prison yard Thursday, two
years after he surrendered and began fingering ex-associates.
	   Helmer ``Pacho'' Herrera was shot at least five times in the
face by a man who gained entry to the Palmira prison outside Cali
by claiming to be a lawyer for another inmate, officials said.
	   Herrera, 47, had been the No. 3 man in the Cali cartel, one of
the world's biggest criminal organizations, and had set up and
managed cocaine distribution rings in major U.S. cities, beginning
in the 1980s.
	   The assailant appeared to be ``an acquaintance of Herrera
because he greeted him first,'' national police spokesman Carlos
Perdomo said.
	   Herrera died on the way to the hospital, emergency room director
Dr. Gustavo Paredes said.
	   The assassin, identified as Rafael Angel Uribe, 32, was beaten
by other inmates before guards took him away. He had entered the
prison a half hour before the attack, apparently while Herrera was
playing in the game's first half, national prisons director Carmen
Lucia Tristancho said.
	   She said it was unclear whether the murder weapon, a 9mm pistol,
was smuggled into the penitentiary or whether it was already
inside.
	   Herrera surrendered to authorities in September 1996, the last
of seven major cartel members to either turn themselves in or be
arrested.
	   He was convicted of drug trafficking in March and sentenced to
six years and eight months in prison after incriminating at least
20 former associates.
	   Herrera continued to seek sentence reductions, fingering his
wheelchair-bound half-brother from jail. But in September, his
prison term was increased to 14 years and eight months, following
an appeal by prosecutors.
	   When he surrendered, Herrera said he was tired of being on the
run from enemies and thought he would be safer behind bars. Known
as a man with a thousand faces, he had dodged hundreds of police
raids, even dressing up as a woman to elude authorities.
	   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Washington
said investigators believed Herrera had continued to traffic
cocaine from prison and could have been killed by a competitor.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Todd Martin won a thrilling final set tie break to
eliminate No. 3 seed Patrick Rafter from the dlrs 2.55 million
Paris Open on Thursday.
	   Martin, who beat No. 14 seed Goran Ivanisevic in the second
round, beat the U.S. Open Champion 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6) to
advance to the quarterfinals _ the first time in six attempts that
he has reached that stage of the Paris Open.
	   After losing the first set, Martin was a break of service behind
in the second, but came back to force a tiebreak.
	   In the third, Rafter was 0-3 behind and was at his athletic best
to force another tiebreak.
	   Rafter looked to have taken the initiative in the decisive game
with a high backhand volley played at full stretch.
	   But Martin kept his consistency, saved a match point and ran out
an 8-6 winner in the tiebreak.
	   ``It was an incredible match. I can't recall playing that well
and losing,'' Rafter said.
	   Pete Sampras played through the pain barrier to beat
little-known French player Jerome Golmard 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-4, and
line up a contest against surprise quarterfinalist Mark
Philippoussis.
	   Sampras, who needed intensive medical treatment on his
troublesome back three times during the match, always looked below
par against Golmard, a 25-year-old who came into the tournament
ranked a career-best 49.
	   In the first set, Sampras had saved two break points with the
scores at both 4-4 and 5-5.
	   But the world No. 1 didn't make the most of his chance, and was
overpowered in the tiebreak.
	   Early in the second set Sampras, who pulled out of the recent
Lyon Open with a vertebral problem, was in pain after stretching to
make a backhand.
	   Playing after midnight local time in the final set, Sampras
trailed 1-4, but found extra reserves of energy to break the
Frenchman's service twice, and win in two hours one minute.
	   Nicola Arzani, the ATP Tour's director of communications, said
that Sampras' injury was not the same as that sustained in Lyon.
	   The player will decide whether to continue playing at the
tournament after more treatment, Arzani said.
	   Andre Agassi defeated Marc Rosset - the player that he beat in
the 1994 Paris Open final - in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4.
	   ``As far as how I am capable of playing, I think I have a margin
to go,'' Agassi said. ``I keep saying that it is important to play
well at the right time, not so much to play better than I have
played.''
	   Agassi faces Martin in Friday's quarterfinals.

category codes:
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Health workers began a vaccination
campaign Thursday in crowded Honduran shelters and slums ravaged by
Hurricane Mitch, while the country's president said the storm's
fury had set back development by decades. Officials estimated more
than 10,000 people were killed in the storm that pummeled the
Central American coast for days last week. (MITCH)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ After a long day of debate, the Israeli
Cabinet planned to reconvene early Friday to vote on the latest
Mideast peace accord. During more than 13 hours of discussions
Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured skeptical
hard-liners Thursday he would walk away from the deal if he feels
the Palestinians are not keeping their commitments. The deal, which
would turn over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians,
would leave 18 Jewish settlements surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council Thursday
unanimously demanded that Iraq immediately resume cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors, but Baghdad has already announced it won't
comply. The legally binding resolution did not include a timetable
for lifting crippling economic sanctions, which Iraq had demanded
as the price for reversing its decision to cut all dealings with
the inspectors. While the council stands united in its condemnation
and demand that Iraq reverse its decision to halt cooperation with
the inspectors, it remains divided on what to do if Baghdad
refuses. The resolution made no explicit threats to use force if
Iraq doesn't comply. (UN-IRAQ).
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde asked
President Bill Clinton on Thursday to answer 81 questions for the
House impeachment inquiry, including whether he made ``false and
misleading'' statements under oath. The questions would have to be
answered under oath,'' Hyde wrote in a letter to Clinton. He said
the president is ``free to dispute whatever he wants,'' but his
agreement to those allegations would ``allow us to narrow the
issues and bring this matter to a close more quickly. Presidential
press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton's lawyers were still
digesting Hyde's letter and had no immediate comment.
(US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ A rebel commander, surrounded by
government troops in mountainous northern Tajikistan, threatened
Thursday to blow up a dam if the government doesn't meet his
demands. ``It will flood vast territories of Central Asia,'' Col.
Makhmud Khudoberdyev warned. He said his guerrillas had mined the
dam on the Kairakkhum channel as a ``deterrence measure.'' The
government, which had no immediate reaction to the threat, claimed
it had largely recaptured a city that Khudoberdyev's forces had
seized and had surrounded his headquarters. Dozens have been killed
in two days of fierce fighting, one of the most serious outbursts
of violence since a peace accord was signed last year, ending five
years of civil war in the small, impoverished Central Asian nation.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Chelsea Clinton has been deeply affected by the
Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, her uncle Roger says.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's younger brother said in this
week's Paris Match that Chelsea was carrying on with life as usual,
but things weren't easy.
	   ``She's going to class every day and I imagine that, in that her
milieu, there's no shortage of talk,'' he said.
	   Chelsea is a sophomore at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California.
	   ``For the moment, the situation isn't easy because things have
been blown out of proportion. Despite her sense of humor and
gaiety, Chelsea has been deeply affected by the scandal, like Bill,
like Hillary,'' Clinton said.
	   Clinton, a rock singer who overcame cocaine addiction in the
mid-1980s, said he had no idea what Hillary was feeling and had no
intention of trying to guess.
	   ``No one can put themselves in her shoes,'' he said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A handful of demonstrators gathered
outside the offices of 20th Century Fox on Thursday to condemn the
altering of national park land for a new Leonardo DiCaprio movie.
	   About 100 coconut trees will be replanted and some vegetation
temporarily removed from an island to broaden a beach for a
football scene.
	   The movie ``The Beach,'' based on a best-selling novel, is
scheduled to begin shooting in mid-January on Phi Island off
southern Thailand.
	   ``The government is making only 4 million baht (dlrs 105,000),''
said Manit Sriwanichpoom, wearing a DiCaprio mask. ``But can we
afford paying for the damage to the environment?''
	   He delivered his message to a somewhat disappointed crowd, many
of whom were female office workers who had heard the Hollywood
heartthrob was in Bangkok and were disappointed to find a masked
Thai activist instead.
	   Santa Petanji, the film's Thai coordinator, said plans for the
movie set are environmentally friendly and 20th Century Fox has put
down a dlrs 130,000 damage deposit.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Orphans sang ``I believe in Angels''
as Prince Charles visited an 18th-century Orthodox monastery on
Thursday.
	   Charles stopped to chat with the choir of 15. As he stepped into
the recently restored Stavropoleus monastery, the only one in
Bucharest, nuns and priests hovered at the entrance.
	   Earlier, in a village near Bucharest, he shook hands with
disabled Romanians and was told how they construct their own
wheelchairs. Hundreds of people pressed to get a glimpse of him,
shouting ``We love you'' in English and ``Charles, Charles.''
	   Charles leaves Romania on Friday.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Margaret Thatcher is one of Stephen Hawking's
British faces of the 20th century.
	   The National Portrait Gallery asked 10 people from the media,

famous and unknown Britons for a ``Faces of the Century''
millennium exhibition in October 1999.
	   The panel, Hawking included, has to cover each decade and
consider who might be remembered 100 years hence.
	   Hawking, the Cambridge physicist who wrote ``A Brief History of
Time,'' said he ``didn't admire many of her policies,'' but
included Thatcher anyway.
	   Geneticist Francis Crick and physicist Paul Dirac are among
Hawking's other choices.

	   HILVERSUM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch spoof of the popular
children's show ``Teletubbies'' showing the characters simulating
sex and fighting could land its makers in court, a programming
director has warned.
	   ``Tuberculosistubbies,'' made by the irreverent youth channel
BNN, features brightly colored characters bearing a
more-than-passing resemblance to Po, Laa-Laa, Tinky-Winky and
Dipsy.
	   Fans of the Tuberculosistubbies have also posted obscene
messages on a Teletubbies Web site, shocking parents whose children
visit the site.
	   Representatives of the British Broadcasting Corp. asked to see a
videotape of the show and may consider legal action against BNN,
Cees Schippers, programming director for Dutch broadcaster
Teleac/Not, told the daily Trouw newspaper for Thursday's editions.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Jailed East Timorese guerrilla leader
Xanana Gusmao has not been idle during his past four years in an
Indonesian prison cell.
	   A collection of poems and paintings which he has rendered behind
bars at Cipinang jail, in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, went on
sale Thursday in Lisbon.
	   ``My Sea of Timor'' _ a bilingual edition in Portuguese and
English _ expresses his dreams of freedom and hope for the future
of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded
in 1975 and annexed the following year, according to top Mozambican
writer Mia Couto.
	   In the book ``we find not only poetry, but the epic story of a
people,'' he wrote in the preface.
	   Gusmao, 51, headed East Timor's pro-independence guerrilla
movements from 1979 until he was captured in 1991 by Indonesian
troops.
	   The charismatic guerrilla leader was later sentenced to 20 years
in prison for plotting against former President Suharto's
government.

Armas cleared to play for United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALO ALTO, California (AP) _ Midfielder Chris Armas has been
cleared by CONCACAF to play soccer for the United States.
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation received word Thursday that Armas,
26, who played five matches with the Puerto Rican team in 1993 and
1994, is eligible to suit up for the U.S. squad. CONCACAF officials
said none of the appearances had compromised Armas' U.S.
eligibility.
	   ``I'm very excited that this has been settled and that I can now
play for the United States,'' Armas said. ``It's been my dream to
play for my country, and I'm grateful that U.S. Soccer took the
time and made the effort to allow me to play.''
	   Armas was born in Brooklyn, New York and was an All-American at
Adelphi University before turning professional. He played two years
for the Los Angeles Galaxy of MLS, then was traded to Chicago for
the 1998 season. Armas helped expansion Chicago win the title.
	   Armas, who has been training with the U.S. team in Palo Alto,
could start in Friday's international game against Australia.

Goossen says he'll be Tyson's promoter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Dan Goossen, a successful boxing promoter
since 1982 but not nearly as well-known in the field as people like
Don King and Bob Arum, said Thursday he will handle those duties
for Mike Tyson.
	   ``We are officially Mike Tyson's promoter,'' said Goossen, who
began his career in boxing as part of a small family operation in
the San Fernando Valley. ``We'll work with Mike, Shelley Finkel and
Showtime to present the man we think is the most interesting and
biggest attraction in the sport.
	   ``It's gratifying after 16 years of hard work to get this kind
of break,'' added Goossen, who has previously promoted world
champions Raphael and Gabriel Ruelas, Michael Nunn, Bernard Hopkins
and Luisito Espinosa.
	   Finkel, heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield's first manager,
will continue as Tyson's chief boxing advisor.
	   Goossen is president of America Presents, a 2-year-old company
based in Denver that has promoted fights on Fox and HBO. He worked
for three years as Arum's executive vice president before founding
America Presents with Matt Tinley.
	   Tyson and his handlers at that time _ promoter Don King and
co-managers John Horne and Rory Holloway _ signed a contract with
Showtime in early 1995 that called for the group to handle Tyson's
first 10 fights after the boxer was freed from an Indiana prison
where he served time on a rape conviction.
	   It was during the fifth fight under that contract _ and sixth
fight overall _ that Tyson bit Holyfield's ears, prompting a dlrs 3
million fine and what turned out to be a 16-month ban from boxing
by the Nevada Athletic Commission.
	   Since that fiasco in June 1997, Tyson has severed ties with
King, Horne and Holloway. Tyson had his Nevada boxing license
reinstated Oct. 19.
	   Goossen, appearing at a news conference in Los Angeles to
promote the WBC super lightweight championship bout between Miguel
Angel Gonzalez of Mexico and Kostya Tszyu of Russia on Nov. 28 in
Indio, California wouldn't say when Tyson would return to the ring.
	   ``We'd like to make that announcement at another news
conference,'' Goossen said.
	   It's been speculated Tyson will fight on Jan. 16 against
Francois Botha of South Africa at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas.
Finkel said earlier this week that no deal had been finalized.
	   A source in Las Vegas also said no deal had been signed and that
Vaughn Bean also was being considered as a possible opponent. The
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added that Jan. 16
seemed a probable date and the MGM Grand was the probable site.
	   Another possible opponent could be Germany's Axel Schultz,
according to a spokeswoman for Showtime, the cable company that
will televise the fight.

U.S. company closes Jamaican underwear factory because of drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LLOYD WILLIAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A U.S. clothing company is closing an
underwear factory in southeastern Jamaica, saying it has been used
too often by drug traffickers who hid marijuana in overseas
shipments.
	   Ronald Josephs, general manager of the Cupid Foundations Ltd.
factory in Spanish Town, said Wednesday that since 1995 the
Blackwell, Oklahoma-based company has lost more than dlrs 750,000
in confiscated shipments because customs officials found marijuana
in them.
	   ``We simply cannot afford it,'' Josephs told the Jamaica
Observer newspaper. ``We cannot be assured of a shipment that is
free of drugs. Therefore, we are closing after spending more than
22 years here.''
	   The last confiscation, in October 1997, cost the company dlrs
300,000 and a major customer, he said.
	   The closing will mean 550 layoffs.
	   Cupid is moving its operations to Mexico and Nicaragua, he said.
The factory will close in mid-December, and only a few supervisors
will be transferred.
	   Cupid's decision followed warnings by Jamaican trade ambassador
Peter King earlier this year that drug smugglers were endangering
legitimate exporters.
	   The Caribbean Textile and Apparel Institute, a trade group, has
commissioned security checks at factories and ports because of the
problem.

<TEXT>
	   SIMSBURY, Connecticut (AP) _ In the midst of her daily treatment
for a sore hip, Lu Chen thinks of how dramatic and traumatic the
last two years have been. First, tears well in her eyes. Then, she
smiles.
	   ``It was difficult,'' Chen says. ``But it was worth it at the
end.''
	   About to begin a new career with the Discover Stars on Ice tour,
Chen has been to the peak of figure skating, and she's been through
the pits. All since 1985.
	   At 17, Chen won the bronze medal at the 1994 Olympics, but was
overshadowed by the emergence of Oksana Baiul and the soap opera of
Nancy and Tonya. By 1995, she was a world champion.
	   The next year, she was nearly perfect at worlds, only to lose to
a more perfect Michelle Kwan. Chen, by far the best skater in
China's short, undistinguished participation in the sport, appeared
to be a strong challenger to Kwan and Tara Lipinski for years.
	   Yet, by the Nagano Games, Chen had become an afterthought.
Despite her beauty and grace and impressive resume, she was
considered an outsider for a medal at the '98 Olympics, pushed far
into the background behind Kwan and Lipinski.
	   ``After the Lillehammer Olympics, I was thinking only of staying
for another four years to try it again,'' Chen says. ``I was still
very young and if you are physically and mentally able to do that,
it's not a big deal. So I decided to stay. I thought I had a chance
to maybe win in 1998.''
	   Great decision for two years. Then, disaster.
	   Chen began feuding with her Chinese coaches, whose backgrounds
were paltry in a sport where teaching experience is a must at the
world-class level. She got little support from the federation,
which backed its hired hands.
	   She disappeared from the world scene. There were rumors of
serious injury and financial problems. While Lipinski was soaring
as Kwan's main challenger, Chen was, well, nowhere.
	   ``I had very serious problems with my coaches,'' Chen says.
``They didn't understand what I need as a skater or how I feel as a
skater. In China, it is so totally different than here, and it was
hard to explain to them what you need to succeed in skating.
	   ``In the United States or Europe, they understand. It was a very
hard time for me.''
	   Chen split with her longtime coach Li Ming Zhu after the 1997
worlds, where she fell apart in the short program, placing 25th and
failing to qualify for the free skate. Out of shape because of a
serious foot injury, and with no faith in Chinese skating
officials, she thought of quitting.
	   ``But I had to keep skating after the '97 worlds, even if I
thought I might not get another chance,'' says Chen, who still is
competing in selected professional events. ``The federation then
realized how important the sport is for our country. My coaches had
left me and the federation gave me a new coach, Liu Hong Yun. But
there was a lot of pressure on us.''
	   Chen had moved to California to train. Her foot healed, and she
won the Olympic qualifying event in Vienna in October 1997.
	   ``Before Vienna, I was so scared,'' she says. ``I was never so
scared to go to a competition. I was crying. I'd never understood
when people were so nervous before competitions. It was always,
`Just go and do it.' But I didn't even want to go. I questioned if
I could do it, got confused.
	   ``But my coach relaxed me and gave me a lot of confidence. He
said to just try to get back what I lost and nothing more. He
talked to me like a friend and it gave me a boost.
	   ``After I qualified, I got my confidence back,'' says the skater
known throughout the sport as Lulu. ``With each competition, it got
better and better.''
	   Still, when she arrived at the Olympics, Chen had no idea where
she would finish.
	   Chen placed a virtually ignored fourth in the short program.
With such a tight focus on Lipinski and Kwan, Chen prospered.
	   ``After the short, I felt like I probably could get a medal,''
she says. ``Before that, nobody was thinking of me as a medalist.''
	   Her legs were shaking during warmups for the free skate, and she
sat nervously while Kwan and Marina Slutskaya of Russia performed.
When it was Chen's time on the ice, the magic of 1994-96 had
returned. The bronze again was her's.
	   And the tears flowed. And flowed. It was as if all the ice on
the Nagano rink had melted and was streaming out of her eyes.
	   ``No matter how much sadness and disappointment there was,'' she
says, ``it was like everything is back to the way it should be. So
I cried, because I was so happy.''

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Members of a human rights delegation planning
to visit Peru have received death threats from a group wanting to
block the visit, activists said Thursday.
	   A six-member delegation from the Washington-based Inter-American
Human Rights Commission will be in Peru starting Monday to meet
with government officials and investigate alleged human rights
abuses.
	   Commission President Carlos Ayala has asked for security
measures to be tightened for the five-day visit because of the
threats, Peru's El Comercio newspaper reported.
	   Ayala gave no more details about the threats from a group
calling itself the April 5th Commandos. April 5, 1992 was the date
President Alberto Fujimori shut down Peru's Congress and judicial
system with military backing in what became known as his
``self-coup.''
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Opposition lawmakers say they will approve a
government-proposed bank bailout if Congress investigates alleged
illegal contributions to the ruling party's 1994 presidential
campaign, local media reported Thursday.
	   Legislators for the right-center National Action Party claim
about dlrs 50 million in donations to the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party ended up being covered by the state-run bailout
fund, which absorbed bad loans from wealthy businessmen with
government ties, newspapers reported.
	   In recent weeks, a number of prominent financiers have admitted
making multimillion-dollar donations to the ruling party's 1994
campaign, which ended with the election of President Ernesto
Zedillo.
	   Earlier this year, Zedillo asked Congress to approve the
bailout, which could cost taxpayers up to dlrs 55 billion. The
government expected quick approval, but negotiations have dragged
on for more than six months.

	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ A search team rescued 10 U.S.
students and their two guides Thursday, three days after the
Americans had failed to reach a scheduled checkpoint in the Costa
Rican wilderness.
	   The Americans, part of a leadership training program organized
by the North Carolina Outward Bound School, were in good condition,
rescue officials said.
	   The 10 students, between the ages of 18 and 23, and their guides
had planned to report at a checkpoint Monday at the end of a
four-day expedition. They were headed to the Braulio Carrillo
National Park near the Turrialba Volcano, 40 miles east of San
Jose.
	   Local Red Cross workers found the team on Thursday. An airplane
from U.S. banana producer Standard Fruit Co. assisted in the
search.
	   The team from Asheville, North Carolina, started their
expedition on Oct. 30, officials said.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's commerce secretary defended the
government's food-import policy Thursday after opposition
legislators called for his impeachment, claiming that U.S. imports
were hurting Mexican farmers.
	   Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco said basic grain and cotton
imports from the United States are needed because domestic
production is insufficient.
	   ``We are acting in accordance to the basic need of supplying the
domestic market,'' Blanco said in Acapulco.
	   Opposition deputies claim U.S. agricultural imports are
subsidized and then sold below their market price in Mexico, a
practice they say hurts domestic farmers.
	   A legislator from the right-center National Action Party on
Wednesday requested Blanco's impeachment, claiming the secretary
has failed to protect the nation's commercial interests.
	   Blanco dismissed the allegations as ``political propaganda.''

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen early
Friday amid speculation interest rates in the United States may
remain unchanged. Japanese stock prices fell on profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 118.40 yen in early trading, up 0.76 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
117.67 yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 120.47 points,
or 0.84 percent, to 14,220.90 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Thursday, the average shed 186.44 points, or 1.28 percent.
	   In currency trading, the dollar moved higher after U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that he is ``already
seeing significant signs of some reversals'' in the bond-market
movement that prompted the Fed to cut rates in September and
October.
	   Though Wall Street analysts expect another rate cut at the Fed's
policy committee meeting on Nov. 17, Greenspan's remarks and and
the latest economic data have made them less certain of their
predictions.
	   The U.S. unemployment rate held at 4.6 percent in October for
the second month in a row despite sluggish growth in payrolls, the
Labor Department said Thursday.
	   The dollar also got a boost against European currencies after
Britain's central bank on Thursday cut its official dealing rate by
a greater-than-expected half a percentage point to 6.75 percent.
	   The dollar benefited since lower interest rates tend to make a
country's currency less attractive to investors.
	   On the stock market, share prices started lower as investors
continued to lock in profits after the market's recent upswing.
Before Thursday's retreat, the Nikkei index enjoyed a two-day
rally, rising 7.1 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 8.14 points, or 0.74 percent, to 1,096.43. The
TOPIX closed down 2.79 points, or 0.25 percent.
	   The decline in Tokyo comes despite an overnight advance on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,915.47
on Thursday, up 132.33 points.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.825 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.860 percent,
driving its price up to 108.67 yen from 108.34 yen.

	   PARIS (AP) _ France's bloodiest war started out like a party for
Maurice Bourgeois, an orgy of nationalistic fervor driving waves of
young men like him to join the fight against ``the evil Hun.''
	   Feeble on his feet now, but dressed proudly in a suit, the
102-year-old Bourgeois is among about 3,000 surviving French
veterans of World War I.
	   They are the last of 8.4 million Frenchmen mobilized for a
conflict in which more than half were either killed or wounded by
the time the armistice was signed on Nov. 11, 1918.
	   When war was declared, Bourgeois watched trainloads of inductees
passing through his Normandy hometown of Bernay.
	   ``These men with flowers in their guns, bayonets fixed, with a
military band in front, and they were marching off to war,'' he
said. ``There was one cry, and it was `On to Berlin!'''
	   In his son's Paris living room, he sat next to a blown-up,
black-and-white photograph of himself as a young man with his
comrades in the trenches of the Argonne in 1915.
	   A wartime lieutenant who rose to general during a long military
career, Bourgeois coolly recounted his time in a fiery hell.
	   Attacking German trenches, ``there was a certain amount of
terrain to run through _ 20, 30, 40, 50 meters (yards),'' he said.
``As a result, if the German defenses weren't destroyed, the
Germans were firing with all the weapons they had, and we had very
cruel losses.''
	   He was wounded and captured, but holds no bitterness toward
Germans. When German medics had no bandages left for him, ``a
German sergeant pulled some out of his pocket,'' Bourgeois
recalled. ``We were treated well.''
	   Juliette Pauvert, a 100-year-old native of Paris, earned a
living during the war sewing patches on leather military jackets
pierced by bullet holes.
	   Five of her brothers went to the front. One was killed in action
and the other four eventually died of wounds.
	   Mrs. Pauvert remembers the armistice as a bittersweet moment.
	   ``People were crazy, kissing each other in the streets even if
they didn't know each other. They were happy it was over.''
	   But, she added, ``For those who survived, you felt like you
wasted your youth.''

On eve of euro, 80th anniversary of WWI armistice takes new

<TEXT>
	   VERDUN, France (AP) _ On what is now a tranquil, forested
mountain, hundreds of thousands of young men fell 80 years ago in
an endless barrage of artillery shells, machine gun bullets and
poison gas.
	   Amid a sprawling field of graves, a huge mausoleum with bones
piled high behind glass panels bears witness to the bloodiest
battle of World War I, the first cataclysm of humankind's bloodiest
century.
	   The four years of carnage spelled the end of empire and
aristocratic privilege for Europe and set the stage for World War
II.
	   At the close of this century, the 80th anniversary of the Great
War's armistice on Nov. 11 is a stark reminder of how far Europe
has come and how far it has to go.
	   Commemoration ceremonies in Verdun will come less than two
months before introduction of the European Union's new currency,
the euro, the strongest move yet toward forging a united Europe.
	   ``The birth of the euro, of our common currency, is so
extraordinarily symbolic of the change since the beginning of the
First World War,'' said Jean-Noel Jeanneney, history professor at
the Institute of Political studies and a former trade minister.
	   But the anniversary also comes as the Balkans, the tinderbox
that set off the war in 1914, simmer much as they did at the
century's start.
	   The fast-dwindling number of surviving World War I veterans
raises the danger their story will fade away.
	   Their fight should be remembered, to provide ``the roots for
refusal of a possible renewal of barbarity, which is unfortunately
always behind the door,'' Jeanneney said.
	   Verdun's sobering mausoleum and sprawling cemeteries, its muddy
trenches, rusted barbed wire and razed villages are powerful
reminders. Across France are 30,000 more monuments, repeating the
epitaph ``Here died for the glory of France.'' Some decimated
villages list more war dead than their current populations.
	   The 80th anniversary of when the guns fell silent _ at the 11th
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 _ is likely to be
the last major commemoration where survivors can speak of their
horrors.
	   Maurice Bourgeois, a 102-year-old retired general, still vividly
recalls the fervor of recruits at the war's start ``marching with
flowers in their guns ... singing patriotic songs.''
	   ``They didn't know that 20 days later they'd face the front
lines and be mowed down by German machine guns,'' he said.
	   Juliette Pauvert, 100, lost one brother in action and four
others from their war wounds. As a teen, she took a job sewing
patches on bullet-pierced military jackets.
	   ``There was blood on them, holes, everything,'' she said at an
interview at her nursing home in Paris. ``That war should never
have happened.''
	   The Battle of Verdun, a fruitless 300-day attempt by Germany to
break through the Western Front in 1916, wiped nine villages off
the map and killed 162,000 French and 143,000 German soldiers.
	   But in just a week in August 1914, the French army lost 40,000
men. Some 20,000 British soldiers died on the first day of the
Battle of the Somme on July 1, 1916.
	   ``Those were the bloodiest weeks in the history of France and
Britain,'' said Jean-Jacques Becker, author of ``Europe in the
Great War.''
	   In all, the war caused the deaths of 13 million civilians and
8.5 million fighting men, including 116,000 Americans.
	   The origins of ``the war to end all wars'' were complex.
	   France was itching to recover its Alsace and Lorraine regions,
seized by Germany during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. The
Austro-Hungarian empire _ including the Balkans _ was crumbling.
Russia was on the brink of revolution. Britain was increasingly
conscious of its security role on the European continent.
	   Intricate plans for mobilizing armies for possible war, once set
in motion, heightened tensions, and interlocking defense pacts led
to falling dominos of war declarations.
	   Patriotism and bluster were such that ``the man on the street,
right up to the politicians and military officers, thought the war
would be extremely brief,'' Becker said.
	   But for the first time, war was fought on a massive scale with
modern weapons of unprecedented lethality _ machine guns,
rapid-firing artillery, tanks, airplanes, poison gas. The result on
the Western Front was stalemate, a war of attrition fought across a
moonscape between lines of trenches stretching from the English
Channel to the Swiss border.
	   Death tolls were kept secret. ``Everyone knew the losses were
heavy, but no one knew the details,'' Becker said. ``It took
several years after the war to find out.''
	   The 30,000 monuments to the dead in France fundamentally changed
the countryside. The war ``left a formidable mark on spirits and
minds,'' Becker said.
	   The scar ran deep, cutting across social strata, transforming
the face of nations and rearranging geopolitics and economies for
decades to come.
	   Reparations under the Versailles Treaty further gutted Germany's
economy, providing seeds of vengeance for Adolf Hitler. The treaty
drew borders causing today's conflicts.

VERDUN: today's conflicts.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   World War I wiped out much of Europe's aristocrats and shifted
power to the capitalist class whose factories profited from the war
effort and to the working classes that built strong unions.
	   The war also further strengthened the state in Europe, where
governments expanded economic controls and social welfare _ a
legacy countries still struggle with.
	   France's rural population was devastated, accelerating the
decline of a countryside that remains underdeveloped today.
	   While Germany lost an estimated 1.7 million soldiers, France 1.3
million, Britain more than 900,000 and Italy 650,000, France was
proportionally the hardest hit, leaving it weak at the start of
World War II.
	   With the men at the front, women flooded into the labor market
and many never returned as homemakers. For some it was out of
necessity: the war created more than 1 million widows in France
alone.
	   World War I also marked the beginning of the American century.
U.S. ``doughboys'' arrived to bolster the allies just as French
troops had begun to mutiny, and America became Europe's creditor.
	   ``Some people say this war was the beginning of the decline of
Europe,'' Jeanneney said. ``American power began emerging before
the war, but this horrible event very much accelerated this
evolution.''
	   The peace treaty signed at Versailles was rejected by the U.S.
Congress, and America reverted to an isolationism that proved
tragically mistaken.
	   It wasn't until after the horror of World War II that Europeans
began working toward a wider union. Today, the European Union
encompasses 15 nations and 380 million people, and it will soon add
more.
	   Probably the most powerful image of French-German reconciliation
was when German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President
Francois Mitterrand held hands at Verdun in 1984.
	   Bourgeois, the old general, said he was ``not at all'' bothered
by that scene. ``On the contrary. It was to put an end to those
feelings of vengeance.''
	   Another powerful image today: Carloads of Germans, many of them
the same age as the soldiers who fell here, visit Verdun so as not
to forget.
	   ``It's unimaginable that it could happen,'' said Christian Maul,
25, who with his brother and their girlfriends drove across a
blurred border, no longer required to have their passports checked.
	   ``French and Germans have one culture now, one history,'' he
said.

In Uganda's fight with rebels, mountainous terrain a second enemy

	   MOUNT KASANZE, Congo (AP) _ Keeping on the lookout for rebels,
the Ugandan soldiers struggle up a steep path cut through dense
forest in the Rwenzori Mountains.
	   Single file, carrying mortars, rifles and grenades, they climb
up through the steaming forest to sharp peaks, down the other side
and up again, moving deeper into eastern Congo where Ugandan rebels
of the Allied Democratic Forces have their bases.
	   The rebels' attacks on towns and villages in western Uganda have
killed hundreds and are strangling attempts to develop the region.
	   These soldiers _ of the Ugandan army's 33rd Battalion _ are
taking the war into the Congo to run the rebels down.
	   But the terrain is a second enemy.
	   ``The goal is to finish them off,'' says Lt. Col. Charles
Mukasi. ``Let me tell you, its hard work. This is difficult
terrain.''
	   Two years ago, the rebels regrouped after being pushed out of
Uganda and set up bases in a region that the ancient geographer
Ptolemy called the Mountains of the Moon. People on the Ugandan
side of the border live in constant fear.
	   The attackers descend from the mountains at night to burn, loot,
slash and kill. They grab children and teen-agers from their beds
to use as soldiers or slaves. Then they slip back into Congo. Their
long-range goals are not clear.
	   Trading, tea-growing and subsistence farming all are suffering
in western Uganda. Thousands of people have fled their villages in
the foothills to seek refuge in insecure towns crowded with
displaced people. Hundreds of those carried off are still missing.
	   The Congolese army has done nothing to hinder the Ugandan
rebels. And the governments of Uganda and Rwanda, which helped
Congolese President Laurent Kabila's rise to power last year, now
accuse him of giving the Allied Democratic Forces and other rebel
groups free rein.
	   The Ugandan army claims it has destroyed 18 rebel camps and
rescued 222 abducted children and youths, forcing the rebels to
split up and move around in groups of less than 10.
	   ``If we deny them the ability to get food, deny them the ability
to establish permanent camps for training, they can't survive,''
Lt. Joseph Balinda says while the patrol rests after a five-hour
climb up Mount Kasenze. ``We want to disorganize them completely.''
	   Hundreds of soldiers, many of them barefoot, lounge on the
ground in a clearing 3,000 meters (9,000 feet) above sea level.
They kick off their rubber rain boots, and dangle their
sweat-soaked socks from trees and small tents.
	   Some clean their weapons as walkie-talkie batteries charge on
solar panels. Rhythmic Congolese music crackles from a
battery-powered radio.
	   Lunch is beans boiled over fires in dented aluminum pots.
	   ``We chased the ADF from this place about a month ago,'' says
Warrant Officer Class 2 Kenneth Okello, green polish glittering on
his toenails.
	   ``They ambushed us. ... We killed two. They got none of ours. It
took five minutes, and then they ran away.''
	   Guided by villagers who saw rebel fighters recently, the patrol
has two more days of hiking ahead through ever higher, colder
terrain to another peak called Tutubwe.
	   District and municipal officials in western Uganda say the
army's move into Congo has helped.
	   ``The day the troops moved into Congo, the situation began
improving on this side,'' says Edward Masika, governor of the
Bundibugyo region on the border.
	   Residents still worry because guerrilla raids continue, although
the attackers are less numerous, and they no longer target big
towns.
	   Army leaders say little about losses. An Associated Press
photographer recently saw the body of at least one Ugandan soldier
loaded onto a military helicopter in Congo.
	   Some legislators back in the capital, Kampala, complain the
anti-rebel campaign is too expensive for poor Uganda.
	   President Yoweri Museveni says his troops won't leave Congo
without being sure the western border has been secured, whether by
Congolese soldiers or a multinational force of troops from central
African nations.
	   He also denies his troops are helping Congolese rebels who are
seeking to oust Kabila. However, his commanders acknowledge that
Ugandan soldiers are the only military forces in the eastern Congo
towns of Beni and Butembo _ both in territory that anti-Kabila
rebels claim to control.

Reagan ranch to serve as monument to conservatism

<TEXT>
	   SANTA BARBARA, California (AP) _ It's as though the Gipper never
left.
	   Ronald Reagan's sweat-stained ball cap is near the front door of
the main house at Rancho del Cielo. And a loofah sponge, glycerin
soap and Head and Shoulders shampoo are still in the shower the
ex-president and his wife, Nancy, shared.
	   But three years have passed since Reagan visited his beloved
mountaintop hideaway, known to a generation of Americans as the
Western White House. Reagan, who at 87 is suffering the effects of
Alzheimer's disease, drew strength and inspiration from the
688-acre (278-hectare) ranch.
	   ``We relax at the ranch, which if not heaven itself, probably
has the same ZIP code,'' he wrote in a 40th wedding anniversary
letter in 1992. It was a sanctuary he rarely shared with outsiders,
although he played host to such world leaders as Britain's Queen
Elizabeth and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
	   Earlier this year, the Reagans sold the property and its
100-year-old adobe ranch house to a group now preserving it as a
monument to conservatism, an inspiration for a new generation of
leaders.
	   ``When you sit in this house you really feel his presence. It's
magical,'' said Marc Short, the chief keeper of the shrine, during
a recent tour.
	   Pointing to a leather patio table, he noted it's where the 1981
Economic Recovery Act was signed. ``It's where we think the Reagan
Revolution started,'' he said.
	   The Virginia-based Young America's Foundation, which promotes
conservative values among high school and college students,
purchased Rancho del Cielo. Reagan spokeswoman Joanne Drake said
the sale price was close to the dlrs 5.95 million asking price.
	   ``We hope that our ranch will be a spark for many bright, young
Americans in the years ahead,'' Nancy Reagan said after the sale.
	   Short, the 28-year-old executive director of the Young America's
Foundation, moved from its Virginia headquarters to California in
June with his 24-year-old bridecomma Kristen. They refer to the
ranch as ``hallowed ground'' and say they are honored to tend it.
	   ``We feel we are the luckiest people in the world,'' Short said,
gazing across the Reagan-built patio with a metal ``1600 Penna.
Ave.'' sign overhead and a view of Lake Lucky, where the Reagans
often canoed.
	   ``Nothing draws a couple closer together than to find a pretty
spot, maybe a ukulele and a canoe _ Nancy's idea of the perfect
romantic setting _ and share happy thoughts of the past,'' Reagan
wrote in his anniversary letter.
	   The 1,200-square-foot (111-square-meter) ranch is modest in its
size and furnishings. There are aluminum-frame, motel-style windows
(the bulletproof glass was removed after Reagan left the White
House); a faux red brick linoleum floor throughout; a Harvest Gold
refrigerator. There's even a Liberty Bell shower head in the
bathroom.
	   It's a far cry from the Blue Room and certainly lacks the
elegance of other presidential retreats such as George Bush's at
Kennebunkport, Maine; Richard Nixon's at San Clemente, California;
or John F. Kennedy's at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.) But it's
cozy, and it's easy to understand why the Reagans cherished it for
25 years.
	   ``He lived just like we did. That's why he was the Great
Communicator,'' Short said.
	   The Young America's Foundation plans to use the ranch for
leadership seminars to steep young people in Reagan philosophies. A
conference center will be built nearby, and students will likely
make day and weekend trips to the ranch, riding the seven miles (11
kilometers) of horse trails.
	   ``The majority of our programs will be focused on the Reagan era
and how he changed the world,'' Short said. A dlrs 10 million to
dlrs 15 million capital drive to build the conference center and
house the students is in the planning stages.
	   Mrs. Reagan hauled many items out of the basement of the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, some 80 miles (129
kilometers) from the ranch, and spent about three hours with
Kristen making sure each item was placed exactly as it had been.
	   ``If something was out of place, she moved it back to its
original spot,'' Mrs. Short said.
	   Added her husband: ``She came up here about a week after
settlement. She hopped out in her jeans and tennis shoes and
quickly went right to work with Kristen. It was emotional. She was
emotional when she left. I think in a lot of ways it was a sense of
closure for her.''
	   The effect is poignant.
	   A weathered copy of ``Lonesome Dove'' sits on a bookshelf,
rugged Western paintings hang on the walls, a shotgun rests on
antlers over a doorway, the kitchen spice rack is stocked with
paprika, oregano and cinnamon, undoubtedly used for the
Thanksgiving family feasts held at the ranch.
	   Reagan's boots are lined up in a walk-in closet in the bright
yellow bedroom. There are cowboy hats and a collection of belt
buckles; a spur once carried into space, and Nancy and Ron
monogrammed bathrobes.
	   Reagan's saddles, including the well-worn English model he
preferred, are in the tack room. His blue-and-gold Cavalry horse
blanket hangs on a wall.
	   Reagan enjoyed trimming the hundreds of oak trees on the
property, explaining in a 1990 interview, ``I love the dappled look
on the ground when the sun comes through.''
	   One spot he made sure to trim back is a hilltop grove of oaks
just above the house. It's the family pet graveyard. Mrs. Reagan's
beloved quarter horse No Strings is there, along with a bull named
Duke, horses Kelly and Duke, and several dogs: Victory, Freebo,
Millie, Taca, Lucky, Kodiak, Sasha, Fang, Fuzzy and Rhino.
	   Each grave has a stone marker with a name carved by Reagan. More
recently, dog Rex was buried. But this time, a ranch hand carved
the stone.

Atlantic City casinos ante up for those down on their luck

	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Homeless families and
tapped-out gamblers can get a warm bed and a free meal at the
Atlantic City Rescue Mission. And not just any free meal: On one
recent day, drop-ins lunched on crab legs and lobster bisque.
	   At Our Lady Star of the Sea School in Cape May, pupils in
kindergarten and third and fifth grades returned in the fall and
found personal computers had been added to their classroom
materials.
	   And when the Egg Harbor Township branch of the Community Food
Bank of New Jersey needed a refrigerated truck to pick up donated
food, a 22-foot (6.7-meter) 1987 Ford was delivered. No charge, no
strings.
	   While they create some paupers on the one hand, Atlantic City's
12 casinos also share the wealth with schools, churches, libraries,
shelters, retirement homes and charities.
	   Goods have included shampoo from the Trump Marina, prime rib
left over from the buffet at Trump Taj Mahal, office furniture from
the Sands Hotel Casino and computers from Harrah's Casino Hotel.
	   ``They do more than people could ever imagine,'' says Evelyn
Benton, executive director of the Food Bank branch.
	   ``And they get asked more than anyone could possibly imagine.
They get hundreds of letters a day. People say, `Are they doing
enough?' They're for-profit companies. What more are they supposed
to do?''
	   What casinos were supposed to do was revitalize Atlantic City.
More than 20 years since the first one opened, the pace continues
to lag. But when it comes to hand-me-downs, the casinos do plenty.
	   Last year, the Rescue Mission received dlrs 300,000 in leftover
food, enough to serve 570 meals a day, according to its president,
Barry Durman.
	   Trump Taj Mahal donates prepared food five days a week, Durman
says, and other casinos pitch in occasionally. Sometimes it's prime
rib, which the mission cooks cut up to use in chili or meat loaf.
	   When Caesars Atlantic City discarded carpeting during an
expansion project, it was sent to the mission's family life center.
The mission also has received office desks, banquet chairs, soap
and shampoo.
	   There's some irony, too: Sometimes the donations help those who
have gambled away their bankrolls. But Durman and others who
benefit are reluctant to criticize the casinos.
	   ``More than irony, it's a matter of corporations helping us
serve the community. I have people (from other charities) come to
me saying, `It's great you get their help. Here's what we get ...
.'
	   ``The casinos really have taken on the social ills of the
community by helping us take them on.''
	   In some cases, the casinos get tax breaks by donating used
equipment to charity instead of selling it or throwing it away. But
with many of the donations, the bottom line is community service,
they say.
	   ``Any tax benefits really don't even offset the administrative
costs of providing those types of items to charitable
organizations,'' said Harrah's Casino Hotel spokesman Michael
DiLeva. ``It's not about a tax deduction, even when they're
available. It's about fulfilling the promise of bettering the
community.''
	   In recent years, Harrah's has given computers to Absegami High
School, the Atlantic City Public Library, the Inlet Public-Private
Association, Our Lady Star of the Sea and a veterans' home.
	   Donald J. Trump's three casinos also have given generously. In
1996, when the Trump Regency was gutted and turned into Trump
World's Fair casino, the company gave away dlrs 740,000 worth of
theater and audiovisual equipment to the Richard J. Stockton
College of New Jersey. It was the biggest such donation in the
college's 25-year history.
	   More recently, Trump Taj Mahal donated a 265-gallon aquarium,
which it had bought for a casino promotion, to the Marine Mammal
Stranding Center in nearby Brigantine, which nurses sea creatures
that wash up on New Jersey beaches. Trump casinos also donated six
video cameras and six TV monitors that once watched gamblers and
now enable officials and visitors to view animals recovering at the
center.
	   In some cases, the goods are nearly new. Theme changes, name
changes, corporate restructurings and renovations all can lead to
one carpeting being replaced with another.
	   ``The ranks of management seem to change all the time, and
people come in and say, `I don't like that, get it out of here.' So
out it goes. If it were a tire, it would have one mile (1.6
kilometers) on it, but it has to go,'' said Jim Wise, a spokesman
for the Sands Hotel Casino.
	   The Sands, which is remodeling its guest rooms, is giving the
used chairs, tables, entertainment centers, coffee tables and
framed pictures to the Eastern Pines Convalescent Center, an
Atlantic City nursing home.
	   ``You can't solve major problems with a couple rolls of carpet
and some desks,'' Wise said. ``It makes life easier, but it doesn't
put anyone on easy street. Still, you can make a big impact on a
small scale.''

Hawaiian-born sumo wrestler finds new popularity as TV celebrity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAKUHARI, Japan (AP) _ Weighing well over a quarter ton,
Konishiki was the quintessential sumo wrestler _ a hulking, glaring
presence who seemed to enjoy nothing more than to strike fear in
the hearts of the toughest guys Japan had to offer.
	   But since retiring from the sumo ring, the Hawaiian-born giant
is cultivating a new image. These days, Konishiki is cute, cuddly
and as mellow as a Honolulu breeze.
	   And he's _ easily _ the biggest thing to ever hit the Japanese
entertainment world, whether plugging whiskey in television ads or
co-hosting a prime-time talk show.
	   ``I enjoy every second,'' Konishiki said in a recent interview.
``I'm just being myself.''
	   Still, it's been a surprising metamorphosis.
	   For more than a decade, Konishiki's 640-pound (290-kilograms)
fighting weight and yield-no-ground stare made him one of the most
feared wrestlers in Japan's national sport, sumo.
	   He was also one of the most successful _ and controversial.
	   Sumo wrestlers are subjected to a strict ranking system based
mostly on how well they fare each tournament, and Konishiki set
several important precedents. He was the first foreign wrestler to
reach the rank of ozeki, the second-highest in the sport.
	   But although Konishiki was one of Japan's most popular wrestlers
and won three tournaments _ another feat no foreigner had ever
accomplished _ the sport's governing body chose not to give him the
top rank of ``yokozuna.''
	   When he was up for promotion in 1992, one member of the
selection committee wrote that no foreigner had the ``dignity'' to
achieve yokozuna. He noted that Konishiki had cried after winning
his first tournament, a no-no in the stoic world of sumo.
	   Soon after, Konishiki was quoted in both American and Japanese
media as accusing Japan's Sumo Association of racism. The report
sparked a volley of recriminations _ cooling down only after
Japan's prime minister urged calm.
	   Konishiki denies having ever made the racism allegations and
today strikes a deliberately conciliatory tone toward whatever
prejudice he may encounter.
	   ``If you try to fight it, you just drown in the current,'' he
said.
	   The question of whether a foreigner should be elevated to
yokozuna is now moot _ another Hawaiian-born wrestler, Akebono, has
held the rank since 1993.
	   And if the 34-year-old Konishiki is drowning in anything now,
it's adoration.
	   Konishiki's jam-packed days are a testament to the scheduling
talents of his manager, who hovered in the background barking into
a cell phone as the former wrestler settled into an interview at a
plush suburban Tokyo hotel.
	   True to his new image, Konishiki, clad in overalls, was as
laid-back as could be _ a more luxurious sprawl would have required
a bigger sofa.
	   The enthusiastic response to Konishiki's move into entertainment
suggests he's new enjoying-it-all image may have struck a chord in
this fast-paced, workaholic country.
	   Part of his appeal may also lie in his decision to strike out in
a new direction mid-career, something that's still next to
impossible here, especially for sumo wrestlers.
	   Konishiki is quick to credit sumo for opening the door to
stardom, but says he is glad to be moving on.
	   There's no more pressure from tournaments. The strict ceremony
and etiquette of sumo don't apply to him anymore. He spends more
time at home with his wife, Sumika, a former model.
	   And, of course, there's no more of the enormous pots of
``chanko'' stew served twice daily on sumo training tables.
Instead, Konishiki takes smaller, more regular meals, eating
breakfast for the first time since becoming a wrestler 16 years
ago.
	   The result: He's lost 66 pounds (30 kilograms).
	   ``I feel great,'' he says.
	   One of nine children whose father was a civilian worker at the
U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor, Konishiki says he would never have
left his hometown of Nanakuli, on the island of Oahu, if a
persistent sumo recruiter hadn't persuaded him to come to Tokyo.
	   He founded the Konishiki Kids Foundation two years ago to bring
sixth graders to Japan. This year, 300 students applied for 35
spots.
	   ``Japan has been good to me,'' he said. ``But the best thing I
can do now is to help my own community.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A top government official may have
conspired to implicate Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister in a
sex scandal, the nation's intelligence chief testified.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's chief economic adviser, Daim
Zainuddin, plotted with the sister of Anwar Ibrahim's private
secretary to prove he was indulging in illegal sex, Mohamed Said
Awang testified Thursday.
	   Anwar, Malaysia's former No. 2 leader, is standing trial on 10
counts of corruption and sexual misconduct. He denies the charges
and says they were fabricated because Mahathir considered his
popularity a threat to his 17-year rule. The trial was continuing
Friday.
	   A statement by the secretary's sister, Ummi Hafilda Ali, saying
her brother's wife had sex with Anwar, is being used by the
prosecution in the trial.
	   The other statement being used against Anwar is from his
personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, who said Anwar sodomized him 15
times.
	   Other details of possible involvement of government ministers in
a scheme to oust Anwar were mentioned in a police report that was
sent to Mahathir in August 1997, Mohamed said on the fourth day of
Anwar's trial.
	   ``Did the report you gave to the prime minister contain a
statement from you that the allegations were politically
motivated?'' Christopher Fernando, one of Anwar's nine defense
attorneys, asked Mohamed during his cross-examination.
	   ``I don't deny it,'' he replied.
	   ``Did you mention that Daim Zainuddin met with Ummi Hafilda as
part of the scheme?'' Fernando asked.
	   ``I don't deny that,'' said Mohamed.
	   Mohamed on Wednesday accused Anwar of trying to force police to
cover up his alleged sexual misconduct. Anwar demanded that
intelligence officers get retractions from Ummi and Azizan, he
testified.
	   Mohamed said he agreed to get the retractions from Ummi and
Azizan despite believing the sexual allegations.
	   Since Anwar's arrest Sept. 20, thousands of Malaysians have
participated in street protests demanding his release and
Mahathir's resignation.
	   The case has attracted international attention after Anwar
showed up at his arraignment with a black eye and bruises. He
claimed police beat him after his arrest.
	   The national news agency Bernama, meanwhile, confirmed that
Mahathir is among the 52 people the prosecution plans to call as
witnesses.

Japan unsure if public spending will perk economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's massive public works spending package might
not be enough to spur domestic demand and power the sagging economy
out of recession, the government said Friday.
	   The Economic Planning Agency's monthly report said the economy
was still floundering in its worst downturn since World War II,
with the outlook darkened by unstable currency markets and
slowdowns overseas.
	   Despite a government stimulus package, private capital spending
is still sagging because of concerns about the long-term prospects
for the economy, the EPA said.
	   One bright spot for the Japanese economy _ exports _ are also in
danger. Exports had been powered by steady U.S. and European demand
as well as a relatively weak yen until a month ago.
	   But the recent surge of the yen combined with signs of slowing
economic growth overseas have posed new risks for Japan, said
Takashi Omori, director of the Economic Planning Agency's domestic
economic affairs section.
	   ``There are signs of a slowdown in the U.S. economy and there is
uncertainty in financial markets due to Latin America,'' Omori
said.
	   Flagging overseas demand is particularly worrisome because Japan
suffers from stagnant domestic demand, as consumers cut back
spending and corporations reduce investment.
	   The government announced Thursday that household spending dipped
1.5 percent in September from a year earlier, stretching the
longest-ever streak of such declines to the 11th month.
	   ``Private sector sentiment is chilled. Although government
expenditure is on the rise, we have to watch closely how much it
will act to stimulate demand in the private sector,'' Omori said.
	   The EPA said industrial output is still declining, but noted
this time that the pace of decline has leveled off somewhat. The
report also said for the first time that the effects of the 16.7
trillion yen (dlrs 141.5 billion) supplemental budget enacted last
summer have started to show up in the economy.
	   Underscoring that point, public works orders to the 50 largest
companies rose 19.5 percent in September from a year ago, marking
the first year-on-year increase in 15 months.
	   But despite the rise in public works outlays, the key to the
economy rests with the private sector, economists have said
recently.
	   Highlighting the weakness of private industry, industrial output
remains stagnant, as companies struggle to reduce inventories
bloated by dormant demand both at home and in some export markets,
the report said.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. report alleges 4,000 to 5,000
people _ many of them minorities, women and children _ were killed
after Afghanistan's Taliban warriors took over a northern city in
August.
	   The report from the U.N. Commission on Human Rights details mass
killings of civilians in Mazar-e-Sharif, including executions,
torture and mass suffocation of people crammed into metal
containers left to simmer in the summer sun.
	   The Taliban rejected the report as ``imaginary,'' and said its
author _ who didn't visit the country for security reasons and
based his claims on ``reliable sources'' _ hadn't verified any of
the claims he had received.
	   The accusations ``are simply a vast propaganda which only
provokes baseless prejudices and brainwashes the people,'' the
Taliban said in a reply contained in the report.
	   The city of Mazar-e-Sharif had been a stronghold of the northern
alliance opposed to the Taliban, which has conquered roughly 90
percent of the Central Asian nation and installed its strict brand
of Islamic rule that forbids women from working outside the home.
	   The Taliban took over the city on Aug. 8, and the slayings of
Iranian diplomats by Taliban soldiers during the capture prompted
Tehran to beef up its military presence along the border and
threaten military retaliation.
	   In the first week of the Taliban offensive, hundreds of people
were summarily executed on the streets of the city or inside their
homes, according to the report.
	   Still others were tortured to death: one survivor had his
fingernails torn out. Others were repeatedly beaten with steel
cables.
	   Many people suffocated after being crowded into metal containers
and transported to another city for questioning, the report said.
	   ``One witness saw the opening of three containers carrying 120
persons, of whom only three had survived the trip to Shebergan,''
80 miles (125 kilometers) west of Mazar-e-Sharif, the report said.
	   The United Nations has persistently criticized the Taliban's
human rights record, but the details from the August massacres went
far beyond the traditional U.N. complaints about the Taliban's
restrictive treatment of women and girls.
	   The report's author, Special Rapporteur Choong Hyun Paik, said
he was ``horrified by the latest reports from Afghanistan, which
are profoundly disturbing and indicate a worsening pattern of grave
human rights violations.''
	   The scale of violations warrants the urgent attention of the
world community, he said in urging a more thorough investigation of
the slayings.
	   The U.N. envoy for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, asked the
Security Council to approve sending human rights monitors for
Afghanistan to ensure that other massacres are prevented.
	   The Taliban has agreed to an investigation of the massacres, but
Brahimi told reporters Thursday that the United Nations is awaiting
security guarantees.
	   The bulk of those slain in Mazar-e-Sharif _ an estimated 3,000
people _ belonged to the minority Hazara group. Surviving Hazaras,
who are Shiite Muslims like most Iranians, were warned to practice
the Sunni Muslim tradition of the Taliban if they wanted to
survive, the report said.
	   The report also detailed massacres of about 1,800 people carried
out during the Taliban takeover of central Bamiyan province and
surrounding areas, which also contain large Hazara communities.
	   ``The pattern of the killings observed showed that men, women
and male children were shot, while baby girls were kicked or beaten
to death,'' the report said.
	   Brahimi recently visited the region and eased tensions between
Iran and Afghanistan by securing the release of 26 Iranians in
detention since the takeover of Mazar-e-Sharif.

Palestinian security chief, top Hamas fugitive share common roots

<TEXT>
	   KHAN YOUNIS REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip (AP) _ One is the hunter,
and one is the hunted.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, chief of Palestinian preventive security in the
Gaza Strip, has been handed the daunting task of breaking the
Izzedine al Qassam brigades, the military wing of the radical
Islamic group Hamas.
	   Mohammed Deif is a top Hamas military leader, one of the most
wanted fugitives in the Palestinian lands, suspected mastermind in
a string of bloody attacks on Israelis _ and a boyhood neighbor of
Dahlan, his newfound nemesis.
	   Now in their mid-30s, the two grew up in the same refugee camp,
went to the same university, earned their fighter's stripes in the
same street clashes with Israeli troops.
	   Shaped by common experience, their lives have always run on some
strangely parallel track. Now they share the stage in a drama whose
larger outcome could lead to the success or shattering of the new
Mideast peace accord.
	   Israel insists that in exchange for more West Bank territory,
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority must wage all-out war on
Islamic militants who have used suicide bombings to terrorize
Israelis and thwart past peace efforts. That includes tracking down
key Hamas leaders like Deif.
	   In demeanor, Dahlan and Deif could hardly be more different.
Dahlan is big, bluff and smooth-spoken; Deif is said to be bookish,
reticent and solitary. While Dahlan is a sharp dresser whose
confident carriage attracts attention, Deif is described as a
master of disguise, a man who can all but disappear in plain sight.
	   Dahlan is a rising star in Palestinian politics, reportedly
impressing President Clinton when they met during Mideast peace
negotiations at a Maryland retreat in October. Deif has clung to
the shadows, drifting like smoke through his fugitive's
netherworld.
	   For all their dissimilarities, the fate of one could easily have
been the other's. Except for a crucial, youthful choice: Dahlan
joined Arafat's army, while Deif embraced the more fundamentalist
Hamas.
	   Because of that, Dahlan's allegiance lies today with Arafat's
Palestinian Authority, which has chosen to make peace with Israel.
Hamas _ and Deif _ remain dedicated to its destruction.
	   But Palestinian society puts an overwhelming traditional
emphasis on personal connections, village bonds and kinship ties.
So the battle lines tend to blur, even in the face of what look
like directly conflicting ideologies. Thus, a
straightforward-seeming task _ the Palestinian Authority must root
out Hamas _ is in fact enormously complicated by cultural factors.
	   The face of the enemy, after all, is so like that of a brother.
	   ___
	   Khan Younis refugee camp, named for the scruffy Gaza Strip town
that surrounds it, is a warren of narrow, sandy streets lined with
cement-block hovels. Although it in many ways resembles Gaza's
seven other refugee camps, its isolation amid lonely stretches of
sand dunes and its stiflingly provincial atmosphere make the others
seem almost cosmopolitan by comparison.
	   Even by strict Gaza standards, public mores are conservative;
women wear long enveloping black robes, and none ventures out
without a headscarf. Barefoot boys leap among the rubble, kicking a
battered soccer ball.
	   Graffiti looping across the camp's walls range from the
grandiosely political to the humbly mundane. ``No peace without our
Jerusalem!'' says one. Next to it is a hand-scrawled advertisement
for a camp hairdresser.
	   Recent years have wrought some changes. When it rained, Khan
Younis' streets used to run with raw sewage; today the water system
is being upgraded. There is a new housing project of pale-yellow
apartment buildings, a soon-to-open hospital.
	   But some things are much as they were when Mohammed Dahlan and
Mohammed Deif were growing up in Khan Younis, their family homes
separated by only a few trash-strewn streets.
	   The camp still sprawls right up to the barbed-wire-topped
perimeter wall of the Jewish settlement of Gush Katif. Israeli
soldiers man a nearby military checkpoint. The camp is still a
prime recruiting ground for radical groups like Hamas and Islamic
Jihad, turning out foot soldiers and top leaders alike.
	   At least a half dozen of the 30 Palestinian militants whose
arrest was demanded by Israel in early November are from Khan
Younis. It was the hometown of Hassan Salameh, the former No. 2 in
Izzedine al Qassam who oversaw a series of deadly bombings before
Israel shot and captured him two years ago.
	   Neither Dahlan nor Deif has lived in the camp for years, but
both still have relatives there. However, none would speak to
journalists or allow their photographs to be taken.
	   Acquaintances and associates of one or both men, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that as youngsters, the two moved in
separate but overlapping circles. They attended the same elementary
school, but at different times of the day _ like many in Gaza,
where schools are so crowded that students go to classes in shifts.

<TEXT>
	   Both went on to Gaza's Islamic University. Although both are
described as sharply intelligent, neither graduated. Their real
education came in street clashes that eventually escalated into the
``intefadeh,'' the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.
	   Both served time in Israeli jails, and Dahlan was deported for
anti-Israeli activity. Later, both settled into apprenticeships
that would heighten a sense of blood loyalty to their chosen
comrades.
	   Dahlan served with Arafat's closest confidant, Khalil al-Wazir,
known as Abu Jihad. Deif became a deputy to Yehiya Ayyash, the
Hamas bombmaker whose deadly expertise earned him the nickname
``The Engineer.''
	   Each lost his mentor to assassination. In operations widely
attributed to Israel, al-Wazir was gunned down in Tunisia in 1988,
while Ayyash, in a mordantly poetic touch, was killed at a Gaza
Strip hideout by an explosives-rigged mobile telephone in 1996.
	   With the coming of Palestinian autonomy, Dahlan returned to
Gaza, continuing an ascent in the Palestinian political hierarchy
that culminated in his high-profile role in hammering out security
agreements at the Wye River negotiations in October.
	   Deif, rarely seen in public the past five years, moved ever
deeper underground.
	   ___
	   Just how diligently is Dahlan looking for Deif? He has called it
the greatest challenge of his career.
	   ``I consider myself very successful in my work,'' he told
reporters recently. ``I have not failed in any of my missions,
except for one _ Mohammed Deif.''
	   On the Israeli side, there is open skepticism about the scope
and intensity of the search.
	   ``In the past, we believe the Palestinians have had
opportunities to arrest Mohammed Deif, and they've taken every
opportunity to miss every opportunity,'' said government spokesman
Moshe Fogel.
	   Despite such doubts, Deif might be lucky to escape alive. In the
past seven months, several other top members of Hamas' military
wing have met with ends as violent as their lives.
	   In September, fugitive brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah died in
a hail of bullets when Israeli soldiers raided their West Bank
hideout. In March, Hamas bombmaker Mohiyadine Sharif was found dead
under murky circumstances at the scene of a car-bomb blast.
	   If those who suspect Dahlan of shielding Deif are wrong, a
search could be a drawn-out affair. Though not large, Gaza is
labyrinthine. Ayyash, the bombmaker, was on the run for four years
before he was finally tracked down and killed.
	   For a man in hiding, patience and a solitary disposition are
assets. Deif is described by one person who knows him as the kind
of man who could live for months alone in a darkened room.
	   But if he is the key Hamas mastermind he is held to be, Deif may
be entering a period of stepped-up activity just when it carries
the greatest risk of exposure. Statements issued in Izzedine al
Qassam's name have threatened more suicide attacks like the failed
attempt to blow up a school bus carrying Jewish children in the
Gaza Strip on Oct. 29.
	   Analyst Boaz Ganor, who heads the International Institute for
Counter-Terrorism outside Tel Aviv, said the longing of ordinary
Palestinians for the gains promised by the peace accord could
overcome any reluctance by Palestinian officials to bring Deif in.
	   ``Palestinian public opinion might accept the arrest of Deif
now, because it would be seen as advancing the agreement, and the
agreement involves the main Palestinian national interest _
territory,'' said Ganor. ``If there was ever a time to move, this
is it.''

Croatian descendants fight to get their church back
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER DURANTINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STEELTON, Pennsylvania (AP) _ For three years, parishioners of a
church in this gritty steel town have been fighting with their
bishop, contending their Croatian heritage is being undermined by
the Catholic diocese's decision to consolidate parishes.
	   They have picketed the home of Bishop Nicholas Dattilo of
Harrisburg, carrying signs that read, ``Save Our Parish, Save Your
Soul.'' They have arranged for a Croatian bishop from Bosnia to
celebrate Mass without Dattilo's permission. They have celebrated a
parish that no longer exists in diocesan eyes.
	   Tensions escalated in September when the bishop warned in an
open letter in the diocese's newspaper, ``The Catholic Witness,''
that the parishioners in the St. Mary's Preservation Society risk
``separation'' if they do not end their dissent.
	   ``They will no longer be members of the Roman Catholic Church,''
explained the Rev. T. Ronald Haney, spokesman for the diocese.
``They have been absolutely disrespectful, disobedient and they owe
the bishop a public act of apology.''
	   But Chuck Wilson, a legal expert who helps Catholics who
challenge church decisions, considers the threat extreme.
	   ``We've handled a lot of parish-closing cases, but I've never
seen anything like this, with people being threatened with
penalties,'' said Wilson, director of the St. Joseph's Foundation
in San Antonio. ``The law of the church says penalties should be
used as a last resort, and this certainly isn't a last resort.''
	   The diocese's canon lawyer, the Rev. William King, acknowledged
that the bishop's warning was the start of the long process of
excommunication, but he expressed hope that it could be avoided.
	   ``One of the guiding principles in the new laws of the church is
to reduce any penalties,'' he said. ``That is essentially why
Bishop Dattilo waited 3 1/2 years to issue any warning.''
	   The dispute over ethnic ties is in a town with this welcome
sign: ``Steelton: Many Countries, One People.'' The Belgrade Bakery
makes Serbian bread and Italian cookies. And there is an Eastern
Orthodox church for Macedonian and Bulgarian descendants.
	   In 1995, the diocese consolidated five ethnic parishes _ German,
Italian, Irish, Slovenian and Croatian _ into Prince of Peace
parish. The 81-year-old red-brick Croatian church, formerly known
as St. Mary's, was made the parish church.
	   ``They suppressed the Croatian parish into an American-based,
English-speaking parish,'' said Joanne Zalek, president of the St.
Mary's Preservation Society.
	   Before the consolidation, Mass was celebrated in Croatian every
other week, with other Masses in English. Some songs at all Masses
were sung in Croatian, she said.
	   Zalek, a second generation Croatian-American, said parishioners
want their culture alive in the church, not just for their heritage
but for new immigrants and refugees.
	   Croatia and four other Yugoslavian republics _ Bosnia, Slovenia,
Macedonia and Herzegovina _ declared independence in 1991,
separating from Serbia and Montenegro and sparking civil war.
	   ``Since the Bosnian war we've had many refugees settle in this
area,'' Zalek said. ``They're not comfortable yet with the
language.''
	   In Pennsylvania, about 78,000 claim Croatian ancestry, including
about 3,400 in Dauphin County, where the parish is located.
	   Unlike a century ago, when waves of Europeans immigrated to
America, ethnic parishes today are not always practicable. Less
money drops into collection plates these days because of dwindling
membership, and the church is grappling with a shortage of priests.
	   Two Croatian-speaking Franciscans had served the Steelton parish
until the consolidation, when two diocesan priests replaced them.
Zalek said they are still needed, noting the parishioners had to
bring in a Croatian-speaking priest to hear confessions from an
elderly woman who understood little English.
	   ``It took months for us to be able to arrange that,'' she said.
	   Haney said the bishop has tried to meet some of the
parishioners' wishes. Masses have been celebrated in Croatian, but
Zalek said few were said on Sunday, the day of obligation for
Catholics.
	   Except for hearing the concerns of parishioners just before the
consolidation, the bishop has refused to meet with them. Vatican
officials, responding to an appeal, said the bishop makes the final
decision concerning parishes.
	   In his warning letter, the bishop wrote, ``Let me be absolutely
clear that there is only one Catholic parish community or
congregation in Steelton, and that is the legitimately erected
parish of Prince of Peace.''
	   Zalek said the parishioners want a dialogue with the bishop. She
said they will accept his decision, but only if parish needs are
met. Haney said they want a parish exclusive to them.
	   In early October, in an event not sanctioned by the diocese, the
group celebrated the parish's 100th anniversary at a local VFW hall
with Croatian food and song.
	   Several days later an editorial in the diocesan newspaper,
written by Haney, compared the parishioners' dissent to the ethnic
fighting in Croatia that Pope John Paul II once described as
``historical hatreds.''
	   ``Is not the excluding attitude of the St. Mary's Preservation
Society in rejecting the presence of other ethnic groups in Prince
of Peace Parish a form of hatred,'' he wrote, ``no matter what
pious platitudes are used to mask their reckless bigotry?''

Council expresses astonishment at Iraqi decision, members reaffirm
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with U.S. State Department comment,
quotes from meeting of Iraqi and British ambassadors &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite the unanimous passage of a
resolution demanding Iraq resume cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors, Security Council members are still divided on whether
it authorizes military force to make Iraq comply.
	   Britain and the United States, who have threatened to use force
against Iraq, claimed Thursday's resolution reaffirmed their right
to take such action. Several other council members _ Russia, China
and France among them _ stressed that only the council has the
right to authorize military strikes to maintain peace and security
in the world.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov warned that any attempt to use
unilateral force against Iraq would have ``highly unpredictable and
dangerous consequences'' for Middle East peace and future U.N.
efforts to monitor Baghdad's weapons programs.
	   ``The way to overcome this new crisis lies, we think,
exclusively in political and diplomatic efforts,'' he said.
	   All council members, however, were united in expressing their
astonishment that Iraq would provoke another crisis over arms
inspections a day after the council outlined what it said was a
roadmap to have crippling sanctions lifted.
	   The council last Friday detailed how it would carry out a
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions
_ a move that could heighten momentum to have the 8-year-old oil
embargo lifted. On Saturday, Iraq announced it was severing all
contact with the U.N. Special Commission, which carries out
inspections, blaming the United States for blocking a clearer
indication of when the sanctions could be eased.
	   ``My delegation would simply reiterate that it was flabbergasted
by the decision taken by Iraq,'' Gambia's U.N. ambassador, Ismaila
Jagne, told the council before the vote.
	   ``This constitutes yet another slap in the face, especially at
this time when the Security Council was in the process of
fine-tuning a possible concept for a comprehensive review of
sanctions imposed on Iraq,'' he said.
	   Several Council members suggested that Iraq could have simply
misunderstood their intention to carry out the review and lift
sanctions if Iraq was declared to have destroyed its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors must make that declaration before
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait can be
lifted.
	   On the request of the council, the author of the council's
outline, Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, met with Iraq's ambassador,
Nizar Hamdoon, after the vote to explain the council's offer of a
review was ``genuine'' and that it will begin ``without delay'' as
soon as Iraq resumes full cooperation with weapons inspectors,
Greenstock said.
	   The resolution, adopted 15-0 by the council, puts into
international law the council's statement last Saturday that
condemned Iraq's decision to halt cooperation with inspectors as a
``flagrant violation'' of U.N. resolutions and demanded it be
reversed.
	   While it doesn't threaten any force, the resolution notes past
council resolutions that threatened Iraq with the ``severest
consequences'' if it failed to allow inspectors unfettered access
to suspected weapons sites.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said the resolution's wording ``further confirms our view that this
and previous resolutions do authorize the use of military force if
necessary.''

Arena prepares for coaching debut as United States faces Australia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, California (AP) _ The U.S. soccer team is asking for a
little patience as it plays its first game under coach Bruce Arena,
who plans to experiment with a lot of younger players Friday night
against Australia.
	   The exhibition match will be the first chance for Arena to make
good on a vow to shake up a squad that went 0-3 in the 1998 World
Cup in France.
	   ``It's going to be about getting experience for younger
players,'' defender Eddie Pope said. ``There might be a period
where we lose a lot of games. Hopefully, people will be patient
with us.''
	   Arena replaced Steve Sampson, who resigned in June after the
United States went winless in the World Cup. Arena led Virginia to
five NCAA titles and took D.C. United to championships in 1996 and
1997 in the first two seasons of Major League Soccer. D.C. United
lost in the MLS final this season.
	   The heart of the U.S. team in the '90s _ including players such
as John Harkes, Tab Ramos, Eric Wynalda, Alexi Lalas and Marcelo
Balboa _ is aging, and Arena plans to seek some younger
replacements.
	   ``It's obviously going to be a tough period because there's so
many new players. You need to look at some new players for the
future,'' midfielder Cobi Jones said.
	   Jones said practices have been intense this week at Stanford
under the new coach, but have been about 1 1/2 hours each, as
opposed to the 2 1/2-hour practices under Sampson.
	   ``It's similar to overseas,'' Jones said. ``The intensity is
there, and they're not lasting forever.''
	   Jones and Pope, along with goalkeeper Kasey Keller, were
announced Thursday as finalists for the award for the top U.S.
soccer player. Pope won the award, which will be given out Dec. 14
in Los Angeles, last year.

Palestinian on Israel's most-wanted list claims he is innocent

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Khader Abu Abra is a father of three
boys with a college degree in education. He wears finely tailored
suits and speaks three languages.
	   He is also on Israel's most-wanted list.
	   Israel believes the 40-year-old is a leading figure in a radical
PLO faction and ordered the 1995 killing of two Israeli hikers. If
he isn't arrested by Yasser Arafat's security forces, Israel will
not go ahead with the new Mideast accord and withdraw its troops
from more of the West Bank.
	   Abu Abra's name is on a list of 30 Palestinians Israel wants
arrested over the next three months. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's aides say it's simply a matter of rounding up people
responsible for the deaths of nearly 100 Israelis.
	   But the demand _ which held up implementation of the peace
accord for several days this week _ is not as straightforward as
that.
	   Abu Abra says he is innocent and ended up on the list only
because of unsubstantiated accusations by a Palestinian
acquaintance.
	   Another of the alleged fugitives has been in Israeli custody for
a year, according to Palestinian security officials, and 14 others
have been in the custody of Arafat's security forces all along.
	   Abu Abra is accused of ordering the killing of two Israeli
hikers in 1995 and participating in a grenade attack on an
Israeli-Palestinian joint patrol near Bethlehem in 1996.
	   The only evidence Israel has against him, Abu Abra maintains, is
the testimony of another Palestinian man who was arrested by Israel
soon after the killings and who implicated Abu Abra in exchange for
his own release.
	   ``I am innocent,'' Abu Abra said Thursday, sitting in an office
in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, where he is the director of an
aid group that assists Palestinian children. ``Israel needs to
seriously re-evaluate this list.''
	   Israel has issued several versions of its most-wanted list,
including one roster that contained the names of dead fugitives
such as Hamas bomb-maker Mohyedin Sharif.
	   But the list does not include suspected Hamas bomb-maker
Mohammed Deif, even though Netanyahu has insisted Deif be arrested
as part of the deal.
	   Netanyahu said Thursday he has received guarantees that all the
men on the list would be arrested.
	   ``We received the necessary assurances from the United States
... that the (Palestinian security forces) would arrest all 30,''
Netanyahu said. ``It was also promised to us that there would be no
revolving door'' and the suspects would remain in custody until
they are put on trial.
	   But Wadia Shadid, another man on the list, who sells car parts
in the West Bank city of Tulkarem, says he will shoot anyone who
tries to arrest him. A former member of the Fatah Hawks, a
vigilante group active during the Palestinian uprising, Shadid is
wanted by Israel for killing his uncle in 1993, a suspected
informer for the Israelis.
	   Dalia Kerstein, director of the Israeli human rights group
Hamoked, said the Israeli demand to arrest the 30 men invites the
potential for human rights abuses, including unfair trials, coerced
confessions and abusive treatment while they are in custody.
	   Still, Abu Abra does not conduct his affairs like a man fearful
of arrest. He moves about freely in Bethlehem, where he lives and
works, and until now has not been afraid of being taken into
custody by the Palestinian police.
	   He does not leave the city's Palestinian-controlled areas,
however, and if he wants to see relatives or friends outside the
city, they come to visit him.
	   Abu Abra said he would not resist arrest if it came to that, as
long as he was assured a fair trial and the chance for his family
to have a normal life.
	   ``I cannot even take my son to school because it is in an area
under complete Israeli control,'' Abu Abra said.

King settles complaint but other questions raised
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE SCHNEIDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Boxing promoter Don King settled a
complaint that could have cost him his Florida promoter's license,
but now he's involved in a dispute with a member of the state
agency that governs boxing.
	   In a contentious daylong meeting filled with shouting and
accusations, the Florida State Athletic Commission voted 4-1
Thursday for an agreement that would spare King from having his
promoter's license revoked.
	   Under the consent agreement, King will pay dlrs 2,500 for
administrative costs, and the commission will allow King to apply
for licenses in the future. The agreement specifies that the
payment is not a penalty or fine.
	   ``I'm tired of being beaten and berated with all types of
accusations,'' King told the commissioners. ``I'm not going to be a
whipping boy.''
	   The complaint stemmed from King's failure last January to
acknowledge on his license application that his company, Don King
Productions, was under indictment. The commission's rules prohibit
the granting of licenses to people or businesses facing charges.
	   The promoter was indicted in New York in 1994 on wire fraud
charges. King was acquitted of all nine wire fraud charges in July,
and jurors deadlocked on charges against Don King Productions.
	   The commission's executive director, Mike Scionti, said his
staff overlooked a blank space where King should have filled out
information on any indictments. King had previously given a dlrs
100,000 donation to a foundation started by Scionti.
	   The complaint was brought by Julio Caesar Chavez's attorneys,
who are trying to void a contract between the boxer and King. Mike
Tyson also is suing King to get out of contracts that bind him to
the boxing promoter.
	   Now another commission member, Terry James, is accusing King and
his lawyers of helping Scionti write a proposal recognizing
exclusive boxing contracts in Florida, a move that could help King
in lawsuits against boxers Chavez and Mike Tyson.
	   James asked the commission to fire Scionti, but the commission
refused to take immediate action.
	   ``We need an executive director who takes up the cause of the
commission and not the cause of a boxing promoter who is governed
by (the commission's) decisions,'' James said.
	   During the meeting, Scionti presented drafts of a proposal
supporting exclusive contracts in Florida. Although the commission
has not taken an official position on exclusive contracts, the
commission's former executive secretary interpreted state law to
forbid them in Florida.
	   James showed commissioners that computer footnotes on the bottom
of a draft of Scionti's proposal matched footnotes on a memo from
King's attorney, indicating that the two documents were written in
the same office.
	   Scionti denied that the draft was made in the office of King's
attorney, Sonny Holtzman, but admitted he had consulted him. He
said he didn't know how the notations got on his proposal.
	   ``In this country, we're innocent until proven guilty,'' Scionti
yelled at James. ``If you're attacking my credibility, you present
the facts.''
	   Holtzman later admitted that ``I gave him words. I gave him
paragraphs and there is nothing wrong with that.''
	   Exclusive contracts allows boxers to sign with a promoter for
more than one fight. Opponents have argued that exclusive contracts
exploit young, uneducated boxers whose earning potential are tied
to one promoter. Supporters, such as King, said promoters need to
earn back the money they invest in young boxers.

Foreign Secretary Cook to visit Gulf states
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook is planning a tour of
the Gulf states to lobby for international condemnation of Iraq's
decision to stop cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors, the
Foreign Office said Friday.
	   Cook, Defense Secretary George Robertson and a junior Foreign
Office minister Derek Fatchett are expected to make the visits in
the next two weeks. A Foreign Office spokeswoman, speaking with
customary anonymity, said additional details were not yet
available.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen was in the Gulf this week
seeking support for possible air strikes against Iraq.
	   On Saturday, Iraq banned U.N. weapons inspection teams from
working in the country after the U.N. Security Council refused to
lift economic sanctions. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The Security Council demanded that Iraq reverse its ban on the
inspectors, and warned that lack of compliance could result in
force being used.
	   Calling Iraq's decision a ''flagrant violation'' of its previous
agreement with the United Nations, Cook warned in a British
Broadcasting Corp. interview Thursday of the ''severest
consequences'' if Saddam Hussein doesn't back down.
	   Both the United States and Britain have threatened the use of
force.
	   During the February crisis over weapons inspections, Cook made a
brief visit to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to rally support.

Cabinet approval on Mideast peace agreement may be conditional on
</HEADLINE>
Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ As the Israeli Cabinet prepared to vote
on the latest Mideast peace accord, a new crisis emerged Friday
following a dispute over the controversial Palestinian Charter.
	   The Cabinet discussed the peace agreement for 13 hours Thursday
and was scheduled to reconvene Friday morning, possibly to vote on
the deal. But concerns over the charter, which includes clauses
calling for Israel's destruction, may delay the vote.
	   Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
said the Cabinet would decide Friday whether to condition its
approval of the deal on clarifications from the Palestinians that
the disputed parts of the charter will be canceled.
	   The announcement was another strain on the nascent accord,
signed last month in Washington, which calls for the Israelis to
give territory to the Palestinians in exchange for security
guarantees.
	   The agreement went into effect on Monday but has been delayed by
Israel, which has claimed that the Palestinians have failed to
comply with certain aspects of the agreement.
	   Without Cabinet and parliament approval, Netanyahu has said he
would not implement the agreement.
	   Netanyahu said earlier that if the Palestinians do not annul
sections of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's
destruction, he would not carry out the agreed Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The paragraph in the peace agreement addressing the issue is
vaguely worded, allowing for different interpretations.
	   The agreement says members of the Palestine National Council,
along with those of other Palestinian organizations, will be
invited to a meeting in mid-December. At that time, it will
reaffirm a letter from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to U.S.
President Bill Clinton that concerned the revoking of the offending
clauses.
	   The PLO charter itself says it can only be amended by a
two-thirds vote of the PNC, the Palestinian parliament in exile.
But the agreement does not specifically refer to holding a vote or
a required majority.
	   Israel says the charter must be annulled with a vote by the PNC,
not by affirmation.
	   Ahmed Qureai, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature told
Israel TV ``There will be no such thing as a vote.''
	   But Netanyahu said, ``There will be a vote. And if not, we
simply won't give them the territory,'' he said.
	   It was the second time Israel has accused the Palestinians of
not complying with the agreement.
	   Netanyahu refused to convene his Cabinet for two days because he
said the Palestinians had provided an incomplete plan to round-up
fugitives wanted by Israel in the deaths of 100 Israelis.
	   That issue was resolved early Thursday with the arrival of
American guarantees that they would oversee the arrest of 30
Palestinian men wanted by Israel.
	   Asked whether he would begin the troop pullback on Nov. 16, as
stipulated in the accord, Netanyahu said it was up to the
Palestinians.
	   ``The vote is critical, we are insisting on it, and if they
don't do it, from our point of view, the agreement is not in
force,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others. But he has come under intense
pressure from the powerful lobby representing Jewish settlers in
the West Bank.
	   Settler leaders say they are searching for a candidate to
challenge Netanyahu in the next elections.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region
Thursday to supervise implementation of the agreement, but his trip
was moved back to the weekend, likely because of the delayed
Cabinet vote.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A former top Cali cocaine boss was
killed while watching a soccer game in a prison yard, two years
after he surrendered and began fingering ex-associates.
	   Helmer ``Pacho'' Herrera was shot at least five times Thursday
in the face by a man who gained entry to the Palmira prison outside
Cali by claiming to be a lawyer for another inmate, officials said.
	   Herrera, 47, had been the No. 3 man in the Cali cartel, one of
the world's biggest criminal organizations, and had set up and
managed cocaine distribution rings in major U.S. cities, beginning
in the 1980s.
	   The assailant appeared to be ``an acquaintance of Herrera
because he greeted him first,'' national police spokesman Carlos
Perdomo said.
	   Herrera died on the way to the hospital, emergency room director
Dr. Gustavo Paredes said. Television video showed the body, in
uniform and cleats, on a gurney, the floor beneath soaked in blood.
	   The killer, identified as Rafael Angel Uribe, 32, was beaten by
other inmates before guards took him away. He had entered the
prison a half hour before the attack during a prison soccer match,
national prisons director Carmen Lucia Tristancho said.
	   She said it was unclear whether the murder weapon, a 9mm pistol,
was smuggled into the penitentiary or whether it was already
inside.
	   Herrera surrendered to authorities in September 1996, the last
of seven major cartel members to either turn themselves in or be
arrested.
	   He was convicted of drug trafficking in March and sentenced to
six years and eight months in prison after incriminating at least
20 former associates.
	   Herrera continued to seek sentence reductions, fingering his
wheelchair-bound half-brother from jail. But in September, his
prison term was increased to 14 years and eight months, following
an appeal by prosecutors.
	   When he surrendered, Herrera said he was tired of being on the
run from enemies and thought he would be safer behind bars. Known
as a man with a thousand faces, he had dodged hundreds of police
raids, even dressing up as a woman to elude authorities.
	   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Washington
said investigators believed Herrera had continued to traffic
cocaine from prison and could have been killed by a competitor.
	   The agency's South American operations chief, Ron Lard, said
Herrera had over the years moved many tons of cocaine into the
United States, where he was wanted for trial on murder, drug
trafficking, and money-laundering charges.
	   A decade ago, Herrera played a key role in the Cali cartel's
secret alliance with the government to wipe out the more violent
Medellin drug gang. His lawyer, Gustavo Salazar, said Thursday the
killing could have been related to that rivalry.
	   In the 1980s, Herrera directed cocaine distribution and
money-laundering in the New York City area for the cartel, which at
its peak exported about 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the
United States, according to the DEA.

Grand champion Akebono to sit out sumo tournament

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Hawaii-born yokozuna (grand champion)
Akebono will sit out the upcoming Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament due
to hip pain, the Japan Sumo Association said Friday.
	   Akebono, also known as Chad Rowan, hurt part of his hip during
pre-tournament practice and has skipped workouts for several days,
the association said. He was seeing a doctor Friday morning and had
no immediate comment.
	   Akebono finished the previous tournament in September with 10
wins against five losses. The upcoming tournament at the Fukuoka
Kokusai Center, 899 kilometers (557 miles), southwest of Tokyo,
begins Sunday.
	   Akebono, 29, the first foreign-born wrestler to become a
yokozuna, sat out the same tournament a year ago due to a knee
injury. That was also the last time he missed a tournament.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON _ A political ally says Gen. Augusto Pinochet is
confident that he'll be flying home to Chile soon. But an appeal by
British and Spanish prosecutors asking Britain's highest court to
uphold the former dictator's arrest is dragging on into next week.
	   A human rights lawyer, given special permission by the House of
Lords to testify Thursday at the second day of the appeal hearing,
argued that Britain must not squander this opportunity to hold
Pinochet responsible for alleged human rights abuses during his
17-year regime.
	   This ``is the most important and significant opportunity to
breach that wall of impunity'' that has surrounded the 82-year-old
general, said Ian Brownlie, who represents three human rights
groups, a doctor who was tortured and three sisters of a man who
disappeared.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in a London hospital on an arrest
warrant from a Spanish judge seeking his extradition. The former
dictator is accused of presiding over genocide, torture and
kidnappings committed by his secret police after he seized power in
1973, toppling President Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   But on Oct. 28, the High Court ruled that Pinochet's arrest was
illegal because his status as a former head of state afforded him
immunity from prosecution. The High Court, however, gave
prosecutors permission to immediately appeal the decision to a
five-judge tribunal drawn from the House of Lords.
	   During the first two days of the appeal hearing, lawyers for the
prosecution argued that England's 1978 State Immunity Act, under
which the High Court quashed Pinochet's arrest, should be
superseded by international conventions that Britain has signed.
	   Prosecutors also contended Thursday that Pinochet violated
Chile's 1925 constitution, which remained in force for seven years
after his military coup. Alun Jones, a lawyer representing a
Spanish magistrate, British prosecutors and the Spanish government,
said the Chilean constitution outlawed torture and unlawful arrest
and imprisonment.
	   The hearing was adjourned to Monday, when Pinochet's lawyers
will begin arguing his case.
	   Pablo Longueira, a right-wing Chilean congressman, said Pinochet
had hoped a ruling would have been made already.
	   But ``he is confident that justice will be made and he will be
able to return to Chile,'' Longueira told Radio Agricultura of
Santiago after visiting the former dictator. Pinochet, who
underwent back surgery Oct. 9, remains under police guard in a
north London hospital.
	   In Chile, the government said this week that if Pinochet
returns, he should leave politics and ask for forgiveness. Pinochet
has had immunity from prosecution in Chile as a senator-for-life
and under laws he initiated.

Delaveau and Aurnella speed to first win at National
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ France's Patrice Delaveau led his mare Aurnella
through a graceful, flawless ride to win the dlrs 10,000 Etienne
Aigner Classic on Thursday in the opening competition of the 115th
National Horse Show.
	   The 10-year-old Selle Francais mare went calmly through a course
that had many of the earlier competitors balking at the water jump.
	   Aurnella, Delaveau's speed horse, brought him victory in two
classes at the Washington International Horse Show two weeks ago
and will be his mount for the Budweiser Grand Prix here Sunday.
	   ``She is very beautiful, a very nice mare,'' said fellow French
national team member Philippe Leoni.
	   Delaveau was followed by the USET's Leslie Burr-Howard aboard
Ulane de Plessis and Eric Hasbrouck on Miss Fio. The riders were
competing later in the evening in the dlrs 25,000 KMC Telecom
Welcome Prix.
	   National teams from the United States, Canada and France compete
Friday in the Nations Cup, and the show ends Sunday with the dlrs
50,000 Budweiser Grand Prix of New York.
	   The French team will have to show more of the same speed once
the show is over as they hurry to compete in the Toronto Royal
Agricultural Winter Fair.
	   The Washington, New York and Toronto shows _ three of only four
Nations Cup events held in North America _ are usually held on
succeeding weeks.
	   But the National was moved from its traditional end-of-October
slot to accommodate a Halloween program at Madison Square Garden,
and now conflicts with the first of Toronto's two weeks.
	   The United States and Canada are fielding separate teams for the
two shows. But, even after Toronto organizers pushed their Nations
Cup to the second week of their show, Sweden elected to skip the
National.
	   ``I don't understand why,'' said French national team member
Philippe Rozier, who jetted back to France for a show and won its
Grand Prix between the Washington and New York shows.
	   ``It's no problem _ it's better,'' he said. ``I rode in Toronto
three years ago, and it was 12 days. It's very long for the horses.
It was eight days in Washington, eight days in New York, 12 days in
Toronto. I think it's too much. Now, it's good.''
	   Some of the USET riders at the National, in fact, will ride as
individuals in Toronto. Burr-Howard plans to ride in a midday class
in Toronto on Saturday and fly back to New York for the gambler's
choice event that night.
	   Her horse and its caretakers were arriving in Toronto even as
Burr-Howard rode in her first class at the National on Thursday
night. She planned to join them Saturday morning.
	   ``The jump's not that difficult. Many businessmen do it probably
three or four times a week,'' she said. ``A major storm could
create a problem for me, in which case I'd miss the class, but life
goes on. It shouldn't be a problem.''

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen Friday
morning amid growing speculation interest rates in the United
States could remain unchanged. Japanese stock prices fell on
profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 117.88 yen in late morning trading, up 0.24
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and slightly above its late New
York level of 117.67 yen.
	   The greenback moved higher against the yen after U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that he is ``already
seeing significant signs of some reversals'' in the bond-market
movement that prompted the Fed to cut rates in September and
October.
	   Though many Wall Street analysts expect a modest rate cut
following the Fed's policy committee meeting on Nov. 17,
Greenspan's remarks and recent economic data showing demand for
labors remains strong have generated speculation lower rates may
not be imminent.
	   The dollar also got a boost vis-a-vis European currencies after
Britain's central bank on Thursday cut its official dealing rate by
a greater-than-expected half a percentage point to 6.75 percent.
	   That hurt the British pound because lower rates reduce demand
for a country's currency by making interest-bearing securities less
attractive to investors.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened lower as investors
cashed in on gains made over the past few trading days. Before a
retreat on Thursday, the main stock index had rallied 963.30
points, or 7.1 percent, in two days.
	   As of midday Friday, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average was down 128.43 points, or 0.90 percent, to 14,212.94. It
had shed 186.44 points, or 1.28 percent, the previous day.
	   ``The market is correcting itself after its 900 point rally
earlier this week,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the
stock division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section lost 8.89 points, or 0.80 percent, to 1,095.68. The TOPIX
closed down 2.79 points, or 0.25 percent, on Thursday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.825 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.860 percent,
driving its price up to 108.67 yen from 108.34 yen.

Volunteer target reached by SOCOG
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympic organizers (SOCOG) have
a surplus of people seeking to become volunteers despite polls
showing a flagging public interest in the 2000 games.
	   About 41,000 Australians have formally announced their interest
in becoming general or specialist volunteers at the Olympics and
Paralympics.
	   SOCOG said about 35,000 had shown interest in filling the 25,000
places for general volunteers while another 6,000 were interested
in filling specialist roles.
	   SOCOG still needs a further 19,000 specialists but it has yet to
start its recruitment campaign for those people.
	   ``The bulk of the 25,000 specialist volunteers will be sourced
directly through organizations representing people with specialist
skills such as medical, technical or language skills and sporting
bodies,'' said SOCOG chief executive Sandy Hollway.
	   SOCOG chiefs have shrugged off opinion polls showing a
decreasing interest in the games in the host city. They say the
trend is normal, with great interest at the time of the winning bid
less interest two years out and increasing interest as the games
get closer.
	   Detailed application forms will be sent to everyone who filled
in the registration of interest forms and interviews will be held
early next year.

Researchers map part of the gene pattern for malaria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Researchers have unraveled part of the genetic
pattern of the malaria parasite, an advance that may lead to new
drugs against one of the world's major disease killers.
	   In a study co-authored by 27 scientists at seven different
institutions, researchers report in the journal Science that they
have identified 210 genes in one chromosome of Plasmodium
falciparum, the most deadly form of malaria.
	   A statement from the National Institutes of Health said that the
genetic information will help find new targets for drugs and
identify parts of the malaria parasite that could be used to make
vaccines against the disease.
	   Malaria is a disease caused by a mosquito-borne parasite. It
annually infects more than 300 million people worldwide and kills
about 3 million. Most of the deaths are among children in Africa.
	   Some forms of malaria have become resistant to preventive drugs,
and the disease is becoming an increasingly serious problem in some
parts of the world.

Firing of Lara causes uproar, biggest row in 20 years

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Trying to solve the worst crisis in
Caribbean cricket in 20 years, West Indian and South African
cricket officials went to London in an attempt to mediate a pay
dispute with dissident West Indies players.
	   The disagreement is threatening to wipe out the West Indies'
three-month South African tour, which is scheduled to begin with a
one-day international on Tuesday.
	   The West Indies Cricket Board's decision on Wedneday to dismiss
Brian Lara and Carl Hooper, the captain and vice captain, sparked
public outcries for the board to either resign or be fired.
	   Besides outraged fans calling radio talk shows, the Guardian
newspaper of Trinidad, where Lara is from, called for the Caribbean
Community chairman, Prime Minister Kenneth Anthony of St. Lucia, to
``intervene and mediate in this sordid affair.''
	   Anthony, who was visiting Trinidad and Tobago on Thursday, said
Caribbean leaders have decided to leave the two sides to ``sought
the matter out'' but that Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada,
a former captain of the Windward Islands cricket team, would ``work
with the board and players to arrive at a speedy resolution.''
	   ``What has resulted so far is a bit unfortunate and I hope it
can be resolved in the near future,'' Lara said Thursday. ``The
main thing is that the West Indies tour to South Africa should be
on. The people want the tour to be on and hopefully something
positive will come out of it.
	   ``I am not a member of the West Indies cricket team at the
moment but I would love to be there. My life is playing cricket,
when it is possible you could be there and you are not there
because of circumstances, as is the case, it is very unfortunate.''
	   Only seven of the 16 players selected for the team have flown to
South Africa, and on Thursday they said they wanted to leave.
	   ``The situation is very serious. The players are keen to return
to London this evening,'' said Ali Bacher, managing director of the
United Cricket Board of South Africa.
	   The other nine players are in London, including Lara, Hooper and
former captain Courtney Walsh. After its emergency meeting
Wednesday, the WICB said the players in London who decided to
continue with the tour would be fined between 5 and 10 percent of
their tour fees, which range up to about dlrs 60,000 for Lara.
	   ``Players in London and in South Africa are in solidarity and
are standing firm on the issues,'' the West Indian Players'
Association said in its first public comment Thursday.
	   Secretary Roland Holder said the issue ``is not about fees'' but
about the rights of players and the need for the board to recognize
the association as a bargaining agent for the players.
	   Holder, who spoke at the association's new office in Barbados,
said the board would not accept that Lara and Hooper had traveled
to London as representatives of their union.
	   That view was shared by the National Union of Government and
Federated Workers in Trinidad and Tobago, which charged that,
``Brian Lara, as a union representative, was sacked for going to
London to negotiate terms and conditions of employment for his
members.''
	   Many predicted the players would abandon the tour.
	   ``I think there is every likelihood now that the players will
stand behind Lara and Hooper, in which case it would lead to a
total strike of all top players and you are back to virtually the
Packer affair,'' said Peter Short of Barbados, the WICB's immediate
past chairman.
	   He referred to the last major revolt, in 1978, when then
islanders snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.
	   Clive Lloyd, the manager of this year's team that is to tour
South Africa, captained the renegade team and led the pay revolt 20
years ago.
	   When it was resolved, the West Indians negotiated substantially
better contracts with the board and began a 15-year winning streak
that earned it a reputation as the best team in the world.
	   Today, the West Indians are ranked in the top three.
	   Lloyd, Bacher and West Indies Cricket Board member Joel Garner
were to fly to London Thursday night to try to negotiate with the
players, the South African and West Indian cricket boards announced
in a joint statement.
	   But there was no sign Thursday of the board relenting in what
some consider a personal vendetta against Lara, a record-holding
but controversial batsmen who has walked out on the West Indies
twice in the past.
	   ``Regardless of what happens, there will be no compromise on
this. Lara and Hooper will not be going,'' Guayana Cricket Board
chairman and WICB member Chetram Singh said.
	   Alloy Lequay, president of the Trinidad and Tobago Cricket Board
of Control, suggested the dispute might go all the way to the
courts _ and that the players might win. He recalled that the
English cricketers took their board to court in a pay dispute some
years ago and won.

Chinese first in pairs short program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMLOOPS, British Columbia (AP) _ Top-seeded Xue Shen and Hongbo
Zhao of China, the fourth-ranked pair in the world, were first in
the short program of the Skate Canada competition on Thursday,
ahead of the surprise duo of Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of
Canada.
	   Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov of Russia were third, with
another Canadian pair, national champions Kristy Sargeant and Kris
Wirtz, fourth and Canada's Marie-Claude Savard-Gagnon and Luc
Bradet fifth.
	   Sale, 21, and Pelletier, 23, competed in world championships
with previous partners and had little success.
	   Pelletier and Sale, who competed with other partners in the past
with little success, are being coached by Richard Gauthier and
appear to have the potential to go a long way.
	   ``When David came to me and said he wanted me to help him find a
new partner, I said, `David, there is only one girl I think you
should skate with _ Jamie,''' Gauthier said. ``I knew the chemistry
would be there right away.''
	   They had an immediate setback when Sale needed surgery last
spring for tendinitis. She was sidelined for 2 1/2 months.
	   ``We've been working really, really hard to skate our best here
and make Canada proud,'' she said.
	   They were surprised to be second.
	   ``Kristy and Kris are seventh in the world, which means they are
pretty good _ better than me,'' Pelletier said. ``And I still think
they are better than me.''
	   With no medalists from the world championships in the field,
marks were pegged low. Even at that, Savard-Gagnon and Bradet got
five marks under 5.0 of the possible 6.0, which was harsh
considering they had not fallen or badly botched anything. Skating
first had cost them.
	   ``Without a top-five world pair here, the marks were not going
to get sucked up,'' coach Paul Martini said. ``And there were
certain things that need to be a little better.

Beijing warns WTO to accept China as a member
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China issued a veiled threat to the World Trade
Organization in an state-run newspaper report Friday which warned
the global commerce watchdog risks dealing with a recalcitrant
economic power if China is not allowed to join by the end of 1999.
	   If not admitted to the WTO next year, China will probably make
up its own code of business conduct for the 21st century, said Long
Yongtu, Beijing's top negotiator with the WTO, according to the
official China Daily.
	   Speaking at a seminar on cooperation between China and the
European Union, Long reportedly denied Beijing has put domestic
economic problems ahead of its desire to join the world trade body.
	   Last week, E.U. Vice President Leon Brittan said China had made
little recent headway on WTO membership because it was focusing on
state enterprise reforms, recovering from a summer of damaging
floods and fending off the Asian financial crisis.
	   China wants to become a WTO member before the organization
starts drafting trade rules for the next century, the newspaper
said.
	   Although China is the 10th largest trader in the world in terms
of volume, it has been kept out of the WTO and its proceeding body,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, after more than a
decade of negotiations.
	   Chinese leaders contend that current WTO demands for tariff cuts
and the elimination of non-tariff barriers would cripple its
developing economy.

Report: Indonesia failing to fully utilize foreign trade financing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia has failed to fully utilize
most of the trade financing facilities provided by foreign
countries to prop up its crisis-stricken industries, the state-run
Antara news agency reported Friday.
	   The Southeast Asian country's trade and industry ministry found
that as of last month only 618 million of the dlrs 5.5 billion in
letters of credit guarantees from overseas had been tapped into by
the government, the report said.
	   The financing was offered in response to a request from
Indonesia to ease a credit crunch resulting from international
banks' refusal to honor locally issued letters of credit due to a
lack of confidence in Indonesian lenders.
	   The report blamed the underutilization of the financing on
various regulatory burdens on local banks and Indonesian bankers'
inexperience.
	   It recommended that joint venture banks be encouraged to use
their expertise in international transactions to help Indonesia
take advantage of the financing and help it overcome the worst
recession in 30 years.
	   Countries which have pledged trade loans to Indonesia include
Australia, Canada, Japan, the U.S., Germany and the Netherlands, it
said.

	   BOSTON (AP) _ Dmitri Khristich scored his 200th career goal and
Sergei Samsonov added a goal and two assists as the Boston Bruins
beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-1 Thursday night.
	   The Bruins won for only the second time in their last eight
games. They had scored a total of three goals in their previous
three games.
	   Boston goalie Byron Dafoe lost his shutout at 3:45 of the third
period when Derek King scored from the right slot on a power play.
Dafoe finished with 34 saves.
 &UR; Penguins 4, Senators 2
	   In Kanata, Ontario, Jan Hrdina scored the tiebreaking goal with
4:06 left in the third period as the Pittsburgh Penguins beat the
Ottawa Senators.
	   Martin Straka, Jaromir Jagr and Robert Lang also scored for the
Penguins, who fell behind 2-0 in the first period before scoring
four straight goals.
	   It was the 100th career victory for Penguins coach Kevin
Constantine.
	   Chris Phillips and Vaclav Prospal scored for the Senators, who
lost for only the second time in 68 games when leading after two
periods.
 &UR; Hurricanes 6, Islanders 3
	   In Uniondale, New York, the Carolina Hurricanes scored six
straight goals, including two by Jeff O'Neill, to overcome a
three-goal deficit and beat the New York Islanders.
	   O'Neill, Martin Gelinas and Kent Manderville scored in a 3:20
span of the third period to help goalie Trevor Kidd get his first
win this season. Kidd made 16 saves in his fourth start of the
year.
	   Curtis Leschyshyn and Paul Ranheim also scored for the
Hurricanes.
	   The Islanders took a 3-0 lead in the first period on goals by
Eric Brewer, Mike Watt and Kenny Jonsson before the Hurricanes
rallied.

Stojko leads men's competition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's short program &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMLOOPS, British Columbia (AP) _ Elvis Stojko took a big leap
down the comeback trail Thursday night by grabbing first place in
the men's short program in Skate Canada.
	   ``It felt really good,'' the three-time world champ from Canada
said of his 2 1/2-minute performance to Japanese taiko drums.
``It's coming together.
	   ``It's great to be back.''
	   Russian teen Evgeny Plushenko was second. The free-skating final
is Saturday night.
	   This is Stojko's second competition since winning silver in the
Olympic Winter Games at Nagano, Japan last February, when he
competed despite a painful groin injury. Stojko, 26, eased back
into action with a fourth-place finish in Skate America last week
at Detroit.
	   Evgeny Pliuta of Ukraine was third.
	   Stojko landed a triple Axel-triple toe loop jump combination,
hit a triple Lutz and displayed the best spins in the field of 11.
He omitted the quad attempt on which he fell last week at Detroit.
	   Plushenko also did a triple-triple combo, and baled out of a
planned quad after three revolutions.
	   Earlier, top-seeded Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao of China, the
fourth-ranked pair in the world, were first in the short program,
ahead of the surprise duo of Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of
Canada.
	   Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov of Russia were third, with
another Canadian pair, national champions Kristy Sargeant and Kris
Wirtz, fourth and Canada's Marie-Claude Savard-Gagnon and Luc
Bradet fifth.
	   Sale, 21, and Pelletier, 23, competed in world championships
with previous partners and had little success.
	   Pelletier and Sale, who competed with other partners in the past
with little success, are being coached by Richard Gauthier and
appear to have the potential to go a long way.
	   ``When David came to me and said he wanted me to help him find a
new partner, I said, `David, there is only one girl I think you
should skate with _ Jamie,''' Gauthier said. ``I knew the chemistry
would be there right away.''
	   They had an immediate setback when Sale needed surgery last
spring for tendinitis. She was sidelined for 2 1/2 months.
	   ``We've been working really, really hard to skate our best here
and make Canada proud,'' she said.
	   They were surprised to be second.
	   ``Kristy and Kris are seventh in the world, which means they are
pretty good _ better than me,'' Pelletier said. ``And I still think
they are better than me.''
	   With no medalists from the world championships in the field,
marks were pegged low. Even at that, Savard-Gagnon and Bradet got
five marks under 5.0 of the possible 6.0, which was harsh
considering they had not fallen or badly botched anything. Skating
first had cost them.
	   ``Without a top-five world pair here, the marks were not going
to get sucked up,'' coach Paul Martini said. ``And there were
certain things that need to be a little better.

Delaveau and Aurnella speed to first victory in National
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results of KMC Telecom Welcome Prix &QL; 
 &UR; By MARGARET LILLARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ France's Patrice Delaveau led his mare Aurnella
through a graceful, flawless ride to win the dlrs 10,000 Etienne
Aigner Classic on Thursday in the opening competition of the 115th
National Horse Show.
	   The 10-year-old Selle Francais mare went calmly through a course
that had many of the earlier competitors balking at the water jump.
	   Aurnella, Delaveau's speed horse, brought him victory in two
classes in the Washington International Horse Show two weeks ago
and will be his mount for the Budweiser Grand Prix here Sunday.
	   ``She is very beautiful, a very nice mare,'' said fellow French
national team member Philippe Leoni.
	   Delaveau was followed by the USET's Leslie Burr-Howard aboard
Ulane de Plessis and Eric Hasbrouck on Miss Fio.
	   Jan Tops, the Dutch husband of Canadian team member Tani
Tops-Zeidler, rode Operette La Silla to win the evening's final
event, the dlrs 25,000 KMC Telecom Welcome Prix. Independent
American rider Debbie Stephens and Orfebre finished second,
followed by Canada's Beth Underhill.
	   National teams from the United States, Canada and France compete
Friday in the Nations Cup, and the show ends Sunday with the dlrs
50,000 Budweiser Grand Prix of New York.
	   The French team will have to show more of the same speed once
the show is over as they hurry to compete in the Toronto Royal
Agricultural Winter Fair.
	   The Washington, New York and Toronto shows _ three of only four
Nations Cup events in North America _ are usually held on
succeeding weeks.
	   But the National was moved from its traditional end-of-October
slot to accommodate a Halloween program at Madison Square Garden,
and now conflicts with the first of Toronto's two weeks.
	   The United States and Canada are fielding separate teams for the
two shows. But, even after Toronto organizers pushed their Nations
Cup to the second week of their show, Sweden elected to skip the
National.
	   ``I don't understand why,'' said French national team member
Philippe Rozier, who jetted back to France for a show and won its
Grand Prix between the Washington and New York shows.
	   ``It's no problem _ it's better,'' he said. ``I rode in Toronto
three years ago, and it was 12 days. It's very long for the horses.
It was eight days in Washington, eight days in New York, 12 days in
Toronto. I think it's too much. Now, it's good.''
	   Some of the USET riders at the National, in fact, will ride as
individuals in Toronto. Burr-Howard plans to ride in a midday class
in Toronto on Saturday and fly back to New York for the gambler's
choice event that night.
	   Her horse and its caretakers were arriving in Toronto even as
Burr-Howard rode in her first class in the National on Thursday
night. She planned to join them Saturday morning.
	   ``The jump's not that difficult. Many businessmen do it probably
three or four times a week,'' she said. ``A major storm could
create a problem for me, in which case I'd miss the class, but life
goes on. It shouldn't be a problem.''

Aid to Central America grows; residents try to cope with disaster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Survivors of Hurricane Mitch, which
has killed more than 10,000 according to official estimates, face
starvation and disease as aid workers struggle to reach them.
	   Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured Thursday into
Central America, where Hurricane Mitch destroyed scores of
communities before moving northwest off the Honduran coast for
several days last week. It crossed southern Florida on Thursday,
damaging mobile homes and buildings and injuring at least seven
people before dying in the Atlantic.
	   More than 6,500 are listed as missing in Central America, where
damaged roads and bridges greatly reduced the flow of aid to
hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle _ only as much as can
be dropped from a helicopter when they can get through.
	   In the Aguan River Valley in northern Honduras, flood waters
have receded, leaving a carpet of mud over hundreds of acres. In
many nearby villages, residents have gone days without clean water
or food. In the village of Olvido, a 7-month-old baby died after
going three days without food.
	   ``The worst thing, the saddest thing, are the children. The
children are suffering, even dying,'' said Olvido parish priest
Cecilio Escobar Gallindo.
	   At normally quiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of
Tegucigalpa a score of cargo aircraft land, delivering aid from
Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina.
	   Also Thursday, President Bill Clinton requested a ``global
relief effort'' to help Central America and issued orders boosting
U.S. emergency aid to dlrs 70 million.
	   Next week, a U.S. delegation led by Tipper Gore, wife of Vice
President Al Gore, will deliver some of the supplies destined for
Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
	   Mrs. Gore will be in Central America on Tuesday and Wednesday,
accompanied by Brian Atwood, head of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, and several members of Congress.
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton also added Nicaragua and
Honduras to a trip she plans to the region beginning Nov. 16. She
will be in Haiti and Dominican Republic for visits canceled in
October because of Hurricane Georges.
	   Mexico announced that it will increase food aid to the region
from 700,000 to 1.3 million tons, in addition to providing 11 tons
of medicine, 12 helicopters, four cargo planes and 475 soldiers to
help in relief operations.
	   On the Choluteca River in Tegucigalpa, a Mexican military rescue
squad pored over a 200-foot (61-meter) rock avalanche with search
dogs, looking for victims buried when dozens of homes disappeared a
week ago. Neighbors heard screams that night, but on Thursday,
residents said, the rescuers recovered no one.
	   ``From here, we'll continue searching downriver,'' where dozens
more remain missing, said Honduran army Maj. Freddy Diaz.
	   Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston took a helicopter tour of
Tegucigalpa to survey storm damage Thursday.
	   The Honduran government, citing better information from the
ravaged countryside, lowered its confirmed death toll to 6,076,
down from an estimated 7,000 earlier in the week.
	   The number of missing also dropped from an estimated 11,000 to
4,621, according to Government Minister Delmer Urbizo. ``Until now,
we have had a short amount of time and few resources to get
reliable information,'' he said. Some 569,000 Hondurans lost their
homes, he said.
	   In neighboring Nicaragua, the estimated death toll increased to
4,000 from 2,400. The bodies of victims from a massive mudslide on
the flanks of the Casitas Volcano have been turning up in fields,
along rivers and shorelines, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman
said. About half the nation's deaths occured in that mudslide.
	   ``More than 200 victims appeared yesterday along the shore and
fishermen in the area between Leon and Chinandega tell us that the
stench along the ocean shore is unbearable,'' Aleman said in an
interview with the Mexican television network Televisa.
	   Attention has also focused the flood-ravaged region along the
Nicaragua-Honduras border. Bad weather forced a U.S. Blackhawk
helicopter from reaching towns on Nicaragua's northern border
Thursday.
	   Towns along the Rio Coco in that area were reportedly wiped out
by flooding last week.
	   El Salvador reported 239 dead, and Guatemala said 194 of its
people were killed. Six people died in southern Mexico and seven in
Costa Rica.
	   In crowded Honduran shelters and slums, health workers began a
vaccination campaign Thursday. President Carlos Flores Facusse said
the storm's fury set Honduras back 50 years.
	   The United States committed 19 helicopters, two C-27 aircraft
and one C-130 cargo plane to help beef up relief efforts. France
said it was sending 250 rescue workers, along with a ship loaded
with construction material and equipment.
	   The U.N. World Food Program announced it was diverting ships to
rush their cargoes of donated food to Central America and was
pulling food from warehouses at its base in Rome for delivery by
emergency relief flights.
	   In Tegucigalpa, 37-year-old Jose Vasquez hoisted a 100-pound
(45-kilo) sack of gravel onto his shoulders _ the same stuff that
days ago destroyed his riverside home _ and leaned forward for the
staggering trek uphill.
	   Trying to salvage something from his personal disaster, Vasquez
was paid dlrs 6 a day filling sacks of the flood-driven gravel that
swept through his neighborhood and delivering them to construction
firms. Never mind that his possessions lay somewhere deep below, or
that a woman's body had been found buried nearby.
	   ``To move ahead, we have to do this,'' he said. ``You have to
make a living.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Defense attorneys for Malaysia's
ousted deputy prime minister on Friday obtained a crucial police
report which they believe could help prove the existence of a
government conspiracy against their client.
	   Prosecutors agreed to hand over the 1997 police document during
the fifth day of a sensational corruption and sexual misconduct
trial of Anwar Ibrahim, the Southeast Asian country's former No. 2
leader.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked his former deputy prime
minister on Sept. 2, saying Anwar was morally unfit to lead.
	   Anwar was later charged with 10 counts of corruption and sexual
misconduct. He denies the allegations, saying they were fabricated
to discredit him and a campaign to end Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   The defense has said the police report may provide evidence that
Mahathir's chief economic adviser, Daim Zainuddin, plotted with the
sister of Anwar's secretary to prove the former deputy premier had
engaged in illegal sex acts.
	   ``This report is absolutely crucial,'' said Pawancheek Marican,
one of Anwar's nine defense attorneys.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul praised the prosecution for
relinquishing the report without a fuss.
	   ``In the interest of justice, we have no objection'' replied
chief prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail.
	   The report includes a pair of statements from witnesses about
the sexual misconduct allegations. One was made by the sister of
Anwar's private secretary, Ummi Hafilda Ali, who said her brother's
wife had sex with Anwar.
	   The other is from Anwar's personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, who
said Anwar sodomized him 15 times.
	   On Thursday, the defense asked prosecution witness Mohamed Said
Awang, chief of Malaysia's intelligence unit, whether the report
implied a conspiracy against Anwar. Mohamed's testimony appeared to
confirm suspicions that the statements were politically motivated.
	   Mohamed testified on Wednesday that Anwar forced police to cover
up his alleged sexual misconduct by demanding that intelligence
officers get retractions from both Ummi and Azizan.
	   Mohamed said he had agreed to get the retractions despite
believing the allegations against Anwar were true.
	   The case has attracted international attention after Anwar
showed up at his arraignment with a black eye and bruises. He
claimed police beat him after his arrest.
	   Dozens of diplomats, international human rights and jurist
groups have been in attendance at the trial, which was expected to
last well into next year.
	   The first four corruption charges will be heard before the trial
adjourns Nov. 14, when Malaysia will play host to 20 world leaders
in the capital for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
When the legal proceedings resume, the fifth abuse of power charge
and the five sex charges will be heard.
	   Since Anwar's arrest on Sept. 20, thousands of Malaysians have
participated in street protests demanding his release and
Mahathir's resignation. A protest two weeks ago turned ugly when
police fired tear gas at stone-pelting demonstrators.
	   Though the demonstrations have died down, Anwar supporters say
they are regrouping and vow to hold more anti-government protests.

Report: China's AIDS, HIV cases could hit one million by 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The number of Chinese infected with the virus
that causes AIDS could reach one million by 2000 unless more
effective action is taken to prevent the disease from spreading in
China, the state-run China Daily reported Friday.
	   The number of Chinese infected with HIV may be as high as
300,000 and is increasing rapidly, the newspaper said.
	   Officially, China's Health Ministry had confirmed only 11,170
carriers of HIV nationwide as of September, a 4.6 percent increase
from the number of confirmed cases as of June, the report said.
	   Of that number, 338 had developed AIDS and 184 had died, it
said.
	   But officials statistics are widely believed to vastly
understate the extent of the problem in China.
	   The government plans to announce a new program soon designed to
stem the rise in cases of AIDS and other sexually transmitted
diseases, the report said.
	   It hopes to keep the number of people found to be HIV positive
to less than 1.5 million by 2010.

U.S. remains from North Korea returned

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ Skeletal remains believed to be those of
nine U.S. servicemen killed during the Korean War were returned
from North Korea on Friday.
	   American and other U.N. officers saluted as the aluminum caskets
changed hands in this border village inside the demilitarized zone
that separates the two Koreas.
	   Friday's transfer marked the largest number of remains to be
recovered from any single search operation.
	   The remains were unearthed by a joint U.S.-North Korean team
operating along the Chongchon River, about 160 kilometers (100
miles) north of the North Koran capital Pyongyang, during the past
three weeks.
	   North Korea began repatriating American remains in 1990. In
1996, it began allowing U.S. forensic experts to search for remains
in its territory, assisted by North Korean officials.
	   The joint operations have led to the recovery of what are
believed to be the remains of 27 soldiers. One has been identified
so far. Work on several others is progressing.
	   The effort is part of an attempt to discover the fate of the
8,100 servicemen still missing from the Korean War. Besides those
missing, more than 50,000 American soldiers were killed in the
conflict, which lasted from 1950-53.
	   All told, about 240 sets of remains have been repatriated by
North Korea, but fewer than a dozen have been positively
identified.
	   The recovery of remains of American war dead is a key U.S.
demand for improving relations with North Korea.
	   No peace treaty was ever signed to end the war, and the Korean
Peninsula remains one of the most heavily armed areas in the world.

Singapore approves the sale of anti-impotence drug Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore has approved the sale of the
anti-impotence drug Viagra for an initial evaluation period of six
months, the country's health ministry said Friday.
	   After months of trials, the government has ``decided to take a
cautious approach towards its introduction'' of the little blue
pills because of reported deaths associated with use of the drug in
the United States, the Ministry of Health said in a statement.
	   The impotence remedy will only be available by prescription in
Singapore and doctors are required to report any adverse reactions
by patients to the health ministry.
	   Singapore will also require the U.S. pharmaceutical company
which makes the drug, New York-based Pfizer Inc., to submit monthly
reports on the amount of Viagra it supplies to the island republic.
	   ``The ministry will monitor the supply of Viagra to deter
excessive utilization and abuse,'' the statement said.
	   The permit allowing sales of Viagra will be reviewed at the end
of the six-month period.
	   Demand for the drug prior to government approval led to the
creation of a thriving black market for Viagra pills smuggled into
the country from overseas.

Australia, New Zealand expect tough APEC debate on free trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Citing Japanese resistance to further
reductions in trade barriers in some industries, Australia and New
Zealand are predicting a tough round of talks at the upcoming Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting.
	   Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer said Friday the free trade
debate at the APEC meetings in Kuala Lumpur would be
``challenging'' and ``cantankerous.'' Senior New Zealand officials
said bargaining to reach agreement on key trade liberalization
issues would ``go to the wire.''
	   Leaders from 20 Pacific rim countries and Hong Kong, including
U.S. President Bill Clinton, will attend the APEC forum meetings in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from Nov. 17.
	   Firm advocates of free trade, the Australasian nations will urge
APEC leaders not to retreat from the forum's broad or detailed free
trade goals.
	   APEC is aiming for free trade between its developed members by
2010 and full free trade by 2020.
	   Forum members have also agreed to fast track progress towards
free trade in chemicals, energy, fishing, forestry products, gems
and jewelry, medical equipment and instruments and establishing
mutual recognition arrangements in telecommunications and toys.
	   The Australian government has said that while some adjustments
to APEC's free trade targets may be needed because of the Asian
financial crisis, the region still had much to gain from continued
trade liberalization.
	   Japan has balked at speeding up the reduction of its trade
barriers in the fisheries and forestry industries, the sectors it
sees as most vulnerable to foreign competition.
	   In top-level meetings Thursday, Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura told Australia that Japan was unwilling to make
concessions in those industries.
	   Some other Asian countries have also expressed doubts about the
free trade pact, which would lift trade barriers and lower tariffs
for some Australian dollars 1.5 trillion (U.S. dlrs 945,000
million) worth of goods and services in APEC countries.
	   Before the onset of the Asian economic crisis, APEC meetings
were marked by the development of broad consensus and cooperation
among participating governments.
	   Australia indicated Friday the happy days may be over.
	   ``Its going to be a challenging, cantankerous meeting of APEC, I
would predict,'' Fischer said Friday. ``But I don't give up easily,
nor do my supporters.''
	   In an official briefing, a senior official of the New Zealand
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Japan posed the most
serious threat to agreement on free trade.
	   ``Japan is probably the most serious problem in the overall
outcome of the negotiations,'' the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``It is going to go to the wire.''
	   A spokesman for Komura said criticism of Japan's trade policies
was unfair.

Killer whale attacks: a return to the natural order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The end of commercial whaling in the
Southern and South Pacific oceans produced big increases in the
population of some species, but it also has led to more reports of
gruesome attacks by killer whales, scientists say.
	   Evidence of attacks by marauding groups of killer whales on pods
of humpback whales, including one that had half of its tail fluke
torn off, has been recorded by National Parks and Wildlife Service
officers working on Australia's east coast.
	   Rangers also found chunks of blubber washed up on beaches on the
north coast of New South Wales state that they believe are the
remains of whales killed in attacks by predators.
	   Last month, a boatload of tourists was horrified as it watched
killer whales stalk a pod of humpback whales, chase down a newborn
calf and eat it in waters near Stradbroke Island off the coast of
Queensland state.
	   Prof. Michael Bryden, head of Sydney University's Department of
Veterinary Anatomy, said Friday that attacks by killer whales, also
known as orcas, on other whales were uncommon but not unknown
before commercial whaling ended in the 1950s.
	   Measuring an average of 20 feet (6 meters), peg-toothed orcas
are opportunistic feeders that hunt in packs and feast on seals,
penguins, birds and other warm-blooded sea creatures, including
other whales, he said in an interview
	   They are often smaller than the whales they attack, such as
humpbacks, the krill-eating giants that grow up to 55 feet (17
meters) long. A few years ago, a pack of orcas was even seen
attacking a blue whale, the world's largest creature, off the
California coast, Bryden said.
	   ``They are smart, a bit like some of the big cats. They hunt
cooperatively. One will attack from the front while the other goes
around the back. They are cunning the way they operate. They work
as a pack, like wolves,'' Bryden said.
	   Such attacks may be increasing because there are so many more
humpback targets available in the oceans now that its food chain is
returning to normal, he said.
	   ``The humpback whale population has increased very significantly
in the last 20 years, and the orca attacks are probably indicative
of that, rather than a shortage of other food supplies,'' Bryden
said.
	   David Paton, a regional manager from the wildlife service in
northern New South Wales, said rangers studying humpback whale
migrations noticed that pods of killer whales were becoming more
common.
	   ``We are noticing large numbers of humpbacks have marks which
indicate attacks by orcas,'' Paton said. ``It appears they are up
here looking for easy prey such as young or sick.''
	   Slow swimmers, humpback whales were once easy targets for
whalers, and in the southern oceans they were almost hunted to
extinction, from an estimated 20,000 when hunting began to just 300
when it ended in the early 1950s. Hunting stopped not because of
the need for protection of the species, but because it became
unprofitable to search for the animals.
	   Left alone by hunters, the humpback population began to recover
almost immediately. Research that began in the 1980s shows that the
population is increasing by about 10 percent a year. They now
number about 3,000, Bryden said.
	   Other species such as the southern right whale have also
increased since whaling ended, and since the Southern and Indian
Oceans became whale sanctuaries.
	   Orcas were never targeted by commercial whalers because other
species were slower, easier to catch and contained more blubber.
	   In an annual migration, humpback whales travel from Antarctic
waters around July to the warmer more protected waters along the
northeast coast of Australia to breed before returning to the
Southern Ocean in about November, Bryden said.
	   They travel close to Australia's east coast. Unlike some other
species, they rarely become beached, Bryden said.
	   Recent beachings by pilot whales on Australian and New Zealand
coasts remain unexplained. Bryden said it may be because pilot
whales can become confused when swimming close to the shore and
have problems navigating.
	   Humpback whales do not appear to ever have this problem.

Food poisoning strikes 260 at funeral banquet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ More than 260 people who attended a funeral
banquet in northwestern Shanxi province were stricken by severe
food poisoning, the official newspaper China Daily reported Friday.
	   Of the 262 people hospitalized, four remained in serious
condition following the poisoning, which occurred Sunday in
Baishui, a rural county northwest of the provincial capital, Xi'an,
the report said.
	   It said the restaurant that had served the banquet had been
closed down and police and health officials were investigating the
cause of the poisoning.
	   State media reported Thursday that 83 people died and more than
3,000 were stricken by food poisoning between January and October.
More than half of the cases occurred at school cafeterias.
	   According to official reports, dysentery and hepatitis _ often
spread by unsanitary food and beverages _ are the two leading
causes of infectious disease in China.
	   Health officials have urged restaurants and other facilities
serving food to improve hygiene and take stricter precautions to
prevent further outbreaks.
