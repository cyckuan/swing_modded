<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. software giant Microsoft
Corp. invests 600 million Canadian dollars (about 408 million U.S.
dollars) into Canada's largest cable television company Rogers
Communication Inc..
</P>
<P>
The two sides have signed a series of agreements on the
development of television into a two-way appliance to communicate,
conduct E-commerce and watch television programs and movies.
</P>
<P>
Rogers, which has about 2.3 million cable customers, is
expecting a phased roll-out next year, as it has already licensed
Microsoft to support at least 1 million "set-top boxes," according
to business reports published here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The "box," which will be the biggest change for consumers, is a
small but powerful computer that will allow the user to record
shows, use the Internet and allow old analog televisions to
receive digital broadcasting signals.
</P>
<P>
Ted Rogers, chief executive officer of Rogers, was quoted as
saying, "We intend to ally ourselves with the best, most
knowledgeable people in the world so that we can build the finest
systems here in Canada."

<HEADLINE> American Trio Case Postponed Again in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The trial of three Americans
arrested in March in the Zimbabwean capital on suspicion of
carrying dangerous weapons was postponed Tuesday for the second
time by the High Court to July 19 to give the state time to
prepare its case.
</P>
<P>
The case had been postponed from Monday to Tuesday because the
prosecutor handling it was ill.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Attorney General Andrew Chigovera told Justice George
Smith that the case should be postponed for at least two weeks as
the state needed to get a new prosecutor to study the case.
</P>
<P>
Justice Smith, however, agreed with the defence led by Advocate
Chris Anderson that the time of two weeks was too long considering
the suffering faced by the accused at one time in prison.
</P>
<P>
Chigovera argued that one week was too short because the state
needed time to establish whether the three were carrying out
genuine missionary work in the Democratic Republic of Congo where
arms were discovered in the house they were staying.
</P>
<P>
He also said if the state had to get a new prosecutor, the
prosecutor would need time to study evidence from at least 20
witnesses and would also go through evidence from pictures, videos
and films.
</P>
<P>
Chigovera said the case had attracted international attention
that its outcome would reflect against the Zimbabwean judiciary
system if it was not properly handled.
</P>
<P>
The three Americans, George Blanchard (35), Joseph Pettijohn
(34) and John Dixon (35), were arrested on March 8 at the Harare
International Airport after they were allegedly found in
possession of a large assortment of arms of war, including
automatic rifles and ammunition.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Vice-President John Atta
Mills Tuesday called on prospective investors not to think only of
their private gains but also the overall interest of the society.
</P>
<P>
"They (Investors) should have in mind what they can put back
into the society in the form of improving the existing conditions
of health, education, social services and sustainable employment
opportunities," Ghana News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mills cautioned against "unnecessary competition and
confrontation among investors, especially between new investors
and existing ones.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president was opening a two-day Trade and Investment
 Conference for the Western Region at Takoradi, which is aimed at
exposing investment potentials to new areas.
</P>
<P>
The conference is on the theme: "The Western Region - the key
to Ghana' s economic development in the 21st Century ".
</P>
<P>
Mills urged the conference, being attended by business
representatives from the private and public sectors and policy
planners to focus on human- centered strategies rather than only
promoting private motives.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Ghana's determination to do all that is necessary
 to enable investors to take advantage of the vast potential
resources of the Western Region.
</P>
<P>
In line with this, said the vice-president, the government had
launched a study with the World Bank to design a strategy for the
development of the region in the context of the national project
for accelerated growth.
</P>
<P>
The government is intensifying its role as a facilitator and
creator of a conducive environment to boost the private sector
through a suitable policy framework and the provision of
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He identified a number of problems such as the lack of social
 infrastructure like roads, utilities and inadequate educational
and health facilities and said strenuous efforts were underway to
address them.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the need to further develop the infrastructural
base, there is the need for the development of complementary
activities and services to assist the envisaged investment, he
said.

<P>
KHARTOUM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Sudan and Britain will exchange
their accredited ambassadors in the coming few days as a result of
the detente of bilateral ties, a Sudanese official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese-U.K. relations underwent their lowest ebb due to
Britain's siding with the United States in its air strikes on a
Sudanese medical plant last August.
</P>
<P>
The detente came following diplomatic shuttle moves that
clarified the facts about Sudan, the Sudanese News Agency quoted
Minister of State with the Foreign Ministry Archbishop Kebrial as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Kebrial also mentioned the breakthrough in the
Sudanese-Egyptian relations after the current Sudanese government
came to power.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Sudan and Egypt were extremely tense
after an abortive attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
life in Addis Ababa in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese officials noted that intensive efforts are being
made by the two sides to solve the problems between the two
countries. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Among the major problems are security, the border dispute on
Halayb and the return of Egypt's properties in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Population Council Committed to Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's National Population
Council (NPC) said Tuesday that women empowerment, girl-child
education and unsafe abortion would be the core of its program for
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
These, according to NPC, form part of the world population
agenda formulated by the International Conference for Population
and Development for the 21st Century, the Ghana News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Accra, capital of Ghana,
Richard Turkson, executive secretary of NPC, said these could be
achieved through strengthening linkages with government
institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to
intensify public education.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the Council's strategies, Turkson said partnerships
with the public sector, donor agencies and NGOs have already
produced a number of important policy guidelines for population
control.
</P>
<P>
They include the medium-term health strategy, national
reproductive health policy, draft national adolescent
reproductive health and national communication strategy.
</P>
<P>
Turkson said there has been significant progress in
implementing these policies which is demonstrated in the
enactment by parliament of the Children's Bill.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, there has been a sharp decline in fertility rates
from 6.5 children per woman in 1960 to 4.5 in 1998, while the use
of modern contraceptives has improved from five percent in 1981
to 13 percent as of now.
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, the successful implementation of the
revised national population policy leading to further reduction
in fertility and an improved quality of life would depend on
massive attitudinal and behavioral change.
</P>
<P>
"This, of course, cannot, in the nature of things, happen
overnight but determined efforts are being made to lay a firm
foundation now," he said.

ATHENS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen Tuesday said in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki that
Washington intended to set up a commercial bureau in the city with
the aim of participating in the Balkan reconstruction effort.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his Greek counterpart, Akis
Tsohatzopoulos, Cohen, who arrived Tuesday afternoon for an
official two-day visit, praised Greece for the indispensable role
Athens has played in the pacification of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the northern Greek city would
play a major part in the reconstruction of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) leaders decided last month to base its
agency for the reconstruction of the Balkans in Thessaloniki, the
largest city in northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
Tsohazopoulos described Cohen's visit as "political" as it
coincided with the selection of Thessaloniki as the headquarters
of the Balkan reconstruction agency, and with the relevant efforts
of the EU and the United States.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two ministers discussed the common
effort for the stabilization of the Balkan region, the situation
in the Middle East and the Mediterranean, bilateral cooperation in
tackling terrorism and the modernization of the Greek armed
forces.

On Wednesday, Cohen will meet in Athens with Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis and Foreign Minister George Papandreou.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Warns Against Unrest in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Tuesday warned that his government will seriously deal with any
riot against the country's interests and government's policies.
</P>
<P>
"Any riot is against the interest of the Islamic system and the
nation as well as the government's slogans and policies," Khatami
told the state-run television after an extraordinary meeting of
the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).
</P>
<P>
However, he said that his government is committed to peaceful
behavior and avoiding violence and is trying to deal as
peacefully as possible with the current violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's warning came as more clashes erupted between Iranian
anti-riot police and several thousand demonstrators protesting the
recent police crackdown on the Tehran University students on
Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), several
groups of people staged sporadic and unorganized rallies at
various spots in Tehran Tuesday, the 6th day of student protests
to the police crackdown.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of the SNSC's ban on illegal gatherings, several
groups of masked demonstrators armed with clubs and stones clashed
with rival groups that held other types of make-shift weapons,
IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The student protests have turned to be the worst unrest in Iran
since the Islamic revolution in 1979, arousing concerns of Iranian
leaders about possible uprising against the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami stressed that his government is against any
violence and is serious about security for the country and the
people.
</P>
<P>
Expressing apology to the Iranian nation for the unrest during
the past six days, he called on the Iranian people to distance
themselves from the unrest and to give a free hand to the
government to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
Terming the police assault on student's hostels as "
extraordinarily bitter," the Iranian reformist president promised
to seriously follow up the case.
</P>
<P>
A committee formed by protesting students on Tuesday night
also denounced the unrest in the country and stated that the
students will suspend their protests until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The students will never confirm sabotage and riot in any
forms," the committee said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee restated the students' demand calling
for dismissal of the Iranian police chief Brigadier General
Hedayat Lotfian.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded the transfer of the police commanding
authorities to the Interior Ministry and dismissal of hard-liners
from the police.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights High on OAU Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report, presented to the three-day OAU summit, was concluded
by the OAU experts and adopted by Council of Ministers during the
70th ordinary session which met on July 6-10 here in Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Though some "tangible results" have been witnessed in human
rights protection, the report said, more efforts must be made in
order to reach the final objective.
</P>
<P>
The enhancement of democratic values in Africa through the
choice of governments as well as freedom of the press are two
evidences of the human rights protection in Africa, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, more efforts should be exerted for the struggle against
poverty in addition to resolving internal conflicts peacefully, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the role of the non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) in defending human rights cases, experts also paid a great
deal of attention to women, children and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the necessary means likely to help in the struggle
against human rights violations, the report highlighted that at
least 15 states have not ratified the African charter on the
rights of children.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, human rights violations in Africa are
mainly due to racism, post-colonialism, different forms of
slavery, poverty, ignorance, diseases, religious intolerance,
internal conflicts, debt, bad management and corruption.
</P>
<P>
The monopoly of power, the lack of judicial and press autonomy,
border conflicts in addition to the political shakings and
disturbances and terrorism are also listed as roots for the
violations.
</P>
<P>
The report prescribed that strategies to reinforce human rights
 protection should be on both the continental and national levels.
</P>
<P>
The protocol dealing with the creation of an African court for
human rights should be ratified as soon as possible by all the
countries in the continent while closer cooperation with the
United Nations institutions and other organizations, the report
urged.
</P>
<P>
On the national level, it called on each of the OAU member
state to be aware of its respective duties deriving from the
African human rights charter and other additional pertinent
treaties for coordinating its efforts in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Equitable and fair opportunities for all Africans without sex
difference and the respect of the principle of fair geographical
representation were also stressed in the report.

ALGIERS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- African countries were urged here
Tuesday to intensify their efforts for the creation of job
opportunities through mobilizing common resources in the

Some African countries have set up industrial partnership
councils, with the objectives of encouraging consultations between
the private and public sectors, the report said.

<P>
ALGIERS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika, who is newly appointed the head of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), spelt out here Tuesday the principal factors
for the reinforcement of the industrial strategies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the sponsorship groups for the Alliance of
African Industrialization, Bouteflika said Africa is characterized
by its "weak manufacturing items in comparison with the world
production," because of the stagnation of its industrializing
process and the absence of adequate industrial strategies of the
adjusting structural programs.
</P>
<P>
"Algeria is bringing its full support to the construction of an
 effective and strong alliance for the industrialization of our
continent," he said, adding that to reach this objective, Africa
needs to find expert human resources and important managing
potentials that could supply the necessary conditions to boost
economies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika recalled that the Abidjan Declaration of 1996
established strong lines which define the type of correlation
between the national and local strategies in order to ensure the
ability of competition on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Pragmatic measures should be taken in the second decade for the
 industrial development in Africa, the president said, adding that
hard work is needed for the industrialization of Africa.

WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is planning to visit the Middle East early in
August following President Bill Clinton's meeting with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak in an effort to help push forward the
peace process, the State Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She is expected to stop in Damascus for talks with Syrian

Arafat in Palestinian-held territory as well as other Arab
leaders.

State Department spokesman James Rubin said Albright, once
keeping away from the Middle East conflict, is now ready to devote
much of her time to the peace process.

<P>
"I know the secretary has already made a decision that she's
prepared to spend a substantial amount of her time working on
the Middle East peace process in the coming months," Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Asked what role the United States would play once the peace
process was revived in the Middle East, Rubin said Washington
would help build confidence between Israel and the Arab nations
and hope the parties concerned would lead the way in building
peace.
</P>
<P>
"And we are there more for a confidence-building and
intermediary role than a negotiating one," he added.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has appealed to the world community to provide
urgent assistance to Ethiopians affected by food shortage, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Although the UNICEF is appealing for other forms of emergency
assistance, we must underscore the importance of the food needs
being met.
</P>
<P>
"The other interventions cannot succeed on their own without
adequate caloric intake," UNICEF emergency officer Bob Mccarthy
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF portion of the appeal covers interventions proven to
save lives in emergencies. These include supplementary feeding
for over 95,000 children under five and 71,000 pregnant and
lactating women, measles vaccination, expanding access to clean
water and supplying blankets to the most vulnerable, a UNICEF
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, which supports one issued by the Ethiopian
government's disaster prevention and preparedness commission, also
covers 208,000 metric tons of food aid, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ethiopia appealed to donor community to provide
360,000 tons of emergency food aid to 4.6 million victims of food
shortage.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that parts of Ethiopia failed to have enough
rain in small rainy season from February to May this year, which
has caused the grain shortage.

Security Council has mandated the United Nations with an
unprecedented challenge in Kosovo. To meet this challenge and
fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to the Organization,
significant financial resources and personnel, including experts
in various fields, will be required immediately."
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kosovo "remains tense," so Annan is
"particularly concerned about the continued harassment and lack of
security of minority groups in Kosovo," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is locked in tensions due to lack of law, and the
international peacekeepers, known as the KFOR, and the UNMIK are
not fully deployed.
</P>
<P>
"The full deployment of KFOR and UNMIK personnel will
undoubtedly contribute to the easing of these tensions," Annan
said. "In order to create a climate of law and order, UNMIK must
deploy international police throughout Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the work of the UNMIK will be conducted in five
integrated phases.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will focus on the establishment and
consolidation of the UNMIK's authority and the creation of interim
UNMIK-managed administrative structures.
</P>
<P>
The second phase will be directed towards the administration of
social services and utilities, and the consolidation of the rule
of law, he said.
</P>
<P>
The third phase, after progress being made in the second one,
will be the finalization of preparation for and the conduct of
elections to what may be termed the Kosovo Transitional Authority,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth phase is the period in which the UNMIK will oversee
and, as necessary, assist elected Kosovo representatives in their
efforts to organize and establish provisional institutions for
democratic and autonomous self-government, he said.
</P>
<P>
A concluding fifth phase will depend on a final settlement and
the dispositions made therein, he said.
</P>
<P>
"During the interim period, UNMIK will endeavor to promote, in
cooperation with KFOR, an atmosphere of security and safety that
will enable all refugees and internally displaced persons,
regardless of their ethnicity, to return freely to their homes and
live there in conditions in which the highest standards of human
rights and fundamental freedoms are respected," he added.

<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- In cooperation with the United States, Lebanon
seeks to develop a high-tech zone in Beirut over the coming two
years.
</P>
<P>
The proposed zone, similar to those in the United States,
Mexico and Malaysia, will be the first of its kind in the Middle
East, the Arabic daily Al-Hayat on Tuesday quoted Chairman of the
Arab General Institution for Investment Promotion in Lebanon
Youssif Shokair as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Agency for Development and Trade granted Lebanon
174,000 U.S. dollars to fund the feasibility studies on the
project, Shokair added.
</P>
<P>
The zone will attract global firms that are specialized in
partial or full manufacture of computer hardware chips and CDs as
well as in electrical industries such as TV sets.
</P>
<P>
It will also cover various services in the video-clip,
advertisement and studio industries, Shokair said.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria has decided to impose controls on the
export of all kinds of olive oil as from early 2000.
</P>
<P>
Local economists attributed the move to poor canning style
that led to the decline of Syrian olive oil exports, Al-Alam
Al-Youm newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- The production of Tunisia's oil and gas went up in
1998 by 4.4 percent to reach 5.6 million tons compared to that of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The production of crude oil rose from 3.8 million tons in 1997
to 3.9 million tons last year while the gas production went up from
1.59 million tons to 1.74 million tons in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to the exploitation of 26 oil
fields, four of which started operation last year, Al-Alam Al-Youm
newspaper on Tuesday quoted an official economic survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Minister of Oil Amir Mohammed Rashid said his
country is willing to have trade exchanges with other Arab Gulf
states, noting that there was a tendency to expand such exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Iraq gives priority in its trade dealings with the Arab
countries that account for 50 percent of Iraq's foreign trade
volume, Al-Alam Al-Youm newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Gulf States were awarded contracts involving more than
400 million U.S. dollars under the U.N. oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the sixth phase of the deal, Iraq singed with Saudi firms
contracts worth 150 million U.S. dollars, said the minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The government of Burundi
Tuesday expressed dissatisfaction with reports being circulated by
rebel groups that the recent killings in the capital Bujumbura
were carried out with the knowledge and consent of the military
rulers in power.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement signed by Burundi's Minister for Peace
Process Ambroise Niyonsaba and the Deputy Speaker Augustin
Njojibwami said that the remarks were inflammatory and could put
the ongoing talks in a very delicate situation.
</P>
<P>
"All these remarks are undue and unfounded," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
They urged the rebels to make responsible remarks and work for
reconstruction in the war-torn central African country.
</P>
<P>
The statement, released from Arusha, northern Tanzania, also
reaffirmed the Burundian government's determination to pursue
peace.
</P>
<P>
Burundi, ethnically divided between minority Tutsis and
majority Hutus, has been going through a civil war since the
country's first elected Hutu president was murdered by Tutsi
troops in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
A new round of peace talks aimed at ending the civil war
started last Thursday in Arusha, bringing together the government
and Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
Rebel groups such as the National Council for the Defense of
Democracy (CNDD) and Party of Hutu People's Liberation
(PALEPEHUTU), also denied that they were involved in the recent
killings of more than 30 people, and last Sunday's attack which
killed 11 people, including eight who were burnt to death.
</P>
<P>
The rebels condemned the killings and challenged the Burundian
government to arrest those who were responsible for the killings.

UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Didier Opertti, president
of the 53rd session of the United Nations General Assembly,
Tuesday expressed satisfaction with the results of his five-day
China visit which ended Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The president held friendly discussions "characterized by the
spirit of cooperation" with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
high-ranking officials including Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, a
press release issued by the General Assembly said.
</P>
<P>
Discussion participants "considered different aspects of the
current international political situation," it said.
</P>
<P>
"It was agreed that efforts needed to be made to continue and
implement the reforms aimed at strengthening the role the United
Nations should play in matters relating to the maintenance of
international peace and security, as stipulated in the (U.N.)
Charter," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In that context, both sides agreed on the need to increase the
representation of the developing countries in the Security
Council," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Hits 19 Dollars for 1st Time in 20 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Brent crude oil prices hit 19 U.S.
dollars a barrel for the first time in 20 months Tuesday as close
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) adherence
to output cuts continued to strengthen market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Brent for August delivery broke above the psychological 19.00
U.S. dollars barrer to trade at 19.03 U.S. dollars Tuesday
afternoon on London's International Petroleum Exchange, its
highest value since November 1997.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have jumped nearly 2 U.S. dollars in the past two
weeks, the latest leg in a recovery which has taken Brent up from
lows of less than 10 U.S. dollars in February.
</P>
<P>
The latest push to the rally came after a Gulf official said
Tuesday that Saudi Arabia wanted cast iron proof of a full market
recovery before the OPEC would consider easing export limits, a
Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC compliance with the supply curbs in the last two months
has reached 85-90 percent of targeted levels, according to Reuters
surveys.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts expect surplus stockpiles to be erased by the end
of September, leaving the market exposed to higher prices during
the peak northern hemisphere winter demand season.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Passes First Reading on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Tuesday passed the first reading of a bill that would allow the
expansion of the new government from 18 to 24 ministers.
</P>
<P>
Since all ruling parties have agreed to the government
expansion while signing coalition agreements with Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, the first reading of the bill was approved by a large
majority.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine members of the 120-seat Knesset voted for the bill,
while 38 were against and 13 abstained.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who took office last week, has initiated the bill in an
effort to accommodate the large coalition in his cabinet, which
has the support of 75 Knesset members. And the bill was approved
by Barak's cabinet unanimously on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Likud Party has accused Barak of wasting
the public funds. The former Likud finance minister Meir Sheetrit
has claimed that the government expansion would cost 400 million
shekels (97.56 million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
During a stormy debate on the bill before Tuesday's voting,
Haim Ramon, Minister in Prime Minister's Office, responded that
the bill would only cost 9 million shekels (2.2 million dollars)
annually.
</P>
<P>
Ramon, who cited a letter from Treasury budget director David
Milgrom, said the opposition had made a gross exaggeration and
that "they could not be taken seriously."
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin also noted that under the present
situation of the proliferation of parties, cabinet expansion is a
way to allow factions to express themselves as partners in the
government.
</P>
<P>
The bill is now being discussed by the Knesset Constitution
and Law Committee before returning to the Knesset plenum for
the second and third readings.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Sinn Fein Accuses Blair of Favoring Unionists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's republican Sinn
Fein party Tuesday sharply criticized British Prime Minister Tony
Blair for introducing a bill which it said could lead to its
exclusion from a planned home rule executive.
</P>
<P>
The political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) said
Blair was "pandering" to David Trimble, leader of the province's
pro-British unionists, by adding last-minute legislation aimed at
clarifying last year's Good Friday peace accord. But Sinn Fein
stopped short of threatening to pull out of the faltering peace
process altogether.
</P>
<P>
"The legislation proposed by Tony Blair is not only outside the
Good Friday agreement but stands the Good Friday agreement on its
head in a number of very important respects," Alex Maskey, a
senior Sinn Fein official, was quoted by a Reuters report filed
from Belfast as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bill spell out more clearly that Sinn Fein would be
excluded from the executive should the IRA fail to hand over
weapons according to a set timetable.
</P>
<P>
But Maskey said it would open the door for pro-British
unionists to persist in efforts to expel Sinn Fein from the
power-sharing government Blair wants up and running by Sunday in
the British province.
</P>
<P>
The legislation fell outside the Good Friday accord in two
areas, that is, providing a mechanism for exclusion and extending
the mandate of the Decommissioning Commission headed by Canadian
General John de Chastelain, he said.
</P>
<P>
Maskey added he thought it would be difficult for the moderate
nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) to agree to
any moves to exclude Sinn Fein from the executive.
</P>
<P>
"I would think it would be very difficult for any other
nationalist party to consider joining with negative unionism to
expel another nationalist party," Maskey said. "That would be a
serious setback to the... peace process itself, the success of
which has been inclusivity, and more importantly, it would shift
the balance of power on the executive toward a unionist majority."

<HEADLINE> U.S., Greek Defense Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen Tuesday held talks with his Greek counterpart, Akis
Tsohatzopoulos, on bilateral defense cooperation, Greece's role in
the reconstruction of the Balkans and the Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki, which also focused on the Cyprus problem, terrorism
and the the sale by the U.S. of specific weapons systems to
Greece, Cohen characterized Thessaloniki as "the port of hope" for
the future of the Balkans, the Thessaloniki-based Macedonian Press
Agency (MPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived Tuesday afternoon for an official two-day
visit, urged the intensification of efforts to tackle terrorism,
saying that terrorists in any part of the world must be brought to
justice.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for a peaceful solution to the Cyprus
problem, Cohen said that most likely this time it had already
come.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Tsohatzopoulos said that Greece's defense doctrine
was based on the fact that the country should have modern and
effective forces to act as a deterrent to a potential threat.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's visit has reportedly put the police force in the city
in a state of alert and strict security measures are in effect.
The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) has organized a demonstration
in the city to protest against Cohen's visit.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Cohen will meet in Athens with Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis and Foreign Minister George Papandreou.

<HEADLINE> Joint Military Commission on DRC Ceasefire to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said Tuesday that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the
United Nations will soon establish a Joint Military Commission
(JMC) to monitor the ceasefire agreement signed recently to end
the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told the Zimbabwe News Agency in Algiers, Algeria, that
the OAU had already received the report on the ceasefire agreement
and was now working on modalities of sending peacekeepers and
appointing an independent chairperson of the Joint Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the war in the Congo will end soon. We can't continue
fighting because we do not have the resources to do so," he said,
adding that the money spent on military conflicts could be better
used for developmental purposes.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba expressed confidence that the peace agreement would
hold and that the rebels in the DRC would also sign it soon once
they put their house in order.
</P>
<P>
The rebels could not sign the agreement when leaders of Rwanda,
Uganda and Southern African Development Community, did so in
Lusaka because of a power struggle within the main Congolese Rally
for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
"No one was against the contents of the peace agreement
including the belligerents," Chiluba said, adding that the signing
of the agreement by several African leaders reflected that they
were happy with it and were committed to peace.
</P>
<P>
On reports that Rwanda and Uganda-backed rebels had intensified
the 11- month war only a few days after the signing of an
agreement, Chiluba said this could be a sign that the conflict was
coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
"It has to escalate before it goes down," he said without
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president said he would soon find ways to convince
the rebels to lay down their arms.

ALGIERS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba, the mediator of the recent ceasefire agreement on the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), said here Tuesday afternoon
that the ongoing summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
will help enforce the implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks when addressing a small-scale press
briefing in the Sheraton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU would be in charge of the deployment of neutral
forces in the DRC and it would cooperate with the United Nations
and other U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire agreement, signed by regional leaders in Lusaka
on July 10 this year, was a result of tireless mediation efforts
by President Chiluba who shuttled between the countries involved
in the 11-month armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The civil war erupted in early August of 1998 and sucked in six
other countries soon afterwards, making it a regional war in the
Great Lakes region.

ALGIERS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Alberro Chissano said here Tuesday afternoon that his country's
economy is in quick recovery after 16 years of war.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is attending the ongoing summit of the
Organization of African Unity here in the Algerian capital, told
Xinhua in an interview that the economy is growing at a two-digit
rate, the fastest in its history and in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The currency is stable and we have the lowest inflation. The
environment for economic growth is becoming increasingly better,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, Mozambique is still facing a lot of
difficulties in the reconstruction drive. "We have a ravaged
country because of the war," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a very high percentage of poverty, but we are
not disturbed by this. What is important is how to apply efforts
to reverse this situation and now we are doing it," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment inflow into the country has been increasing
and there has been big progress in health care, power supply and
some other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The president said he was optimistic that the national economy
would enjoy further development in the near future.

ALGIERS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Isaias Afeworki
said here Tuesday afternoon that there has been progress made
toward peaceful resolution to the border conflict between his
country and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the president said that
the Horn of Africa is moving toward peace and stability like other
parts of the continent.
</P>
<P>
"The Organization of African Unity (OAU) has pushed peace
process in some African countries like in Sierra Leone and in the
Democratic Republic of Congo," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that the conflict, which has lasted for
more than one year, will be resolved through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say that much progress has been made. We are waiting
to see the final results of the summit," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the situation in his country is peaceful and
the economy is not much affected because it is growing quickly.
</P>
<P>
The border conflict between these two neighbors started in May
last year and resumed in February this year and later again in
June after a short repose. The OAU has provided a framework
agreement for the resolution of the conflict but it has not been
adequately implemented.

Shire River, south of the commercial capital Blantyre.
</P>
<P>
Assistant parks and wildlife official, Joe Chinguwo, said
Tuesday that more than 500 hippos were recorded in 1994 in the
serenity and peaceful beauty of the marsh alongside the river.
</P>
<P>
But the figure declined drastically to between 200 and 300 now
due to skirmishes by poachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinguwo said the poachers, who camped in the village of
Yokoniya in the area, made big business selling the hippo meat,
hides and teeth.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has organized an education exercise for local
people, sensitizing the people along the marsh about the
importance of preserving the hippos for tourism purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The scouts of the tourism ministry, under police cover in
March, ambushed the village where they arrested four poachers and
uncovered various guns including AK 47s and muzzle loaders,
ammunition and knives used in killing and skinning the hippos.
</P>
<P>
The operation has made the area safe for hippos, noted
Chinguwo.
</P>
<P>
The tourism official said they would continue the education
program aimed at conserving areas where animals or plants are
under threats.
</P>
<P>
"If villagers understand the importance of conserving wildlife
they will not be involved in poaching," he added.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Official Travels to Finland for Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Egyptian official flew to
Helsinki, Finland on Tuesday for talks with Finnish officials on
regional issues and the ties between Egypt and the European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon departure, Assistant Foreign
Minister Fathi el Shazli said he will discuss with Finnish
officials ways of seeking a more active role of the EU in helping
advance the Mideast peace process now that moderate Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak has come to power.
</P>
<P>
Finland is holding EU's rotating presidency for the second half
of this year. The EU desires to play a key role in helping
revitalize the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel and an active mediator in the Arab-Israeli peace talks,
keeps close contact with the EU on the issue.
</P>
<P>
El Shazli said he will also hold talks with Finnish officials
on the Egyptian-EU relations, which he described as "in an
important stage," referring to the finalization of the Egyptian-EU
partnership agreement.
</P>
<P>
After four years of negotiations, EU foreign ministers endorsed
last month the text of the agreement. But Egypt has yet to approve
the draft as what the country's chief negotiator Gamal Bayoumi
said there are around 15 clauses which remain to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The accord is aimed at providing for more open trade,
coordination in economic and financial areas, a political dialog
and joint efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, el Shazli is to prepare for a planned two-day
trip to the North European country by Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa on Thursday when el Shazli will be accompanying
Moussa.

WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia has agreed to limit
shipments of steel to the United States to avoid imposition of
punitive American tariffs, U.S. officials said Tuesday.

An Associated press report quoted the administration officials
as saying that the deal was signed after marathon bargaining talks
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
If an agreement had not been reached by Tuesday, the United

<HEADLINE> First Science Fiction Degree to Be Set Up in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A British university announced
Tuesday it will offer the country's first Bachelor of Science
degree in Science and Science Fiction from September.
</P>
<P>
The degree has been specially designed to achieve a "balance
between the study of science in its accepted format and the
phenomenon of science fiction," the University of Glamorgan said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The university, which has previously offered a course which
considered the possibility of extra-terrestrial life, said the aim
of the degree is to identify the relationship between science and
science fiction in a revolutionary new way of encouraging more
people to consider careers in science.
</P>
<P>
Students will be able to pursue particular specialisms within
the degree but will need to sustain their study of science
disciplines alongside their science-fiction related modules.
</P>
<P>
They will tackle topics such as "Will robots take over the
earth?", which can be considered from the perspectives of both
science fiction and science fact.
</P>
<P>
And the cultural significance of science and science fiction
will also be examined.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Sign Agreement on Steel Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Russia
have signed an agreement limiting Russian shipments of steel to
the United States, avoiding imposition of punitive American
tariffs against Russian steel, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal was signed after marathon bargaining talks in Paris.
</P>
<P>
If an agreement had not been reached by July 13, the United
States was set to impose the penalty tariffs, which would have
resulted in an even steeper drop in demand for Russian steel in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The deal was achieved only at the last minute following a
number of concessions from the American side, the Associated Press
quoted Russian Trade Minister Mikhail Fradkov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. steel industry claims that it has been hurt by a flood
of cheap imports into the country following the global currency
crisis, which sharply lowered demand for steel and other
commodities because of the steep recessions in many Asian nations
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The industry has filed a number of dumping cases seeking to get
the government to impose high tariffs to stem this tide of cheap
foreign steel into the country.
</P>
<P>
With political pressures rising, the Clinton Administration has
tried to show support for the U.S. steel industry. High tariffs
have been imposed in a case involving hot-rolled steel with Japan.
But Russia entered into negotiations to avoid having the tariffs,
which the industry favors because they are more effective at
halting imports.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Edges Up In June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The rate of inflation in Britain
rose slightly last month, although not enough to overshoot the
Government's target of 2.5 percent, according to official figures
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said the annual underlying
rate of inflation in June was 2.2 percent, up from 2.1 percent the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the effect pushing up the price index came from
alcoholic drink prices and housing costs, while downwards effects
came from falls in household goods prices and motoring costs.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed among economists in the City that there
is little inflationary pressure now in the UK, which could
persuade the Bank of England to cut interest rates once again.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Refute Lee Teng-hui's Separatist Remarks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUANZHOU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Scholars from the Chinese
mainland who are here for a symposium on cross-straits relations
met late tonight to refute the separatist remarks of Taiwan's Lee
Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
Lee said on July 9 in an interview with a German radio station
that cross-straits relations should be defined as "state-to-state
or at least special state-to-state relations" and this was echoed
later by other Taiwanese officials, who said that cross-straits
talks are "bilateral talks between two states."
</P>
<P>
Jiang Dianming, the vice-president of the Taiwan Studies
Society, said at the meeting that the separatist remarks are a
serious attack on the internationlly recognized principle that
there is only one China and they run contrary to the wish of the
Chinese people for the smooth development of the cross-straits
relations.
</P>
<P>
Lee's separatist remarks pose a great threat to the cross-
straits relations and the stability of cross-straits situation,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Lu Kaixuan, the president of the Tianjin Institute of
Agriculture and Forestry, said that Lee's remarks match the goals
of "Taiwan Independence" supporters and cater to the needs of anti-
China forces who hate to see a strong and unified China and want
to "make the Taiwan issue an international issue."

<TEXT>
<P>
Li Jian, the secretary-general of the Cross-strait
Transportation Exchange Association, called Lee Teng-hui "a
troublemaker" who is disturbing relations across the Taiwan
Straits and said that Lee always makes trouble when cross-straits
relations have reached a favorable point. Lee's recent separatist
remarks show he has made a wrong judgment about the international
situation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Fan Xizhou, the director of Xiamen University's Taiwan Research
Institute, said that it was regression in cross-straits relations
when Lee's remarks were backed by theTaiwan authorities. All the
Chinese people around the world should be on guard against such
dangerous behavior, he said.
</P>
<P>
The scholars agreed that more relaxed relations across the
straits and a final reunification of China are unavoidable and
that the Chinese people will never lose their determination to
guard China's territorial integrity and sovereignty, in spite of
Lee's remarks and they asked Lee and the Taiwan authorities to
stop their separatist activities immediately and to adhere to the
"one China" principle.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece to Facilitate Turkey's EU Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Greece have agreed to
lift objections to Turkey's bid to join the European Union (EU),
Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides told the Athens News
Agency (ANA) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of Greek Foreign Ministry Yiannos Kranidiotis
said on Monday that it will be preferable if Turkey meets the
requirements set by EU leaders to be designated as an EU candidate.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Greece will allow Turkey to become an EU
candidate on two conditions: firstly, Cyprus' accession to the EU
would go ahead unhindered by a political solution to the Cyprus
issue being a prerequisite; secondly, a public statement of
solidarity from the EU on the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
While echoing Greece's position, the Cyprus foreign minister
said that the Greek government once again showed its dedication
toward Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island but
so far no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started
substantive accession negotiations with the EU in November
1998. It hopes to be admitted as an EU member by January 2003.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM's Remarks on Cyprus Issue Draw Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's medieval views regarding
the solution of international issues, including that of Cyprus,
with the use of force do not conform with the international law,
Cyprus Government Spokesman Costas Serezis said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a statement made Monday by Turkish Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit that the Cyprus issue was solved in 1974, Serezis
noted that Ecevit himself had ordered Turkish troops to invade
Cyprus in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Serezis asked that if this was the case, then "why are the
U.N., the European Union, the G-8 (the seven most industrialized
nations plus Russia), the Non-Aligned Movement and the
Commonwealth" have been involved in efforts to solve the
longstanding Cyprus issue?
</P>
<P>
"The medieval theory that one country has the right, through
the use of force to solve international issues," Serezis said, is
"something which should concern Europe, if it wants Turkey to
join its ranks."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman also criticized Turkey for its
intention to change the island's demographic character.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish Cypriot press reports, there are now
less than 60,000 Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has implanted more than 80,000 Turkish colonist
settlers in the northern area of the island, in addition to 35,000
Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
Before 1974 there were some 120,000 Turkish Cypriots in
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Denies Deadline for Withdrawal From Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday termed as pack
of lies the Indian propaganda that Islamabad has been given
deadline of July 16 to complete the process of disengagement in
Kargil sector in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as "boastful propaganda," Foreign Office
spokesman Tariq Altaf told media that it was absolutely wrong on
the part of India to make such a claim.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that India was saying to create an impression of
pressuring Pakistan over what has already been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Altaf noted that the schedule of disengagement from different
sectors along the Line of Control in Kashmir was decided by the
Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMO) of the two
countries on July 11.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed upon between the DGMO that disengagement in
Mashkoh sector would be completed in four to five days.

<HEADLINE> Rich Oil Reserves Found in Iraq's Western Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Rich oil reserves and hydrocarbon
susbstance have been found in Iraq's Western Desert, said an Iraqi
oil official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency (INA), Ibrahim
Abdulkareem, the director-general of the Iraqi Oil Exploration
Company, said prospecting made by the Oil Ministry has shown the
country's Western Desert is rich in oil and hydrocabon substance.
</P>
<P>
Abdulkareem said his company's staff expanded activities in
searching and digging new wells in the Western Desert to find new
oil reserves. He did not reveal the estimated oil reserves in
this area.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's proven oil reserves, which stand at 112 billion barrels,
rank the second in the world only next to Saudi Arabia, whose oil
reserves are 260 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
Iraq expects to add about 214 billion barrels to its oil
reserves, said the Iraqi official. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Gulf War touched off by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, Iraq has not been allowed to sell its oil freely on
world markets under relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program which came into force in
December 1996, Iraq is allowed to export limited amount of oil in
every six months to buy food, medicine and other basic needs for
its people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq plans to increase its daily oil export capacity to 3.5
million barrels by the year 2000 from the current level of 2
million barrels.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Renews Accusation of Israeli Soil Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Tuesday renewed its
accusation that Israel is stealing the country's fertile soil and
taking it into northern Israel, the second charge since last
October.
</P>
<P>
The state-run National News Agency quoted sources in south
Lebanon as saying that the Israelis have been plundering Lebanese
soil since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Several Israeli trucks were seen to have transported soil from
Marjayoun district inside the Israeli occupied zone in south
Lebanon into northern Israel for the benefit of Israeli farmers.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in less than a year that Lebanon
charged Israel with stealing soil.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon had previously accused Israel of stealing south
Lebanon's water resources and using the volatile region to test
newly developed missiles.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
The agency also quoted Lebanese Foreign Ministry sources as
saying that Lebanon has asked the United Nations to help stop the
Israeli plunder.
</P>
<P>
It is a new Israeli aggression on Lebanon, which will force the
country to file a complaint to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan as it did last year, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli occupation forces and its ally South Lebanon Army
(SLA) out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Army Beats off UNITA Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters of the general
staff of Angola's armed forces announced here Tuesday that
government army beat off an unknown number of UNITA soldiers
attempting to occupy Chitembo city in central Bie Province over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said in a brief statement that the forces of
the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) incurred "grave casualties" during the fighting in the
city 100 kilometers south of the capital city Kuito.
</P>
<P>
However, no details were given, except that "a UNITA political
commissioner commanding the operation" was killed.
</P>
<P>
After the victory in Chitembo, the government army went on to
chase the enemy in the direction of Camacupa city, 80 kilometers
southeast of Kuito, which is still under UNITA's control, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said UNITA's strategy now in areas with the
fiercest fightings is to try to consume the strength of government
army so as to impoverish the latter's plan of launching an
offensive in the dry season.
</P>
<P>
The army headquarters noted that despite some "individual
events of armed attacks by (Jonas) Savimbi's bandits," the present
situation in "most of the country" is still under government's
control.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Backs Annan's Decision on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Tuesday endorsed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
decision to start vote registration in East Timor on July 16, a
presidential statement said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time the 15 council members expressed concern over
the "serious" security situation in East Timor, particularly over
the recent incidents in some parts of the territory, which "has
highlighted the larger problem of militia impunity", the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued after the council heard a briefing from
the U.N. Secretariat on Annan's decision made last Saturday when
he put off the original registration date by 3 days because of
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Pro-integration and pro-independence militias in East Timor
have recently engaged in violent activities, according to U.N.
information.
</P>
<P>
The statement said council members welcomed the high-level
visit on Monday by members of the Indonesian cabinet to Dili,
capital of East Timor and their reaffirmation commitment to the
full implementation of the May 5 agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached after months of talks between Indonesia
and Portugal under the U.N. mediation, gives the U.N. mandate to
organize and conduct a "popular consultation" in East Timor to see
whether the majority of the local people want special autonomy
within Indonesia or independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a Portuguese colony until 1975, was occupied by
Indonesia the same year after a civil rift took place. In 1976
Indonesia annexed it and since then the U.N. has called it a
non-self-governing territory administered by Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The original ballot was set for August 8. Annan has postponed
it by two weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET),
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Monday that a
number of people were being investigated for their alleged
involvement in recent incidents and action will be taken to
prevent setting illegal roadblocks in the territory.

<HEADLINE> East African Treaty in Final Touches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Experts from east African
countries who have been meeting in north Tanzania's Arusha town
since June 29 have adopted a revised text for the establishment of
the East African Community.
</P>
<P>
The experts agreed on a 148-page revised draft treaty
containing 160 articles which cover various aspects of the new
regional cooperation organization to be formed on the basis of the
current East Africa Co- operation (EAC) comprising Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Alot Magaga, the public relations officer of EAC, said in
Arusha Tuesday that the revised draft has 33 chapters, covering
sectors of trade, customs, common market, infrastructure, human
resources and education.
</P>
<P>
Others are on free movement of personnel, health, environment,
culture, women, investment, industrial development, political
matters and the role of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The draft treaty envisages the eventual realization of a
political federation of east Africa, he said, adding "it will be
the responsibility of the heads of state to determine when such a
federation shall be established."
</P>
<P>
With the adoption of the revised text, the stage is now set for
the final lap to the signing of the treaty by heads of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania scheduled for July 30 in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The revised text agreed by the high level treaty-making experts
will now be sent for consideration by an extraordinary meeting of
the EAC Permanent Tripartite Commission to be held in Arusha
between July 19 and 21.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Arusha, Magaga said the draft treaty
as reviewed by the commission "will be tabled at the meeting of
the attorneys general of the three member states during July 23
and 24, which will verify the legal content of the draft treaty."
</P>
<P>
Another meeting of the Permanent Tripartite Commission will be
convened during July 27 and 28 to clear the final text in
readiness for signature by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi,
Uganda's Yoweri Museveni and Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The revised text, said the EAC official, has also incorporated
the views and amendment proposals from the public.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has proposed the establishment of a customs
union and common market.
</P>
<P>
Within the customs union, internal tariffs and other charges on
imports will be eliminated, all non-tariffs barriers removed, and
application of a common external tariff effected.
</P>
<P>
The common market, however, said the draft, will be established
subject to protocols which will be concluded by the member states.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for World Aid to U.N. Mission in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday called on the international community to help the
United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) to meet
what he described "unprecedented challenges" in the post-war
reconstruction drive in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the U.N. Security Council, Annan said, ""The
Security Council has mandated the United Nations with an
unprecedented challenge in Kosovo. To meet this challenge and
fulfil the responsibilities entrusted to the Organization,
significant financial resources and personnel, including experts
in various fields, will be required immediately."
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kosovo "remains tense," so Annan is
"particularly concerned about the continued harassment and lack of
security of minority groups in Kosovo," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is locked in tensions due to lack of law, and the
international peacekeepers, known as KFOR, and UNMIK are not fully
deployed.
</P>
<P>
"The full deployment of KFOR and UNMIK personnel will
undoubtedly contribute to the easing of these tensions," Annan
said. "In order to create a climate of law and order, UNMIK must
deploy international police throughout Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Annan also appealed for the quick deployment of civilian police
to Kosovo as well as money to pay civil servants before public
services collapsed entirely.
</P>
<P>
"Their early arrival is essential if we are to stem the
tendency toward lawlessness which is taking hold in some areas,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
So far about 1,900 police have been pledged by 41 countries
several hundred more are needed for border units and special task
forces, a senior U.N. official told a press conference. He said he
had received only 968 names of officers who would actually go to
the Yugoslav province beginning July 17.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the work of UNMIK will be conducted in five
integrated phases.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will focus on the establishment and
consolidation of UNMIK's authority and the creation of interim
UNMIK-managed administrative structures.
</P>
<P>
The second phase will be directed towards the administration of
social services and utilities, and the consolidation of the rule
of law, he said.
</P>
<P>
The third phase, after progress being made in the second one,
will be the finalization of preparation for and the conduct of
elections to what may be termed the Kosovo Transitional Authority,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth phase is the period in which UNMIK will oversee and,
as necessary, assist elected Kosovo representatives in their
efforts to organize and establish provisional institutions for
democratic and autonomous self-government, he said.
</P>
<P>
A concluding fifth phase will depend on a final settlement and
the dispositions made therein, he said.
</P>
<P>
"During the interim period, UNMIK will endeavour to promote, in
cooperation with KFOR, an atmosphere of security and safety that
will enable all refugees and internally displaced persons,
regardless of their ethnicity, to return freely to their homes and
live there in conditions in which the highest standards of human
rights and fundamental freedoms are respected," he added.

<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations between Britain and
Argentina on how to resume air links between the disputed Falkland
Islands and the Argentine mainland are expected to reach agreement
on Wednesday, British Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
The talks, in their third round in London now, are due to
continue on Wednesday morning and a statement is expected to be
issued around noon, a spokeswoman in the Foreign office told
Xinhua on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They are being attended by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
and his Argentine counterpart Guido di Tella and councillors from
the Falklands.
</P>
<P>
"They had made good progress today," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, a war broke out between Britain and Argentina over the
sovereignty of the Falkland Island, which lies off the Argentine
coast. Argentina has claimed sovereignty of that island, which was
called "Las Malvinas" by Argentine, since 1833.

<P>
LONDON July 13 (Xinhua) - Main European stock markets suffered
sizable losses at the close Tuesday, as the disappointing data at
home and the sharp fall in Argentine stock market hurt investors'
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 in London closed down 99.9 points, or 1.53
percent, at 6445.6, as early losses on Wall Street mounted and
banking stocks fell on benign UK inflation data.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outgunned gainers by more than seven-to-one in London
as bank and telecom shares drifted off recent highs.
</P>
<P>
British banks were hit by June inflation figures that came in
exactly in line with expectations of an annual increase of 2.2
percent, raising speculation that the current round of interest
rate cuts is at an end.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt, lost 78.20 points to end at
5573.82, a fall of 1.38 percent, as investors bailed out on the
back of disappointing retail sales figures and lower prospects for
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Among individual stocks HypoVereinsbank led the decline among
banks, falling 3.8 percent. Deutsche Bank was the most traded
stock and also fell 3 percent, while Dresdner Bank was down 3.33
percent.
</P>
<P>
Car maker BMW, was the leading faller, down 3.97 percent amid
profit-taking after rising to its highest price since February on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
French shares fell lower on the day as weaker than expected
German economic data and sharp losses in Argentina overnight
prompted profit-taking. The CAC 40 fell 67.63 points, or 1.45
percent, to end at 4594.65.

<HEADLINE> Kasich Withdraws From U.S. Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Representative John
Kasich from Ohio has decided to drop out of the race for the
Republican presidential nomination, Republican officials said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kasich decided to withdraw to support the Republican
presidential front-runner, Texas Governor George W. Bush, said the
officials. He is expected to make a formal announcement of
withdrawal on Wednesday afternoon in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old Kasich, chairman of the House of
Representatives Budget Committee, is also expected to announce
that he will not seek re-election to a tenth two-year term in
Congress next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another Republican presidential hopeful, New
Hampshire Senator Bob Smith, announced Tuesday that he abandoned
the Republican party to join the U.S. Taxpayers Party nomination
for the White House as a third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
Kasich and Smith made their decisions of withdrawal after Bush
solidified his claim as front-runner in the Republican nomination
race with record fund-raising of more than 36 million dollars for
the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Departure of Kasich and Smith from the Republican
presidential race will reduce the number of contenders for the
party's 2000 nomination to 10.
</P>
<P>
Republican officials said they expect other contenders to drop
out after the August 14 straw poll in Iowa. Traditionally, the
party's eventual nominee for presidential election comes from the
top three in the poll.

<HEADLINE> Hill Drives On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- British driver Damon Hill has
announced he will carry on in Formula One until the end of the
1999 season.
</P>
<P>
The announcement ends nearly a month of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
Hill confirmed he was retiring at the end of the season, then
hinted that he would go immediately after a disastrous French
Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
He was persuaded to change his mind after meeting with team
owner Eddie Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The driver refused to discuss his future during a successful
weekend at Silverstone, which saw him finish fifth in the race.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old former world champion said on Wednesday: "I am
looking forward to helping the Jordan team achieve their highest-
ever Constructors' Championship position."
</P>
<P>
The team are currently third in the race for this title.
</P>
<P>
Team chief executive Jordan added: "We are all extremely
pleased with Damon's decision.
</P>
<P>
"His contribution to this massive team effort is invaluable and
we are all eagerly anticipating the last eight races."
</P>
<P>
Both Hill and Jordan are on holiday with their families this
week while the team tests at Monza with Shinji Nakano and Heinz-
Harald Frentzen.
</P>
<P>
Hill's decision came as no real surprise after Jordan himself
hinted on Monday that the driver was likely to carry on.
</P>
<P>
Last year he performed much better in the second half of the
season - bringing Jordan their first GP win in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Talk of premature retirement this season came when he was at a
low ebb in France, his fifth failure to finish in seven races.
</P>
<P>
The Briton had also been eclipsed by team-mate Heinz-Harald
Frentzen, who won the French race.
</P>
<P>
There are also few drivers available of the caliber required to
slot in to Hill's place, and one fewer after Ferrari's appointment
of Mika Salo to stand in for the injured Michael Schumacher.

<HEADLINE> Pak New Trade Policy to Diversify, Expand Export Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
Wednesday announced its annual trade policy for new fiscal year
(July 1-June 30) which sets export target at nine billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new trade policy announced here by Finance Minister Ishaq
Dar envisages various concessions and tax incentives and relief to
expand and diversify export base, propelling foreign exchange
earnings and trimming trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Dar spelled out various measures and steps in the trade policy
to remove the stumbling blocks which hamper export expansion, and
to facilitate exporters to concentrate on value-addition.
</P>
<P>
The policy measures will eliminate anti-export biases retarding
the export growth and put the economy on a sound track, he said.
</P>
<P>
The trade policy sets the annual target of exports at nine
billion dollars and that of imports at 9.8 billion dollars,
bringing down the trade deficit to 800 million dollars against
1.57 billion dollars during 1998-99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need of renewed role of the private
sector which would gear up investments, exports and growth process
in an effective fashion.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet earlier approved the trade policy after detailed
discussion on various aspects of imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also
discussed different measures for creating more jobs and boosting
exports.
</P>
<P>
Dar said that in order to promote exports of engineering,
contracting and consulting services, there will be only one
percent income tax on foreign exchange earnings of this sector.
</P>
<P>
The export of rice, he said, is now subjected to one percent
income tax. This ratio is being curtailed to half a percent to
promote the rice export, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dar also said that the income tax imposed on the exports of
fish and other edible items is being reduced to 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports in fiscal 1998-99 stood at only 7.72 billion
dollars as against the target of 10 billion dollars. Exports in
1997-98 reached 8.63 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total bill of imports in 1998-99 was 9.28
billion dollars, registering a trade deficit of 1.56 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government had vowed to achieve zero-rate trade
deficit during the last fiscal year when it announced its trade
policy for 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts to contain the deficit, it has been on the rise
gradually due to stagnation in exports and rise in import bill
following the reduction of import duties from 45 to 35 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Rise Slightly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales rose just 0.1
percent in June to a seasonally adjusted 243.3 billion dollars,
the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The June increase followed a big 1.2 percent gain in retail
sales in May. The last month's small advance reflected a sharp
drop in automotive sales.
</P>
<P>
However, retail sales, which represent one third of the
nation's economic output, have climbed or held steady for 11
months running and were 8 percent higher than in June of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said consumers' strong appetite for shopping is being
fueled by the country's economic boom. Consumer confidence is high
as both unemployment and inflation remain low, and the stock
market continues to post record gains.
</P>
<P>
In June, despite the overall increase in retail sales,
automotive sales fell a sharp 1 percent while sales at gasoline
stations also went down 0.4 percent. But without the often
volatile autos category, retail sales would have increased 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods fell 0.4 percent in June following a
strong 2.3 percent increase in May.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, also were up
in June, rising 0.4 percent, following a 0.5 percent increase in
May.
</P>
<P>
Last month, sales at apparel and accessory shops rose 0.2
percent and sales at department and general merchandise stores
increased 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last week the nation's biggest retailers reported surprisingly
strong sales in June and warm weather took people buying
everything from bathing suits to air conditioners. Discount
chains, such as Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, were the biggest
winners.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Albanian, Macedonian Foreign Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Greece,
Albania and Macedonia Wednesday agreed on the establishment of
joint committees for the development, democratization and
reconstruction of the Balkans within the framework of the
stability pact.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached while the three ministers were
meeting at the Agios Achillios islet, in the northern Greek region
of Prespes, within the framework of a relevant initiative by
Athens, the Thessaloniki-based Macedonia Press Agency (MPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
During the first such tripartite meeting, Greek Foreign
Minister George Papandreou and his Albanian and Macedonian
counterparts, Paskal Milo and Aleksander Dimitrov, discussed
multilateral cooperation in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Describing the tripartite meeting as "historical," Papandreou
said that those meetings would be in the future upgraded and would
be held at prime ministers' level and at ministerial level in
order to broaden the cooperation among the three countries within
the framework of the stability pact that would be implemented in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The Greek side reportedly wants these tripartite meetings to
take place every six months.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou also said that Greece regarded as necessary for
Albania and Macedonia to receive assistance as they were mostly
hit by the crisis in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Non-Communist Parties Of China Refuting Taiwan Leader's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's non-communist
parties today refuted the separatist remarks made recently by Lee
Teng-hui, saying the remarks reveal his intention to undermine
China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity and that
this is opposed by all the Chinese people, including Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Tienong, the executive vice-chairman of the Chinese
Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee's Central Committee, pointed
out that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is  part
of China and none can change this fact.
</P>
<P>
Qian Weichang, an honorary chairman of the 8th Central
Committee of the China Democratic League, said that Lee has
strayed too far on the separationist path and has risked the
future of Taiwan and its people, something that is certain to make
all the Chinese people more wary and that they will strongly
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
Wan Guoquan, the honorary vice-chairman of the 7th Central
Committee of the China Democratic National Construction
Association, said that the one-China policy is the foundation of
the cross-straits relations and that Lee's intention is to
separate Taiwan from China and make the Taiwan issue an
international one.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jialu, the chairman of the 10th Central Committee of the
China Association for Promoting Democracy, pointed out that Lee's
remarks have posed a great threat to the cross-straits relations
which are developing smoothly in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Winnipeg Deadly Lab leak Causes Growing Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian media voiced growing
concern on Wednesday about the deadly lab leak in the city of
Winnipeg, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
Many provincial officials demand to know why they were not told
in time after a Level 4 lab dumped waste water into city sewers,
according to the media.
</P>
<P>
The lab is reported to be one of just a dozen in the world
capable of handling the deadliest of viruses such as Ebola, Lassa
and Marbug.
</P>
<P>
Although Manitoba's Environment Minister Linda McIntosh assured
Tuesday that "no viral containments will be entering the water
system," and the federal government was asked to review the safety
facility at the lab, the media said.
</P>
<P>
So far there has been no report of any illness caused from the
deadly discharge.
</P>
<P>
The accidental leak occurred on June 23 but only came to light
in news reports three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
The waste water was sent to a lab sewer tank but then
discharged by mistake into a large blending tank that mixes waste
from other labs in the facility.

GENEVA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Air Transport
Association (IATA) urged NATO here Tuesday to immediately lift
flight ban over the Kosovo region.
</P>
<P>
"At least 30 percent of the increased air traffic control
delays in the last three months have been caused by diverting
civilian flights around the Kosovo region into Italy, France and
Eastern Europe," the IATA said in a statement.

After the end of NATO's 11-week air strikes against Yugoslavia
in June, no-fly zones set up over Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia,
Albania, southern Hungary, Bosnia and the Adriatic Sea during the
Kosovo conflict were still in operation, according to the IATA.
</P>
<P>
"Immediate action must be taken to help this summer's
bottlenecks," the Geneva-based IATA said. "As the Kosovo conflict
is over, NATO and all relevant states must immediately return the
region's airspace to normal use."

<HEADLINE> India Asks Pakistan to Restart Lahore Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- India's caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee Wednesday asked Pakistan to restart Lahore
peace process, which began last February when he and Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif signed the Lahore Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The Lahore Declaration was a "firm commitment between India and
Pakistan to resolve all issues bilaterally and what happened in
Kargil (of Kashmir) was totally against this commitment," Vajpayee
said at a public rally in Kulu, a northern city.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Vajpayee said, Pakistan should make a fresh
beginning to carry forward the Lahore peace process which the
Indian leader said had been marred by incursions in Kargil.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), India would not
wait indefinitely for the intruders to withdraw, Vajpayee told the
rally, adding that they would be thrown out if they refuse to
vacate Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that the conflict in Kashmir was not completely over,
Vajpayee said his country would not stop the retreating intruders
and expected them to leave immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan stabbed us in the back and considered the present
uncertain political situation (in India as) an opportune time to
push in intruders, but a tide of nationalism swept India which
united us like a rock," PTI quoted Vajpayee as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee assured the army that it would be equipped with the
latest weapons and equipment that would be either imported or
manufactured domestically.
</P>
<P>
He refused to give any comments when asked about Pakistan's
statement that no date had been fixed for complete withdrawal of
"Mujaheedins" from all sectors in Kargil area.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee indicated that, during his talks with Sharif in
Lahore, the issue of so-called line of control (LoC)in Kashmir had
not been raised.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan should have raised the LoC issue during the Lahore
talks if it had any reservations about it, Vajpayee said, adding
there was no such mention at that time.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee reiterated that the Indian army was determined to
throw out the last infiltrator from Indian side.
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi, Defense Minister George Fernandes echoed what
Vajpayee said Wednesday, warning Pakistan of grave consequences if
it backtracked from its commitment to withdraw forces from Kargil.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Pakistan's reported statement that the July 16
deadline for withdrawal was a "big lie", Fernandes said "Pakistan
speaks with one voice for its people and with another voice for
India."

<HEADLINE> SADC Tariff Reductions on Track: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of 12 southern
African trade ministers opened in Botswanan capital Gaborone
Wednesday with officials optimistic about implementation of the
phased reduction of tariffs between their countries in the year
2000, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Of the 14 member states of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), only the Democratic Republic of Congo and
Seychelles were not represented.
</P>
<P>
The officials agreed that there could be compromise on the
original protocol under which the tariffs will be reduced. But
they remain confident that it will finally be ratified by the time
of a SADC heads of state summit in August.
</P>
<P>
This will clear the way for tariffs on at least 60 percent of
goods traded between member states to be abolished by January 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
Malawi and South Africa are in line to be at least two states
that will ratify. They would make up the seven needed to
implement the protocol.
</P>
<P>
Members of the South African delegation said Wednesday that
they were unhappy with the handling of negotiations so far by
trade sector coordinating country Tanzania and would propose
amendments.
</P>
<P>
"Things are moving too slowly, communications between ourselves
and some of the other member states are difficult," they said. "We
want to reshuffle the responsibilities.... but things will still
happen by the end of the year."
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki said at the World Economic
Forum's Southern Economic Summit in Durban last week that South
Africa would ratify the protocol to allow for its implementation
in January, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, Botswana Commerce Minister George Kgoroba
said that the implementation of the trade protocol is the greatest
challenge facing the SADC.
</P>
<P>
"It will tell potential investors that the SADC is ready for
them," SAPA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is the way to achieve full regional integration in the
shortest possible time," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
SADC Deputy Executive Secretary Prega Ramsamy said the
implementation would show how ready the SADC is to become a
serious player in the international economic arena.
</P>
<P>
"We must put our house in order," he said. "Members must be
flexible in today's negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Chungu Mwila of the SADC secretariat said negotiations had come
a long way. He expected agreement, but also warned of final
compromise.
</P>
<P>
"Wednesday will be decisive," he said. "The ministers are under
pressure to deliver."
</P>
<P>
"This is the real world. The crunch of the matter is that some
of the countries were trying to hang on to some tariffs even in
non-sensitive categories," the SADC official said. "Now they are
more accommodating."
</P>
<P>
Negotiations had snagged previously on rules of origin and the
textile and motor assembly industries. Some members had
classified goods they were not trading in as from 'essential'
industries that had to be protected.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Botswana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Mauritius have already ratified the protocol, which seeks to
establish a tariff-free zone within eight years of its signing in
Maseru, capital of Lesotho, in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the original signatories have to ratify the
document before the SADC secretariat can start the process of
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The SADC in August 1996 had only 12 members. All but Angola
signed, so two-thirds of 11 is taken as seven.
</P>
<P>
"Angola did not sign then, (the Democratic) Congo and
Seychelles were not members, but the rule is that they will have
to go along with the rest," secretariat spokesperson Kito Segwai
said.
</P>
<P>
Three phases of tariff reduction are planned. Items in group A
which account for 60 percent of traded goods, will kick in with a
zero tariff rating on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on group B items will be liberalized gradually over the
five remaining years of the eight year period.
</P>
<P>
Group C is for 'sensitive' items.
</P>
<P>
Mwila said that broadly defined, the A group was everything
except textiles, clothing, assembled motor vehicles, leather goods
and some agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
He foresaw last minute special arrangements for sugar and beef
and the fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
The 14 member states of the SADC are: Angola, Botswana,
Democratic Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hails Egyptian-Sudanese Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
on Wednesday spoke highly of a recent meeting between Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and his Sudanese counterpart Omar
al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting is a key step on the way to progress of the
bilateral ties," Moussa told Egypt's Middle East News Agency on
the sidelines of the 35th summit of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) in the Algerian capital of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the two countries "would maintain good
cooperation in the near future."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister stressed Egypt's keenness on
Sudan's unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's rebel groups have been fighting a 16-year-old war for
greater autonomy in southern states from the Khartoum Islamic
government.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been in close contacts with Sudan's opposition
groups, including the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, in an
effort to advise them to refrain from splitting the south from the
north. Cairo fears that a dismembered Sudan will endanger the
Nile, its major water source.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak met on Monday with al-Bashir on the sidelines of the
OAU summit in Algiers, a move rare in the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mubarak said the bilateral relations "are
continually improving."
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-Khartoum ties soured in 1995 after Egypt accused
Sudan of masterminding an assassination attempt on Mubarak in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also blamed Sudan for sheltering Islamic militants who
have been waging an insurgency since 1992 in an attempt to
topple the secular Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied both charges.
</P>
<P>
The ties have been improving steadily in the recent two years
after the two sides repeatedly expressed readiness to end tensions
and exchanged visits by senior officials. It has been reported
that the two sides are considering a visit to Egypt by the
Sudanese president.

head the mission, said the trip would go ahead despite a lack of
detailed information from NATO about its bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The military information is not on the table," Haavisto said.
"But we have all the background information available which is a
good basis for our work."
</P>
<P>
He said that the experts "are trying to get information from
all sources and have established good contacts with KFOR (
peacekeeping) troops. From their side we have the first reports
from villages, which is very useful."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team will try to assess the possible impact on water
resources and the food chain and check whether depleted uranium
was released into the air and soil.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Commission on Human Settlement is helping to organize
the mission, which will also look into damage to housing. The U.N.
refugee agency, the leading humanitarian agency in Kosovo, has
estimated 65 percent of the province's homes were damaged or
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Serb authorities say NATO's air strikes targeted fuel
refineries, fertilizer plants, petrochemical units and storage
tanks and has caused an environmental nightmare.

ATHENS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An Albanian man on Wednesday
hijacked an inter-city bus carrying eight passengers on its way
from Polykastro to Thessaloniki in northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old hijacker, identified as Aleksandr Nana and
armed with six hand grenades, asked for about 793,650 U.S. dollars
and two weapons in return for releasing the hostages, the semi-
official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
However, later reports said that Nana, whose face is covered
with a ski-mask, would cross into Albania alone at the
Krystallopigi border post after releasing the hostages unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges India to Hand over 3 Officers' Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday urged India to
hand over three Pakistani military officers' bodies and not to
"play games" with them.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office spokesman Rafiq Altaf told journalists here that
Pakistan has since Tuesday contacted the Indian Foreign Ministry
and the International Committee of Red Cross in a bid to get those
bodies but failed so far.
</P>
<P>
He said India informed Pakistan Tuesday that three Pakistani
military officers' bodies were available and asked Pakistan to
accept them.
</P>
<P>
But the bodies, which have been taken to New Delhi "for some
propaganda purpose", are so far unavailable to related Pakistani
officials. "We even don't know where they are," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
India wanted a formal note on identification of the dead from
Pakistan for the return of the bodies, but Pakistan insisted that
the bodies should be handed over before any identification, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to the names given by the Indian side, the three dead
are separately Captain Iftikhar, Major Iqbal and Captain Karnal
Shakh.
</P>
<P>
They are among those missing in Indian ambushes or Indian
attacks on the Line of Control during the two-month fighting in
Kashmir, according to Altaf.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indians are playing games on the bodies and trying
to misuse them to "prove what they want to prove", which is "a
very sad affair".
</P>
<P>
Touching upon another issue, the spokesman said the Line of
Control is the cease-fire line mapped out according to the Simla
Agreement in 1972, and "it is just a line of control and no more
than that".
</P>
<P>
No one can infuse new meaning to the Line of Control, he
stated.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kashmir dispute is not a border dispute, but is an
issue of the fate of the Kashmiri people.

<HEADLINE> Intruders to Be Treated as "Hostile" After July 16: India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- India sternly warned Pakistan
Wednesday that any intruder found in the Kargil sector of Kashmir
after July 16 deadline for withdrawal would be treated as
"hostile" towards India.
</P>
<P>
"We expect Pakistan to keep its commitment on the time frame
under which the withdrawal must take place," a spokesman of the
External Affairs Ministry said at the regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the deadline, he added, "enemy personnel seen on our
side of the so-called line of control (LoC) would be treated as
hostile and dealt with accordingly."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made these remarks in response to a question on a
report quoting the Pakistani Foreign Office that no deadline of
July 16 had been agreed to for pull-out of the intruders during
the meeting of the Directors General of Military Operations of the
two countries last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from Kargil
that Indian troops moved very close to the LoC in Batalik and

<HEADLINE> China's Military Indignant Over Taiwan Leader's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) --  The Liberation Army Daily of
China says in a commentary that will appear tomorrow that the
officers and men of the People's Liberation Army are extremely
indignant about the separatist remarks made recently by Taiwan's
Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army has made big strides in
modernization and formalization and is determined enough and
strong enough to guard national sovereignty and territorial
integrity, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army has been entrusted with the
sacred mission of guarding national sovereignty and territorial
integrity, it says, and the Chinese government has constantly
called for a peaceful reunification of the motherland, but has
never undertaken to renounce the use of force.
</P>
<P>
 It goes on to say that it fully supports the solemn and just
stand of the Chinese government and is closely monitoring the
developments in the Taiwan island.
</P>
<P>
 In the battle for reunification and against divisiveness, the
paper says, the army will take the will of the state as its
supreme will and the nation's interest as its supreme interest,
and it will never tolerate separatist conspiracies or sit idly by
and watch even an inch of territory being cut off without taking
action.
</P>
<P>
 On July 9, Lee told a German radio station that cross-straits
relations should be defined as "state-to-state or at least special
state-to-state relations" and this was later echoed by Taiwanese
officials who said that cross-straits talks are "bilateral talks
between two states."
</P>
<P>
The paper says that Lee Teng-hui is playing with fire again,
and, in answer to a question about why he is doing so, it says he
is attempting to undermine the "one China" principle and to split
Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
 He tore off his masks and exposed his ugly divisive side when
he broke away from his usual guise of being committed to
runification of the motherland, it says. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Asks Local Governments Prepare for Yangtze Flood Fight (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji visited Hubei and
Jiangxi provinces on Monday and Tuesday to make arrangements for
the fight against the summer flooding.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here, Zhu asked all local governments of areas
along the Yangtze River to do their best in preparing for the
flood fight and ensure the quality of flood control projects in
order to guarantee the safety of the lives and properties of
millions of people.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China won the fight against last summer's floods,
but that is no reason to relax and neglect this year's work,
because it has been not unusual for the Yangtze to flood several
years in succession.
</P>
<P>
He laid out five requirements for local governments and
departments of the central government for this year's flood
control work:
</P>
<P>
-- A responsibility system is to be implemented by provincial
governments to make people responsible for every section of dikes.
If problems emerge and major losses occur because of poor work
performances, the relevant officials will be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
-- Immediate checks on flood control projects are needed,
especially on dike quality, along the Yangtze River. Weak points
need to be reinforced or rebuilt if necessary. Officials or
contractors who do faulty work are to be punished in accordance
with the law. Top provincial officials need to go to the dikes
themselves to inspect project quality and to see that potential
risky places are dealt with.
</P>
<P>
-- Manpower and flood control materials need to be got ready
ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
-- Dike defenses, especially at the most dangerous parts, need
to be improved and dike patrols are to be carried out 24 hours a
day.
</P>
<P>
-- Relief work needs to be taken care of right away if certain
areas are flooded, to keep losses at a minimum.

<P>
The premier emphasized the importance of quality of embankments.
The central government has spent a huge amount of money on water
conservation projects since last summer's devastating floods, he
said, but the real effect of this enormous investment is decided
by project quality.
</P>
<P>
He asked for a permanent-responsibility system, in which all
those involved in a project, from leading administrative officials
and officials of those units responsible for the designing and
construction will be held accountable and will be investigated in
case of a major accident.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed the importance of scientific designing and
construction. The designing of flood control projects should be
conducted by qualified units and examined by authoritative
organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked for strict implementation of an open and fair bidding
system and for strict supervision and management to ensure the
quality of projects and said that anyone who diverts or skims
money off special funds for water conservation projects will face
severe penalties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will continue to ban illegal
logging along the upper reaches of the Yangtze to prevent soil
erosion and improve the ecology of the Yangtze basin.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, who
is director of the State Flood Control Headquarters, and top
officials from the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and
Jiangsu and the city of Chongqing.

<HEADLINE> Expedition to Search Bodies of Hong Kong Climbers Missing 11 Months Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- About 16 Chinese climbers,
including several from Hong Kong and Taiwan Province, on Wednesday
launched an expedition to recover the bodies of three Hong Kong
climbers died in snowstorm 11 months ago at Mt. Bogda.
</P>
<P>
Chan King-chuen, Lam Chi-wai and Yeung Chi-ho went missing at 5,
080 meters on August 15, 1998 when they attempted to scale the 5,
445-meter peak in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Ziyun, head of the searching expedition, said on Wednesday
that they hope to find bodies or relic of the trio which may be
exposed with the melting of snow and ice in the summer.
</P>
<P>
The expedition said the missing climbers may either dropped to
their death at 5,080 or died in sleeping as heavy snowstorm hit
them unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the Ngok Fung Rock Climbing Society, of which the
missing trio were members, the Xinjiang Mountaineering Association
and the Chinese Army had put up a joint rescuing operation, which
was greatly hampered by heavy snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers only found an empty tent with equipment buried in
snow at 4,700 meters. They stopped the operation on August 30,
fearing the trio had died.

NANNING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Higher People's Court of south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region today announced the
result of its second-instance trial of Li Chenglong, former deputy
mayor of Guigang City, and upheld a lower court ruling of death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
He was also stripped of all political rights, fined 100,000
yuan worth of personal property, and had to return all the money
and gifts he received as bribes.
</P>
<P>
The court investigation found that, from 1991 to 1996 when Li

from 21 individuals and organizations that were worth 3.74 million
yuan, along with 25,000 U.S. dollars and 10,000 HK dollars in cash.
</P>
<P>
When he was arrested in December 1996, his personal assets were

<HEADLINE> Cohen Stresses Greece's Role in Balkan Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen stressed on Wednesday Greece's leading role in the
reconstruction of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the U.S. embassy in Athens,
Cohen, who arrived in Greece on Tuesday for an official two-day
visit, said that Greece had a very significant role in the Balkan
reconstruction effort.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the European Union leaders decided to base its
agency for the reconstruction of the Balkans in the northern Greek
city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
To participate in the reconstruction effort, the U.S.
government also intended to create a trade office in the northern
Greek city.
</P>
<P>
As for Greek's relations with Turkey, Cohen described the talks
at high-ranking Foreign Ministry level that were to begin soon as
"very important".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was now encouraging Greece and Turkey to find a
peaceful solution to their disputes, but the U.S. did not seek to
become in any way an arbitrator or in any way to pressure either
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of terrorism, Cohen said that the U.S. condemned
all forms of terrorism. The U.S. would look positively on an
exchange of information and cooperation with Greece in combating
terrorism, he added.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, Cohen met with Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis, Foreign Minister George Papandreou and the main
opposition New Democracy leader Costas Karamanlis to discuss Greek-
Turkish relations, terrorism, the Cyprus problem and matters of
bilateral interest.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's top security body on
Wednesday promised to investigate into the unauthorized police
attack on the Tehran University dormitory compound, which
triggered a six-day unrest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC)
Hassan Rowhani told a massive rally in Tehran University that the
SNSC, headed by President Mohammad Khatami, would investigate the
recent incidents and inform the public of the outcome, the Islamic

</P>
<P>
Rowhani, also vice Majlis (parliament) speaker, also assured
that the government has full control over the situation.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of university students clashed with anti-riot police
in recent days in the wake of the police assault on the Tehran
University dormitory last Thursday night following a student rally
protesting the newly-approved press law and the closure of the
leading moderate daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
Millions of people Wednesday gathered in Tehran University and
streets nearby, condemning the recent police attack on student
hostels and the consequent unrest.
</P>
<P>
In a seven-point resolution, the demonstrators called on the
authorities to identify and punish those involved in the attack
and bring an end to the unrest during the past six days, the worst
since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar FM Leaves for Sri Lanka, Bangladesh on Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung
left here Wednesday afternoon on a six-day official visit to Sri
Lanka and Bangladesh to strengthen bilateral ties with the two
South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
As the first leg of his journey, U Win Aung will stay in Sri
Lanka for three days and then proceed to Bangladesh Saturday for
another three days on the second leg of his tour.
</P>
<P>
U Win Aung's trip to South Asia comes after his tour of all the
 Southeast Asian nations except Cambodia in the first half of this
 year.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman
Kadirgamar came to Yangon, during which an agreement on the
establishment of a Joint Commission for Bilateral Cooperation was
signed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
There was only a one-million-dollar investment project of Sri
Lanka in Myanmar by the end of February this year. Sri Lanka has
had some imports from Myanmar in the past few years, but it
offered no exports to Myanmar, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, former Myanmar foreign minister U Ohn Gyaw
visited Dhaka and discussions were made on repatriation of
Myanmar refugees from Bangladesh, border trade and cooperation in
joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Later in November that year, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad visited Yangon, during which an agreement on the
inland boundary of the northern part of the Naaf River was signed.
The Myanmar-Bangladesh boundary is made up of the Naaf River part
and the inland part.
</P>
<P>
The two countries initiated formal border trade at Maungtaw
(Myanmar)- Teknaf (Bangladesh) trade point in September 1995.
Their bilateral trade stands at about 8 million U.S. dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are all members of the
BIMST-EC, a sub-regional economic grouping formed in June 1997 by
Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand bordering the
Bay of Bengal.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Genocide Suspect's Extradition Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The extradition case
concerning Bernard Ntuyahaga, a former Rwandan army officer wanted
by both Rwanda and Belgium for his role in the 1994 Rwanda
genocide, is adjourned to July 28.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga was brought to the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court
in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam Wednesday, but his counsel
Jwain Mwaikusa said that a Belgian lawyer to defend the accused
has not arrived yet.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian lawyer, Luc de Temmerman, has mailed his curriculum
vitae, professional certificates and other needed documents to
Tanzania's Chief Justice applying to jointly defend Ntuyahaga, but
the Chief Justice has not made any response so far, Mwaikusa told
the court.
</P>
<P>
Even when the Chief Justice endorses the application, time is
still needed to hear the case as Temmerman will travel to Spain
until July 22, Mwaikusa said.
</P>
<P>
"I pray for another mention date in two weeks time," he said.
The Principal Resident Magistrate Projestus Rugazia, who presided
over the case, agreed to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Major Ntuyahaga, the former head of Logistics at Kigali
military camp in Rwanda, allegedly murdered former Rwandan Prime
Minister Agathe Uwiningiyimana and 10 Belgium U.N. peace-keepers
escorting her in the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old man fell into the hand of the Tanzanian
government in March this year after the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), based in Arusha in north Tanzania,
dropped charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against
him and released him in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga was re-arrested by the Tanzanian police and wanted by
both Rwanda and Belgium for extradition and trial.
</P>
<P>
At present, Ntuyahaga is defended by Tanzanian lawyer,
Mwaikusa, a teacher at the Law Department of the University of Dar
es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
However, the accused alleged that he has language problems and
needs Temmerman, who has been his lawyer since 1995, to work
together with Mwaikusa.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga's case has been adjourned several times since it was
heard by the Kisutu court on May 12 this year.
</P>
<P>
Mwaikusa later told Xinhua that when the case comes two weeks
from now, he believes the Chief Justice will have decided to say
yes or no to the Belgian lawyer's application.
</P>
<P>
"If he says no, I'll immediately ask for a hearing date so that
we proceed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If he says yes... hopefully I will be able to know the
decision before that date (July 28) then I'll communicate with
this man there to tell him ' now you have been allowed. So please
make arrangements to come down here'... " he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Publishes Policy Initiatives on Banking Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) Thursday published a package of policy initiatives to
reform the local banking market and to improve safety and
soundness of the local banking sector.
</P>
<P>
These initiatives are largely drawn from the recommendations
contained in the Banking Sector Consultancy Study published in
January this year, said David Carse, deputy chief executive of
HKMA, at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Two of the more prominent features of this reform package
concern the deregulation of the remaining interest rate rules and
enhancing depositor protection in Hong Kong, Carse said.
</P>
<P>
Having carefully considered the views of the banking industry
and other non-bank organizations, such as the Consumer Council,
the HKMA plans to deregulate the remaining interest rate rules
within a shorter time scale than that recommended by the
consultants, while ensuring that this takes place in a relatively
stable economic and financial environment.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of deregulation, scheduled to take place on
July 1, 2000, will see the restrictions on the remaining
regulated time deposits lifted.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate rules on current and saving accounts will be
deregulated together in the second phase, which would take place
12 months after the first phase.
</P>
<P>
On depositor protection, the HKMA considers it appropriate to
carry out a full study in the first half of 2000 into the
feasibility and desirability of a deposit insurance scheme or
other forms of depositor protection in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Regarding other measures to strengthen the safety and soundness
of the banking system, the HKMA clarified its role as the lender
of last resort in a policy statement announced last month.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA will also continue its work on improving the
disclosure framework for all authorized institutions in Hong Kong
and is taking steps to develop a more formalized risk-based
approach to banking supervision.
</P>
<P>
On the banking sector reform side, the HKMA will undertake a
thorough review next year of ways to convert the current three-
tier system of authorization into a two-tier system.
</P>
<P>
It will also take immediate measures to relax the one branch
policy currently applicable to most foreign banks and to allow
access by restricted license banks to the Real Time Gross
Settlement system.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the initiatives arising from the recommendations
of the consultants, this package of policy initiatives contains
measures which the HKMA wishes to pursue in order to further
enhance safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
These additional initiatives include a feasibility study on
establishing a credit register to provide relevant information to
lending institutions on corporate enterprises' overall
indebtedness, and measures to promote higher standards of
corporate governance among authorized institutions through
strengthening the role of the board of directors.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Government Calls for NLD's Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government Wednesday
called for cooperation from the National League for Democracy
(NLD), an opposition political party in the country, by retracting
its 10-member "Committee Representing the People's Parliament
(CRPP) Elected in the 1990 General Election" formed last year.
</P>
<P>
"The government wishes the NLD to act in a more pragmatic and
sensible way so that a positive and a meaningful interaction can
be resumed without any interruption again," said a government
statement released here Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"The government believes that the process could be managed with
the NLD's retraction of the committee," the official Information
Sheet stated.
</P>
<P>
The government views with great concern over the committee's
saying that it will act as an interim parliament, it said, adding
that the NLD's move would not lead to a stable democracy, but to
institutional confusion, social chaos and genuine political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the NLD to take serious consideration on
the retraction call and contribute in a responsible and
constructive manner to achieving their common goals which are a
thriving economy and a stable, multiparty democratic system.
</P>
<P>
The statement charged the NLD with coming up with only the
symbolic gestures designed merely to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
The government has been in the process of "exchanging views"
with a number of NLD members since September 1998 by "inviting"
them to various government guest houses, the statement said,
adding that "almost all of them have returned home after a
successful exchange of views".
</P>
<P>
The statement disclosed that there remain 55 NLD members for
continuous views exchange.
</P>
<P>
The NLD won the general election held on May 27, 1990 with 396
parliamentary seats out of 485.
</P>
<P>
On June 23, 1998, the NLD demanded the government to convene
the parliament elected in the election, setting a deadline of 60
days, but was ignored by the government.
</P>
<P>
On September 16, the NLD unilaterally formed the 10-member
"CRPP" and set up the "People's Parliament".
</P>
<P>
As for the dialogue issue between the government and the NLD,
the biggest difference is that the NLD side insists on the
inclusion in dialogue of Aung San Suu Kyi, the party's general
secretary, while the government side sticks to the exclusion of
her.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Donor Countries Call for Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Afghan
donors visited Afghanistan recently and held talks with Taliban
leaders on a host of issues, calling for national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The delegation met with Taliban official for foreign affairs
Mohammad Hasan and apprised him of the decisions of the Afghan
Support Group (ASG) in Stockholm last month, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 Afghan donor countries, U.N. agencies and
non-governmental organizations attended the meeting, which had
expressed serious concern over the lack of national reconciliation
and continued hostilities in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting observed that military solution is no answer to the
Afghan issue and called for political solution to the 21-year-old
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has proceeded to northern Afghanistan for talks
with the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. All member countries of
ASG still recognize the ousted Afghan president, Burhanuddin
Rabbani, as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The donors conveyed to the Taliban authorities their concern
over the continued fighting, human rights violations and poppy
cultivation in Afghanistan and urged them to put an end to
hostilities, respect to human rights and take measures to combat
drug trafficking, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
ASG members include Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany,
Switzerland, Japan, Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"They told the Taliban that the donors can not take part in
long-term reconstruction planning of the war-shattered country
until durable peace is restored," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Stockholm meeting of ASG had considered the needs for
Afghanistan's reconstruction, but made no commitments in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The aid agencies had appealed for a total of 112 million U.S.
dollars for priority sectors last year. However, the donor
countries pledged 42 million dollars of which only 29 million
dollars were disbursed so far.

<HEADLINE> China Making Headway In Overseas Oil Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An oilfield, a long oil pipeline
and an oil refinery China built in Sudan has gone into operation,
a major breakthrough in China's overseas oil work.
</P>
<P>
China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) beat out other
international bidders on the project, which was built by its
subsidiary China Petroleum Engineering Construction Corp. (CPECC).
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of work, China finished the Muglad
Oilfield project. It has an annual production capacity of from 7.5
million tons to 10 million tons. It also involved building a 1,506-
km pipeline from Heglid in southern Sudan to the port of Sudan,
and an oil refinery that processes at least 2.5 million tons
annually.
</P>
<P>
This is China's largest overseas oil project ever that meets
international standards, according to CPECC's president Qin Anmin.
</P>
<P>
According to CNPC, China is actively exploring international
oil markets, while developing its own oil and gas resources with
foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
China plans to have a 10-million-ton-oil supply from overseas
a year by 2000 and 50 million tons of oil and 50 billion cubic
meters of gas by 2010.

According to Qin, China has made progress in these oil and gas
projects overseas and CPECC has signed overseas oil construction
contracts worth more than a billion U.S. dollars. It has also been
listed among the world's top 225 contractors for 5 consecutive
years.
</P>
<P>
Qin says that China is rich in oil resources and produces over
150 million tons of crude annually and has proven oil reserves of
17 billion tons, putting it in the 5th and 9th place respectively
in the world.
</P>
<P>
He explains that China's petroleum development strategy is to
rely mainly on domestic resources and to increase Sino-foreign
cooperation in its offshore and western oil and gas resources and
to increase entry into international oil markets.

<HEADLINE> UN Delegation to Discuss KR Trial With Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nation will send a
delegation to Cambodia to discuss the trial of Khmer Rouge
leaders, maybe the end of July or early August, a senior un
official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the Cambodia Daily, Special Representative of
the UN Secretary-General for Human Right in Cambodia Thomas
Hammarberg said that "I have been asked about the UN's position on
the 'mixed' tribunal to try those responsible for the massive
crimes during the rule of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s."
</P>
<P>
Is a UN delegation coming to discuss this? "The answer is yes,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hammarberg said that during his meeting with Prime Minister Hun
Sen in May, the later expressed his hope that the highest
standards to be applied in the trial and experts should assist
Cambodia in drifting the legislation to ensure that it would meet
the necessary requirements.
</P>
<P>
"I conveyed this message to the UN Secretariat and proposed a
positive and quick response," said Hammarberg.
</P>
<P>
The UN Office of Legal Affairs is at present analyzing the
aspects that should be covered by the tribunal law. "It is a major
step that the UN Secretariat implicitly has declared its
willingness to support such a trial," Hammarberg said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the next step, after the finalization of the
preparations, is to agree on a date for the arrival of the UN
mission.
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion I have received from New York is that they aim
for the end of July or early August," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hammarberg said that the preparation has
taken longer than expected. The reasons, he said, are that a
"mixed" tribunal would be a new phenomenon and there is no
experience from other countries to draw on when preparing a UN
approach.

However, Minister of Finance and Minister of Communication
Sheikh Ali Salem Al-Ali Al-Sabah was replaced by Ahmad Abdallah
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, another royal member and a banker.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ali has reportedly lost his seat due to his pragmatism
and unpopular policies, perhaps coupled with the threat of
questioning by opposition parliament members.

Former Minister of State for National Assembly Affairs,
Mohammad Deifallah Sharar succeeded Abdel Aziz Al-Dekheel as Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs.
</P>

support Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Sabah A-Ahmad Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Works Eid Hathal Saud Al-Rashidi is the
only elected MP selected in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of Health Adel Khaled Al-Subeih remained
in the cabinet as Minister of Electricity and Water, Minister
of State for Housing Affairs and Minister of Awqaf and
Islamic Affairs.

<P>
Abdul Wahab Mohammad Al-Wazzan, who also received his college
education in the U.S., was named the new Minister of Commerce and
Industry, and Minister of Labor and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's last cabinet resigned under the Constitution on July
4, after final results of the country's parliament elections were
officially announced.

<HEADLINE> PNA Agrees to Postpone Geneva Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) has agreed to postpone a U.N. sponsored conference scheduled
for Thursday to give the new Israeli government a chance to change
its policies on the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil
Sha'ath Wednesday told the Voice of Palestine radio that signatory
parties of the Fourth Geneva Convention are continuing their
intensive consultations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the sanctions that would be imposed on Israel
under the Geneva Conventions on the conduct of war could be
postponed another six months until the new Israeli government
practically proves its ban on settlements and land confiscation.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be held after verifying Israel's promise
which supports the convening of the conference while giving Prime
Minister Ehud Barak a chance to stop Israeli violations in the
occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
He also said that all United Nations members, except the United
States and Israel, approved the convening of the conference to
examine Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the conference would take binding
resolutions against further settlement activities which will
threaten peace in the region and aim at changing the demographic
and geographic status of the Palestinian lands, especially
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israel had asked for the postponement of the Geneva
conference for six months. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
told Israeli Radio that the conference "contravenes with the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
The postponement came after a constructive meeting between PNA
leader Yasser Arafat and Barak in the Erez Crossing Sunday. Both
sides vowed to implement all the agreements they signed and to
revive the long-deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly called last February for the
convening the meeting to ensure the Fourth Geneva Convention
on protecting civilians in occupied areas.

<HEADLINE> Former FIFA Head Respects Asian Demand for Extra Berth: Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Joao Havelange, the ex-president of
international soccer body FIFA, said he respected Asian demand of
an extra berth at the 2002 World Cup finals, according to Japan's
Kyodo news agency.
</P>
<P>
In a report filed from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Kyodo quoted
Havelange as saying that he understood the complexities of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
But the former chief said the AFC should realize the attention
of fans throughout the world is centered mainly on European and
South American nations.
</P>
<P>
"People would be less interested in the competition if
countries like Brazil, Argentina or Uruguay did not play the
finals," Havelange was quoted by Kyodo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Havelange pointed out that the number of European berths was
decreasing and the sacrifice of even half of a berth was not easy
for them.
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans once had 17 countries in the finals. Later, they
saw this number shrink to 16, and now only 15 European countries
can qualify for the World Cup final matches," he said.
</P>
<P>
FIFA offered the AFC a compromise deal in agreement with
European soccer body UEFA to give up half a European place to Asia.
</P>
<P>
AFC turned down the deal, saying South America could have co-
operated to offer another half a berth to the Asians.
</P>
<P>
Ten South American countries now have four and a half berths,
with a fifth placer in the qualifying round vying for a berth
against the winner of the Oceania group.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 14 (Xinhua) -- There has been a decreasing
number of inaccurate and negative foreign media reports on
Malaysia, the House of Representatives was told Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was due to the government's proactive response and
measures in dealing with such media reports, said Deputy Foreign
Minister Leo Michael Toyad.
</P>
<P>
He said recent feedback from Malaysian missions abroad revealed
that the foreign media had started to understand the government's
stand and action in dealing with the economic and financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The measures taken by the government so far have bring
positive results," he said.
</P>
<P>
The measures include briefings on current political issues and
economic recovery efforts to target groups like foreign government
leaders, politicians, businessmen and the media itself.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry and Malaysian missions had also written to
editors of the foreign media to clarify inaccurate reports made
against Malaysia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian missions had also published newsletters to inform
Malaysian students abroad informing them of the country's policies
and developments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Programs were arranged for foreign journalists and editors to
visit Malaysia to provide them with a clearer picture of the
country's progress and development, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Conservatives Show Strength Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's powerful conservatives
geared up their show of strength on Wednesday by staging
nationwide rallies against the student protests in the recent week.
</P>
<P>
Several millions of people from all walks of life gathered in
Tehran University and streets nearby, condemning the unrest in
the recent week, triggered by student protests to police
crackdown on student hostels.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of motor-cyclists rallied in streets of the capital
before noon, chanting slogans in support of the Islamic
revolution and upholding portraits of the late Iranian leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Shouting slogans against the United States and Israel, the
demonstrators reiterated their allegiance to Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Some demonstrators presented thousands of bunches of flowers to
the police thanking their efforts to deal with rioters, the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The conservative Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-
Nouri along with a number of cabinet ministers and Majlis
deputies took part in the grand rally.
</P>
<P>
A message from Khamenei read at the rally warned that "the
powerful Islamic system will severely crush down" any riots
supported by "certain bankrupt political groups and foreign
enemies."
</P>
<P>
Along with the massive rallies throughout the country,
thousands of Basijis (military volunteers) armed with sticks and
guns have been deployed in the capital city Tehran to control the
main streets.
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized by the conservative Islamic
Propagation Organization after Khamenei warned on Monday that the
"enemies" of the Islamic system were behind the recent unrest,
the worst since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The rallies suppressed the six-day student protests to the
police unauthorized assault on the Tehran University dormitory
complex on Thursday night triggered by a student rally
protesting the newly-approved press law and the closure of the
leading moderate daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
Anti-riot police shot into the air and fired tear gas to
disperse demonstrators who claimed the police had killed at least
seven students, injured dozens and arrested hundreds of others
during the assault on student hostels.
</P>
<P>
Students demanded dismissal of the conservative police chief
Brigadier General Hedayat Lotfian, the transfer of the police
commanding power to the moderate Interior Ministry and more
freedom for press.
</P>
<P>
The student protests put more pressure on the moderate
President Mohammad Khatami to speed up his promised reforms in
the face of strong challenges from powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomats and political analysts here said that the
grand rallies on Wednesday indicated a possible setback for the
Iranian reformists led by President Khatami.

<HEADLINE> Barak Heads For Washington to Restore Trust, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak left for Washington Wednesday for his first trip to the
U.S. aimed at restoring trust and intimacy between Israel and its
closest ally and coordinating positions on reviving the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the week-long trip, Barak will meet U.S. President Bill
Clinton four times and discuss his plan to resume peace talks
with Syria and the Palestinians as well as Israeli-American
strategic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After defeating former hard-line prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the May election, Barak had initially planned to
visit the United States as the first stop of his diplomatic drive
after taking office, but Washington persuaded him to meet with
Arab leaders first.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office last Tuesday, Barak has held talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
These talks have been designed mainly to restore the
atmosphere of trust, which was crumbled during the three-year
tenure of Netanyahu, thus paving way for the resumption of
negotiations with the Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel's ties with Washington also soured in the last three
years, with the two sides at bitter disputes over the hard-line
peace policy of the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
Washington has expressed enthusiasm over the election victory
of Barak, offering help to jump-start the Middle East peace
talks, both on the Palestinian and the Syrian tracks, which were
largely frozen under Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in Florida that he was as "eager as a kid with a
new toy" to meet Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak will also meet U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who plans a shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East region
in August, including talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, the
first time in many months.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks broke off in early 1996 over the fate
of the Golan Heights, the Syrian territory seized by Israel in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Since the Israeli election in May, Syria has sent a series of
signals to Israel indicating its eagerness to resume negotiations
with Barak's new government, offering to match every peace step
Barak takes.
</P>
<P>
"The signals from Damascus in recent weeks are clearly
positive," Barak said after meeting King Abdullah in Jordan late
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
After their first summit meeting Sunday at the Erez border
crossing between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip,
Barak and Arafat pledged to work together to overcome obstacles
on the road to peace.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides were at odds over Jewish settlement
expansion and the implementation of the Wye agreement, signed in
last October and then frozen by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Barak hopes to combine the implementation of Wye with the
final status talks, but Arafat demanded proper and full
implementation of the interim deal before the two sides start the
permanent negotiations.
</P>
<P>
While expected to ask for U.S. support for his negotiation
policy with the Palestinians and Syria, Barak will also seek to
reduce Washington's involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington should return to the role of "facilitator"
rather than mediator and arbitrator as it was in the negotiation
and implementation of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
Before departing for Washington, Barak met with visiting
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel in Jerusalem, saying Israel
views its relations with Turkey as "extremely important" and these
relations pose no threat or hindrance to Israel's relations with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are currently experiencing renewed momentum in the peace
process with our Arab neighbors," Barak said. "I intend to
continue this process with full determination until we reach a
comprehensive settlement."
</P>
<P>
President Demirel, the first foreign leader to visit Israel
since the launching of the new Israeli government, is on his
first leg of a regional tour, which will also take him to the
Palestinian-ruled areas and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Israel has maintained close military and economic ties with
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Students Storm Police Station, Seizing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Students of Obafemi Awolowo
University in the southwestern state of Osun Tuesday stormed the
State Police Headquarters in the state's capital Osogbo and
forcefully took away one of the cult suspects in police custody.
</P>
<P>
The students who arrived at the headquarters in four buses
claimed that they handed the suspect, Efosa Idahosa to the police
so that his confessions could be recorded by security agents and
"then from here take him to Lagos to go and face the world."
</P>
<P>
Although they were persuaded by police that Efosa's being with
them would help in their investigation to unravel the
circumstances that led to the killing of eight students, the
students insisted that "Efosa must be released to us."
</P>
<P>
Even though there were some handful of policemen around, they
did not resist the irate students who later burst into songs.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Wednesday quoted a student as explaining
why they took laws into their hands.
</P>
<P>
"We brought Efosa here by ourselves and we want to go with him.
We are not taking him away to kill him but to make him confess his
sins," said the student.
</P>
<P>
"In March this year, when seven secret cult members were
apprehended, we handed them over to the police but they claimed
that they did not have any evidence to prosecute them. The boys
were released, now, see the result, they in turn killed about
eight of us. " he added.
</P>
<P>
Five students of Nigeria's Obafemi Awolowo University including
the secretary-general of the Student Union were murdered last
Saturday following an attack on them by above 200 secret cultists.
 Three students injured in the accident died latter in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
The cultists in black carried out the bloody attack may still
poses a threat to other students at the Obafemi Awolowo Teaching
Hospital complex where the bodies of the victims have been
deposited, warned Lanre Adeleke, president of the Student Union
who narrowly escaped death.
</P>
<P>
The late secretary-general of the Student Union was shot on the
head together with his friend, while sleeping in their rooms
around 4:30 local time Saturday and his body was taken to the
corridor by the cultists.
</P>
<P>
Some students reported secret drum sound around midnight and
teamed out to search before the attack took place.
</P>
<P>
The students, according to the report, was very angry at the
authorities' silence at the accident and vowed to wage a war
against the cultists on their campus and beyond.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reiterates "Three-No" Policy on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States reiterated on
Tuesday its "three-no" policy and the "one China" position which
it sees as in conformity with America's national interests.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin, Spokesman for the State Department, told a regular
news briefing that "We do not support Taiwan independence. We do
not support Taiwanese membership in organizations where statehood
is required. We do not support a two-China policy or a one-China,
one-Taiwan policy."
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the announcement when asked whether the United
States would adhere to the "one China" policy if "some of the
Chinese people" tried to break away from the country.
</P>
<P>
The "three-no" policy on Taiwan was brought to life by
President Bill Clinton on June 30 last year in Shanghai when he
paid a state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
"We have a one-China policy. That has been our policy for some
time now," Rubin said. "Our one-China policy is based on our
national interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin described U.S. position on Taiwan's future as "clear and
unchanging." "We believe that it is a matter for the Chinese
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to resolve," and "we
have an abiding interests and concern that any resolution be
peaceful," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States "encouraged both sides to engage
in meaningful and substantive dialog."
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the remarks at a time when cross-strait relations
got strained after Lee Teng-hui publicly announced on July 9 that
Taiwan and the Chinese mainland should be "state-to-state," or "at
least special state-to-state relations."

<HEADLINE> EU to Lift Ban on British Beef Exports from 1 August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Farm
Commissioner Franz Fischler confirmed Wednesday that the EU is set
to lift the ban on British beef exports on August 1.
</P>
<P>
"The decision will be made in an hour and will come into force
from the first of August," Fischler told a BBC TV breakfast news
program.
</P>
<P>
The beef ban was imposed three years ago in response to
consumer fears about the spread of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), or the so-called "mad cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
EU veterinary experts who had insisted on stringent government
measures to reduce the risk of the BSE have given a final approval
to the lifting of the ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
"What has changed is very clear. First of all, we have got
positive advice from our scientists. Secondly, we did a lot of
inspections in the United Kingdom and the results are now all
positive, so it is justified now to lift the ban," Fischler said.
</P>
<P>
"If I wouldn't be convinced about that, then I would not vote
in favor to lift the ban," he said, adding that the EU is
convinced that British beef is safe under the conditions which are
in place in the future.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the ban is expected to trigger a major marketing
campaign to regain lost export sales which have cost the British
beef industry about 2.3 billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
QINGDAO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese marine safety monitors
discovered some 6,300-sq-km of red tide yesterday in Liaodong Bay
in the northeast area of the Bohai Sea off the coast of northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
This is the second occurrence of a large-scale red tide in the
Bohai Sea waters in a month. On July 2, 1,500-sq-km of red tide
was found in coastal waters in the western Bohai Sea and remained
there for four days.
</P>
<P>
In September and October 1998, Liaodong Bay suffered from 3,000-
sq-km of red tide for more than 20 days, causing a serious impact
on the local ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Red tide is mainly caused by pollutants from the land and
excessive marine cultivation.

<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
provide a better environment for Internet development in the
country, an official with the Ministry of Information Industry (
MII) said here today.
</P>
<P>
A report on Internet development released today by the China
Internet Network Information Center said Chinese Internet users
are concentrated mainly in large and developed cities and
provinces such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong Province in
south China.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of users in most remote areas is lower than
1 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Internet surfers are most dissatisfied with slow net-surfing
speeds, high fees, and insufficient information, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Educational and technological information and medical, cultural,
and tourism information are in short supply on the 'Net, some
users complain.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yin, director of the development and planning section of
MII, said that band width, a key indicator of Internet capacity,
does not meet users' demand. Related departments are making
efforts to catch up with international standards in this regard in
a bid to increase surfing speed, he said.
</P>
<P>
China slashed telecommunications fees in March this year, but
the payment system still has room for improvement, Chen said. He
did not rule out the possibility that China may cut down related
fees in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He said China's security department has stepped up efforts to
establish network and information security systems, and China will
come up with a schedule early next century to provide all primary
and secondary schools in China with Internet access.

Welfare and Development (DSWD) has organized a team to render and
sustain 24-hour disaster operation, especially in areas that may
be hit by the Mayon volcano eruption.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Vice President Gloria Arroyo, also Secretary of the
DSWT, said Wednesday that the team is composed of action officers,
information team, report and data management team, monitoring
team, reinforcement team and general administrative support teams.
</P>
<P>
The department has trained its officers in the provincial, city
and municipal Social Welfare and Development Offices and other
social workers and volunteers in the local government units in
line with the operation, Arroyo said.
</P>
<P>
Among the subjects that were tackled were disaster management,
relief operation and management of evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo assured that the department is already prepared for the
people who will be affected by the volcano's eruption.
</P>
<P>
Ready-to-eat food and other relief items have been made
available any time at the department's regional office, while
relief support may also be provided by its central office.
</P>
<P>
There will be no problem in the supply of rice because the
National Food Authority has agreed to allow the department to
withdraw sacks of rice from its warehouse which will then be
distributed to people the affected areas, Arroyo added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Probing Fraud Against Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The presidency of Nigeria has
directed the State Security Service and Nigeria Intelligence
Agency to investigate alleged fraud on qualifications by a news
magazine against Alhaji Ibrahim Buhari, speaker of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The directive is to unearth the truth behind the fraud and save
the administration from embarrassment, The Post Express newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The News magazine alleged in its cover report this week that
Buhari lied about his age and claimed educational qualifications
he did not have.
</P>
<P>
It could not be ascertained the time limit given to the two
security agencies, but their investigations are expected to be
concluded in a record time, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the House from the ruling People's
Democratic Party (PDP) have set up a 10-member committee to
investigate the allegations of fraudulent claims by the Speaker.
</P>
<P>
Olisa Agbakoba of Senior Advocate of Nigeria and Abdul Oroh,
executive director of Civil Liberties Organization have called on
the Speaker to step down to give room for unimpeded investigation
into the matter.
</P>
<P>
Deputy leader of the House of Representative Chief Mao
Chuabunwa disclosed the setting up of an investigation panel,
adding that the ruling party decided to take the step because the
allegations were too grave to be ignored.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that if the House confirmed that what the
magazine wrote about the Speaker was true, a motion could be moved
to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Speaker of the House Chibudum Nwoche described
the allegations as "politically motivated", hence the allegations
should be discountenanced.
</P>
<P>
He said, "what we saw in the magazine were the same things we
saw during the campaign," but he added, "if we confirm that the
allegations are true, it is left for us to move a motion."
</P>
<P>
Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi, member of the Alliance for Democracy
(AD) representing Lagos Central Senatorial District said that he
had confirmed from Toronto University of Canada, where the Speaker
claimed to have graduated from, his name could not be found in the
university's record.
</P>
<P>
According to the senator, "it is not only the integrity of the
Speaker that is at stake, but also the whole National Assembly and
the Fourth Republic."
</P>
<P>
Olisa Agbakoba noted that the incident is a test case for the
Obasanjo administration and advised the Speaker to step down to
allow uninfringed investigation.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued on Tuesday by the press office to the
Speaker said that the Speaker had briefed his solicitor Chief
F.R.A. Williams on taking appropriate steps against the magazine.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the solicitor has given the
magazine a 72- hour ultimatum to retract and render an unreserved
apology.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Vows to Curb Speculators' Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada assured
the public Wednesday that his economic team is ready to foil any
move by currency speculators in manipulating the movement of the
peso in the market.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said newly-appointed Governor Rafael Buenaventura of
the Philippine Central Bank, as well as the rest of his economic
team, is now crafting measures to thwart this "get-rich-quick"
scheme of speculators.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot discount the activity of these speculators who want
to earn a fast buck. That's why I warned them so that their moves
won't affect our economy," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
From last Friday's 38.50, the peso continued to appreciate
against the U.S. dollar, with Tuesday's trading closing at 38.34
to one dollar following the warning aired by the president and his
economic managers against speculators in a regular TV program.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said the president also called on Filipino
businessmen to join forces with government in sustaining the
country's status as the leader in economic recovery among Asian
crisis-hit economies, instead of engaging in currency speculation
and other unethical trade practices.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president noted that the foreign exchange reserve
was at an all-time high of 14 billion dollars, making it easier
for the Central Bank to counter any pressure on the peso
investigated by currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
When the peso suffered a sharp fall last year, the country's
foreign exchange reserves reportedly amounted to less than 8
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Takes Steps to Stamp out Unfair Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan state minister in charge
of planning and investment Gabriel Opio has assured investors that
the government is committed to stamping out unfair trade and
irregularities, a local report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Opio was in reaction to a foreign company's report that without
firmer and more even-handed implementation of government
regulation, the climate does not encourage further investment in
the local textile sector.
</P>
<P>
The state minister said in a statement that the strengthening
of the Uganda Revenue Authority administration and management
systems together with the real rationalization of anti-smuggling,
dumping and corruption, will ensure growth of the country's
textile industry.
</P>
<P>
Other measures, he said, included legalizing the awarding of 10
percent commission to informers of smuggling activities and tax
evasion and increased funding for the Auditor General by 39
percent and for Inspector General of the Government by 47 percent
in this financial year.

BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Fund for Women (UNIFEM) today presented the first public screening
in China of the video-conference titled "A World Free of Violence
Against Women."
</P>
<P>
The video-conference was held this year on March 8 at the
United Nations General Assembly Hall to mark the last Women's Day
of this century, with the participation of people at other places
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The conference was organized by UNIFEM offices all over the
world to launch a global campaign to end violence against women,
and millions of people around the world watched the conference via
satellite or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"Today's event is especially significant not only because this
is the first time this video-conference is being viewed in China,

participation in this global campaign," said Noeleen Heyzer,
executive director of UNIFEM.

<HEADLINE> La Nina Creating Difficulties in Flood Forecasts for the Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese meteorologists are blaming
the caprice of La Nina for causing uncertainty in their flood
forecasts for the Yangtze River whose lower reaches are still in
the grip of rainy weather.
</P>
<P>
Ji Xuewu, a senior engineer with the Yangtze River Water
Resources Committee, said that since the beginning of summer,
weaker than usual sub-tropical high pressure along the river
valley has led to a down flow of cold fronts from the north,
bringing more rainfall to the region.
</P>
<P>
The monitor center is finding it difficult to locate the rain
belt, which is deviating from its normal route parallel to the
river.
</P>
<P>
The uncertain movement of the subtropical high pressure is
probably a sign of the La Nina phenomenon, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze has been relatively high since last month, but
thanks to an unobstructed flood discharge path, no heavy
casualties have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The second crest passed Hankou City in central China's Hubei
Province yesterday, with a water level of 27.76 meters, 0.46
meters above the danger mark.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Arrives in Baghdad to Close UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. technical team to remove
toxic chemical substances left behind in the Baghdad laboratory of
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq arrived in
Baghdad on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team, sent by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and
led by South Africa's chemical production technologist Dirk van
Niekerk, is to meet Annan's special representative in Baghdad
Prakash Shah and three senior diplomats from the Chinese, Russian
and French embassies in Baghdad before it will carry out its
mission.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team comprises four chemical experts from the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague
and an independent biological weapons expert.
</P>
<P>
These U.N. experts are from China, Russia, Poland and
Germany. Yako Yalato, a Finnish, former Assistant Director of
U.N. Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Center, will act as
guide for the technical team.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. reached an agreement last month on the
composition of the technical team to visit UNSCOM's Baghdad
laboratory, where one kilogram of mustard gas and VX gas were left
behind by UNSCOM before it withdrew from Iraq last December.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has not resumed its work of weapons inspections in Iraq
since last December when the United States and Britain launched
four-night airstrikes against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Manila Moves to Train Filipino Seaman Computer Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has taken
fresh steps to make the sailors computer literate so as to further
sharpen their global competitiveness, a senior official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government has introduced a new computer literacy course
for seamen to better comply with the Standards of Training
Certification and Watchkeeping Convention, a requirement for a
country to be appreciated by the International Maritime
Organization, said Reynaldo Regalado, chief of the Philippine
Overseas Employment Administration (POEA).
</P>
<P>
Last month, President Joseph Estrada ordered the Overseas
Workers Welfare Administration, the POEA and other government
agencies concerned to intensify efforts to improve the seamen's
skills in this front.
</P>
<P>
A total of 49,515 Filipino seamen were deployed abroad from
January to April this year, slightly higher than the 48,373
sailors who went overseas in the same period of 1998, according to
POEA records.
</P>
<P>
Regalado said the new computer course for seafarers, which was
developed by the National Maritime Polytechnic School last summer,
was tailored for the facilities of a high-tech ship.
</P>
<P>
This course, he said, covers concepts on information processing
systems computer organization, operating systems and application
systems software, networking concepts and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a maritime mission led by Labor Secretary Bienvenido
Laguesma received assurance from maritime employers in five
European countries -- Greece, Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom
and the Netherlands -- that they would continue hiring
Philippines' seafarers to man their ships.

<HEADLINE> Asia's E-commerce Applications Markets to Expand Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific market for
Internet commerce applications has been enjoying a robust growth
over the past year, and will likely remain that way through 2003,
according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Internet commerce application software enables companies to
conduct business on-line. The Asia-Pacific market, excluding Japan,
topped 20.1 million U.S. dollars in revenue in 1998, up 104
percent from a year ago, said the U.S. market research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
The IDC estimates a 95 percent growth to 40.45 million dollars
this year and 167.76 million dollars in 2000. By 2003, the market
is projected to top 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the IDC, two types of software should warrant
special attention over the next two years. One application allows
Web sites to better manage on-line content; the other helps sites
improve their interaction with customers. Both will be
increasingly important to companies betting their future on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The IDC expects to see a tremendous growth in the number of E-
commerce software vendors indigenous to the region, providing
multilingual, business-to-business and business-to-consumer
software applications in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Technology localization will be the key success factor of
penetrating the Asian markets, the IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Right now Australia and New Zealand are the leading driver of
sales for E-commerce software vendors in the region. This is
mainly a result of the use of English as the main language medium,
a relatively mature information technology infrastructure and high
Internet user penetration. In addition, the hottest markets for E-
commerce software adoption among innovative companies are
Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan, the IDC said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Yang Zhengquan, director of the
China International Publishing Group (CIPG), said here today that
the country intends to hasten the development of international
publishing and adopt advanced computer network technology to
provide readers worldwide with a greater understanding of China.

</P>
<P>
"The CIPG will make greater effort to carry out its goal --
providing the world with a better understanding of China and
making China more open to the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a bridge of cultural exchange connecting China and rest of
the world, the CIPG initiated copyright trade and cooperation with
foreign counterparts in 1980, and has so far conducted a variety
of international copyright transactions.
</P>
<P>
The CIPG ranks first among China's publishing organizations in
terms of copyright trade with foreign countries, while many books
printed by the CIPG have entered major publishing and issuing
markets in Japan, the United States, and European countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, English, and French versions of "Three Thousand

<HEADLINE> Barak Vows to Abide by Agreements With Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
pledged to comply with all agreements his country had signed with
the Palestinians as part of the efforts to revive the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the pledge Tuesday night during his talks with
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein at the southern port city of
Aqaba of the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Barak also voiced hope to resume Israel's
peace talks with Syria and he said, without elaborating, that
Damascus had sent "very positive signals" on the peace talks last
week, the semi-official Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Barak paid a brief visit to Jordan Tuesday before heading for
Washington for a summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton on reviving
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak briefed Abdullah on the outcome of his just-concluded
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat during which he renewed commitments to peace
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He also paid tribute to what he described as a key role in the
peace process played by Jordan under King Abdullah and late King
Hussein Bin Talal, Abdullah's father who died of cancer in
February.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, Barak said he and Jordanian leaders had
discussed trade projects, the issue of building a joint airport
in Aqaba and water-sharing issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This was Barak's first visit to Jordan after he won a landslide
victory in the May 17 election which brought down his hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu from the Likud party.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon
remained virtually deadlocked during Netanyahu's three years in
office.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and other Arab countries have pinned hopes on Barak
to recommit Israel to peace in the region and to resume
peace talks with all Arab neighbors.

drought, we reap almost nothing and have to live on government
relief," he said.
</P>
<P>
The couple live in a three-room house made of sun-dried mud
bricks. They have no cattle or sheep nor a single piece of decent
furniture. All they have is a double bed and two cupboards.
</P>
<P>
"The government is preparing to help us move to a vast fertile
land in Dulan County in the Mongolian-Tibetan Autonomous
Prefecture of Haixi. Only by leaving this unproductive land can we
have a bright future," she said.
</P>
<P>
This expresses the ardent hope of poor people living in eastern
Qinghai, a multi-ethnic region on the northeastern tip of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the "Roof of the World." The
plateau covers an area of 721,200 square kilometers, making it
fourth in area after the autonomous regions of Xinjiang, Tibet,
and Inner Mongolia. Eastern Qinghai is densely populated and has a
harsh and arid environment resulting in low crop output. A great
number of farmers and herdsmen there still live below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
To lift these people out of poverty, the provincial government
plans to move 57,000 farmers from six over-farmed counties in
Haidong Prefecture in eastern Qinghai to Balong and Zongjia
townships in Dulan County where 366,000 hectares of arable land
remain to be opened up, and four rivers are nearby. The immigrants
comprise people of the Han, Hui, Tibetan, Tu and Salar.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of a poverty-relief program implemented by
the land-locked province, and implementation of this project will
effectively alleviate the destruction of vegetation and curb soil
erosion in Qinghai, said Guanbo, an official of the soon-to-be
settled area.

<P>
The funds will be used to plant trees and grass on 5,300
hectares of land, open up 21,300 hectares of wasteland, set up 126
resettlement villages in four townships, and build two reservoirs,
two power stations, 11 schools and 22 hospitals and clinics. A
national highway trunk road will be extended to Dulan County in
central Qinghai to facilitate trade and economic growth there.
</P>
<P>
The projected new area has for centuries been populated by
Mongolian herdsmen, and became a multi-ethnic area predominantly
inhabited by Mongolians when people of the Han and other ethnic
groups settled there a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
At present, the area is sparsely populated with only 5,736
residents. Mongolians number 3,717, accounting for 54 percent of
the total population, and the Han inhabitants totals 2,111, or 36.
8 percent. There are also 276 Tibetans, or 4.8 percent, and the
remainder are people of the Hui and Tu.
</P>
<P>
When the 57,000 immigrants are settled, the ratio of people of
the Han in the region will drop by five percent, and that of the
Mongolian people is expected to decline by one percentage point
because no more Mongolians are expected to move in.
</P>
<P>
The number of Tibetans will increase from 276 to 3,700, with
its ratio of the local population rising from 4.8 to six percent.
People of other ethnic groups will also rise to varying extents,
said Gao Hui'en, an official with the Qinghai Provincial Office
for Foreign-funded Projects of Poverty Alleviation and Development.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Keep Gold Reserves Untouched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese government has expressed
that it would not touch the country's gold reserves even though
the world's gold price is expected to drop further.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon will not sell off its gold reserves which is
considered one of the Lebanese economy's elements of strength,"
Prime Minister Salim Hoss said Tuesday at a parliament session,
the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was answering the question by parliament members over the
possibility of unloading million ounces of bullion to deal with
the fluctuating world gold market.
</P>
<P>
The price of gold sank last week to less than 256 U.S. dollars
an ounce for the first time for 20 years after the Bank of England
sold off massive amounts of its gold bullion.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices threatened to plummet further as dealers and
analysts speculated that other nations might unload their reserves.
</P>
<P>
Riad Salmeh, Lebanese Central Bank governor, estimated the
price of Lebanon's gold stocks at 2.8 billion dollars, down from
the 1993 peak of 3.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most of the gold was bought in the 1960s to support the
Lebanese pound.
</P>
<P>
"The use of gold to back the national currency is an internal
part of national security and not subject to the laws of the
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Lebanon should keep its gold and give the
Central Bank some freedom in administering it.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges More Debt Relief for Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Jubilee 2000-Zambia Campaign,
part of a world-wide anti-debt drive, has urged industrialized
countries to relieve more debt from poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The organization said in a statement issued in Lusaka Tuesday
that the recently announced package for debt relief under the G-7
initiative is not enough to make significant changes.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Wednesday quoted the statement
as saying that most poor countries will continue to pay more than
20 percent of government revenue toward servicing their foreign
debts even with the amnesty pledged by the G-7 industrialized
countries at their meeting in Cologne, Germany, last June.
</P>
<P>
Jubilee 2000-Zambia coordinator Barbara Kalima said the
framework under the G-7 debt initiative would only relieve Zambia
of about 900 million U.S. dollars from the stock of six billion
dollars in foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
This calls for vigorous campaign to achieve significant debt
cancellation that will improve people's life, Kalima said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that her organization, in collaboration with other
civic groups like trade union, students' and women's groups and
individuals, will fight for economic and social justice to improve
the living of the Zambians living in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, considering Zambia's population of about 10
million, the immense debt burden means that every woman, man and
child owes 650 dollars to international creditors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the southern African country spends 200 million
dollars annually on debt servicing, and is likely to be faced with
over 600-million- dollar annual debt servicing bills after the
year 2000.

Konbu Dangzhou, a Tibetan farmer in Balong Township of Dulan
County, said, "Life has changed a lot since my family moved here
from a hilly area in eastern Qinghai 10 years ago."
</P>
<P>
"We were given 1.5 hectares of land on which we built a 10-room
house with a courtyard and grew grain crops and vegetables. the
average annual net profit gained from grain production now exceeds
20,000 yuan, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The family has bought a tractor and a seeder and flour-milling
machine, and their house is equipped with modern furniture and a
full array of household appliances including a TV and VCD.
</P>
<P>
"Farm work in the village has been mechanized. When more
immigrants come here, I'll open a farm tool repair shop."
</P>
<P>
"The status of Mongolians and Tibetans will remain unchanged
and so will the regions inhabited by various ethnic groups," Gao
Gui'en said.
</P>
<P>
The wishes of the ethnic groups will be respected in the course
of settlement. Tibetans will live in a separate area near villages
inhabited by the Tu because they share similar customs and
religion -- Tibetan Buddhism. The Salar people will be placed in
an area next to Hui people because they share a belief in Islam.
Those who wish to live together with other ethnic groups may live
in a multi-ethnic area.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Gao said, all ethnic groups will retain their
existing modes of production, customs and habits, religious
beliefs and the traditional education.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Global Competitiveness Listing Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa was ranked the
47th in terms of competitiveness, dropping five places from last
year's global listing, and was seen by global executives as one of
the five least secure countries of the 59 surveyed in this year's
study.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 edition of the Global Competitiveness Report,
published yearly by the World Economic Forum and the Harvard
Institute for International Development, placed South Africa last
in terms of labor practices such as firing and hiring workers,
labor relations, work ethic and labor regulations.
</P>
<P>
The report, published by the Business Day newspaper Wednesday,
said that the labor component of the competitiveness index, which
is made up of eight indicators, seeks to measure the efficiency
(ease of hiring and sacking workers) and competitiveness of the
country's labor market, including costs relative to international
norms.
</P>
<P>
Other indicators making up the competitiveness index are
management, institutions, the state's role in the economy, the
trade and investment regime as well as infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The index seeks to show that competitive countries are those
that have underlying economic conditions to achieve rapid growth
over a number of years, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The study forecasts that South Africa, ranked the 45th in
growth terms, will have 2.3 percent annual gross domestic product
growth per capita in the period from the year 2000 to 2008.
</P>
<P>
This year's study added six more countries, with Mauritius
making its debut in the 29th position. Zimbabwe slipped to the
57th position from the 51st slot it occupied in 1997 and last
year.
</P>
<P>
The study noted that poor performers like Zimbabwe are
characterized by low rule of law, uncertainty of property rights
and poor infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Singapore maintained its leading position as the most
competitive country ranked, with Russia taking the dubious honor
of being the least competitive.

<HEADLINE> Two Shanghai Cyclists Arrive in Qinghai En Route To Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Two elderly men from Shanghai have
arrived on their bicycles at the Qaidam Basin in northwest China's
Qinghai province on their way to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Lin Zhiyou and Xu Guoqiang, together with four others, began
their Shanghai-Lhasa bicycle tour from Shanghai on May 18.
</P>
<P>
So far they have traveled through seven provinces including
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Gansu,
covering some 5,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The six are all members of the Shanghai Bicycle Tourists'
Association, with the youngest aged 62 and the oldest 68.
</P>
<P>
Lin and Xu told Xinhua they plan to meet their four other
partners in the Golmud City of the province, and then cycle along
the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to Lhasa, capital of southwest China's
Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
They said they plan to arrive at their destination at the end
of this month.
</P>
<P>
This year has been designated the Year of the Aged, and it is
also the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic
of China, the 40th anniversary of Tibet's Democratic Reform, and
the year of Macao's return to China.
</P>
<P>
That is why they chose this year for their tour, Lin said,
adding that they found the trip meaningful and enjoyable despite
some hardships.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he is very grateful to people they are meeting
along their way who often offer accommodations and assistance.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-nine persons were found
infected with filariasis in the northern part of the Philippines
recently, the Philippine News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Results of blood tests conducted by the local health
surveillance team in the city of Baikingon, Cagayan Province,
showed that 42 out of the 59 infected residents are males and 17
are females.
</P>
<P>
Team leader Dr. Joey Retuya noted that the figure comprises
only 4.3 percent of the 1,362 Baikingon residents who received the
examination.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Malaria Control Service of the
Department of Health-10 (DOH-10) recently held an entomological
survey to check the presence of mosquitoes which are possible
carriers of microfilaria.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that filariasis-carrying mosquitoes are
present in Baikingon.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, the local health authority has urged the
residents to destroy all possible breeding places of mosquitoes in
order to prevent the occurrence of filariasis and dengue in their
area.

The ocean and weather conditions over the two weeks of the
voyage have been most conducive to scientific observations and
research, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the team members have been experiencing longer
days and shorter nights as the ship nears the North Pole, with the
temperature hovering at about one degree C.
</P>
<P>
Xie Simei, a team meteorologist, said nephograms received on
the ship show that the sea ice is diminishing above 71 degrees
north latitude, a good indication for a smooth voyage.
</P>
<P>
Some floating ice can be seen near the ship, and visibility
will be five to ten nautical miles, according to weather forecasts.

<P>
The Snow Dragon, a modern icebreaker carrying scientists and
journalists, left Shanghai on July 1. This is China's first
expedition to the North Pole.

<P>
NANCHANG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered a cultural site dating back to the late New Stone Age
of 4,000 years ago in Yudu County in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, several local farmers unearthed a quantity
of pottery pieces covered with strange patterns in the Kuanshizhai
area in southern Yudu County. The discovery soon stirred the
interest of archeologists, who then conducted excavations of the
area.
</P>
<P>
They have so far unearthed refined stone articles and 50 pieces
of pottery including red pottery jars, kettles and cooking vessel.
</P>
<P>
The markings on these pieces consist of knots, circles,
bowstrings, and weaving patterns.
</P>
<P>
This discovery indicates human presence in the area 4,000 years
ago, said one archeologist, adding that the site will provide
valuable material for the study of the culture and history of
southern Jiangxi.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Prepares for Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan National Year 2000
(Y2K) Task Force is determined to complete the Y2K preparedness
efforts on time, the task force has said.
</P>
<P>
Local media Wednesday quoted a report of the task force as
saying that as a result of the National Task Force vigilance, "our
vision of 'life as normal' during the millennium date changes will
be attained in Uganda."
</P>
<P>
The report concentrates on critical sectors including aviation,
 electricity, oil supply, telecommunications, banking, revenue
collections and water and sewerage.
</P>
<P>
It examines the status of the plans and the actual Y2K
remediation work that has been completed.
</P>
<P>
It warns that three major dates may cause problems in old
computer systems: September 9, 1999 which may be interpreted as a
null date; January 1, 2000 which may be recognized as January 1,
1999 and February 20, 2000 which may not be recognized as a valid
leap year date.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K status assessment was done using the standard COMPARE
(Compliance Progress And Readiness) methodology used by the
Cartner Group in their Y2K testimony in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan national Y2K task force was set up in January, 1999
to spearhead the national effort in dealing with the Y2K problem.

<HEADLINE> Surging Demand in Telecom Industry to Drive Semiconductor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The current up-cycle for the
semiconductor and related industries worldwide could last as long
as seven years.
</P>
<P>
Instead of personal computers (PC) sales, the predicted growth
will come from the world's telecommunications sector, which is
rushing to keep up with demand created by the rising popularity of
the Internet and shift to global business networking models.
</P>
<P>
These views were offered by Fred Zieber, president of
Pathfinder Research, a U.S. high-tech business consulting and
market analysis firm focusing on most aspects of the chip industry.
He was speaking Tuesday at the annual exposition in San Francisco
hosted by trade association Semiconductor Equipment and Materials
International (SEMI)
</P>
<P>
SEMI members supply the equipment and materials used to make
semiconductors, or chips, the brains behind everything from
automobiles to wireless telephones. The industry is experiencing a
turnaround after a sharp downturn in 1998.
</P>
<P>
SEMI quoted Zieber as saying that the current up-cycle reflects
the revolution taking place in telecommunications, and more
specifically the Internet and World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
The chip equipment and materials industry's old reliable source
of revenues and profits, the PC, won't be driving the surge in
sales as the upswing progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications should be a large market, but is only a
fraction of the size of the PC market. Meanwhile, Zieber noted,
sales of PCs are slowing at the time their prices are falling.
</P>
<P>
According to a new report released Monday, SEMI members
predicted that worldwide semiconductor equipment sales in 1999
will reach 23.8 billion U.S. dollars, up nine percent from a year
ago. Last year, the market decreased almost 21 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Environment on Verge of Collapse: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- In the near future, Israelis
will have to go abroad if they want to enjoy nature or even a
clean beach, the local daily Jerusalem Post quoted a report on
the country's environment as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prepared by more than 100 scientists and experts, the report
declared that Israel's environment is "on the verge of collapse,"
citing irreversible salification of underground aquifers, declining
quality of air, piling-up of garbage and uncontrolled construction
which is eating away at open areas.
</P>
<P>
Besides issuing warnings, the report also sets new priorities
for dealing with the environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
Arguing the common claim that little can be done to improve
the environment without major capital investment, the report said
changes do not necessarily require massive government budgets.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that the government promote environmental awareness
and education, initiate legislation relating to land use, adopt
stricter European standards for vehicle emissions, and improve
public transportation by setting aside additional bus lanes.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends the establishment of a "popular lobby
for the environment" that would be alert to threats facing the
environment and press for immediate action.
</P>
<P>
Finally, "the polluter must pay" should become a rule, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Environment Ministry said he had asked
ministry experts to study the report and the ministry will
deal with it seriously.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Assists Over 1 Million Job Seekers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) - More than a million job seekers have
been assisted by the Philippine government in the past year, the
Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This record was lauded in a one-year performance report as an
achievement made as President Joseph Estrada moored employment
facilitation to his overall strategy to eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, the government has extended assistance to
457,372 local job applicants through the Department of Labor and
Employment (DOLE) and its network of 1,805 Public Employment
Service Offices (PESOs) nationwide, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
The labor marketing efforts of the DOLE also led to the
deployment of 606,222 overseas Filipino workers to 182
international destinations during the July 1998 - March 1999
period.
</P>
<P>
According to the DOLE, of the 457,372 applicants registered
under the Estrada presidency, 353,398 were listed under the PESOs
and 93,974 more under the DOLE regional offices.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE said 226,477 job seekers were counseled on acquiring
employability, while 381,304 applicants were referred for wage
employment, self-employment and training opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Of these government-assisted applicants, the DOLE said, "a
total of 296,733 job seekers or 64.9 percent received placement
assistance."
</P>
<P>
The DOLE said its employment-facilitation services include
special programs for vulnerable sectors like the youth and persons
with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the matching of job seekers with available job
vacancies, the DOLE has also sponsored job fairs where job seekers
directly apply to companies participating in these special
projects.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, the DOLE conducted 222 job fairs
nationwide that led to the hiring of 10,330 applicants by
participating companies.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian Sports Minister Jackie
Kelly unveiled the results of the latest drug-testing research on
Wednesday and warned drugs cheats to stay away from the 2000
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Sydney, The Australian government has
committed three million dollars for research into substances such
as erythropoetin, or EPO, which is the latest rage among sportsmen
looking for a short cut to success.
</P>
<P>
It increases production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells,
which improve stamina.

"I'm very confident that the IOC will support any move to show
that the Sydney 2000 Games are the cleanest Games ever," Kelly
said on a tour of the Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory (
ASDTL) where 2,000 drug tests will be carried out during the Games.

She said Jacques Rogge, chairman of the IOC Coordination
Commission monitoring Sydney's progress, had told her the test
would be included if they could satisfy the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said: "I'm warning the athletes who think they could
still be using it coming to Sydney ... really think again."
</P>
<P>
She warned that "By July 2000 you want to be very, very, very
clean. Don't enter Australia and think that you can rob athletes
of medals."

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Stock Exchange Ready for New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX)
is ready to anticipate the new millennium by preparing various
facilities and infrastructures aimed at smooth, efficient, liquid
and secure stock trading activities, its President-Director Mas
Ahmad Daniri said.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the new millennium, Daniri said, the JSX's
big challenges are to materialize efforts to make local investors
as market leaders, to enhance the climate of openness and to
exercise good governance in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there should also be scripless trading and remote
trading that will support market development.
</P>
<P>
"Many things have been done and many challenges have also been
passed, marked by a fluctuating composite share price index,
increasing market capitalization and increasing transactions
through the capital market," the Antara News Agency Wednesday
quoted Daniri as saying.
</P>
<P>
JSX is one of the country's biggest stock markets. During the
year of 1998, the JSX's composite share price index strengthened
by 66.6 percent to 693 points from 398 points of the previous
year. Market capitalization also increased by 164.6 percent from
176 trillion rupiah (25.13 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 to 465
trillion rupiah (66.4 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The JSX's composite share price index hovered around 660 points
recently.
</P>
<P>
According to Daniri, the average stock trading volume increased
to 512 billion rupiah (731.12 million dollars) per day last year,
while in 1997 it was only recorded at 404 billion rupiah (576.89
million dollars) per day.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Firm Told to Pay for Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Dong Ya Tankers (PTE) Ltd. of
Singapore was recently instructed by a court ruling to pay more
than three million yuan to the Maritime Administration of
Guangdong Province in compensation for an oil spill and attendant
damages they were found to be responsible for.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, in February 1997, the fully loaded
Ocean Success, an oil tanker owned by the Singaporean company, was
in Zhanjiang Port of the southern China province for unloading
operations.
</P>
<P>
Due to a major failure in one of the tanker's valves, 300 tons
of crude oil was poured into the sea, seriously polluting the
water and seabed of Zhanjiang Port as well as the ecological
environment of nearby tidal zones, and destroying natural fishing
resources in the area.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province entered a lawsuit in the Guangzhou Maritime
Court asking the Singaporean company to pay 16 million yuan in
compensation for the oil leakage and damages.
</P>
<P>
After an investigation, the court found the Dong Ya Tankers Ltd.
responsible for the oil spill and ordered that the company pay 3.1
million yuan in compensation and another 350,000 yuan to cover
expenditures related to the incident.

<HEADLINE> IMF Ends Annual Review in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund's
(IMF) mission has ended its annual review of Kenya's economy, but
will not present its report to the IMF board for three months to
allow Nairobi to implement some of its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The eight-man mission, which left here Tuesday, had reviewed
Kenya's fiscal and monetary issues, the banking sector, the
privatization of state- run companies and the efforts to reduced
the bloated civil service, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF halted its three-year 205-million-U.S.-dollar loan
package in July, 1997 to reinforce its protests against corruption
and poor governance in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, informal talks between the IMF and the
Kenyan government have failed to yield a resumption of formal
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
During their stay here, the IMF officials examined such
governance issues earlier proposed as the operations of the Kenya
Anti-Corruption Authorities and transparent tendering procedures.
</P>
<P>
Governor Micah Cheserem of the Kenya's Central Bank said that
the offer to hold its report to the board for three months by the
mission would allow action on some of its recommendations and move
Kenya closer to formal loan negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Since the suspension of the IMF loan in 1997, Kenya's economy
has been worsening with the growth rate sliding down to 1.8
percent in 1998 from 4.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya has forecast gross domestic product
growth rate at two percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, independent economists said that a decline in all
sectors of the economy will lead to growth of between zero and 1.4
percent and any other predictions are too optimistic.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Leaves for Visit to Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
left here Wednesday for a three-day official visit to Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule territories and Jordan with a view to
advancing the Mideast Peace process.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the Ankara Esenboga Airport that Turkey
always encourages efforts aimed at securing peace, stability and
prosperity in the Middle East in a decisive and active way.
</P>
<P>
Demirel is expected to visit Israel on July 14-15, and the
Palestinian territories and Jordan on July 16.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Mideast Peace process, which has been
stalled due to the hard-line policies pursed by former Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing a golden opportunity
which might slip away.
</P>
<P>
However, Demirel added that in the elections in Israel, a great
majority of the people voted for the continuation of the process,
according to local Daily News Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit to Israel is aimed at further enhancing
Turkey's growing ties with this country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have signed a series of military cooperation
agreements, causing great panic among the Arab states and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Demirel reiterated that Turkey's ties with Israel are not
directed against any other regional country and that the growing
relations with the Jewish state "should be taken into
consideration that is under way in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Syria has exploited the relations between
Turkey and Israel and turned the Arab countries against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, he stated that Turkey does not need Israel to cope
with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
"We have no need for Israel to deal with Syria. This is out of
the question," he said, adding "Turkey is a strong country. Our
relations with Israel should not be regarded as an alliance."

<P>
TOKYO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Sadaaki Numata said Tuesday that Japan's position on Taiwan
remains unchanged and Japan's relationship with the island is of
non-governmental nature.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the recent separatist remarks of Taiwan's
Lee Teng-hui, Numata told a regular press conference that Japan
will firmly maintain its position expressed in the 1972 Japan-
China Joint Statement, in which Tokyo says that it fully
understands and respects the Chinese government's stand that
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
Lee said in an interview with a German radio station on July 9
that cross-straits relations should be defined as "state-to-state
or at least special state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
Japan strongly hopes that the Taiwan issue would be settled
peacefully through direct dialog between the two sides across the
Taiwan Strait, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> India's Steel Imports, Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- India's steel imports rose 29
percent in April and May, the first two months of the new fiscal
year, according to the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Steel user industries and traders purchased 160,000 tons of
steel in April and May this year, compared to 124,000 tons during
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in steel imports this year comes in the wake of an
equally dramatic drop in imports last year and despite the import
ban on the cheap metal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's steel exports sprang up by 17 percent.
Enthused by the slight increase in steel prices in the world
market, steel producers at home shipped out 319,000 tons of steel
in April and May as against 273,000 tons in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Steel imports stood at 1.48 million tons last year, a 25
percent decrease from the previous year's 1.85 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Arsenic-Related Diseases Wide-Spread in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Arsenic-related diseases have taken
on an epidemic form in Bangladesh's 21 districts claiming the
lives of hundreds of people, the Independent daily newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The zonal headquarters of the Public Health in the Khulna
division, about 140 kilometers southwest of here, had undertaken a
comprehensive water test with a view to identifying
arsenic-contaminated tube-wells in these 21 districts and found
all the tube-wells of the Khulna Police Lines had been arsenic
polluted, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Finding no other alternative, the vast population in these
areas was using arsenic-contaminated water as the people did not
have enough money to purchase deep tube-wells that cost 5,000 taka
(about 103.1 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
In many areas, arsenic was found above the acceptable level of
0.01 to 0.05 percent per liter of water, and in some cases the
level rose to 3 percent per liter, Mohammad Abdus Sattar, a senior
chemist of the Khulna Public Health office, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is the main reason for the wide-spread arsenic-related
diseases in these districts.
</P>
<P>
An alarming situation was prevailing in Khulna division
especially Khulna city and adjoining areas.
</P>
<P>
The patients with arsenic-related disease are initially found
to have some skin diseases in the hands and legs, but ultimately
their kidneys and livers are damaged and with the failure of these
two vital organs, they die soon, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, the UNICEF (United Nations International
Children's Emergency Fund), Japan and the Netherlands are working
to mitigate the sufferings of the people through non-government
organizations in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Arsenic, a deadly mineral in water, has so far attacked as many
as 59 out of Bangladesh's 64 districts, Minister of Local
Government and Rural Development Zillur Rahman said in the
parliament in early February.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh suffers most seriously from arsenic pollution in the
world and the government has already taken a series of measures to
control arsenic contamination.
</P>
<P>
The government approved a non-government organizational
emergency project to supply pure water, which was launched at a
cost of 1.79 billion taka (about 36.9 million dollars) in February
this year.

<HEADLINE> 14 Zimbabwean Demonstrators Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 demonstrating
Zimbabwean ex-combatants were arrested in Harare Tuesday,
following running battles with riot police, the daily Herald
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators had gathered at the ruling party headquarters
to press for the payment of 500,000 Zimbabwean dollars (13,000
U.S. dollars), among other demands, for the part they played
during the war of liberation.
</P>
<P>
All the arrested demonstrators were women who had failed to run
away from the advancing riot police and sought refuge at the
headquarters of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union
(Patriotic Front).
</P>
<P>
Riot police fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrators after
they had locked the gates to the building.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Zimbabwe National War Veterans'
Association Endy Mhlanga condemned the police action, saying that
they provoked an otherwise peaceful demonstration by his members
who wanted to be paid what they were promised.
</P>
<P>
"The tear-gassing of peaceful demonstrators is not fair. They
should have been left to express their dissatisfaction on the
manner things concerning them are being handled," he said.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Beats Chile to Enter Copa America Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chile blew two penalty kicks,
one in regulation time and another in the tiebreaker, and Uruguay
advanced to the final of the Copa America soccer tournament with a
5-3 victory in the penalty-kick shootout after a 1-1 tie in
Asuncion, Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The victory was virtually a repeat of Uruguay's win over host
Paraguay in the quarter-finals by an identical 1-1 score, with
Carini again the hero with a save in the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay, which brought a junior team to the Copa America, faces
the winner of the Brazil-Mexico matchup in the final.
</P>
<P>
Chile started stronger, with Jose Luis Sierra and Fabian Estay
controlling the midfield and veteran strikers Marcelo Salas and
Ivan Zamorano keeping Uruguay penned in its own end. But Chile
was unable to penetrate the solid defense and Uruguay gathered
courage and began to counterattack dangerously.
</P>
<P>
It was Uruguay that got a good opportunity on a corner kick in
the 22nd minute. Walter Coelho fired the ball to the far post and
Alejandro Lembo caught the defense flatfooted to head it in.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, Chile missed two excellent chances to tie.
</P>
<P>
Chile's pressure finally paid off in the 63th minute, when
Zamorano soared over the Uruguayan defense to head in a cross from
Sierra.

<HEADLINE> Indian Fabric Exports Expected to Grow at 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian fabric exports are
expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 16 percent till the
year 2001/02, according to a Crisil study published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Crisil report predicts that the country's cotton fabric
exports will grow at an annualized 15 percent through to 2001/02,
while synthetic and blended fabric exports are expected to
increase by an annualized 20 percent in this period.
</P>
<P>
The overall fabric demand, both domestic and for exports, is
likely to record a compound annual growth rate of about 8.5
percent to reach 50 billion square meters in the year 2001/02. The
share of exports in the total fabric demand is likely to increase
from 18 percent in 1997/98 to about 24 percent in 2001/02.
</P>
<P>
The increased export demand is expected as a result of the
phasing-out of capacities in the developed world, and increased
market access following the gradual dismantling of quotas of the
United States and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> More State Enterprises to be Privatized in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Eleven more state-owned economic
enterprises (SEEs) in different parts of Myanmar will be
privatized by being sold through competitive bidding to national
entrepreneurs, The Mirror official newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 11 SEEs include two soft drink and ice-making plants in
Nyaunglaybin township, and nine rice mills in Minpya, Hinthada,
Mawlamyine, Bago, Thandwe, Letpadan and Pyay townships.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises to be auctioned also include those nationalized
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the submission of bidding is set on August 13,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, the Myanmar government's
Privatization Commission privatized a total of 74 SEEs, which
include four factories, 7 rice mills, 57 cinemas and 6 hotels.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has, since January 1995, been implementing a
privatization plan for its SEEs, aimed at transforming them into
effective business organizations.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the scheme covers 51 SEEs including
processing and manufacturing factories, livestock breeding farms
and cinemas, and has been implemented in various ways --
auctioning and leasing out the enterprises or establishing joint
ventures with local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In a significant move to accelerate the privatization of heavy
industries, Myanmar transferred to local private entrepreneurs the
Ywama steel mill in September 1998, the biggest SEE leased out
after the privatization plan began.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there is a total of 36,275
private industrial enterprises in Myanmar by the end of 1998.

WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Tuesday reiterated Washington's position to follow the one-China
policy and voiced concern about the situation arising from Lee
Teng-hui's latest separatist remarks on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"We do not support Taiwan independence. We do not support
Taiwanese membership in organizations where statehood is required.
We do not support a two-China policy or a one-China, one-Taiwan
policy," State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Lee said on July 9 that cross-straits relations should be "
state-to-state" or at least "special state-to-state."
</P>
<P>
"We have a one-China policy. That has been our policy for some
time now," Rubin affirmed.
</P>
<P>
"Our position on Taiwan's future is clear and unchanging. We
believe that it is a matter for the Chinese people on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait to resolve," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have for some time encouraged both sides to engage in
meaningful, substantive dialogue."
</P>
<P>
He said Washington would seek further information on Taipei's
position. "Let me say we will be discussing the recent statements"
made by Lee.
</P>
<P>
"We are first trying to clarify, from Taipei, what the
significance, if any, of these statements is."

<P>
CANBERRA, July 14 (Xinhua) - Mekere Morauta was sworn
in as prime minister of Papua New Guinea (PNA) on Wednesday after
being elected by the country's parliament, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Morauta, leader of the People's Democratic Movement, was sworn
in by PNG Governor-General Sir Silas Atopare at the Government
House, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, PNG Parliamentary Speaker Iairo Lasaro announced
Morauta had won the vote for the job by 99 to 5. The only other
nominee was East New Britain Governor Francis Koimanrea, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Morauta becomes the sixth man to lead PNG since it gained
independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The country's former parliamentary speaker John Pundari had
been tipped to become prime minister after being nominated by
outgoing prime minister Bill Skate on Tuesday, but he refused to
accept the nomination on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Pundari nominated Morauta for the job.
</P>
<P>
"I accept the nomination with great pleasure," Morauta said.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later the parliamentarians divided to vote and all but
five crossed the floor to Morauta's side.
</P>
<P>
Those who crossed the floor included Skate and Fisheries
Minister Chris Haiveta, who had earlier nominated Pundari.
</P>
<P>
Skate resigned as prime minister last week.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Criticizes Western Economic Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 13 (Xinhua) -- President Emil Constantinescu
said Tuesday NATO's air campaign and EU's sanctions against
Yugoslavia have imposed heavy economic losses on Romania and what
his country badly needs is substantive support, not empty promises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Romania-U.S. Action Committee meeting held here,
Constantinescu explicitly expressed his dissatisfaction at the
rigid conditions western countries attach on their provision of
loans to his country, reported Antenna One television.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that when NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia
ended, senior delegations from the European Union and NATO visited
Bucharest one after another. However, they only expressed thanks
for Romania's unconditional support to NATO during its eleven-week
airstrike but were vague on substantive issues such as Romania's
security guarantees and economic compensations.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the economic cooperation between Romania and the
United States, Constantinescu said there is hardly any U.S.
investment in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian leader held out hope that western countries would
not order Romania about and raise contradictory requests. He said
while the World Bank urged Romania to step up economic reform and
investors from the west wanted Romania to improve investment
environment, the International Monetary Fund demanded Romania
maintain its macro economic stability and revoke its preferential
tax policy toward foreign capital.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Headway In Economic Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua)-- China made remarkable progress in
restructuring its economy and optimizing industrial mix in the
first half of this year, according to the State Economic and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
In the sweeping move, quite a few large enterprise groups were
established, while dozens of other firms were shaped into
companies in accordance with the Company Law.
</P>
<P>
China also continued cutting down on its textile, coal and
steel sectors, which are suffering from an oversupply in the face
of slackening market demand.
</P>
<P>
In the January-May period, China destroyed 1.15 million textile
spindles and resettled about 400,000 workers. The country also
closed down over 23,000 small coal mines, reducing the coal output
by 100 million tons, said an official of the State Economic and
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
During the period, bankruptcy was introduced to small oil
refinery, fire-powered power plants, and glass, cement and steel
works.
</P>
<P>
To improve management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the
commission has also held five management training sessions for
leading officials of 1,070 loss-making SOEs.
</P>
<P>
To date one-third of the major leaders of loss-making firms
have sat in for the management crack courses.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs 114.6 Billion Dollars in Next 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will require investments
estimated at 802.2 trillion rupiah (about 114.6 billion U.S.
dollars) over the next five years to boost economic growth, an
investment official said.
</P>
<P>
Soenaryo Dasusaputro, assistant for policy and investment
climate affairs to the investment minister, said the estimate was
based on the country's annual economic growth rate over the next
five years which would range between minus 2 percent and 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the country's economic growth rate would
be minus 2 percent in 2000, nil percent in 2001, 3 percent in
2002, and 5 percent respectively in 2003 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the investment projection, a number of investment
strategies and policies would be needed, Soenaryo said at an
investment consultation meeting in Padang, capital of West
Sumatera, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had already taken a number of bold
measures to lure investors, including the issuance of reform
policy packages in the investment sector aimed at restoring
business people's confidence in the country's business potentials.
</P>
<P>
To improve transparency in investment policies and ensure
business certainty, the government has also issued a presidential
decree on the negative list of investment.
</P>
<P>
"Under the presidential decree, there are fewer economic
sectors closed to foreign investors compared to the situation in
1995," the Antara News Agency Wednesday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Industry and Trade Rahardi Ramelan
Tuesday told members of Commission V of the House of
Representatives in a hearing here that investors have not shown
strong interest in Indonesia despite the relatively stable
situation, the strengthening of the rupiah and the drop in bank
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"I think investors are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude
until the formation of a new government in Indonesia," Ramelan
said.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the Investment Coordinating Board
(BKPM), foreign direct investment approved by the Indonesian
government in the first six months of this year plunged by 77.5
percent to 1.88 billion U.S. dollars, from 8.35 billion dollars
during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Although the general picture of investment in Indonesia was
still not encouraging, Ramelan said that investment was taking
place in certain sectors, for example, the chemical, forestry and
agro-industries.
</P>
<P>
"There are developments in investment in the forestry and
agro-industries in the first three months of 1999, especially
those based on fishery, milk, bottled drinking water, tobacco
processing, and in downstream forestry industries like the
furniture industry," The Indonesian Observer Wednesday quoted
Ramelan as saying.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Slips Down World-Wide Human Development Scale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Colombia descended from
the 53rd position to the 57th on the world-wide scale of human
development, due to its internal armed conflict and economic
crisis, said the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the economic crunches and internal wars, the
spread of the deadly disease AIDS also hindered the development of
the Colombian population, the UNDP said in a statement about human
development.
</P>
<P>
But the fall of four places on the scale does not necessarily
mean a general deterioration of the quality of life, added the U.N.
agency.
</P>
<P>
It attributed Colombia's down-sliding in the classification
mainly to its application of a new method to measure the Index of
Human Development (IDH), which takes into consideration the
effects of internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Two of the fundamental indexes, on which the classification is
based, show slight improvement. Life span rose from 70.3 years in
1997 to 70.4 a year later, and the annual income per capita from 6,
347 U.S. dollars to 6,810 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The index of literacy in Colombia suffered a slight fall, from
91.3 per cent to 90 percent in the adult population.
</P>
<P>
Another worrying indicator in the country's human development
is that the percentage of the Colombian population, which is not
expected to reach the age of 40 due to poverty, rose from 9 to 10.
1 percent, the UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, Colombia stayed within the top 10 countries
with the most advanced human development, above Cuba and Brazil,
but behind Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Venezuela,
Panama and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Volcano Evacuees Suffer From Food Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen evacuees from Mt. Mayon of
the Philippines have suffered from food poisoning after eating
foreign-donated relief goods from the Department of Social Welfare
and Development, the Today newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The evacuees at a relocation center in Albay were rushed to a
local clinic after suffering loose bowels and nausea when they ate
imported canned food and powered milk.
</P>
<P>
"The explosion (food poisoning) was as if under Alert Level 5
of the volcano," one of the victims, Domingo Banzuela, a retired
public school principal, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Banzuela suffered the disorder after drinking a glass of
imported milk that was included in the relief goods distributed by
the provincial social welfare official.
</P>
<P>
The relief goods consist of 20 boxes of chili and beans, which
also have caused stomach disorder among the evacuees.
</P>
<P>
As the victims were being treated for food poisoning, the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs)
raised the alert level to 3 around Mayon, which turned out to be a
false alarm causing greater panic among the villagers there.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of villagers living on the slopes of the active Mayon
Volcano were reportedly preparing for evacuation after the release
of the higher alert level, but the Phivolcs corrected its error in
data interpretation two hours later.
</P>
<P>
Alert Level 2 is still in effect.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Give SEA Games Athletes Doping Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) has announced it will hold pre-competition doping
tests for selected members of the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games
contingent, The Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
National training director Imron ZS said the pre-competition
tests next week were aimed at reducing any possible problems at
the August 7 to 15 biennial event.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to take any risks by sending athletes who might
fail the doping test. We prefer to be a 'clean' contingent rather
than an overall champion with athletes found guilty of using
banned substances," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta doping laboratory located in Rawasari, Central
Jakarta, has offered to hold the pre-competition testing at no
cost to KONI.
</P>
<P>
Imron said he would recommend athletes not to consume any
medications without first consulting the official team doctor.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's men's cyclist Tonton Susanto was found guilty of
using amphetamines during the 19th SEA Games here two years ago.
He was banned from national and international tournaments for
approximately one year.
</P>
<P>
KONI's chief of Sports Science Commission Carmen Jahya said she
would consult the contingent's four supervisors before selecting
athletes to undergo the test.
</P>
<P>
Carmen said three women's shooters, who left for Brunei
Darussalam in early July for pre-competition training and
acclimatization would not be tested.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian sporting delegation for the SEA Games plans to
visit President B.J. Habibie for a farewell ceremony ahead of
their departure to Brunei.
</P>
<P>
However, Imron has yet to confirm the date.
</P>
<P>
"It's either July 22 or 23. We're still waiting for a fixed
date from the State Secretariat," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will compete in 20 events at the biennial event with
a 392-strong contingent including officials. The contingent won't
leave on the same date of flight.
</P>
<P>
The cycling, shooting and football squads will fly earlier than
August 3 when the main group is scheduled to leave.
</P>
<P>
Imron met KONI chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar Tuesday to report
over the latest development of the athletes.
</P>
<P>
"The national camp has gone well. The athletes are all in good
physical shape. None of them have been injured ahead of their
departure," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Sees 17-Percent Rise In Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's economic
powerhouse, saw a year-on-year 17.7 percent rise in exports in the
first half of 1999, according to latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
Total exports amounted to 8.035 billion US dollars in the
period, announced Shanghai Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Commission, which attributed the increase to a surge in exports of
machinery and electrical products.
</P>
<P>
However, exports by local state-run foreign trade enterprises
were still stagnant, in sharp contrast to overseas-funded firms,
which contributed remarkably to the city's export growth.
</P>
<P>
During the January-May period, Shanghai exports were one
billion US dollars more than the same 1998 period, of which 996
million US dollars were brought in by overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Exports of machinery and electrical products were on a rapid
rise and accounted for nearly half of total exports during the
half-year period, and exports to Asia, Europe and North America
grew by two-digits.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai intends to maintain a 10-percent rise in exports in
the second half of the year and has set a goal to garner a total
of 17.6 billion dollars exports for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The city will increase exports of hi-tech and hi-value-added
products and will also make good use of the marketing mechanism of
international chain enterprises to improve the presence and image
of local name-brand products in overseas markets.

CHANGSHA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central China
has kept in reserve 30 million yuan worth of medicines, necessary
medical equipment and funds in preparation for this year's flood
control efforts, according to the provincial administration of
medicines.
</P>
<P>
China has introduced a medicine reserve system since the latter
half of 1998 to ensure sufficient supply at a time of natural
disasters or other accidents.
</P>
<P>
Hunan, located at the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the
country's longest, is a disaster-prone region. It reserved 20
million yuan worth of medicines last year and another 10 million
yuan worth before the start of this year's flood season.
</P>
<P>
The reserves, which consist of Western medicine, ready-made
traditional Chinese medicines, medicinal raw materials, and
medical equipment, are placed at five medicine companies of the
province.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, flooding caused by heavy
rainfall along the Yangtze River Valley since late June has killed
more than 200 people and posed a threat to the lives of 60 million
local people.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Chinese Province Breeding New Potato </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in northwest China's
Qinghai Province have developed a technique to prevent the growth
of potato virus by a process of detoxification in the course of
breeding.
</P>
<P>
With equipment provided by the European Union, scientists at
the Qinghai Academy of Agriculture and Forestry (QAAF) placed
detoxified potato shoots in a laboratory for cultivation. They
then transplanted these young shoots in a glass room where the
temperature, humidity, and sunlight were entirely controlled by
computers. When the potato stock was fostered to the fifth
generation, it was ready to be used for cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Sowing with these young shoots will not only curb the growth of
virus, but also increase potato output by 100 percent compared
with ordinary seedlings, said Wang Jian, head of QAAF's Biological
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
To date, this technique has been applied in 20 townships in
Qinghai, yielding 130 million yuan in profit for local farmers.
</P>
<P>
A staple food in China, the potato is grown on 34 million
hectares of land across the country each year. Qinghai is an ideal
place for growing potatoes since it is located in a frigid zone
with sharp variations in temperature between day and night, making
it difficult for insects to survive in the area.

reported a year-on-year rise of 14.06 percent in turnover to 1.89
trillion yuan in the first half of the year.

BUENOS AIRES, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The South American Football
Confederation (CSF) on Tuesday discarded Mexican arguments that
two of their players failed a doping test because they had eaten
contaminated food, according to reports from Asuncion, Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Cesar Chavez and Raul Lara were banned for the rest of
the tournament on Friday after testing positive for nandrolone and
testosterone respectively following the 2-1 defeat by Brazil on
July 3.
</P>
<P>
Mexico team doctor Jose Luis Serrano argued that his squad was
clean, that the substances could only be administered with a high
degree of specialisation and it was likely they had been found
after being used in the production of meat eaten by the players.
</P>
<P>
But his arguments were refuted by Marco Teixiera, head of the
CSF's doping commission, who said that between four and six times
the normal limits of the banned substances had been found in the
tests.
</P>
<P>
The CSF will meet Saturday to consider extending the ban on the
two players.

Mexico have entered the semi-finals of the Copa America

<HEADLINE> Talks Between Costa Rica, Nicaragua Come to Standstill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations between Costa Rica
and Nicaragua to find a solution to various disagreements between
them "are at a standstill," said Costa Rican Vice President Walter
Niehaus on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between their two vice-presidents, initially planned
for this month, has been postponed indefinitely after a rise of
tensions in their relations, he said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agenda includes discussion on the navigation rights
on the border river of San Juan which have affected the bilateral
relations since last year.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua, which holds sovereignty over the river, banned the
transit of armed police from Costa Rica along the waterway, while
Costa Rica accused the ban as an infringement on its navigation
rights granted by treaties.
</P>
<P>
Another issue on the agenda is the Nicaraguans who are living
and working in Costa Rica illegally, whose number is believed by
Costa Rica to reach as many as 600,000.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government granted a six-month amnesty period
to all the Central American immigrants from February to November
9th.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman requested Costa Rica to
extend the initial term.
</P>
<P>
The immigrant situation took a turn for the worse, when two
weeks ago, the Costa Rican authorities deported almost 30 heads of
families, who had participated in the occupation of urban land
plots in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Nicaraguan congress sent a delegation to
investigate whether or not the Nicaraguan's rights were being
respected within Costa Rica.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Army continued
Tuesday its fighting against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) which began on Saturday, and the death toll has
kept rising.
</P>
<P>
Armed forces chief General Fernando Tapias on Tuesday revealed
that specialized battalions were being sent to Puerto Rico, where
three policemen were killed in a clash with the FARC, that
launched a 12-hour attack on the municipal of Cucutilla, kidnapped
27 policemen and destroyed totally the police headquarters with
explosives made from adapted domestic gas cartridges.

In the Tuesday clash 36 were added to the death list of 242
rebels delivered on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>

continued for the remains of other possible victims below the
ruins.
</P>
<P>
Isolated attacks in various parts of the country, including
Santander North, Caqueta and Narino, and Risaralda are carried out
by the FARC rebels.
</P>
<P>
Both Tapias and Serrano said that El Doncello was under control
following the rebel's Saturday attack, which killed two children.

seized by the guerrillas, saying that the city is watched from
helicopters, and the guerrillas are trying to block the access
highways into the city.

<HEADLINE> Six Dead, Thousands Stranded After Downpours in Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Six people have died and
thousands have been stranded or evacuated as torrential rains
entered the fifth day on Tuesday in Hungary. Daily life and
agricultural production in many parts of the country are seriously
affected.
</P>
<P>
Heavy downpours which began last weekend have flooded 106 towns
and villages, affecting nearly 2,000 homes. More than 7,000 people
have been stranded by rising waters and about 1,700 people have
been evacuated to safer areas.
</P>
<P>
The record-high rainfall is expected to cause heavy damage to
agricultural production, particularly the summer harvest. Experts
estimate that heavy rains will affect wheat, the main summer crop,
both in quantity and quality.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring countries are also suffering bad weather conditions.
A rainstorm hitting Romania on Monday caused a serious landslide,
killing 15 people.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 14 (Xinhua) - People's Democratic Movement
leader Mekere Morauta was elected as new prime minister of Papua
New Guinea (PNG) on Wednesday, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
PNG Parliamentary Speaker Iairo Lasaro announced Morauta had
won the vote for the top job by 99 to 5. The only other nominee
was East New Britain Governor Francis Koimanrea, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Morauta becomes the sixth man to lead PNG since it gained
independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The country's former parliamentary speaker John Pundari had
been tipped to become prime minister after being nominated by
outgoing prime minister Bill Skate on Tuesday, but he refused to
accept the nomination on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Pundari nominated Morauta for the job.
</P>
<P>
"I accept the nomination with great pleasure," Morauta said.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later the parliamentarians divided to vote and all but
five crossed the floor to Morauta's side.
</P>
<P>
Those who crossed the floor included Skate and Fisheries
Minister Chris Haiveta, who had earlier nominated Pundari.
</P>
<P>
Skate resigned as prime minister last week.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Exports Hit Hard by Transport Workers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's exports are being hit hard
by a nine-day-old transport workers strike protesting against fuel
price hikes.
</P>
<P>
President of the country's Exporters' Federation Luis Maldonado
said Tuesday that the losses in the export sector so far are
estimated at 10 million U.S. dollars every day, concentrated on
the perishable goods like bananas, fish, flowers and fruits.
</P>
<P>
The daily export of 10,000 boxes of flowers, costing 500,000 U.
S. dollars, is being halted due to the close of highways in the
north and center of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen have been getting complaints from their clients,
especially in the United States, which receives 70 percent of
Ecuador's flower production.
</P>
<P>
The exports of tuna, shrimp and bananas are also in danger as
the vessels stand in the harbors in Guayaquil, awaiting for
transport lorries.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Urges Reform of Italy's Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Mario Monti, Italy's European
Commissioner for Competition, Tuesday called for a far-reaching
reform of the pension system and the removal of obstacles to an
efficient economy in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Mario Monti told the Italian Parliament that he agreed with the
European Central Bank, which called on Italy Monday to reform its
pension system and on France and Germany to review key aspects of
theirs.
</P>
<P>
He called for a far-reaching reform that solves the problem
once and for all, saying the key issue is to remove the "perennial
state of uncertainty" surrounding future pensions.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said measures are also needed to reduce
subsidies to industry, amend the rigid rules on skill-oriented
professions, further liberalize trade and credit, and intensify
the battle against tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The Italian pension system was partially reformed in 1993 and
1995 and is due for further revision in 2001. However, the reform
is strongly opposed by trade unions, and the government has not
yet made any progress in winning the unions' consent to some
pension moves in the next budget.

<HEADLINE> Austria Includes "Non-nuclear" Clause Into Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian parliament on Tuesday
passed a bill affirming that Austria will be a non-nuclear country.
The bill will be included into the constitution.
</P>
<P>
All the five parties in the parliament supported the bill which
bans the building of nuclear power plants and the storage of
nuclear weapons on Austrian territory.
</P>
<P>
Peter Kostelka, leader of the ruling Social Democratic Party's
parliamentary group, said in the parliament session that Austria
is the first and only European country whose constitution
prescribes the country to be non-nuclear.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Khol, leader of the parliamentary group of another
ruling party, the Austrian People's Party, also said in the
session that nuclear weapons in the world have been cut down by
two-thirds and the world in the future must be a non-nuclear one.
</P>
<P>
Austria built a nuclear power plant in 1978, but Austrians
voted against its use a referendum.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, 13 July (Xinhua) -- Italy's Ferrari F1 team said Tuesday
that a loose screw was to blame for sending Michael Schumacher off
the track at the Britain's Silverstone Grand Prix race.
</P>
<P>
The official cause of the accident was "an unexpected loss of
pressure on the brakes' posterior circuit which was caused by the
loosening of a screw," Ferrari declared in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the reason for the technical mishap was not known, but
that the screw had been checked the evening before the race and
there had been no reason to carry out any further tests.
</P>
<P>
"Data shows there weren't any problems with it during the warm-
up session or during the race, until the anomalous braking,"
Ferrari said, referring to the point when Schumacher slowed down
to turn round a curve before veering off the track.
</P>
<P>
The team, which has its headquarters in the northern Italian
town of Maranello near Modena, said it was carrying out "a full
and detailed investigation" into the incident.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has agreed to
grant 250,000 U.S. dollars to Nicaragua over the next three years
to implement its population policies, a senior Nicaraguan official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The money will be earmarked to help establish a system of
coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the country's
population policies, in addition to a plan of action, said
External Cooperation Secretary David Robleto.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan population is almost 5 million, with the life
expectancy rising from 44 to 66 years during the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
But what worries the authorities is that half of the population
live in poverty and one fifth in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
One of the general goals of the population policies is to
contribute to the creation of demographic conditions favorable to
the social and economic development of the country.

<HEADLINE> Edible Cactus Successfully Grown in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An edible cactus introduced from
Mexico is growing well in China, and has recently been selling at
the vegetable stalls in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The cactus, called the Milpa Alta, was introduced to China last
year and can grow to the extent of 30,000 kilograms per hectare.
About seven hectares of the cactus is growing in Beijing and the
southernmost island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Edible cactus cultivation has become a full-blown industry in
some countries of South America and Europe, with Mexico leading
the world in edible-cactus production.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that planting this cactus in China will not only
provide a new variety of vegetable, but also make it possible to
utilize large areas of arid and semi-arid land for agriculture
purposes.

<HEADLINE> UK Rejects Amendments to N. Ireland Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Amendments designed by the
Protestant Ulster Unionist Party to save the Northern Ireland
peace process were rejected by the government in Britain's House
of Commons on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amendments to the Northern Ireland Bill, want guarantees
that Sinn Fein will be excluded from a proposed Northern Ireland
government if their military wing, the Irish republic Army (IRA)
do not hand in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists said the legislation proposed by the
government was "flawed and unfair". Even with Britain's opposition
Conservative Party, they were unable to push through last-minute
changes to the legislation as it was rushed through parliament, a
Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
The amendments had sought to spell out more clearly that Sinn
Fein would be excluded from power if the IRA did not hand in
weapons according to a set timetable before a May 2000 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The government's emergency package was rushed through all its
stages in the House of Commons in eight hours of impassioned
debate Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> SFA Supports Brown over 'Bigot' Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Scottish Football Association
has decided to take no action against the national team coach
after newspaper allegations that he sang anti-Catholic songs.
</P>
<P>
The SFA said there was "absolutely nothing" to make it think
that Craig Brown had ever acted in the bigoted manner of which he
had been accused.
</P>
<P>
The News of the World reported that Brown sang the songs onto a
then girlfriend's telephone answering machine.
</P>
<P>
SFA President Jack McGinn and Brown held a 40-minute meeting in
Glasgow, after which a statement was read out.
</P>
<P>
Mr McGinn said: "I have had a full and frank discussion with
Craig and it was useful to hear, on a confidential basis, his side
of the story.
</P>
<P>
"Following our talk, and based on his remarks, I consulted with
the office bearers.
</P>
<P>
"I can only reiterate my earlier comment that there is
absolutely nothing to make us think that Craig has ever, in any
way, acted in the bigoted manner of which he is accused - and I
think that any reasonable person would come to the same conclusion.
"
</P>
<P>
Brown has demanded the retraction of the allegations and large
damages or he will start legal action.
</P>
<P>
But News of the World Managing Editor Stuart Kuttner said: "The
News of the World stands by its reports and will vigorously defend
itself against any legal action."
</P>
<P>
Brown, 59, told BBC Radio Scotland: "I find it preposterous
that I could be accused of religious bigotry because there is not
an ounce of bigotry in me."
</P>
<P>
"But I wish to totally and completely refute any suggestion of
bigotry and I would defy anyone with whom I've worked in football
for 40 years or anyone who knows me, to make that accusation.
</P>
<P>
"I would say to you that there is not an ounce of bigotry in me
and that's emphatic and I think that could easily be proved and I
will be happily extending my attempt to prove that.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was concerned about his reputation, Mr Brown said:"
Anything that's detrimental concerns you a little but I worry more
about the truth and I know the truth therefore I don't have that
inner worry, I can assure you."
</P>
<P>
The claims come amid a Scottish Football Association initiative
to stamp out sectarianism in football and follow the resignation
of Rangers vice-chairman Donald Findlay in May.
</P>
<P>
He quit the club after a newspaper published photographs of him
apparently standing on a stage and singing what the paper
described as "anti-Celtic anthems" following Rangers' Scottish Cup
win over Celtic.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between Celtic and Rangers has polarised Glasgow
football supporters along religious lines for decades, with
Catholics traditionally supporting Celtic while Protestants follow
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry boiled over into violence during the league title
decider when Celtic fans invaded the pitch and referee Hugh Dallas
was injured by a coin thrown from the crowd.

<HEADLINE> Granada Buys Stake in Liverpool FC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- UK media and hotel group Granada
will take a 9.9% stake in Liverpool Football Club, as part of a "
strategic partnership" with the team, according to the BBC report
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The company will pay 22 million pounds (34.24 million U.S.
dollars) for a share in the English premier league club.
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Granada will manage a wide range of
commercial issues for Liverpool FC, including publishing,
electronic media rights and merchandising.
</P>
<P>
The revenue from the new issue of shares will allow manager
Gerard Houllier to spend 20m on buying new players.
</P>
<P>
Another 2m will go towards the football academy it hopes will
produce young players of the quality of home grown strikers
Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Granada and the Anfield club said: "The boards
of Liverpool and Granada are pleased to have announced they have
entered into a ground-breaking strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
"These are new shares created by Liverpool and so the chairman
David Moores is not selling any shares."
</P>
<P>
Granada said it would take on a range of commercial functions
at the club, allowing management to concentrate on winning
football matches.
</P>
<P>
It said the move brought forward the possibility of creating a
Liverpool FC television channel.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool Football Club, England's most successful ever after a
series of English league and European Cup wins in the 1970s and
1980s, has lost its pre-eminent position in the 1990s to its
fiercest rivals Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
Long controlled by the Littlewoods Pools founder Sir John
Moores' family, the club has recently been looking at possible
ways of raising extra cash.
</P>
<P>
These have included a partial sell off through the listing of
shares on the London stock market.
</P>
<P>
However the deal with Granada allows it to raise funds while
club chairman David Moores remains in control, with his stake
reduced from 58% to 51%..
</P>
<P>
The statement said the strategic partnership would ensure the
club maximised its commercial potential for the benefit of
shareholders and fans.
</P>
<P>
Mr Moores said: "With the increased capital strength and wealth
of commercial expertise the partnership brings, I am confident
that together we will develop the Liverpool FC brand into a world
leader.
</P>
<P>
"Most importantly, the partnership will help bring success on
the field which will always be our number one priority."
</P>
<P>
Granada effectively owns a third of Britain's biggest and most
popular commercial television network ITV and produces most of its
programming.
</P>
<P>
This move means Granada will have influence within the club
when the television rights for the Premiership matches come up for
renewal in 2001.
</P>
<P>
It will also be in a position to play a part if and when clubs
are allowed to sell their own rights to individual matches.
</P>
<P>
Granada has the means of delivering such coverage as a 50%
owner of the digital pay television venture ONdigital, which
competes with BSkyB's pay television channels which currently own
the rights to British premiership football.
</P>
<P>
The move comes just weeks after BSkyB's bid to buy Manchester
United was ruled offside by UK competition authorities. That
decision prompted another media group, cable firm NTL, to withdraw
its bid for Newcastle United.
</P>
<P>
It also comes at a time when rumours have been growing that
Manchester United is facing a fresh takeover bid, possibly from a
continental Europe based media group.

<HEADLINE> IFC, AusAID Launch Private Sector Study in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the Australian government's international
development agency (AusAID), and China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) recently began a major study of
the status of China's domestic private sector, the IFC announced
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first of its kind in China, the study will be conducted
jointly by IFC and the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC)
with technical assistance provided by experts from the Australian
National University and Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the study is to identify opportunities for and
constraints to the development of the domestic private sector with
a view to making practical, immediately applicable recommendations
to the government of China, the IFC said.
</P>
<P>
The study will identify issues in the domestic private sector
by listening to what business entrepreneurs have to say about the
current climate for private business and how this climate can be
improved.
</P>
<P>
The researchers plan to interview business people in Beijing,
Chendu, Shunde, and Wenzhou this month. The results of the study
will be announced early next year.
</P>
<P>
The study is being financed through the China Technical
Assistance Trust Fund, established with IFC by AusAID. The
1.5-million-Australian-dollar trust fund supports activities that
enhance the Chinese government's capacity to improve the
environment for private sector development and is part of the
Australia-China bilateral program of development cooperation in
which AusAID and MOFTEC are partners.
</P>
<P>
The mission of IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is to
promote private sector investment in developing countries, which
will reduce poverty and improve people's lives.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Closes over 19 U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices surged to a new
20-month high on Tuesday after OPEC's leading producer Saudi
Arabia said it wanted to retain a tough line on export curbs.
</P>
<P>
London futures for benchmark Brent crude last traded 44 cents
higher to end at 19.04 U.S. dollars, breaching 19 U.S. dollars a
barrel for the first time since November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest leg to a rally which has nearly doubled oil prices
since February came after a Gulf official said Saudi Arabia wanted
cast iron proof of a full market recovery before the OPEC oil
cartel considered easing back export limits.
</P>
<P>
Speedy price gains since OPEC implemented curbs in April have
sparked debate about when the cartel should raise exports to stop
the market overheating.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that excess stockpiles are set to drain so
quickly over the next few months that inventories could be
depleted even before peak winter demand starts, according to a
Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
The output limits were set for a year until the end of March
2000 and last week two countries, Algeria and Iran, said they
wanted to retain the restrictions for the full term.
</P>
<P>
Traders on Tuesday also appeared to be anticipating fresh
evidence of a rundown in stockpiles in the important U.S. market
where weekly inventory data was due for release after the close of
the futures market.
