   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even if they don't agree on campaign finance reform, Sen.
John McCain said Sunday he will endorse Texas Governor George W. Bush when they
meet next week. Overhauling federal campaign finance laws was the signature
issue of McCain's now suspended campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination. Bush opposes some proposed reforms. But McCain said that discord
would not preclude an endorsement of Bush, the all-but-declared GOP presidential
nominee, since the two agree on other areas in need of change, including Social
Security, the military, education and health care.

<HEADLINE> Proposal to expand Carousel Center looms large  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Robert Congel always thinks big, as would
befit a founder of a company called Pyramid. However, his latest
proposal sort of boggles the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Congel wants to triple the size of Carousel Center here,
transforming it into the largest mall in the country -- bigger even
than Minnesota's Mall of America, now a major tourist attraction.
He's putting before city and Onondaga County lawmakers a proposal
to spend $900 million to expand the mall to 4.5 million square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be nothing like this in the world if we're able to
put even 75 percent of what we think we can put together here,''
Congel said. ''And I think we will. There are a lot of things going
on right now to make this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyramid, which built and opened Carousel Center nearly a decade
ago, is proposing an indoor-resort tourist destination, filled with
entertainment of Disney proportions.
</P>
<P>
   It would include: a four-level aquarium aimed at giving visitors
the sense they're in the ocean, hockey rinks, family sporting and
entertainment centers, a golf dome and indoor soccer fields;
upscale shopping and restaurants; and four hotels. A lush,
landscaped atrium would include a public water ''park'' with wading
and swimming areas and a waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   The addition would be built in two phases. Phase One
construction would begin in the fall or next spring, and
construction on Phase Two would begin when Phase One opens. The
first phase would cost $300 million to build and cover 780,225
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, Pyramid will get tax-exempt borrowing to pay for
infrastructure improvements for the property, including roads,
multi-level parking decks and underground parking that would be
owned by the city but maintained by Pyramid. The $250 million for
these infrastructure improvements would be repaid over 30 years,
with annual payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) of $11.3 million
going directly toward that debt.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city and county would forgo full property taxes,
they would share in the additional sales tax revenue from the
expanded mall, which Pyramid executives and city and county
officials who have studied the plans estimate at $89 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Millions more dollars would ripple out of the giant mall-resort,
Pyramid says, with mall employment increasing from 3,100 jobs to
11,150 jobs, plus 8,200 construction jobs to build the addition.
</P>
<P>
   The company says a resort of the size projected will draw
visitors from as far as four hours away to stay overnight.
Pyramid's studies and projections, based on mall customer trends,
say the mall-resort would draw 35 million visitors a year, with 75
percent of them coming from outside Onondaga County.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Carousel Center drew 17 million shoppers, with just
under half coming from outside the county, according to Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Congel said the hotels also would be a draw for the downtown
convention center, and would give the community enough rooms to
draw events like the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the city has said an
entertainment-themed expansion of the mall would jump-start the
economy and make Syracuse's Inner Harbor a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   Without the PILOT, Congel and other Pyramid executives say, the
expansion will not be built. And Congel wants an answer in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PILOT is what will make it go,'' said Onondaga County
Executive Nicholas Pirro, who has been briefed about Pyramid's
plans and proposals. Pirro said there's little reason for the
project not to go ahead, considering the promise of thousands of
jobs and a massive construction project creating a major resort
that will attract tourists and their money.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you try to define yourself as a community,'' Pirro said,
''we can either go along status quo or we can look to a major
change for our future. We can either take advantage of that or stay
where we are. Most people, I think, would like to take a step
forward ... to increase the viability of this community.''

<HEADLINE> Bondi Protesters Claim Victory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Protesters demonstrating against the
building of the Olympic beach volleyball stadium said the
postponement of the construction was a victory for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 protesters, burning posters of Olympic rings and
carrying anti-stadium banners, assembled at Sydney's famous Bondi
Beach early Monday to stall the start of construction of the
10,000-seat temporary stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the Olympic Coordination Authority, the organization
responsible for the construction and management of all Sydney 2000
Olympic venues, rescheduled the start of construction.
</P>
<P>
   New South Wales state police and Waverley Council, the local
government authority, confirmed that work was now expected to start
May 8.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Bondi Olympic Watch speculated that the OCA
would attempt to sneak onto the beach at night to avoid protesters
and erect a fence around the site.
</P>
<P>
   BOW spokesman Lenny Kovner said the delays were a moral victory
for campaigners, who were demonstrating against the closure of a
large section of the beach, possible environmental degradation, and
public safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters left the scene when builders failed to arrive but
Kovner said the group would keep the beach under surveillance
around the clock to ensure construction didn't commence.
</P>
<P>
   He said the group had established a telephone hot line to assist
rapid mobilization of protesters if builders started work on the
site before next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We waited until 7 a.m. but no trucks turned up and we declared
a victory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kovner said the protesters aimed to keep stalling the
construction project until it was too late and Games organizers
were forced to shift the beach volleyball to an alternative,
existing venue.

<HEADLINE> American Red Cross workers vote to strike in Connecticut  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Red Cross workers in Connecticut went out on strike
early today after overwhelmingly rejecting the relief agency's
latest contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 strikers set up a picket line outside the Red Cross
headquarters in Farmington shortly after midnight, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, the first by Red Cross workers in Connecticut in 25
years, may reduce daily blood collection in the state by 80
percent. But any shortfall will be made up from a national
inventory, said Red Cross spokeswoman Lynn Townshend.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed, but we remain committed to our mission of
supplying blood and blood products to Connecticut's hospital
patients,'' Townshend said shortly after the strike vote was
announced. ''No patient needs will go unmet.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers, members of AFSCME Local 3145, voted 168-19 to
reject the last contract offer after meeting for several hours in
New Britain. Some of the Red Cross workers called the contract
offer insulting.
</P>
<P>
   The strike involves about 200 employees who conduct blood drives
around the state. It will not affect the work of Red Cross
chapters, such as disaster relief, Townshend said.
</P>
<P>
   Townshend said management will step in and hold only one blood
drive a day, reducing daily collection from 600 units to about 125.
The Red Cross has some 6,500 units in storage, about an 11-day
supply. A unit is slightly less than a pint.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross has said a strike would not immediately affect
Connecticut's blood supply, but a prolonged walkout could
''seriously affect the region's ability to collect and distribute
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The employees include technician-drivers, nurses, phlebotomists
and lab workers. They say they often work long hours, have daily
changing schedules and are being asked to pay a greater share of
their health benefits. Their pay ranges from $10 to $22 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross contends it has made a fair and generous offer,
with pay increases ranging from 3 to more than 5 percent annually.
The proposal is for a three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Jump, the union spokesman, declined to quantify the pay
raises, but said with concessions sought by management factored in
they equal the cost of living or less.
</P>
<P>
   The strike vote came despite the efforts of a federal mediator.
Jump said he hopes the walkout would lead to more negotiations
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope the message has been sent loud and clear,'' he
added.

<HEADLINE> Livingstone Is Likely London Mayor  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Barring a sudden massive change of heart by London
voters, their first elected mayor will be a political outcast with
a passion for newts and salamanders, and a genius for annoying
prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Livingstone, known as ''Red Ken'' ever since he led London's
last metropolitan government and gave fits to Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, is so far ahead in opinion polls before
Thursday's mayoral election that one major betting agency has
stopped accepting wagers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't had a single substantial bet for any of his
so-called opponents for over a month,'' said Graham Sharpe,
spokesman for the William Hill agency.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Britain's political parties fight for the middle
ground, Livingstone is an unabashed survivor from the governing
Labor Party's once-powerful left wing -- a lively relic of the days
when Laborites called each other ''comrade'' and conservative
newspapers railed against the ''loony left.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in the 1980s when Livingstone led the Greater London
Council, churning controversy by supporting gay rights, declaring
the city a nuclear-free zone, cutting subway fares, and making
common cause with Gerry Adams in support of the Irish Republican
Army's violent campaign for a united Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Livingstone says, that's the key to his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   People ''see me as my own man. That's what people want,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published Thursday by the Evening Standard showed
Livingstone with 51 percent support, far ahead of Conservative
Steve Norris at 17 percent and Labor nominee Frank Dobson at 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey of 1,004 voters had a margin of error of
about 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone, 54, is a skilled political counter-puncher. He
fought a long, losing battle against Thatcher's determination to
kill the Greater London Council, and he danced away from Prime
Minister Tony Blair's often ham-handed efforts to keep him from
becoming mayor.
</P>
<P>
   However, Blair's government created the mayor's job -- the first
elected mayor in London's history -- as part of its program of
returning some powers to regional and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Though enormously popular with ordinary Londoners, Livingstone
is regarded as a self-aggrandizing flake by many of his Labor
colleagues in the House of Commons, including some who share his
left-wing beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone wanted the Labor nomination, repeatedly swore his
eternal fealty to the party, but concluded he was the victim of a
rigged selection process and ran as an independent. He was then
kicked out of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Skinner, a former ally, says Livingstone as mayor would
''hit the headlines, but you'll never be able to trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always viewed him as someone who is an out-and-out
opportunist,'' says David Winnick, a Labor lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The virulence of the attacks contrast with Livingstone's low-key
style. He's a master of the talk show, adroit at turning away wrath
with a quip.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in London, young Kenneth Robert Livingstone was
far more interested in reptiles than in politics, sharing his
bedroom at various times with a South American bullfrog, an
alligator, lizard, salamanders and snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone won a seat on his local government council in 1971
and moved up to the Greater London Council in 1973. At 35, he burst
into national prominence by unexpectedly winning the leadership of
the Labor group, and of the council.
</P>
<P>
   In style and substance, Livingstone's regime in London was
contrary to the Thatcherite norm. He shunned the GLC's official
limousine and rode the subway. He turned down an invitation to the
wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. ''No one elected
us to go to weddings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More controversially, he met with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
and supported the IRA's goal of a united Ireland. In 1983,
Livingstone fanned outrage when he declared that ''what Britain has
done for the Irish nation is, although it is spread over 800 years,
worse than what Hitler did to the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Livingstone, the GLC offered its financial support of gay
rights, feminists, racial minorities and a group called Babies
Against the Bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was him being brazen and wanting to be
outrageous,'' says Illtyd Harrington, Livingstone's deputy for a
time at the GLC. ''There is a little bit of Ken that wants to drop
his trousers in public.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the GLC is most fondly remembered for its attempts
to slash subway and bus fares -- a plan thwarted by Thatcher's
government and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Thatcher decided to abolish the council. Livingstone
fought back by posting London's unemployment figures in big numbers
on the County Building, clearly visible to lawmakers across the
Thames in Westminster Palace. He also launched an expensive
advertising campaign stressing London's right to its own
government.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone's marriage ended in divorce in 1973, and he now
lives with Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK.
</P>
<P>
   Since the GLC's abolition, he has written a book titled ''If
Voting Changed Anything They'd Abolish It,'' became a restaurant
reviewer for the Evening Standard, and earned more than $240,000 as
an after-dinner speaker, often entertaining the capitalists he
excoriates by day.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Livingstone was forced to apologize to the
House of Commons for failing to fully disclose his outside
earnings.

<HEADLINE> Top official Assesses Vietnam Ills  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- After an invitation-only 25th
anniversary celebration of its victory over the United States, a
top official said Vietnam's communist government must now confront
some hard realities -- a sagging economy, rampant corruption and
rising drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually blunt assessment of the country's ills, Ho Chi
Minh City Mayor Vo Viet Thanh told the aging architects of the 1975
military triumph and 20,000 guests Sunday that Vietnam had failed
the memory of those who died and should feel ''guilty at heart''
for not doing more to clean up the economy and government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arbitrary and imperious behavior, wasteful spending,
embezzlement, bribery and other social evils, particularly the
increasingly widespread scourge of drug addiction, are sending
worrying signals of ineffective law enforcement and serious
degradation of moral and spiritual values,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the victory on the battlefield a quarter-century ago
brought the country together, Vietnam's rulers have failed to bring
real prosperity to its 76 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Despite huge potential, including a highly motivated work force,
Vietnam remains among the world's poorest nations, with an average
per capita income of $370 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment, which topped $8 billion in 1996, plummeted
to less than $2 billion in 1999 following the Asian financial
crisis and concerns that Vietnam was unwilling to undertake serious
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Thanh said a top priority must be to make the investment
environment more attractive, adding that his city, once known as
Saigon, ''welcomes with open arms'' foreign investors, businessmen,
and multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's parade on the grounds of the old Independence Palace
-- where communist tanks smashed through the gates on April 30, 1975
-- the focus was the military triumph, although the United States
was never mentioned by name.
</P>
<P>
   Old soldiers, their chests dripping with medals, drew the
loudest applause, along with rifle-toting women from the
''long-haired army'' who were part of the guerrilla campaign
against the Americans. Soldiers on several floats waved bouquets of
fake flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Banners flanking a giant portrait of revolutionary leader Ho Chi
Minh hailed the anniversary of the reunification of communist North
Vietnam and the capitalist South and called on the people to build
an ''economically strong country.''
</P>
<P>
   Only invited guests and participants took part in the palace
festivities, but the festivities continued throughout the day and
night with an open carnival that drew tens of thousands into the
city streets. In the country's largest-ever amnesty, 12,000
prisoners were released. A mass wedding of 25 couples was also held
at a downtown park.
</P>
<P>
   Average Vietnamese have so far shown patience with the
government, as living standards have slowly crept up in the wake of
the economic reforms launched in 1986. But with the current
slowdown, that patience may start to wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   Dang Duc Hao, 40, an invited parade-watcher who was a teen-age
communist supporter in 1975, said he was very happy to be
celebrating what he called ''one of the most vivid examples of
national liberation in the world,'' but he complained about trying
to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family is in difficulty,'' he said, explaining that his
salary as an electricity worker is very low, his wife is sick and
he doesn't have enough money to support his four children.
</P>
<P>
   Among the thin crowd of spectators outside the palace -- now
called Reunification Palace -- was Nguyen Thi Chinh, 39, who
recalled his problems finding a good job after 1975 because his
sister had married an American. Three years ago, he finally got
work as a driver with a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things have gotten better, but I still worry about my
children's future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pham Chi, 70, a retired port worker who came to Ho Chi Minh City
hoping to watch the parade, also wound up standing outside the
palace because he didn't have a ticket. He said the country was
''much more advanced'' than it was a quarter-century ago, when he
watched the palace being bombed just before the city fell to the
communists.
</P>
<P>
   What are his hopes for the next 25 years?
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not be alive in 25 years,'' he laughed. ''Maybe at that
time, the Vietnamese people can fly to the moon.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks Resume  </HEADLINE>
By DANA BUDEIRI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Squabbling in Israel's ruling coalition and
Palestinian protests over a plan to expand a Jewish West Bank
settlement have overshadowed the latest round of talks on a final
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations resumed briefly Sunday in this Red Sea resort amid
accusations by the Palestinians that a plan to build 174 new homes
in the Jewish settlement of Maale Adumim showed that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak either would not or could not make the
concessions necessary for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is struggling for support from parties in his coalition
who oppose territorial concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Talks scheduled to resume today were expected to focus on the
framework agreement for a final treaty and the final Israeli troop
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region
Tuesday to try to push the talks forward. The latest round is aimed
at achieving a framework for a permanent peace between Israel and
the Palestinians, along with agreement on the scale and location of
the third and final troop withdrawal that Israel has promised to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said a disclosure Sunday that
Israel has approved the expansion of Maale Adumim was destroying
Palestinian trust in Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister is concentrating not on the peace talks but
on his coalition talks,'' Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured in 1967, and they
see Jewish settlements there as dangerous obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of talks was delayed five hours while the
Palestinians registered a bitter complaint with Israeli negotiator
Oded Eran over the planned expansion.
</P>
<P>
   After less than two hours of talks, Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators took a break from the tense atmosphere for a swim
together in the hotel's outdoor pool.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, meanwhile, lobbied Cabinet ministers Sunday to support
his plan to give three Arab suburbs of Jerusalem to the
Palestinians as a trust-building gesture. Hard-liners warn that the
move would give the Palestinians a foothold in the disputed city,
claimed by both sides as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said the handover was necessary to give the Palestinians
territorial integrity, something they want for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is proper that the (areas) be under Palestinian security
control,'' Barak told reporters. ''This does not weaken
Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which is expected to be proposed at Wednesday's
Cabinet meeting, the villages would move from joint control to full
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Yisrael B'Aliya, an immigrants party, and the National Religious
Party, a patron of Jewish settlers, said they opposed the gesture,
and the NRP said it would bolt the government if Barak went ahead
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, Barak met with Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual
leader of his largest coalition partner, the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party, after weeks of tension between the two leaders. Barak is
trying to win Shas' support for his peace policies by handing over
funds to Shas' religious school system -- a move opposed by the
dovish Meretz party, another coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
   Barak aide and Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said that without
coalition support, Barak would not be able to hand over the
villages.

<HEADLINE> OSU Plans Hog Research Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARNER, Okla. (AP) -- Oklahoma State University officials say a
planned high-tech, $3 million hog research facility won't smell --
at least not much.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a very high confidence level that the center can do
what we say it will do, which is remove 90 percent of the odors
that commonly come with high concentrations of hogs,'' said Monty
Karns, OSU facilities engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Karns said the 800-hog OSU Swine Teaching and Research Center
will use microbe remediation and ''biofilters'' made of hay to
eliminate most offensive odors coming from the center.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it's complete, there won't be anything else like it in
the world,'' Karns said. ''It will contain the latest features in
odor elimination and groundwater protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The center borrows stench-control technology from the University
of Minnesota and Iowa State University, Karns said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Barfield, head of OSU's biosystems and agricultural
engineering department, said the building will be so odor-free that
most people won't even know it's there.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, the university is expected to seek bids for the
experimental facility, said Harry Birdwell, vice president of
business and external relations.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Birdwell said he plans to get permission from OSU
regents in June to pick a contractor for the project. He said he
thinks construction could begin in August and finished a year
later.
</P>
<P>
   OSU officials agreed to move their 90-year-old swine operation
in February 1999 after complaints about its smell from real estate
agents and city officials in Stillwater. The school's current swine
barn is west of town, next to a motel.
</P>
<P>
   School officials had considered simply doing odor-control
projects on the current facility but dropped that idea.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed facility would be about a mile north and a mile
west of the existing one -- well away from retail and residential
areas, said OSU spokeswoman Natalea Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   The facility would provide instruction, research and ongoing
odor-control development.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Howard, an OSU regent and commissioner of the state
Agriculture Department, said the center will be the next generation
of swine facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the future, I predict this is the kind of facility that the
Environmental Protection Agency is going to require corporate hog
operations to build,'' Howard said. ''The EPA is going to say that
municipalities have done it to eliminate odors from city sewage
systems. So can the hog industry.''

<HEADLINE> Gay Activists Meet on National Mall  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Buoyed by Vermont's new civil-union law,
hundreds of thousands of gay and lesbian rights supporters marched
on the Capitol, hoping to build on recent political victories won
by homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The green fields of the National Mall filled on Sunday with a
sea of people carrying multicolored flags and signs, such as
''Protect our families'' and ''Equal rights for gays and
lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Millennium March on Washington sought to build
on the new Vermont law, which gave homosexuals legal rights similar
to those accorded married couples, and mobilize the crowd into an
important voting bloc this presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's emotionally uplifting. It's incredible,'' said Chris
White of Stafford Springs, Conn. ''But what's most important is the
legislation in Vermont. I wish that our state and other states
could follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a crowd dotted with openly gay celebrities, participants were
also encouraged by President Clinton's recent plea to Congress to
pass the Hate Crime Prevention Act. Others vowed not to rest until
same-sex couples get equal rights in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Some wore costumes or carried signs calling attention to fights
still on the horizon, such as one man wearing a Boy Scout uniform
who carried a sign reading ''Straight Scouts for gay scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If my son was alive, he would be here today,'' said Dennis
Shepard. His 21-year-old son Matthew, a gay University of Wyoming
student, died in October 1998 after being beaten into a coma and
tied to a fence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gay rights is the civil rights issue of this century,'' said
Shepard, who added that he met with Clinton on Friday about the
hate crimes bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke via videotape to what was the first gay rights
march on Washington since 1993. His image shown on a giant screen,
the president said he had presided over ''the most inclusive
administration in history,'' with more than 150 openly gay people
appointed to important government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said there was no sign of any anti-gay
rights demonstrators, and agreed with estimates the crowd numbered
about 200,000. March co-chair Donna Red Wing gave a much higher
estimate, saying it may have been as large as 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other gay and lesbian groups were more critical of the event,
saying organizers lacked support from grass-roots groups and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This event did not galvanize our community and did not gather
the community-building that it attempted to,'' said Bill Hileman,
the national co-chair of the 1993 march who watched this year's
event on television.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Potter, the White House liaison to the gay and lesbian
community, tried to smooth over differences. ''We don't always
agree'' on which path to take, but ''what I do know is that every
step we take'' leads closer to equal rights for all, Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities in the crowd included actress Ellen DeGeneres and
her partner, actress Anne Heche, singer Melissa Etheridge, and
tennis star Martina Navratilova.

<HEADLINE> First President's Home Saved  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The riverboat slid through the night, and when
her captain sighted the famous house on the steep bank above the
Potomac he followed long-established custom and rang the ship's
bell in salute.
</P>
<P>
   The bell awakened a cabin passenger, Louisa Cunningham, who came
out on deck for a moonlit view of Mount Vernon, home of George
Washington, first president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1853 and the house where Washington had died 54 years
earlier was clearly a wreck. Its roof sagged. Its pillared portico
was painfully propped with raw wooden beams.
</P>
<P>
   The image was still vivid when Mrs. Cunningham wrote her
daughter, Ann Pamela Cunningham, who was in Philadelphia recovering
from an operation:
</P>
<P>
   ''I was painfully distressed at the ruin and desolation of the
home of Washington, and the thought passed through my mind: Why was
it that the women of his country did not try to keep it in repair,
if the men could not do it? It seems such a blot on our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The words struck a spark.
</P>
<P>
   The first historic preservation project in the United States was
soon under way. And as Mrs. Cunningham had envisioned, it was run
by women. Her daughter took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was an opportune moment. Mount Vernon was for sale, but only
to the right buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The estate was owned by John Augustine Washington Jr., the
president's great-grandnephew. He was unable to earn a profit from
its lands and therefore could not maintain the house and grounds.
But he insisted that Washington's home should not be exploited by
private interests. He would sell only to the state of Virginia or
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Pamela Cunningham was then 37 and a semi-invalid. But she
had found an inspiring project.
</P>
<P>
   Surmounting the difficulties then placed in the way of women,
Miss Cunningham formed a corporation, The Mount Vernon Ladies'
Association of the Union. She enlisted allies to lobby the Virginia
legislature in Richmond. In March 1856 it passed legislation
allowing the transfer of the Mount Vernon mansion and 200 acres to
the association under state supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Ritchie, wife of the editor of the Richmond Enquirer, who
had helped in the effort, offered congratulations:
</P>
<P>
   ''Mount Vernon is secure -- is ours! We may be sure of that,''
she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The congratulations were premature. The owner balked.
</P>
<P>
   John Augustine Washington Jr. was suffering from bruised
feelings. He had been criticized for attempting to sell his family
legacy in the first place. Now he felt the latest arrangement was
intended ''to put an indignity upon him.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Cunningham won a point when she visited Mount Vernon in the
summer of 1856 and assured Washington she thought he had been
unfairly abused.
</P>
<P>
   Watching his face, she thought she had touched ''the obstacle no
money could have removed.''
</P>
<P>
   But reaching final agreement on the sale and a purchase price of
$200,000 took two more years.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1858, the owner conceded in a letter that ''the women
of the land will probably be the safest, as they will certainly be
the purest, guardians of a national shrine.''
</P>
<P>
   When the association took possession in 1860 the house was empty
except for a globe, the clay model of a bust of the first president
and the key to the Bastille sent to George Washington by the
Marquis de Lafayette after the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   There was a postscript.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the sale the federal Union that Washington helped
found broke apart. The most urgent mission for the new owners of
Mount Vernon was to keep the war from destroying the place.
</P>
<P>
   John Augustine Washington Jr. was killed in combat in September
1861 while fighting for the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   By 1874, when Miss Cunningham stepped down as the association's
regent, Mount Vernon's future was assured.
</P>
<P>
   She had a final wish: Allow George Washington's home to remain
as close to his time as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let one spot in this grand country of ours be spared from
change,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The story of the saving of Mount Vernon is told in ''Mount
Vernon Is Ours,'' by Elswyth Thane, published by J.B. Lippincott
Co. in 1967. The spring issue of the journal ''Colonial
Williamsburg'' features an article by Robert A. Seilig entitled
''Mount Vernon After Washington: The Rescue of an American
Memory.'' Mount Vernon is still owned and managed by The Mount
Vernon Ladies' Association.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renews Criticism of Senate  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- President Clinton is renewing his criticism of
the Republican-led Senate for its slowness in confirming dozens of
his judicial appointments, particularly those of women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Sunday to the Detroit chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Clinton said a
recent study showed that women and minorities took longer to be
considered and were rejected more often than white males.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to appointing judges, the United States Senate
is not doing what it ought to be doing, especially with regard to
women and minority appointees,'' the president told an enthusiastic
audience of about 9,000. ''Vote them up or down. Let us know how
you stand.''
</P>
<P>
   As of early March, when two of Clinton's more controversial
appointees won Senate confirmation, there remained 73 federal
judicial vacancies, or about 10 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited a Michigan appellate judge, Helene White, who has
waited for a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for three years --
longer than any other pending nominee. A nominee who was in
Sunday's audience, Kathleen McCree Lewis, would become the first
black woman ever to serve on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
if approved.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame, and we ought to be doing something about it,''
the president said of the slow pace.
</P>
<P>
   In response to similar Clinton comments earlier this year, Sen.
Orrin Hatch, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said more than half
the nominees that his panel reported to the full Senate in 1999
were women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if the nominee is a judicial activist or is for some other
reason unqualified to serve for a lifetime appointment on the
federal bench, that nominee should not and will not have the
support of the Senate,'' the Utah Republican added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also touched on race relations, saying that if granted
one wish, ''I would wish for our country to be truly one America.''
</P>
<P>
   But his long-promised prescription to improve race relations,
the ''One America Agenda,'' has gone through several drafts and the
White House has no timetable on when, if ever, it will be released.
Clinton offered no glimpses of detail in his Sunday speech, either.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, say that the government's ability to turn
chronic budget deficits into surpluses and move 7 million people
from welfare to work are examples of what can be accomplished when
Americans of all backgrounds work together.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe everybody counts. Everybody should have a chance.
Everybody has a role to play. And we all do better when we help
each other,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In a commencement address earlier Sunday at Eastern Michigan
University in Ypsilanti, Clinton said he would send Congress
legislation intended to better protect the privacy of individual
financial and medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one should have to worry that the results of their latest
physical exam could deny them a home mortgage or a credit card,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this information age we can't let new opportunities erode
old, fundamental rights We can't let breakthroughs in technology
break down the walls of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would, in many cases, require a company to tell
customers it was going to share sensitive consumer information such
as medical and insurance records, or lists of what people buy and
where they buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would give consumers the option not to have
that information shared, and give consumers a new right to review
their credit reports for errors.
</P>
<P>
   The plan stands little chance of passing Congress in this
election year, however. Much of the financial services industry is
opposed.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hearings on Elian Not Definite  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional hearings on the government's
seizure of Elian Gonzalez may never happen, despite Republican
demands for an inquiry into the Justice Department's use of force,
a key lawmaker says.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he
will need to see the government's documents before deciding whether
such proceedings are warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we get those, I think we can make an intelligent
appraisal as to whether hearings should be held or not. Whether we
should go forth, whether we shouldn't,'' Hatch said Sunday on NBC's
''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if hearings might not be held at all, he replied: ''If
they're not justified, I guess there won't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Hatch's reasoning for postponing the proceedings
gives Republicans a graceful way to bow to public opinion, which
polls show has overwhelmingly swung against a congressional
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doubt there will be hearings, and there shouldn't be
hearings,'' Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on
Hatch's committee, said on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of no hearings is a stark departure from the
demands of GOP congressional leaders last week, who accused
Attorney General Janet Reno of prematurely ending negotiations with
the 6-year-old Elian's relatives in Miami and ordering an
excessively forceful raid on their home.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents seized Elian on April 22 and reunited him with
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. The pair, along with Elian's
stepmother and infant half brother are staying a secluded retreat
on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Thursday to Reno, Hatch gave the Justice Department
24 hours to turn over all documents ''related to (1) surveillance
of the Miami home, including but not limited to the possibility of
weapons in that home; (2) seeking and obtaining the search warrant
and the arrest warrant; (3) the decision to enter the home and the
means of entry, and (4) the conduct of the operation of entering
the home, seizing the boy, and taking him to Maryland, including
but not limited to any tactical plan or rules of engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department announced it was unable to comply with
the request in 24 hours, and with the blessing of Republican
leaders, Hatch postponed the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   While those proceedings might never take place, Hatch and others
said questions still need to be answered about the legality of the
agents' search warrant, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ends don't justify the means here,'' Hatch said. If he
schedules any hearings, Hatch said he would ask Reno to testify,
but probably not Elian's Miami family.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats said they would support forward-looking hearings
on how to improve the immigration system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we ought to take a look in a very dispassionate way at
all of the cases ... and see if there isn't a better way of handing
these matters,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She
added that she believes Reno followed the law.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans kept up their attacks on Reno, saying photos showing
gun-toting agents grabbing a sobbing Elian raises questions about
whether the Constitution still protects Americans against the
government's excessive use of force.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration seems ''to only have two speeds:
either warped speed, aggressive all-out send-in-the-storm-troopers,
or no speed at all, as in the investigation of campaign finance
abuses and Chinese involvement,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there would be hearings, Lott replied: ''We have a
commitment to have the hearings. But it is hard to go forward with
hearings when basic documents you requested have not been
received.''

Clinton Renews Criticism of Senate
</SUBHEAD>

   DETROIT (AP) -- President Clinton is renewing his criticism of the
Republican-led Senate for its slowness in confirming dozens of his judicial
appointments, particularly those of women and minorities. In a speech Sunday to
the Detroit chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, Clinton said a recent study showed that women and minorities took longer
to be considered and were rejected more often than white males. As of early
March, when two of Clinton's more controversial appointees won Senate
confirmation, there remained 73 federal judicial vacancies, or about 10 percent
of the total.

Israeli-Palestinian Talks To Resume
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Squabbling in Israel's ruling coalition and Palestinian
protests over a plan to expand a Jewish West Bank settlement have overshadowed
the latest round of talks on a final peace treaty. Negotiations resumed briefly
Sunday in this Red Sea resort amid accusations by the Palestinians that a plan
to build 174 new homes in the Jewish settlement of Maale Adumim showed that
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak either would not or could not make the
concessions necessary for peace. Talks scheduled to resume Monday were expected
to focus on the framework agreement for a final treaty and the final Israeli
troop redeployment.

McCain Expected To Endorse Bush

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain said Sunday he will endorse Texas
Governor George W. Bush when they meet next week. Overhauling federal campaign
finance laws was the signature issue of McCain's now suspended campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination. Bush opposes some proposed reforms. But
McCain said that discord would not preclude an endorsement of Bush, the
all-but-declared GOP presidential nominee, since the two agree on other areas in
need of change, including Social Security, the military, education and health
care.

U.S.: AIDS Is Risk To National Security

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials Sunday defended their decision to
classify AIDS as a threat to national security -- a designation aimed at
garnering more attention and funding toward combating the disease worldwide.
Sandy Thurman, director of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, said
AIDS has become such an epidemic that, in years to come, it threatens to
destabilize nations and the economies of whole continents. The Clinton
administration has designated about $325 million to fighting the disease
worldwide this year, most of it going to Africa.

Sheppard Family To Challenge Verdict
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The jury verdict rejecting the claim that Dr. Sam Sheppard
was wrongfully imprisoned for killing his wife in 1954 will be challenged, the
Sheppard family's lead attorney said Sunday. On April 12, a jury unanimously
rejected the wrongful imprisonment claim filed in the case that helped inspire
''The Fugitive'' TV series. Gilbert said he would file a motion on Monday asking
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Ron Suster to set aside the verdict or,
as an alternative, grant another trial. Suster presided at the civil trial.
Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William Mason said the Sheppard side had gotten a
fair chance to present its case and predicted the verdict would stand.

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The NAACP, fighting to bring the Confederate flag down

that would create a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday alongside one honoring the
Confederacy. Hodges plans a major ceremony Monday -- planting a tree grown from
a seedling from Selma, Ala. -- to honor the King holiday. South Carolina was the

<HEADLINE> GOP Mayor Hosting Dems' Convention  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- He's rich, Republican and, come August,
responsible for helping showcase Democrat Al Gore's pursuit of the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Leading his city in playing host for the Democratic National
Convention, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan may end up the one
Republican whose praises Democrats sing this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic convention is a huge plus for the city of Los
Angeles, and that's my first love. My first love is not the
Republican Party,'' the slender, reserved mayor said in an
interview a few days before his 70th birthday Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan already has called the Aug. 14-17 convention his top
priority and even participated in a high-profile Beverly Hills
fund-raiser with President Clinton that drew director Steven
Spielberg and other Democratic Party stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ''irony of ironies,'' said H. Eric Schockman, associate
professor of political science at the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Riordan's wife is a Democrat, he has golfed
and jogged with Clinton and is comfortable with both parties.
</P>
<P>
   More a businessman than a politician, the New York native sees
the convention through the eyes of a corporate executive: He hopes
to boost not only Los Angeles' economy but also the image of the
nation's second-largest city before an expected 50,000 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a footnote, it shows that a Republican can put on a better
Democratic convention than a Democrat, or, to put it another way,
than a Democrat can put on a Republican convention,'' said Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Convention will be held July 31-Aug. 3
in Philadelphia, where one Democratic mayor helped secure the bid
and another will be in office during the event.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said that after months of disorganization and poor
communication among Democratic convention planners, he ''sort of
woke up three months ago'' and jumped in. He ousted the host
committee's president and installed his deputy mayor in the job.
</P>
<P>
   He also works the phone for contributions, recently securing
donations from Republican entertainment moguls Rupert Murdoch and
A. Jerrold Perenchio.
</P>
<P>
   Now things are, by all accounts, moving along, and Democrats are
quietly breathing a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for example, said at the Beverly Hills fund-raiser,
''We were a little slow off the block, but I think we're in good
shape now.'' The president acknowledged he was ''a little bit''
surprised to see Riordan there but credited the influence of the
mayor's Democratic wife, Nancy Daly Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Convention Committee is responsible for
events inside the convention, but the city's host committee handles
major outside issues: raising money, overseeing transportation and
working with police to ensure protesters don't shut down parts of
the city as they did at world financial meetings in Seattle and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will be one of Riordan's last big events before
he leaves office next year.
</P>
<P>
   It caps a brief political career that began with appointments by
Democratic Mayor Tom Bradley to the Recreation and Parks Commission
and the Coliseum Commission. A multimillionaire investment banker
and lawyer, Riordan ran for his first elective position in 1993
when Bradley left office.
</P>
<P>
   Spending millions of his own money and portraying himself as an
outsider, Riordan overcame a crowded field of candidates and then
won a close runoff against an Asian-American Democrat. The victory
marked the first time a Republican had been elected to the
nonpartisan office in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan was re-elected in 1997, beating Democratic state Sen.
Tom Hayden, Jane Fonda's former husband.
</P>
<P>
   He has accepted just $1 a year as mayor, making clear he's not
in politics for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan is comfortable around both major parties and has been
suggested as a possible U.S. secretary of education. He won't rule
it out but says he'd rather work with local school districts,
including perhaps Los Angeles' troubled system.
</P>
<P>
   His choice for president? He sent an endorsement letter to humor
columnist Dave Barry.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the only one who has committed to do absolutely nothing
if he's elected,'' Riordan said.

<HEADLINE> 'U-571' Tops Box Office Again  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The submarine film ''U-571'' remained buoyant
at the box office despite an onslaught of new movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''U-571'' was North America's top-grossing film for a second
week, taking in $12.3 million, according to industry estimates
Sunday. The movie has made $38.2 million in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Final weekend figures were to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' the second live-action
comedy based on the TV cartoon series, debuted in second place with
$10.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sci-fi tale ''Frequency'' premiered at No. 3 with $9.1
million. Jim Caviezel stars as a cop communicating with his dead
father (Dennis Quaid) via time-traveling radio waves as they track
a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It works on the science-fiction level, it's got a little bit
of 'Sixth Sense' in it, it's a family picture and a murder mystery
all at the same time,'' said David Tuckerman, executive vice
president of distribution for New Line, which released
''Frequency.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where the Heart Is,'' a melodrama starring Natalie Portman as
an abandoned pregnant teen, opened in fourth place with $8.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend is shaping up as the unofficial kickoff to the
summer blockbuster season, with the Roman spectacle ''Gladiator,''
starring Russell Crowe, hitting theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the calm before the storm,'' said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. ''The
summer starts in earnest next week, when you'll get new movies
every weekend looking for bigger and better results.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Viva Rock Vegas'' had a quiet opening compared to its 1994
predecessor ''The Flintstones,'' which took in $28 million in its
first three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what happens with sequels,'' said Nikki Rocco,
Universal's head of distribution. ''It's a little family film, and
our expectations were fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Two new movies scored well in limited release. The experimental
''Time Code'' had a solid debut, grossing $95,000 and averaging an
impressive $13,571 in seven theaters. Directed by Mike Figgis
(''Leaving Las Vegas''), ''Time Code'' was shot by four cameras in
single, 93-minute takes and plays out on four separate frames on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey's ''The Big Kahuna'' opened in eight theaters and
took in $88,000 for an $11,000 average. Danny DeVito and Peter
Facinelli co-star in the story of three salesmen at ideological
odds as they try to land a big customer at a convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time Code'' and ''Big Kahuna'' expand to more theaters over
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ''Fantasia 2000'' ended its four-month run at most
large-screen Imax theaters with $63.8 million worldwide and one
week left in Japan. The movie begins a four-week engagement at
regular theaters June 16.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''U-571,'' $12.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' $10.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Frequency,'' $9.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Where the Heart Is,'' $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Love and Basketball,'' $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Rules of Engagement,'' $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Keeping the Faith,'' $4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''28 Days,'' $4 million.

<HEADLINE> Gore Raps Bush on Foreign Policy  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- With a heightened focus on foreign policy, Vice
President Al Gore is taking aim at what he sees as a vulnerability
of George W. Bush, whose thinking on national security he charges
is ''noticeably blank.''
</P>
<P>
   In an address Sunday to the International Press Institute's
congress of foreign journalists, Gore cast his Republican rival for
the presidency as a puppet of ''right-wing'' ideologues such as
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and dangerously fixated on the Cold War
past.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of hands-on diplomacy at the White House, Gore
believes he outshines Texas Gov. Bush in foreign policy expertise.
He recently added elements of foreign policy, particularly Bush's
opposition to a nuclear testing ban, to his campaign stump speech
and will address international affairs again at the West Point
military academy's commencement May 27.
</P>
<P>
   In his Boston speech, Gore dismissed Bush as ''noticeably
blank'' on 21st century national security challenges such as
terrorism, narcotics trafficking, the global environment and
international family planning, for which Gore supports additional
U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's foreign
policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and
inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan
isolationism of the Republican congressional leadership,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice, Bush's top foreign policy adviser, shot back
that the speech lacked credibility, ''somewhat typical of the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He has this tendency to say that he's going to do one thing
and in fact he's ... done another for seven years,'' Rice said,
calling the Clinton-Gore record haphazard and incoherent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has pledged to make the rejected Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty the first measure he submits to the Senate if elected,
attacked Helms' declaration last week that he will block any new
arms control pacts until a new president is inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is negotiating a START III weapons pact with
Russia and hopes to adjust the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
to allow for a limited U.S. missile defense system to protect
against attacks from rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Governor Bush were to inherit from us an arms control
agreement so clearly in the best interests of the American people,
is Senator Helms the last word?'' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized Bush for promising to heighten the threshold for
American intervention in overseas crises and get involved only
where there is a direct U.S. interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush dangerously fixates on the Cold War past when
speaking of the use of force. He suggests that he would not
intervene to relieve even the brutal repression of ethnic cleansing
and genocide,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must reject the new isolationism that says, don't help
anywhere because we cannot help everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice countered, ''If what the vice president is saying is that
the post-Cold War mission of American armed forces is to just
intervene in other people's civil wars because we might be able to
help, I think that's a headline.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended his work with the Russians, which Bush has
criticized as solicitous and negligent of increased corruption in
Moscow, and said Bush wrongly viewed Russia and China as America's
enemies instead of as ''vital partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said Gore had mischaracterized Bush's views. ''The governor
has not said that Russia and China should be enemies; in fact, he
has said that China is a competitor and we should reach out to
Russia,'' she said. ''It is very much like the vice president to
distort (Bush's) record.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore lashed out at supporters of the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act, legislation backed by Bush to establish closer military ties
with Taiwan. He said they were ''blind to its consequences: A sharp
deterioration in the security of the region.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Hope To Find Woman's Body  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- When Girly Chew Hossencofft failed to
show up for work at Bank of America nearly eight months ago, her
co-workers knew they would likely never see her again.
</P>
<P>
   Her boss called police. Within hours, her bloody clothing was
found along a rural highway and her purse was found in the middle
of an Albuquerque street. Damp carpet with bleached-out bloodstains
was found at her home.
</P>
<P>
   Her estranged husband, Diazien Hossencofft, and his 46-year-old
girlfriend, Linda Henning, are charged with murder in a case that
has made headlines in Mrs. Hossencrofft's native Malaysia. Bail for
each was set at $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a grand jury handed down a 27-count indictment
against Hossencofft and a 20-count indictment against Henning, that
includes charges of murder, kidnapping, conspiracy and
evidence-tampering. No trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants could face the death penalty if convicted,
prosecutors say, although the defense disputes that. It is rare for
defendants to face execution when the alleged murder victim is
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Both defendants maintain their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent John Schum said bank employees told him that Mrs.
Hossencofft, 36, reported threats by her 34-year-old husband of six
years over the couple's final years and ''that if she ever
disappeared, they should expect the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very afraid of him. She feared for her life,'' said
her boss, Kathy Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Hossencofft, who also vanished when his wife disappeared, was
arrested Sept. 21 in Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   A witness told grand jurors that Hossencofft twice tried to get
him to help kill Mrs. Hossencofft, who had left her husband in
February 1999 and obtained a restraining order against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she didn't show up, I knew something was wrong,'' Freeman
said, recalling the day she disappeared, Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks passed, and fellow employees were sure she was dead,
Freeman said. They set up a floral shrine in her memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''She had a teller cage that no one had touched since she
left,'' Freeman said. ''There were flowers all over her cage.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman says Girly Chew apparently met Hossencofft while
vacationing in California. She had worked at two banks in Malaysia
and often visited America as a tourist. She married Hossencofft
about a year before she began working in Albuquerque. The couple
had no children.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, who lives on Penang island in northern Malaysia, was
hesitant to talk much about his only daughter's disappearance,
saying it wouldn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ''My daughter's gone. There's no hope. She's no more,'' he told
The Associated Press from Kuala Lumpur. ''Although she's missing,
the chances are very slim that she's still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 10, a highway worker found her bloody blouse, shorts
and panties along with a bloodstained tarpaulin along U.S. Route
60, just west of Magdalena.
</P>
<P>
   Police have scoured the wind-swept area, 100 miles southwest of
Albuquerque and also have searched the foothills of the Sandia
mountains east of Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Paul Spiers said the continuing
search is about to intensify again in an area he declined to
identify. Prosecutors have asked for blood samples from the family
to compare DNA with blood evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Hossencofft, who was born in Houston and raised in Texas,
Oklahoma, California and Arizona, denies killing his wife or
dumping her body, defense attorney Ron Koch said. Hossencofft has
an idea about what happened to her, Koch said, but added that he
cannot divulge that theory.
</P>
<P>
   Born Armando Chavez Jr. on March 5, 1965, he changed his name to
Diazien Hossencofft in an Albuquerque court in July 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I heard it, he had wanted to incorporate within his own
name, according to him, the strains of the master races,'' Germanic
and Asian, Spiers said.
</P>
<P>
   Henning's public defender, Trienah Meyers Gorman, says her
client maintains her innocence. She also says the defense does not
believe the aggravated circumstances required in a death-penalty
prosecution exist in this case.
</P>
<P>
   When Hossencofft was arraigned on Jan. 14, he grinned throughout
the proceedings. Reporters asked about it as he was led away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no reason not to smile,'' he told them.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Forces Seek Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISABELA, Philippines (AP) -- Rosebert and Lydda Ajon were riding
a motorcycle home from the elementary school where they teach when
they were stopped by a band of Muslim rebels who had just attacked
a nearby military outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, along with 50 other teachers and students, were
forced to serve as human shields for the Abu Sayyaf rebels' escape.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, they are at the center of a hostage crisis that
has put an end to the obscurity of the Philippines' long-simmering
Muslim separatist rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Philippine soldiers overran the Abu Sayyaf's
sprawling mountain stronghold on southern Basilan island, but are
still searching for the Ajons and 25 other remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a separate group of Abu Sayyaf rebels on the
neighboring island of Jolo are holding 21 other hostages, including
10 foreign tourists, kidnapped April 23 from Malaysia. A kidnapper
told a local radio station today that a South African woman had
collapsed and several other hostages were suffering from fevers.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappings have put the country's 30-year Muslim rebellion
on front pages around the world, spooked Philippine financial
markets, and instilled a new urgency in the government's peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the government's hard-line response to recent
attacks by Islamic rebels has nearly sunk prospects for peace in
the impoverished southern Mindanao region, the home of the
country's Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   While the Abu Sayyaf kidnappings have focused attention on the
insurgency -- which has killed more than 120,000 people in three
decades -- the group is the smaller of two Muslim separatist groups,
with 200 fighters and little public support.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf, with roots in an organization founded in 1972 by
Iranian missionaries spreading the teachings of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, has been blamed for many violent attacks in the southern
Philippines -- including one in 1995 that killed 53 people and
injured 100 others in the town of Ipil.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Abu Sayyaf are bandits masquerading as religious
fundamentalists, giving Muslims a bad name,'' said military
spokesman Col. Hilario Atendido.
</P>
<P>
   The other, much larger rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, announced Sunday it would pull out of peace talks with the
government. The group's withdraw from the peace process is seen as
a much more serious blow to peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three days, MILF forces and government troops have
clashed outside the group's headquarters in Maguindanao province.
At least 36 guerrillas and four soldiers have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels accused the government of attacking the camp, but
military officials said they were only trying to remove 700
guerrillas who had blocked a main road along the camp's boundary
and were extorting money from motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said he hoped the MILF's
decision was ''just a temporary setback to the peace talks,'' which
began earlier this year. But he said the military will continue
attacks to stop the rebels from violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   The MILF warned that if the attacks continue, it will respond
with counterattacks in major southern cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The possibility is that the war ... will be escalated to other
areas,'' MILF vice chairman Ghazali Jaafar told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The military says the MILF has up to 5,000 well-armed fighters
in the camp, while the guerrillas claim twice that number. A major
battle would greatly escalate tension in Mindanao, where 17 million
of the Philippines' 74 million people live.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada has pledged to turn the resource-rich
region into the nation's food basket. Lasting peace will only be
realized, he said Sunday, ''when our brother Muslims have equal
access to development opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, per capital annual income in southern Mindanao is
$200, compared to an average of more than $1,000 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Estrada has also taken a hard-line on the rebels, warning of
an ''all-out war'' if guerrilla attacks don't stop.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they want peace in Mindanao, we will give them peace,'' he
said Sunday. ''But if the rebels there persist in carrying out
terrorist acts, we will not hesitate to apply to them the full
force of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But by focusing on the conflict with the rebel groups, critics
say, the government is losing sight of the deeper problems of
Mindanao's Muslims, such as decades of discrimination and
government neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not leading to peace. Everybody knows that a military
solution is not the solution to what is happening in Mindanao,''
said Inday Santiago, a member of the Mindanao Council of Women
Leaders, an independent women's group.
</P>
<P>
   Rosebert Ajon's family waits anxiously for the couple's return.
Both his father, Roberto, and mother, Rosario, have given up their
jobs because of their worries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't do anything but pray,'' Rosario says. ''I don't want
them to die because God knows they did nothing wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Mayor's latest health report is positive, spokesman says  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani won't make a final
decision on his cancer treatment course or his campaign until the
middle of May, but his supporters are predicting that he will stay
in the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident that he will be back,'' former GOP presidential
candidate Sen. John McCain, of Arizona, told ABC's ''This Week'' on
Sunday. ''The odds are overwhelming that he'll be fine and that he
will be very active, and I believe he'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Senate campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, told ''Fox
News Sunday'': ''It's not only my hope, but my expectation, that he
will run. Hopefully he'll pick a course of treatment that will give
him a cure, a complete cure, and then we'll be able to move forth
aggressively, with a winning campaign. That's our hope, and I know
the mayor shares my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has offered to campaign for Giuliani while the mayor
keeps his medical appointments.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he's sure Giuliani, who was playing golf Sunday
with his son, will be campaigning again soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very confident he'll be on the trail soon and he'll win
and he won't need any of us,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post released a poll Sunday that identified Gov.
George Pataki as the ''best choice'' among Republicans to take on
Hillary Rodham Clinton if Giuliani should drop out of the Senate
race. The poll showed Clinton and Pataki in a statistical tie if
Giuliani were to exit the race, with U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, who put
his Senate campaign on hold to make way for Giuliani, a distant
second in a matchup with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Giuliani were also tied for support in a
head-to-head race.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby International poll surveyed 601 likely voters
statewide. It has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum noted that tests show the mayor's prostate cancer has
not spread, but he said it will take the mayor 10 days to two weeks
before he decides on a course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   That will take up important campaign and fund-raising time
before the state Republican convention in Buffalo on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stayed away from any reference to the mayor in a speech
Sunday to a Catholic organization of union electricians.
</P>
<P>
   She has been criticized recently for failing to comment
immediately on news developments, while Giuliani is often more
forthright with his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts have predicted that the first lady will
tone down her rhetoric against the mayor because it would be
unseemly to attack him now that he has cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Austin McCann, business representative for the union, Local 3 of
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, pledged the
group's support for Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're right behind you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton spokesman declined to comment on the prediction by
Teitelbaum and McCain that Giuliani would stay in the race.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Adoptions Rising in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By CADONNA M. PEYTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Anfisa Luopajarvi's room is cluttered but
cozy, filled with furniture, stuffed animals and knickknacks.
</P>
<P>
   Her walls are covered with 17 posters of Leonardo DiCaprio. He
was once her favorite actor, she said, but now she likes Matt Damon
and Richard Gere more.
</P>
<P>
   Anfisa is not your average American teen-ager, though. The
16-year-old with a troubled past was born in Karelia, a northwest
territory of Russia, and was adopted in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say I'm Russian but it means nothing. I don't feel like
I'm Russian,'' Anfisa says.
</P>
<P>
   Each year more and more Americans -- single and married -- are
traveling to places like Russia, China, Guatemala and Romania to
add to their families.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign adoptions have risen from 6,536 in 1992 to more than
16,396 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Anfisa's mother, Natasha, was a prostitute. Her father, Genaldie
Ovchinicova, was a customer. They did marry, but only briefly,
before he left.
</P>
<P>
   With no way to care for her child, Natasha returned to the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   As a toddler, Anfisa was often left outside in freezing weather
to find her own supper.
</P>
<P>
   When Ovchinicova learned of his daughter's plight, he got
custody and they moved to a ''run down, rough neighborhood'' in a
poor area of St. Petersburg, Anfisa said.
</P>
<P>
   Anfisa's mother was killed by another customer.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was fine with her father, Anfisa said, until he lost
his job and started drinking and the neglect started all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   So Anfisa ran away, seeking refuge at a church until nuns placed
her in an orphanage. She was adopted after just a year.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, she has little or no accent and the only
evidence of her birthplace is a ''matrushka'' in her bedroom
window. The handpainted wooden doll, the size of a soda can, has
four other dolls inside. Anfisa will only say: ''It was a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Many children, especially the older ones who know and understand
where they came from, come to America and try to acculturate too
quickly, sometimes rejecting everything that has to do with their
own homeland, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very natural for kids to want to forget about that life,
because it was hard and they want to just shove it away,'' said
Sharon Roszia, a social worker and program manager at Kinship, an
Orange County adoption agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''But in the process of shoving it away, they literally bury a
part of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Igor McCamey's room, the only evidence of his heritage is a
couple of Russian books and a dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are not mine,'' he said. ''My mother put them there.''
</P>
<P>
   Igor, 13, and his older sister Natasha live in San Mateo, about
20 miles southeast of San Francisco. The siblings spent 10 years in
different Russian orphanages before being adopted almost 18 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Igor denies his heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not Russian, I'm American,'' he said, still with a strong
Russian accent. He pulls out a Pokemon collection as if to prove
his point.
</P>
<P>
   This is typical sentiment, Roszia said. During the years she has
worked with international adoptees and their families, she has
known children who reject their countries and their language. Some
have gone so far as to change their names to make them more
''American.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They feel an internal need to disidentify themselves from the
place from which they come,'' she said. ''A younger child will have
some issues. The older child is going to have more.''
</P>
<P>
   It is up to new parents to help the children find a healthy
identity embracing cultures old and new, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Parents must also teach the children about their countries and
encourage them to nurture their languages.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much of culture is transmitted through language. If you
don't speak the language, you lose the culture,'' Roszia said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her brother Igor, Natasha has no problem acknowledging
where she came from. Although she doesn't want to go back to live
in Russia, she calls it her ''home.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Igor, she hopes his attitude will change.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha, 16, reads a Russian newspaper sent to her home every
weekend. She also continues to use her native language with a tutor
that visits the home frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like America. It's a good country, but,'' she said, stopping
in mid sentence, ''I'm Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever language I speak, wherever I am, I will always be
Russian.''

<HEADLINE> Turkish Leaders Step Up Pressure  </HEADLINE>
By SUZAN FRASER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Leaders of Turkey's governing coalition
were looking for support today to ensure their candidate's win in a
second round parliamentary vote for president.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmet Necdet Sezer, a top judge and advocate of reforms,
captured a majority of votes in a first round of balloting last
week, but failed to get the 367 votes needed for an outright
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer lost despite receiving the endorsement of the leaders of
all of the parties in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A second round of voting was expected today.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the governing coalition have launched a behind
the scenes campaign to convince independent-minded lawmakers to
back Sezer, the Hurriyet newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mesut Yilmaz, the leader of the Motherland Party, planned to
speak with each lawmaker from his party thought to have failed to
back Sezer in last week's vote, Hurriyet reported. Motherland is a
member of the governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said another coalition partner, the Nationalist
Action Party, was also lobbying its members for support.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has repeatedly spoken out in favor
of Sezer.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer received 281 votes in the first round secret ballot. That
would be sufficient for a victory in a third round of voting, when
only 276 ballots are required.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Mr. Sezer is not elected in the second round, he will
certainly win in the third round,'' said Yilmaz. ''But those
candidates who have no chances to win should pull out before the
second round.''
</P>
<P>
   Sezer closest adversary won only 61 votes.
</P>
<P>
   But with eight other candidates still in the race, many analysts
believe the election will extend to a third round.
</P>
<P>
   That would be another blow to coalition leaders, who have had
increasing trouble enforcing party discipline. In April, deputies
snubbed Ecevit's attempt to amend the constitution and give
President Suleyman Demirel another term.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Sezer -- the 58-year-old chief justice of the
Constitutional Court -- could be a catalyst for democratic reforms
in a country frequently criticized for restricting freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   As head of Turkey's constitutional court, he has called for a
major overhaul of the constitution -- drawn up under the scrutiny of
the leaders of the 1980 military coup -- saying it restricted
freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer has also openly criticized restrictions on the use of the
Kurdish language, banned in schools and broadcasts. Speaking the
language was only made legal in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey does not recognize its 12 million Kurds as a minority,
and views Kurdish cultural identity as a threat to the Turkish
state.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer's election would likely please the European Union, which
says Turkey's candidacy to the union depends on sweeping reforms to
its freedom-curbing laws.

Memo Addresses White House E-mail
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials prepared to tell Congress as early
as February 1999 about a glitch in their e-mail system and to begin retrieving
thousands of unarchived messages that might be relevant to investigators. But
they never followed through, an internal memo shows. The memo, a set of talking
points for testimony before congressional appropriators, laid out the history of
the problem. It disclosed that presidential aides had solicited a bid on Oct.
20, 1998, from contractor Northrup Grumman to retrieve e-mails that weren't
archived because of the glitch.

Time Warner Drops ABC Affiliates

<P>
	   UNDATED (AP) -- An impasse over transmission rights between Time Warner Inc.
and The Walt Disney Co. has caused 11 Disney-owned ABC affiliates to be dropped
from the Time Warner Cable system during the May sweeps period. Michael Luftman,
spokesman for Time Warner, said about two million homes on the East Coast lost
their ABC signal shortly after midnight Sunday. A total of 3.5 million homes
nationwide were to be affected. In New York, a scrolling message from the cable
company under the headline "Disney Has Taken ABC Away From You" said the move
came "despite our best efforts to avoid this situation."

Clinton Renews Criticism of Senate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- President Clinton is renewing his criticism of the
Republican-led Senate for its slowness in confirming dozens of his judicial
appointments, particularly those of women and minorities. In a speech Sunday to
the Detroit chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, Clinton said a recent study showed that women and minorities took longer
to be considered and were rejected more often than white males. As of early
March, when two of Clinton's more controversial appointees won Senate
confirmation, there remained 73 federal judicial vacancies, or about 10 percent
of the total.

resumed briefly Sunday in this Red Sea resort amid accusations by the
Palestinians that a plan to build 174 new homes in the Jewish settlement of
Maale Adumim showed that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak either would not or
could not make the concessions necessary for peace. Talks scheduled to resume
Monday were expected to focus on the framework agreement for a final treaty and

for the Republican presidential nomination. Bush opposes some proposed reforms.
But McCain said that discord would not preclude an endorsement of Bush, the

Sandy Thurman, director of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, said
AIDS has become such an epidemic that, in years to come, it threatens to

<HEADLINE> Four from NJ injured in Va. plane crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASSAWADOX, Va. (AP) -- A single-engine plane slammed into a
wheat field on the Eastern Shore, injuring the four people from New
Jersey aboard, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   The four were in serious but stable condition at Sentara Norfolk
General Hospital, spokeswoman Vicky Gray said today. Their
identities haven't been released, but state police said they were
from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Beechcraft four-seater reported engine problems to the
control tower at Norfolk International Airport moments before
disappearing from radar Sunday, said state police spokeswoman Tammy

</P>
<P>
   The plane went down about 4:40 p.m., several hundred yards from
a ball field in this Northampton County town, according to local
fire department chief Jim Lecato.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dame said the plane was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The four people aboard were initially taken to Shore Memorial
Hospital in Belle Haven but subsequently were moved to Norfolk.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner Drops ABC Affiliates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For many ABC fans, it wasn't a good morning
America today.
</P>
<P>
   A quarrel over transmission rights between Time Warner Inc. and
The Walt Disney Co. left 11 Disney-owned ABC stations off of local
cable systems. The only way for cable customers to see ABC programs
would be to rig their TVs to get ABC the old-fashioned way, through
an antenna.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 3.5 million homes nationwide were affected in seven
key markets, according to Michael Luftman, spokesman for Time
Warner. Cable customers were without ABC programming in New York
City; Los Angeles; Houston; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and
small parts of Time Warner systems in Fresno, Calif., and
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes in the midst of May sweeps, the period when
ratings are used to set local advertising rates. Sweeps began
Thursday and last until May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disney has taken ABC away from you,'' read a Time Warner
message on WABC-TV, ABC's affiliate in New York City. ''We offered
a proposal that would have kept ABC for our customers. Disney said
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney officials did not return calls Sunday or early today.
</P>
<P>
   Disney-ABC offered five deadline extensions after the original
national transmission deal expired Dec. 31, 1999. The most recent
deadline, offered in March, gave Disney the authority to withhold
its programming from Time Warner cable systems if no deal was
reached by 12:01 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has asked that Time Warner cable systems not only feature
its new channels -- Toon Disney and a soap opera channel -- but also
make the Disney Channel part of the basic service packages. Time
Warner has agreed to Disney's demands but has balked at the amount
of money it says Disney is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disney is trying to inappropriately use its ownership of ABC
television stations to extract excessive and unreasonable terms for
its cable TV channels -- terms that would add hundreds of millions
of dollars in costs for Time Warner Cable and its customers,'' said
Fred Dressler, senior vice president for programming for Time
Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and other over-the-air networks have had the right to demand
compensation from cable providers in exchange for their programming
since Congress passed 1992's Cable TV Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, ABC is set to air four celebrity editions
of ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire'', the conclusion of its
miniseries ''Arabian Nights,'' the Daytime Emmys, the Kentucky
Derby and virtually all of its prime time season finales.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are shocked and dismayed that Time-Warner would do this to
their own customers,'' said Henry Florsheim, president and general
manager of ABC-affiliate KTRK-TV in Houston. ''This is punishing
their own customers.''

<P>
   Disney-ABC offered five deadline extensions after the original
national transmission deal expired Dec. 31, 1999. The most recent
deadline, offered in March, gave Disney the authority to withhold
its programming from Time Warner cable systems if no deal was
reached by 12:01 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has asked that Time Warner cable systems not only feature
its new channels -- Toon Disney and a soap opera channel -- but also
make the Disney Channel part of the basic service packages. Time
Warner has agreed to Disney's demands but has balked at the amount
of money it says Disney is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disney is trying to inappropriately use its ownership of ABC
television stations to extract excessive and unreasonable terms for
its cable TV channels -- terms that would add hundreds of millions
of dollars in costs for Time Warner Cable and its customers,'' said
Fred Dressler, senior vice president for programming for Time
Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and other over-the-air networks have had the right to demand
compensation from cable providers in exchange for their programming
since Congress passed 1992's Cable TV Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, ABC is set to air four celebrity editions
of ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire'', the conclusion of its
miniseries ''Arabian Nights,'' the Daytime Emmys, the Kentucky
Derby and virtually all of its prime time season finales.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are shocked and dismayed that Time-Warner would do this to
their own customers,'' said Henry Florsheim, president and general
manager of ABC-affiliate KTRK-TV in Houston. ''This is punishing
their own customers.''

<HEADLINE> ING Buying ReliaStar for $5.1B  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- ReliaStar Financial Corp., the eighth largest
publicly-held life insurance company in the United States, is being
sold to Dutch financial giant ING Group NV for about $5.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ING will also assume $1 billion in ReliaStar debt under terms of
the deal announced today.
</P>
<P>
   ING has been looking for a U.S. life insurer for two years. It
already owns Equitable of Iowa and the U.S. investment firm Furman
Selz. With the addition of ReliaStar, it will have completed a
major part of its international strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ReliaStar, which had revenues of $3.04 billion in 1999, had been
mentioned as a potential takeover target by several possible
suitors, including General Motors Corp. and Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The company's subsidiaries offer life insurance and annuities,
employee benefits products and services, retirement plans, life and
health reinsurance, mutual funds, and bank and trust products. It
has $38.4 billion in assets under management.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction values ReliaStar at $54 a share. The U.S.
company's stock rallied 43 percent Friday to $43 a share on the New
York Stock Exchange on rumors that talks were being held with ING.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is expected to close late in the third quarter
of this year, subject to regulatory and ReliaStar shareholder
approval. The companies expect to be fully integrated by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ReliaStar will continue its operations as part of ING Americas
and retain current management. ReliaStar's chairman and CEO John
Turner will become a member of the executive committee ING Americas
and become vice chairman of the Americas region.
</P>
<P>
   Based on revenue from insurance premiums, the Amsterdam-based
ING currently ranks 19th in the U.S. life insurance market.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, ING acquired Equitable of Iowa for $2.2 billion. One
month later it purchased the investment bank Furman Selz for $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   ING expects to cut annual costs by up to $65 million by 2005 if
the ReliaStar deal goes through as planned.
</P>
<P>
   According to ING, combined revenues from insurance premiums in
1999 would have been $12.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Minneapolis, ReliaStar employs 3,800, while ING has
about 90,000 staffers.

   Time Warner Drops 11 ABC Stations
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A quarrel over transmission rights between Time
Warner Inc. and The Walt Disney Co. left 11 Disney-owned ABC
stations off of local cable systems. The only way for cable
customers to see ABC programs would be to rig their TVs to get ABC
the old-fashioned way, through an antenna. A total of 3.5 million
homes nationwide were affected in seven key markets, according to
Michael Luftman, spokesman for Time Warner. Cable customers were
without ABC programming in New York City; Los Angeles; Houston;
Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and small parts of Time Warner
systems in Fresno, Calif., and Philadelphia. The move comes in the
midst of May sweeps, the period when ratings are used to set local
advertising rates.

   Actors Set For Rallies Over Contract

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The first major Hollywood strike since
writers walked out in 1988 was set to begin today with union actors
planning rallies in Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco and
Chicago. The actors said they refuse to perform in radio and
television commercials until they get a larger chunk of the booming
cable TV business. In Los Angeles, actors planned to march to the
Wilshire Boulevard offices of several ad agencies, Screen Actors
Guild spokesman Greg Krizman said. SAG and the American Federation
of Television &AMP; Radio Artists, representing about 135,000 actors,
authorized the walkout last month.

   Newspaper Competition Trial To Begin

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The future of newspaper competition in San
Francisco will be shaped in federal court this week as the Hearst
Corp. defends its purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle and the
subsidized transfer of the San Francisco Examiner to a local
publisher. A lawsuit by Clint Reilly, a former mayoral candidate
and unsuccessful bidder for the Examiner, contends the Chronicle
purchase was rigged and that the Examiner's transfer is a sham,
designed to give Hearst a local newspaper monopoly after more than
a century of competition. The trial begins today and is scheduled

   6 of Top 10 CEOs Head Computer Firms

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Six of the nation's 10 highest paid chief
executives work for high-tech firms, according to Forbes magazine.
The magazine, in a report released yesterday, ranked executives
running the nation's top 800 companies by their total compensation
packages for 1999, including salary, bonuses and stock gains. No. 1
on the list was Charles B. Wang, head of Computer Associates
International Inc. of Islandia, N.Y., with a 1999 compensation
package totaling $650.1 million, Forbes said. He had ranked 39th in
1998. Two other newcomers to the top 10 -- who weren't even listed
last year -- were Bobby R. Johnson Jr., chief executive of Foundry
Networks Inc. in San Jose, Calif., and Stephen M. Case, head of
America Online Inc. in Dulles, Va. Johnson's compensation totaled
$230.5 million, giving him the No. 2 ranking, while Case collected
$117.1 million to land in the No. 6 spot.

<HEADLINE> Report: Secret files protect dangerous doctors  </HEADLINE>
sdhfcdtfonrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A little-known government database
tracking malpractice suits and disciplinary action against
physicians remains unavailable to the general public, and at least
one congressman says dangerous doctors have hidden behind that
shield of secrecy long enough.
</P>
<P>
   But standing in his way is the American Medical Association and
a powerful medical lobby, The Hartford Courant reported in weekend
editions.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, using a public version of the database which does
not have names or other identifying information, nevertheless
deduced the names of several doctors who have repeatedly faced
malpractice charges but continue to practice. One such surgeon was
nicknamed ''Eric the Red'' because of the way his patients bled.
</P>
<P>
   The Courant said it identified the doctors by comparing the
anonymous data in the database with court records, regulatory files
and other public records.
</P>
<P>
   In today's editions, the newspaper said Connecticut ranks last
in the nation in the number of incidents reported to the database
per thousand doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner, a lawyer representing several hospitals in the
state, said the low reporting rate is due to the high quality of
doctors in the state, and its proximity to high-caliber medical
schools such as those of the Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   ''I honestly don't think we get the same kinds of problems other
places get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper highlighted two cases in which doctors stopped
practicing at hospitals but were not reported to the database.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr., R-Va., chairman of the House
Commerce Committee, unsuccessfully championed legislation this year
that would have opened the National Practitioner Data Bank to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is the time to open the data bank,'' Bliley told The
Courant. ''It is unconscionable that consumers have more
comparative information about the used car they purchase or the
snack foods they eat than the doctors in whose care they entrust
their health and well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits anyone other than hospitals, health
maintenance organizations and licensing boards from using the
complete database.
</P>
<P>
   In its Sunday editions, The Courant reported the Fairfax,
Va.-based data bank lists malpractice payments of $25 billion
against more than 100,000 doctors, or one of every six physicians
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of list, the newspaper said, is Dr. Eric Scheffey, a
Houston orthopedic surgeon. The data bank shows Scheffey involved
in 29 malpractice payments totaling $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1985 death of a back surgery patient, Scheffey's
medical license was put on probation, but he was allowed to keep
practicing. The 1994 death of another patient resulted in five more
years' probation from the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners.
He can still practice but cannot perform operations without another
surgeon present.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in a hospital where Scheffey worked gave him the
''Eric the Red'' nickname, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffey could not be reached for comment Sunday. Phone messages
from The Associated Press were left with his answering service,
where an operator said he was unavailable until Monday. Calls to a
private listing went unanswered. He also did not respond to several
attempts by the newspaper to contact him.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA has fought to keep the data bank closed to the public,
arguing that malpractice payments are an unfair measure of a
doctor's abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even some of our nation's finest physicians who specialize
high-risk cases are involved in settlements,'' said AMA President
Thomas Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   He said the data bank was intended to allow only regulators and
hospitals to flag problem doctors who move from state to state, and
the general public could misinterpret or overreact to the raw
information.
</P>
<P>
   But the patients who must live with their doctor's mistakes say
access to the bank is a matter of public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Hachey, a Scottsdale, Ariz., travel agent, said she
was not aware of any complaints against the eye doctor accused of
botching her surgery. Dr. Gary Hall, of Phoenix, had accumulated
more than two dozen malpractice payments totaling $5.3 million
before his state medical board prohibited him from performing a
certain type of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   It came too late for Hachey, who now needs a large magnifying
glass to read.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really makes me angry,'' she told The Courant upon
learning of the data bank. ''I never knew any of this. I can't
believe the system is so secretive. How are you supposed to know
whether your doctor is any good?''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to The Courant, Hall said his insurance company had
settled cases ''without my consent'' and noted he had performed
25,000 radial keratotomy operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Therefore, though the number of entries in the National
Practitioner Data Bank appears high, it still represents a very
small percentage of the total number of cases I performed,'' he
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Patrick Stewart Denounces Producers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Stewart shocked Broadway audiences
during curtain calls of ''The Ride Down Mt. Morgan'' when he
angrily accused producers of the Arthur Miller drama of failing to
promote it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arthur Miller and I no longer have confidence in our
producers' commitment to this production, especially the Shubert
Organization, or their willingness to promote and publicize it,''
Stewart, still in costume, proclaimed Saturday at his matinee and
evening performances. ''Arthur and I feel frustrated and
helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was endorsed by Miller during a New York Times
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the play has dropped through the memory hole,'' Miller
said. ''I haven't talked to management, but Patrick has, since he's
there for every performance. Promises have been made repeatedly
that were never kept.''
</P>
<P>
   Shubert President Philip Smith issued a statement disputing
Stewart's claims but did not detail promotional efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The producers' commitment to 'The Ride Down Mt. Morgan' could
not be stronger,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The show's chief publicist, Michael Hartman, said more money had
been spent on advertising for the play than was spent on two
comparable plays last season, ''The Blue Room,'' which starred
Nicole Kidman, and ''Amy's View,'' which featured Dame Judi Dench.
</P>
<P>
   More publicity would be forthcoming, Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences applauded Stewart's accusations Saturday, prompting
him to say he would restate them at the Sunday matinee. But he did
not, and it was unclear whether Stewart and the producers had
reached a compromise. Shubert representatives did not immediately
return a phone call today seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mt. Morgan'' is the story of a bigamist whose efforts to keep
his two families unaware of each other fail when he's injured in a
car crash and both wives visit him in the hospital. It was produced
in London in 1991 and opened at Broadway's Ambassador Theater on
April 9 for a run scheduled to end July 23.
</P>
<P>
   The show has enjoyed positive reviews and has done well at the
box office, according to the show business journal Variety.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 59, is known for his role in television's ''Star Trek:
The Next Generation.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Insurer Ends Debt Repayment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Daiichi Mutual Fire and Marine Insurance
Co. gave up Monday on efforts to repay its debts, becoming Japan's
first nonlife insurer to fail since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Supervisory Agency, Japan's financial industry
watchdog, forbade Daiichi from taking on new customers, although
the insurer will continue making payments to current clients, FSA
chief Masaharu Hino said.
</P>
<P>
   The FSA and the Marine and Fire Insurance Association of Japan
have assigned administrators to look for a purchaser of the failed
insurer's assets.
</P>
<P>
   They will also investigate alleged falsification of financial
reports at the company. Earlier this month, Japan's Financial
Supervisory Agency found that Daiichi had concealed that it was
insolvent at the end of March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The administrators will decide whether to file a criminal suit
against Daiichi executives, said Noboru Araki, executive director
of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association.
</P>
<P>
   Daiichi's failure comes amid rapid change in Japan's financial
sector, which the government is trying to liberalize and make more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Koichi Hirai, president of the Tokyo-based firm, said he and
other top managerial officials are ready to take ''any criticism''
for the company's failure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't know what excuse to make,'' Hirai said at a
televised news conference.
</P>
<P>
   After the FSA found the inconsistencies in Daiichi's financial
reports the regulator told Daiichi to boost its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Under that order, Daiichi sought fresh capital injections from
Japanese and foreign companies, but failed to attract funds quickly
enough, Daiichi said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the company's decision to give up restructuring, the
FSA ordered Daiichi to suspend part of its operations, including
the issuance of new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Daiichi was set up in 1949 and became Japan's eighth-largest
nonlife insurer with assets totaling $13.08 billion, according to
the Nihon Keizai business daily.
</P>
<P>
   A recent decline in returns on investment and an increase in bad
loans left it with debts that exceeded assets by $451 million at
the end of March, 1999.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Reports April Trade Surplus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's trade surplus shrank to
$220 million in April, down sharply from $2.4 billion a year ago,
the Trade Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It pushed the country's cumulative trade surplus during the
first four months of the year to $773 million, down from $7 billion
in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   In April, exports rose by 18.6 percent to $13.64 billion, while
imports surged by 47.4 percent to $13.42 billion, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government blamed the lackluster performance on labor
strikes by autoworkers and a disease outbreak in early April that
blocked exports of pork and other meat.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's car workers staged a one-week joint strike in
early April, opposing the planned sale of ailing Daewoo Motor Co.
to a foreign investor.
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to the reduced trade surplus were rising
demand for raw materials and capital goods and high oil prices, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   With crude oil prices stabilizing, South Korea expects that its
trade balance will improve considerably in May.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea spent $2 billion on oil imports in April.

<HEADLINE> Putin Increases Russian Pensions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a small May
Day present on Monday to hard-pressed retirees by raising the
average monthly pension about 42 percent to $25, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin promised to raise pensions in the recent presidential
campaign, appropriating one of the issues of his Communist opponent
Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Government pensions, which had been around $17.50, had been set
to rise to the equivalent of $25 by the end of the year, but Putin
ordered the increase to take effect now, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency. The order envisions raising average pensions further,
to $35, in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many retirees, including World War II veterans, get small
supplements worth between $3.5 and $7.
</P>
<P>
   Higher oil prices have helped the government budget in Russia, a
major oil exporter, allowing it to increase pensions and pay off
pension and wage debts.
</P>
<P>
   State pensions are the only income for nearly all elderly
Russians, and the pensions are below the official poverty line.

<HEADLINE> Court To Study Search Procedures  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to clarify
whether police can keep people from going inside their homes alone
while officers seek a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear Illinois prosecutors' argument that
they should be allowed to use as evidence the marijuana seized from
a man's home. Illinois courts said police violated the
constitutional ban on unreasonable searches and seizures by
temporarily keeping him outside.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 episode, two Sullivan, Ill., police officers
accompanied Tera McArthur to retrieve her belongings from the
trailer home she shared with her husband, Charles McArthur. When
she came outside, she told police he had marijuana under the couch.
</P>
<P>
   An officer knocked on the door, and McArthur came outside,
denied he had drugs and told police they could not search without a
warrant. During the two hours it took to get a warrant, police did
not let McArthur re-enter his home unless an officer accompanied
him and stood inside the door.
</P>
<P>
   Police then conducted a search and found marijuana and drug
paraphernalia. McArthur was charged with possessing less than 2.5
grams of marijuana and possessing drug paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   McArthur conceded that if he had been allowed to go inside his
home alone he would have destroyed the marijuana. But he asked a
state trial judge to bar use of the marijuana as evidence,
contending the officer violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The
trial judge ruled for him, and an Illinois appeals court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The officers essentially evicted McArthur from his home, the
appeals court said, adding that no special circumstances justified
the officer's entering the trailer with McArthur.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court noted that other courts have let police keep
someone outside when the person was under arrest, subject to arrest
on arrival, or when the person consented to stay outside.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, prosecutors said the government
had an interest in keeping McArthur from destroying evidence, and
that the appeals court ruling would make it virtually impossible
for police to secure homes in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Illinois vs. McArthur, 99-1132.

<HEADLINE> Mayor's latest health report is positive, spokesman says  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani won't make a final
decision on his cancer treatment course or his campaign until the
middle of May, but his supporters are predicting that he will stay
in the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   If he does, he'll find another rival. Former Rep. Joseph J.
DioGuardi said Sunday that he is seeking the nominations of the
Conservative, Right-to-Life and Independence parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have two social liberals in the race,'' DioGuardi told The
New York Times. ''There's a clear need for a conservative
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not return a telephone call this morning.
</P>
<P>
   A DioGuardi campaign seems likely to hurt the mayor by siphoning
off votes from right-wing Republicans; no Republican candidate has
won a statewide race without Conservative Party support since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   State Conservative Party chairman Michael Long, reached by phone
today, said DioGuardi ''knows they're long odds'' but added, ''I do
not believe it's impossible for him to win outright. ... He's a
former congressman. He is certainly no lightweight. He's a scrappy
fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi, 59, an accountant from Ossining in Westchester
County, was a two-term incumbent who narrowly lost his seat in 1988
to Democrat Nita Lowey. He challenged Lowey again in 1992, but lost
that race as well. In 1994, DioGuardi entered a Republican primary
for a neighboring congressional district, but lost that to Sue
Kelly. He then ran against Kelly in the general election on the
Conservative and Right to Life lines, but Kelly won the race as the
GOP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College Poll released this morning concluded that
Giuliani's medical condition has not so far influenced voter
preference in the Senate race. Half the 952 voters surveyed were
contacted after Giuliani's announcement Thursday, and Quinnipiac
polling director Maurice Carroll said there was no noticeable shift
among them. The poll showed the race remains neck and neck, with
Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton leading Giuliani 46-44. Given the
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, the
candidates are in a statistical tie, which is consistent with other
recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain,
of Arizona, told ABC's ''This Week'' on Sunday that he is confident
the mayor will continue campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The odds are overwhelming that he'll be fine and that he will
be very active, and I believe he'll win,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Senate campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, told ''Fox
News Sunday,'' ''It's not only my hope, but my expectation, that he
will run. Hopefully, he'll pick a course of treatment that will
give him a cure, a complete cure, and then we'll be able to move
forth aggressively, with a winning campaign. That's our hope, and I
know the mayor shares my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has offered to campaign for Giuliani while the mayor
keeps his medical appointments.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he's sure Giuliani, who was playing golf Sunday
with his son, will be campaigning again soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very confident he'll be on the trail soon and he'll win
and he won't need any of us,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post released a poll Sunday that identified Gov.
George Pataki as the ''best choice'' among Republicans to take on
Clinton if Giuliani should drop out of the Senate race. The poll
showed Clinton and Pataki in a statistical tie if Giuliani were to
exit the race, with U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, who put his Senate
campaign on hold to make way for Giuliani, a distant second in a
matchup with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Giuliani were also tied for support in a
head-to-head race.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby International poll surveyed 601 likely voters
statewide. It has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum noted that tests show the mayor's prostate cancer has
not spread, but he said it will take the mayor 10 days to two weeks
before he decides on a course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   That will take up important campaign and fund-raising time
before the state Republican convention in Buffalo on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stayed away from any reference to the mayor in a speech
Sunday to a Catholic organization of union electricians.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts have predicted that the first lady will
tone down her rhetoric against the mayor because it would be
unseemly to attack him now that he has cancer.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Change Terrorism List  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to disturb the
State Department's designation of an Iranian dissident group as a
terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that the
People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran has enough U.S. ties to
qualify for constitutional protection of its due-process rights.
</P>
<P>
   Formed during the 1960s, the dissident group seeks the overthrow
of the current Iranian government. It says it has a volunteer army
''to defend Iranian citizens against domestic political suppression
and acts of terrorism by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says the group participated in the 1979
takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and was responsible for
killing several U.S. citizens before the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Justice Department lawyers
said, the group has coordinated attacks on Iranian embassies and
consulates around the world, and its members killed a Turkish
diplomat in Iraq in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 federal Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
authorizes the secretary of state to designate as terrorist
organizations any foreign group engaging in terrorist activity that
threatens U.S. national security or the security of U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires U.S. banks to freeze the assets of such
organizations, and it is a crime for Americans to provide aid to
them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright designated the
People's Mojahedin group as a foreign terrorist organization. The
group went to federal court, but the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia upheld the designation, saying the
group could not assert constitutional rights because it lacked
''property or presence'' in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, the dissident group's lawyers said
the appeals court had been too deferential to the State
Department's decision. The group has a press office any many other
activities in this country, its lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said courts are supposed to be
''highly deferential'' to government decisions on foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The case is People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran vs.
Department of State, 99-1070.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Settle Tax Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to resolve a
split among the nation's federal appeals courts over how to
calculate taxes owed by shareholders of insolvent small businesses
classified as ''S corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   The court will use a Colorado case to decide how federal tax
collectors must view forgiven debts of S corporations, created
under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code as pass-through
entities that offer favorable tax treatment for owners of closely
held businesses.
</P>
<P>
   David Gitlitz and Philip Winn each owned a 50 percent interest
in PDW &AMP; A Inc., a Colorado-based S corporation that belonged to a
real estate partnership.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the partnership had a $4.1 million debt forgiven. PDW &AMP;
A's share was just over $2 million. But because the S corporation
was insolvent at the time, it incurred no tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   Gitlitz and Winn, in submitting tax returns for the relevant
years, sought to claim their share of the forgiven debt as income
to increase their basis in PDW &AMP; A stock. An increased basis raises
the number of deductions a shareholder-taxpayer can claim for prior
losses.
</P>
<P>
   After an Internal Revenue Service audit, the agency's
commissioner disallowed those deductions claimed in the amounts
equal to the two men's allocable share of the forgiven debt.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS said Gitlitz owed $251,192 in additional taxes, and Winn
$242,555.
</P>
<P>
   They challenged the tax agency's determination, but lost in the
U.S. Tax Court and the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruled that allowing shareholders in insolvent
S corporations to avoid tax liability for forgiven debts by not
treating such amounts as income means the forgiven debts cannot be
counted toward increasing a shareholder's basis in the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   To do otherwise, the appeals court said, would be to give
taxpayers an inappropriate double benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Gitlitz and Winn said
the appeals court ruling ''is contrary to the plain language of the
statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers told the justices that the 10th Circuit court
ruled correctly, but said the appeal should be granted because the
Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a
ruling that favors taxpayers in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of cases raising the same tax issue are pending in lower
courts, the justices were told.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Gitlitz vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
99-1295.

<HEADLINE> Man May Lose Transplanted Hand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERTH, Australia (AP) -- Doctors were treating a New Zealand man
Monday who was in danger of losing a hand grafted onto his arm 18
months ago in the world's first hand transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Hallam, 49, was being given drugs to combat rejection of
the hand transplant, Peter Cogan, a spokesman at Perth's Sir
Charles Gairdner Hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam made international headlines in September 1998 when a
team of surgeons in Lyon, France, grafted the hand of a 41-year-old
motorcyclist on to his forearm in a 13-hour operation.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard, co-head of the transplant
team, told RTL and France-Info radio that Hallam had suffered
similar rejection problems before but that they had been
successfully treated.
</P>
<P>
   Dubernard said he was awaiting more information to decide
whether the rejection was reversible.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the worst case scenario ... if the arm is rejected or
becomes useless, it must be amputated, which would put him in
exactly the same state he was in before the surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallam was serving a two-year sentence for fraud in New Zealand
when he lost his hand in a chain saw accident in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said he hoped one day to learn to play the piano
and told the Sunday Times newspaper he already was performing
simple tasks with the hand such as holding a cup of coffee and
swimming.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Internet Providers  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling
that says Internet service providers are not legally and
financially liable when someone is defamed in e-mail communications
or bulletin board messages.
</P>
<P>
   The court, acting without comment, rejected an appeal stemming
from several vulgar messages an impostor posted six years ago in
the name of Alexander Lunney, then 15.
</P>
<P>
   Lunney, a Bronxville, N.Y., high school student at the time,
sued Prodigy Services Co. after the impostor opened Internet
accounts under his name and sent a threatening, profane e-mail
message to someone who notified police.
</P>
<P>
   During the police investigation, Prodigy sent Lunney a letter
saying it was terminating one of the accounts ''due to the
transmission of obscene, abusive, threatening and sexually explicit
material.'' The real Alexander Lunney, whose innocence in the
episode was quickly established, never was a Prodigy customer.
</P>
<P>
   He sued the service provider, which later found other accounts
the impostor had opened in Lunney's name. On one of those accounts,
vulgar bulletin board messages had been posted by the impostor.
</P>
<P>
   Three New York state courts ruled that Lunney's lawsuit against
Prodigy must fail.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest tribunal,
said the service provider was not legally culpable for either the
objectionable e-mail or the bulletin board message.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prodigy was not a publisher of the e-mail transmitted through
its system by a third party,'' the state court ruled unanimously.
''We are unwilling to deny Prodigy the common-law qualified
privilege accorded to telephone and telegraph companies.''
</P>
<P>
   It added: ''The public would not be well served by compelling an
(internet service provider) to examine and screen millions of
e-mail communications, on pain of liability for defamation.''
</P>
<P>
   The state court also said Prodigy could not be treated as
publisher of the electronic bulletin board message.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Lunney called the case
''the most egregious of a series of Internet related liability
cases that have developed an enlarging rule of law that totally
immunizes non-carrier, proprietary online services from virtually
any ... liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy Services Co., originally a joint venture of Sears and
IBM, was succeeded by Prodigy Services Corp. and was merged into
Prodigy Communications Corp. in 1998. PCC stock has been publicly
traded since early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Lunney vs. Prodigy Services Co., 99-1430.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A modest advance by technology stocks led the
broad market higher at the start of trading today. Microsoft rose
in the first session since the Justice Department asked a federal
court to split the company in two to satisfy antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 15.20 at 10,749.11.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 65.40 at 3,926.06, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 7.46 at 1,459.89.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 2 31/64 to 72 15/64. Late Friday afternoon, the
Justice Department and 17 states delivered their propsed remedy for
Microsoft's antitrust violations: splitting the company into one
business for Microsoft's Windows operating-system software, and one
for Microsoft's Office and other applications products, plus
Microsoft's Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was widely expected, and many investors decided
that the possibility of a breakup had already taken its toll on
Microsoft stock. Before today's session, Microsoft's share price
had declined by about 40 percent since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies that compete with Microsoft were mostly
higher. Red Hat, which sells the Linux operating system, was up 3
3/8 to 28 7/16. VA Linux rose 5 3/8 to 47.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, a leading maker of computer servers and
workstations, rose 11/16 to 92 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 111.62 million
shares, behind Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.32 to 510.57.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.4 percent. In

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Grows at Slower Pace  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN ALT POWELL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- America's industrial sector grew for the 15th
consecutive month in April, though at a slower pace than in March,
while prices for raw materials didn't rise as fast as in earlier
months, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported
today.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers' group said that its manufacturing
index, based on a national survey of executives who buy raw
materials and other supplies for industries, registered 54.9
percent in April, slightly weaker than the 55.8 percent reported
for March and the lowest since a 54.4 percent reading last August.
April's number was below the 55.5 percent that Wall Street analysts
had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Any reading above 50 indicates growth, however.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers' index is watched closely because it is
the first national reading for April on the U.S. industrial
performance, a key sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall picture is one of continuing growth in
manufacturing activity during the month of April,'' Norbert J. Ore,
chairman of the association's survey committee, said in a statement
accompanying the report.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that the index ''trend for the last six
months indicates deceleration in the rate of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ore noted that price increases for raw materials continued, but
at a slower rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It also appears that the recent decline in energy prices has
not found its way through the manufacturing sector this month,''
Ore added. ''This should give hope to further declines in the
prices index in the near term.''
</P>
<P>
   The index of prices paid by manufacturers was 76 percent in
April, down from 79.8 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Camilli, director of economic research for the Tucker
Anthony investment firm in New York, said the report showed ''a
strong level of economic activity with some hints of building
inflationary pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported last week that the U.S. economy
grew at a sturdy annual rate of 5.4 percent in the first quarter,
down from a roaring 7.3 percent annual rate the in fourth quarter
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Camilli, who expects to see a 4 percent annual growth rate in
the April-June quarter, said the latest reports indicate that ''the
economy is growing at an overly robust pace.''
</P>
<P>
   This could spur Federal Reserve policy makers to raise interest
rates further to slow growth and head off inflation. The Fed has
raised rates a quarter of a point six times since last June.
Camilli expects an increase of a half a percentage point when the
Fed meets May 16.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers' report said that 16 of 20 industries
reported improved business in April.
</P>
<P>
   The survey indicated that 17 industries were paying higher
prices. The price index has been above 50 percent for 12
consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
   The report also indicated that manufacturing inventories are
still being liquidated, with the inventory index registering 45.2
percent in April, down from 48.4 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   The index of new orders showed continuing growth at 56.3 percent
in April, but it was down slightly from 56.9 percent the month
before.

   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai Customs have seized a record 1,078
pounds of raw ivory at Bangkok airport, but let the man who came to
collect the smuggled goods go free, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 112 pieces of elephant tusks worth more than $131,000 were
found Friday in three iron boxes freighted from Zambia. The ivory
was concealed under a thick layer of uncut gemstones.
</P>
<P>
   Documents with the shipment said the boxes contained 1,188
pounds of gemstones. The size of the consignment aroused officers'
suspicions, Rapee Asumpinpong, deputy director general of Thai
Customs told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Tailo, a citizen of the West African country of Guinea,
was arrested when he showed up at the airport's cargo terminal to
claim the goods, but was later released when he agreed to sign over
all the tusks to the Thai government.
</P>
<P>
   Rapee said that under Thai law, the owner of illegal imported
goods is freed if he gives all the goods to the government. That
applies unless there is other legislation specifying harsher
penalties, such as in the case of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It was not yet decided what the government would do with the
ivory. But Rapee said that since Thailand is a member of
international conventions forbidding trade in endangered wildlife
and animal parts, it would not sell the tusks.
</P>
<P>
   The ivory would either be destroyed or handed to a government
department that could put them on display or otherwise to good use,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Jewish Spy Suspect Confesses  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) -- A senior judicial official said one of 13
Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel confessed today in a
trial that has strained relations with the West -- just as
reformists are coming under pressure from conservative clerics to
stick to the principles of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Hossein Ali Amiri, regional head of a judiciary which is
dominated by hardline clerics, said that Dani Tefilin had confessed
to delivering ''sensitive information'' to Mossad, Israel's main
external intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   Tefilin also admitted to receiving training and a salary from
Mossad, Amiri said. ''His case is finished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tefilin's lawyer could not be immediately reached for comment
today. When the trial opened April 13, state-run television
reported Tefilin and three other defendants had confessed and
defense lawyers denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Amiri said Tefilin had asked the court for clemency. He did not
know when a verdict was expected. Tefilin was the first of the
suspects to be arrested more than a year ago and his brother also
is among those charged.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has dismissed the charges against the 13 suspects as
baseless, and several nations as well as the United Nations and
rights groups have either condemned the arrests or called on Iran
to ensure proceedings are fair. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has said the case was ''of strong concern'' to her.
</P>
<P>
   The trial comes amid a power struggle between Islamic
hard-liners and President Mohammad Khatami's reformist wing. The
conservatives have opposed the reformers' approaches to the West,
including the United States, and have launched a crackdown against
their attempts at political and social change. The judiciary has
closed 16 pro-democracy newspapers and arrested six reformist
activists in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that those who stand trial in Iran, probably only
because they are Jewish, will be released without any delay,''
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Aviv Sharon said in response to
today's reported confession.
</P>
<P>
   Amiri said that the trial of all 13 should be over within weeks.
The next session was scheduled Wednesday. The Jews are being tried
in a non-jury revolutionary court where the judge also serves as
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants' families, members of Iran's Jewish community,
Western diplomats and foreign journalists milled outside the
courthouse in Shiraz, 550 miles south of the capital, Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the defendants, Navid Balazadeh and Omid Tefilin, who
have been out on bail since February, also stood outside as they
waited to be called in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The charges of espionage against me are completely false,''
said Balazadeh. ''We have been treated well, and I trust the judge
to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Elahe Sharifpour-Hicks, a New York-based representative of Human
Rights Watch, said she had asked Judge Sadeq Nourani earlier today
to allow an international observer or a member of the Jewish
community to attend the trial. He refused for ''reasons of national
security,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials initially said the suspects were accused of
spying for the United States and Israel, charges both countries say
are baseless. But when the trial opened, the judge said they were
only charged with spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians convicted of spying usually receive long prison terms,
but they can be executed if they are found to have ''endangered
national security.'' Two Jews were executed at Tehran's Evin prison
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Iran maintains religion has no bearing on the case and notes
that eight Muslims also have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Haroun Yashayaii, head of Iran's Jewish Society, said the
foreign media ''have magnified the trial,'' saying the suspects
weren't arrested because of religion and no actions were taken
against their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trial needs no follow-up or international sympathy,''
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Yashayaii as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian Jews numbered 80,000 before the 1979 Islamic revolution;
25,000 remain today. Jews in Iran are generally allowed to practice
their religion freely, but they cannot travel to or have any
contact with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Tensions Flare at May Day Rallies  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Far-right demonstrators rallied against immigrants
and radical leftists clashed with police in Europe and Asia today,
overshadowing international labor's traditional May Day
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, a nationalist fringe party staged rallies in several
cities, the largest one in Berlin. There, about 900 far-right
youths with signs demanding ''work for Germans first'' listened to
speakers demanding the expulsion of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 leftists blowing whistles and chanting ''Nazis out!''
gathered near the rally. The groups were kept apart by 1,500 police
officers. Police spokesman Michael Kokert said 140 leftists were
arrested or detained citywide.
</P>
<P>
   In Hamburg, Germany, several hundred anarchists rioted
overnight, breaking windows and setting bonfires. Police used water
cannons and armored vehicles to clear the crowd. Sixteen officers
were injured and 123 people arrested or taken into temporary
custody.
</P>
<P>
   In London, May Day anti-capitalist demonstrations began today
with peaceful ''Guerrilla Gardening'' in Parliament Square, but the
day turned violent when a group of masked activists trashed a
McDonald's restaurant and attacked police.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of police had been deployed around London, determined
to prevent a replay of last spring's city riots, which caused
millions of dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
   At Parliament Square, banners and a Maypole went up, and some
demonstrators strolled around elaborately costumed as rabbits,
dragons and woodland creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Although most demonstrators remained quietly in front of
Parliament planting seeds in the square, a breakaway group moved
away toward the government offices at Whitehall. When they reached
a nearby McDonald's branch, they broke all the windows, tore down
the golden arches sign and distributed the prepared food.
</P>
<P>
   One officer was badly injured when hit in the face with a brick,
said police Assistant Commissioner Mike Todd. He called the
attackers ''mindless thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Jean-Marie Le Pen's far-right National Front party
made its traditional May Day march, and the rival far-right party
called a separate demonstration, parading in automobiles through
the capital to protest a proposal to give foreigners the right to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Across the former Soviet Union, the celebration of international
workers' solidarity was a pale echo of decades past, when huge
government-organized parades snaked past Kremlin leaders atop
Lenin's tomb on Red Square. Russians grow much of their own food,
and many used the holiday this year to plant seedlings at their
suburban cottages.
</P>
<P>
   China marked May Day with few political activities beyond praise
for 3,000 model workers. Most Chinese had the day off and headed
for parks or visited friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But violence flared in Manila, the Philippines' capital. Police
used water cannons to disperse hundreds of leftists who threw rocks
and tried to break through police lines in the direction of the
presidential palace. Several protesters and a firefighter were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist labor groups claim President Joseph Estrada has followed
pro-business policies despite campaign promises to side with labor
in the fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, about 300 militant students clashed with riot
police trying to prevent them from joining a rally by workers in
downtown Seoul. Witnesses said the students scuffled with riot
police, hurling rocks and wielding sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was more placid in Japan, where the rallies are usually
more like picnics than protests, but the country's near-record
unemployment added a sense of urgency. Unemployment in Japan rose
to a record high of 4.9 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are determined to make the greatest effort to achieve
stable employment,'' Etsuya Washio, chairman of the Japan Trade
Union Confederation, told a crowd in a downtown Tokyo park. An
estimated 1.7 million people attended more than a thousand rallies
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, there was a massive turnout for May Day celebrations
designed to add fuel to a national campaign to return 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez to his homeland from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, hundreds of thousands of people crowded the Plaza of
Revolution for the first speech by President Fidel Castro at a May
Day celebration in many years. During May 1 gatherings in recent
decades, Castro has presided over massive marches of workers but
has left the podium to labor leaders and other top officials.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 104; Dow Up 52  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose for a third straight
session today, leading the broad market to a moderate advance.
Microsoft rose in the first session since the Justice Department
asked a federal court to split the company in two to satisfy
antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In morning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
up 52.74 at 10,786.65.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 104.22 at 3,964.88, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 14.30 at 1,466.73.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 2 15/16 to 72 11/16. Late Friday afternoon, the
Justice Department and 17 states delivered their propsed remedy for
Microsoft's antitrust violations: splitting the company into one
business for Microsoft's Windows operating-system software, and one
for Microsoft's Office and other applications products, plus
Microsoft's Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was widely expected, and many investors decided
that the possibility of a breakup had already taken its toll on
Microsoft stock. Before today's session, Microsoft's share price
had declined by about 40 percent since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether split up, or not, the sum of the parts are worth
around $125 to 135 a share,'' said Michael E. Stanek, a Microsoft
analyst with Lehman Brothers. ''Therefore, investor objections of
not owning the stock based on 'break-up' fears are no longer rooted
in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies that compete with Microsoft were mostly
higher. Red Hat, which sells the Linux operating system, was up 3
3/4 to 28 13/16. VA Linux rose 5 3/8 to 47.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, a leading maker of computer servers and
workstations, rose 27/64 to 92 23/64.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some modest support for the stock market came from the
National Association of Purchasing Management, which said America's
industrial sector grew for the 15th consecutive month in April. The
group said the economy's growth came at a slower pace than in
March, while prices for raw materials didn't rise as fast as in
earlier months.
</P>
<P>
   That offered some relief to inflation-wary traders. Most market
watchers expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the
sixth time in a year when it holds its next meeting on May 16. The
indication of modest growth raised hopes that only a modest,
quarter-point increase is in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 273.68 million
shares, behind Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 9.79 to 516.04.

<HEADLINE> Court: No Retroactive Convictions  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, reinvigorating language it
used in a ruling 202 years ago, today threw out some of a Texas
man's convictions for sexually assaulting his stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, ruled that four of Scott Carmell's
15 convictions wrongly were based on a Texas law enacted after he
allegedly committed the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was an aspect of the Constitution's ban on laws that
criminalize acts, or alter the evidence needed for a conviction,
after the crime occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Carmell was convicted in a Denton County court in 1997 on 15
counts of indecency with a child, sexual assault and aggravated
sexual assault. Prosecutors said he engaged in various sex acts,
including intercourse, with his stepdaughter over a four-year
period, beginning in 1991 when she was 12 and a sixth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to life in prison on two convictions of
aggravated sexual assault that were not at issue in today's case.
He was sentenced to 20 years in prison on the other charges.
</P>
<P>
   The four convictions in question today involved alleged assaults
that took place at a time when Texas law said that a suspect could
not be convicted merely on the testimony of the victim, unless she
was under 14. At the time the girl was aged 14 or 15.
</P>
<P>
   That law was later changed and Carmell was convicted under the
new law, an action the court ruled to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases today the court:
</P>
<P>
   -- Agreed to clarify whether police can keep people from going
inside their homes alone while officers seek a search warrant. The
court said it will hear Illinois prosecutors' argument that they
should be allowed to use as evidence the marijuana seized from a
man's home. Illinois courts said police violated the constitutional
ban on unreasonable searches and seizures by temporarily keeping
him outside, even though he admitted that it allowed to return he
would have destroyed the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   --Ruled 6-3 that public employees who agree to take extra time
off instead of collecting overtime pay can be forced to use the
time off at their employer's convenience. The justices said
governmental employers have the authority to control when such
time-off credits are used if no pre-existing labor agreement says
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   --Left intact a ruling that says Internet service providers are
not legally and financially liable when someone is defamed in
e-mail communications or bulletin board messages.
</P>
<P>
   --Refused to disturb the State Department's designation of an
Iranian dissident group as a terrorist organization. The justices
turned away arguments that the People's Mojahedin Organization of
Iran has enough U.S. ties to qualify for constitutional protection
of its due-process rights.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, before 1993, no one could be convicted of a
sexual offense based solely on an alleged victim's testimony unless
they told a third party within six months of the alleged incident.
However, an exception was made for alleged victims under 14.
</P>
<P>
   The law was changed in 1993 to extend the exception to any
alleged victim under 18.
</P>
<P>
   The four offenses at issue in this case took place between June,
1992 and July, 1993, when the victim was aged 14 or 15 and before
the new law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Carmell contended that he should not have been convicted for
incidents that allegedly occurred more than six months before his
stepdaughter told his wife in 1995 about his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But he was prosecuted under the 1993 law.
</P>
<P>
   Carmell's Supreme Court appeal relied heavily on language in a
1798 high court decision. It said the Constitution does more than
bar laws that criminalize conduct after it occurs, or make a crime
more serious than when it was committed.
</P>
<P>
   The 1798 decision said the Constitution also bans ''every law
that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or
different, testimony than the law required at the time of the
commission of the offense, in order to convict the offender.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that language, Texas courts and prosecutors and the
Clinton administration said using the 1993 law did not violate
Carmell's rights. The Supreme Court disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under the law in effect at the time the acts were committed,
the prosecution's case was legally insufficient ... unless the
state could produce both the victim's testimony and corroborative
evidence,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court. ''Under
the new law, (Carmell) could be (and was) convicted on the victim's
testimony alone...''
</P>
<P>
   ''A law reducing the quantum of evidence required to convict an
offender is as grossly unfair as, say, retrospectively eliminating
an element of the offense,'' Stevens added.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' opinion was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, David H.
Souter, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Ginsburg contended that ''retroactive
changes to rules concerning the admissibility of evidence and the
competency of witnesses to testify'' do not violate the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, Carmell once worked as a counselor
of incest victims, and met the woman he married in 1988 while
counseling her. It was her daughter he sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Carmell vs. Texas, 98-7540.

<HEADLINE> Gen. Clark Bids Farewell to Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Outgoing NATO commander Gen. Wesley
Clark visited Kosovo today for the last time during his term,
bidding farewell to the leaders he's worked with in an effort to
end violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 55, finishes his term as supreme commander of NATO forces
in Europe on Wednesday. He arrived today in Kosovo's provincial
capital, Pristina, to meet with U.N. mission chief Bernard Kouchner
as well as ethnic Albanian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After his formal meetings, Clark is to take a walk down the
provincial capital's main street, where he received a hero's
welcome last year after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign forced
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces from
Kosovo. That withdrawal opened the way for an international
presence here.
</P>
<P>
   Still, full peace has not been achieved. Since the NATO-led
peacekeepers and the U.N. mission arrived in June 1999, an
estimated 100,000 Serbs have fled the province as a result of
revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians. The ethnic Albanians were
seeking to get even for a bloody crackdown that was ordered by
Milosevic and ended by the NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   In the ethnically divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica, Clark
crossed for the first time into the northern, Serb-controlled side
of the city. There he met with a leading hard-line Serb, Oliver
Ivanovic.
</P>
<P>
   After Clark returned to local NATO command headquarters in the
southern, Kosovo Albanian section, Ivanovic told reporters he was
satisfied with the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the high American official realized that we Serbs are
no wild nation,'' Ivanovic said. He said the two discussed the
return of hundreds of thousands of Serbs who fled Kosovo before
NATO deployed there last June.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is being succeeded as NATO commander by Air Force Gen.
Joseph Ralston, 56. As is traditional, Ralston also will be
commander of U.S. European Command, in charge of all 100,000 U.S.
forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Secretary of Defense William Cohen was to meet
American troops serving in the Kosovo peacekeeping force. He and
Clark were not scheduled to meet.

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices climbed in early
dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade, propelled by
forecasts for mostly dry weather this week in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and soybeans both hit one-month highs in the first
half-hour of trading, with corn briefly touching the 12-cent daily
limit.
</P>
<P>
   New forecasts called not only for drier weather than previously
forecast for next weekend, but for hot and dry conditions in
growing regions over the next 30 to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   As farmers make swift progress with their spring plantings,
concerns are increasing that a dry-weather pattern is re-emerging
after a spate of April showers. Dry forecasts are reviving fears
that drought could limit this year's crop yields.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasts affected corn and soybeans the most -- primary
products from the nation's midsection -- but wheat also was pulled
higher by the rally in grains.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery rose 6} cents to $2.61{ a bushel; July
corn rose 10\ cents to $2.42\ a bushel; July oats rose 4\ cents to
$1.26 a bushel; July soybeans rose 21} cents to $5.61 a bushel.

<P>
   Beef and pork futures retreated in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.

<HEADLINE> If mayor stays in, he'll have an extra opponent  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's supporters are
predicting he'll stay in the U.S. Senate race despite his cancer
diagnosis; if he does, he'll be facing another rival.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Joseph J. DioGuardi said today that he is seeking
the nominations of the Conservative, Right to Life and Independence
parties, any of which could siphon votes from right-wing
Republicans the mayor has been courting. No Republican candidate
has won a statewide race without Conservative Party support since
1974.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor ''isn't conservative at all,'' DioGuardi said. ''Look
at his positions on abortion, on gun control. And he hasn't shown
any reason to think he can deal with foreign policy, national
security, military morale, any of the things you have to do as a
senator.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, ''She's a
moving van away from the most scandal-scarred White House maybe in
our history,'' DioGuardi said.
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi said he'd been considering the run for weeks and the
timing had nothing to do with Giuliani's prostate cancer, which has
the mayor reconsidering the race. DioGuardi said that he would
expect the Republican nomination if Giuliani bows out, but that he
can win the race even with Giuliani on the GOP ballot.
</P>
<P>
   State Conservative Party chairman Michael Long, reached by phone
today, said DioGuardi ''knows they're long odds'' but added, ''I do
not believe it's impossible for him to win outright. ... He's a
former congressman. He is certainly no lightweight. He's a scrappy
fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi, 59, an accountant from Ossining in Westchester
County, was a two-term incumbent who narrowly lost his seat in 1988
to Democrat Nita Lowey. He challenged Lowey again in 1992, but lost
that race as well. In 1994, DioGuardi entered a Republican primary
for a neighboring congressional district, but lost that to Sue
Kelly. He then ran against Kelly in the general election on the
Conservative and Right to Life lines, but Kelly won the race as the
GOP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College Poll released this morning concluded that
Giuliani's medical condition has not so far influenced voter
preference in the Senate race. Half the 952 voters surveyed were
contacted after Giuliani's announcement Thursday, and Quinnipiac
polling director Maurice Carroll said there was no noticeable shift
among them. The poll showed the race remains neck and neck, with
Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton leading Giuliani 46-44. Given the
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, the
candidates are in a statistical tie, which is consistent with other
recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain,
of Arizona, told ABC's ''This Week'' on Sunday that he is confident
the mayor will continue campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The odds are overwhelming that he'll be fine and that he will
be very active, and I believe he'll win,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Senate campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, told ''Fox
News Sunday,'' ''It's not only my hope, but my expectation, that he
will run. Hopefully, he'll pick a course of treatment that will
give him a cure, a complete cure, and then we'll be able to move
forth aggressively, with a winning campaign. That's our hope, and I
know the mayor shares my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has offered to campaign for Giuliani while the mayor
keeps his medical appointments.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he's sure Giuliani, who was playing golf Sunday
with his son, will be campaigning again soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very confident he'll be on the trail soon and he'll win
and he won't need any of us,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post released a poll Sunday that identified Gov.
George Pataki as the ''best choice'' among Republicans to take on
Clinton if Giuliani should drop out of the Senate race. The poll
showed Clinton and Pataki in a statistical tie if Giuliani were to
exit the race, with U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, who put his Senate
campaign on hold to make way for Giuliani, a distant second in a
matchup with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Giuliani were also tied for support in a
head-to-head race.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby International poll surveyed 601 likely voters
statewide. It has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum noted that tests show the mayor's prostate cancer has
not spread, but he said it will take the mayor 10 days to two weeks
before he decides on a course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   That will take up important campaign and fund-raising time
before the state Republican convention in Buffalo on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stayed away from any reference to the mayor in a speech
Sunday to a Catholic organization of union electricians.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts have predicted that the first lady will
tone down her rhetoric against the mayor because it would be
unseemly to attack him now that he has cancer.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Calls Out Millions for May Day  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP)-- Cuban leader Fidel Castro spoke with Elian
Gonzalez's father by cellular telephone today in front of a May Day
crowd of hundreds of thousands gathered to demand the boy's return
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is Juan Miguel,'' Castro said after Foreign Minister Felipe
Perez Roque handed him the phone. ''He says, 'Congratulations. Many
thanks.''' The crowd -- the largest to gather at the Plaza of the
Revolution in years -- roared approval.
</P>
<P>
   For days, Cuban newspapers and state radio stations had exhorted
Cubans to gather at the Plaza for the largest May Day celebration
in many years, one meant to be a crescendo in Cuba's campaign to
return 6-year-old Elian to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Before a sea of people stretching as far as the eye could see,
Castro linked the case to Cuba's struggle against the U.S. embargo
and international criticism of the communist island's human rights
record. He accused a ''Cuban-American terrorist mob'' of blocking
the shipwreck survivor's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was obvious that they underestimated our people, who have
not rested a single day in fighting for something absolutely
just,'' Castro said, referring to the massive campaign in Cuba to
demand Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not even Dante could have described the hell he (Elian) has
been through,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   But he praised U.S. public support for Elian's return to his
father, who flew to the United States last month to be reunited
with the son he had not seen since late November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pay tribute to the overwhelming majority of those
(American) people who despite all those lies have opposed the
odious crime committed against a small Cuban boy,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers urged Cubans to turn out in tennis shoes for a
two-mile march to the U.S. Interests Section after Castro speaks.
The Cuban leader himself wore tennis shoes with his traditional
olive-green uniform.
</P>
<P>
   During May 1 gatherings in recent decades, Castro has presided
over massive marches of workers but has left the podium to labor
leaders and other top officials.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering this year is also unusual in that it is being
described as an ''open tribune'' -- the government term used to
describe the mass concentrations regularly held to press for
Elian's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has riveted the attention of Cubans for five months, ever
since the boy was found floating on an inner tube off the Florida
coast following a boating accident that killed his mother and 10
others.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny castaway quickly found himself at the center of an
international custody battle. His anti-communist Miami relatives
are fighting to keep him in the United States and his communist
father is demanding to take the child back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was reunited with his father in Washington last week after
a dramatic raid of the Miami relatives' home. Armed agents whisked
the boy away and flew him to his dad.
</P>
<P>
   The raid has been bitterly criticized by the Miami relatives and
a large group of their supporters in South Florida's large
Cuban-American community, as well as among conservative members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son must stay in the United States pending a May 11
appeals court hearing on a request by the Miami relatives for a
political asylum hearing for the child.

<HEADLINE> Pill Makers Settle With Government  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The producers of the dietary supplement
''Vitamin O'' agreed Monday to repay consumers $375,000 in a
settlement of government charges that the product didn't do what
they claimed it would, federal regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would end the government's lawsuit against Donald
L. Smyth, president and sole shareholder of Rose Creek Health
Products, Inc. and The Staff of Life, Inc., both of Kettle Falls,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ''Vitamin O'' promised customers a $25 bottle
of pills could treat or prevent hosts of chronic or
life-threatening ailments, from heart disease to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The pills were essentially overpriced placebos, according to the
Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement bars Smyth and his companies from claiming
''Vitamin O'' is effective in treating life-threatening diseases,
or that its effectiveness has been established by medical or
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth and his companies also would be prohibited from making any
claims about the health benefits or safety of any other food, drug
or dietary supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Smyth nor the companies admitted any wrongdoing in
reaching the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. District Court judge must sign the deal before it is
finalized.

<HEADLINE> China Confirms Tiananmen Jailings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China has confirmed that two laborers who took
part in pro-democracy demonstrations 11 years ago are in prison, a
U.S. human rights leader reported today.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from China's Ministry of Justice to John Kamm, the
director of the U.S.-based Dui Hua Foundation, explained Chen Gang
and Zhang Jingsheng's prison terms and said when both are due to be
released, Kamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Chen and Zhang are among hundreds, if not thousands, of Chinese
still in jail for demonstrations centered on Beijing's Tiananmen
Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have known about the jailing of Chen and
Zhang through word from friends, other dissidents and news reports.
Their accounts said Chen had called for justice after the arrest of
his brother, a student organizer, while Zhang had called on workers
to resist the government's crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ministry of Justice letter was the first direct comment
from the government on the cases. According to Kamm, the ministry's
letter said Chen and Zhang were arrested in separate incidents in
southern Hunan province in 1989 and that both men are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the letter provided the following details:
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, now 47, had already served a four-year term for
''counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement'' in the early
1980s and committed the same crime again in 1989 in Changsha city.
He was given a 13-year sentence which has been reduced once. He is
due to be released next month.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, now 28, was arrested on charges of hooliganism in Xiangtan
city and sentenced to life imprisonment. His sentence has been
reduced three times. He will complete his prison term in November
2007.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Kamm submitted a list of 100 political prisoners to
Chinese justice officials. With word on Chen and Zhang, Kamm has
now learned the fate of 68 of them.
</P>
<P>
   China has yet to resume a human rights dialogue with the United
States broken off after U.S. warplanes bombed the Chinese Embassy
in Yugoslavia a year ago. Kamm's discussions were seemingly a
casualty of that rupture, but in March he again began to receive
information on prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Kamm also said China's Justice Ministry has invited him to come
to Beijing later this month for talks.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Chinese authorities reportedly released a marine
biologist who was serving an 18-year prison sentence for denouncing
the military assault on Tiananmen demonstrators. The Hong
Kong-based Information Center on Human Rights and Democracy said
officials gave no reason for releasing Chen Lantao on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up118; Dow Up 99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose for a third straight
session today, leading the broad market higher. Microsoft rose in
the first session since the Justice Department asked a federal
court to split the company in two to satisfy antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 99.90 at 10,833.81, building on early gains.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 118.97 at 3,979.63, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 20.34 at 1,472.77.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 3 11/16 to 73 7/16. Late Friday afternoon, the
Justice Department and 17 states delivered their propsed remedy for
Microsoft's antitrust violations: splitting the company into one
business for Microsoft's Windows operating-system software, and one
for Microsoft's Office and other applications products, plus
Microsoft's Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was widely expected, and many investors decided
that the possibility of a breakup had already taken its toll on
Microsoft stock. Before today's session, Microsoft's share price
had declined by about 40 percent since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether split up, or not, the sum of the parts are worth
around $125 to 135 a share,'' said Michael E. Stanek, a Microsoft
analyst with Lehman Brothers. ''Therefore, investor objections of
not owning the stock based on 'break-up' fears are no longer rooted
in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies that compete with Microsoft were mostly
higher. Red Hat, which sells the Linux operating system, was up 3
13/16 to 28 7/8. VA Linux rose 6 11/16 to 48 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, a leading maker of computer servers and
workstations, rose 3/4 to 92 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's advance was led by General Electric, which rose 3 7/16
to 160 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some modest support for the stock market came from the
National Association of Purchasing Management, which said America's
industrial sector grew for the 15th consecutive month in April. The
group said the economy's growth came at a slower pace than in
March, while prices for raw materials didn't rise as fast as in
earlier months.
</P>
<P>
   That offered some relief to inflation-wary traders. Most market
watchers expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the
sixth time in a year when it holds its next meeting on May 16. The
indication of modest growth raised hopes that only a modest,
quarter-point increase is in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 401.52 million
shares, behind Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 11.53 to
517.78.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accuses Brazil in Trade Fight  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today announced it
was planning to file World Trade Organization cases against Brazil
and five other nations, accusing the countries of unfair trade
practices that are hurting American businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil was targeted for two alleged violations, one involving
textile products and the other one covering the administration's
belief the country needs to increase patent protection for U.S.
products.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said the five other nations targeted in the
annual trade review were Romania, for discriminatory pricing on
clothing, poultry and distilled spirits; India, for rules regarding
autos; the Philippines, for local content requirements on autos and
motorcycles; Argentina, for patent protections, and Denmark, for
the enforcement of its patent and copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   All the nations now face the prospects of having to defend their
trade practices in cases brought before the Geneva-based WTO,
although it is possible that the disputes could be settled before
the appointment of hearing panels.
</P>
<P>
   ''These cases underscore our determination to take vigorous
action against foreign government practices that conflict with
international obligations,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky said in a statement announcing the administration's
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements were included in three reports the
administration submits annually to Congress detailing its trade
negotiating priorities for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. trade deficit set a new record last year of $268
billion, none of the countries responsible for the biggest share of
that imbalance was put on notice of possible WTO action in today's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Japan had the largest trade surplus with the United States last
year at a record $73.9 billion, and China was No. 2 with a record
imbalance with the United States of $68.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the threat of immediate WTO cases, Japan was placed
in lower priority ranking that the administration said ''may
warrant stepped-up enforcement action in the near future.'' Japan
was singled out for its alleged failure to implement market-opening
agreements involving flat glass and its government bid procedures.

<HEADLINE> Fox's 'Party of Five' Says Goodbye  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- From the beginning, the fictional, orphaned
Salinger siblings overcame obstacles, struggling to stay together
after their parents' death -- and also to stay on the air after the
network nearly pulled the plug on their first television outing.
</P>
<P>
   Season after season, audiences tuned in to find out what hurdle
was next for the tight-knit fictional brood of ''Party of Five'' as
they coped without parental guidance.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the family faces one final obstacle -- making their
own way in the world in the two-hour series finale, airing at 8
p.m. Eastern on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we attempted to wrap everything up,'' said the
show's co-creator and co-executive producer Christopher Keyser.
''What we tried to do was deal head-on with the central issue of
the show: How long does a family need to stay together?''
</P>
<P>
   The series told the story of five siblings whose parents were
killed by a drunken driver. Older brother Charlie (Matthew Fox)
took on the unwanted job of family patriarch to his brothers and
sisters: Bailey (Scott Wolf), Julia (Neve Campbell), Claudia (Lacey
Chabert) and Owen (Jacob Smith).
</P>
<P>
   ''We always felt the idea of the show was not an idea that was
worth exploring forever,'' said Amy Lippman, the other co-creator
and executive producer. ''It was about a family that was dealing
with the death of their parents. That can only go so far. We always
knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   Its demise, though, was hastened this year when the show was
moved to a new time slot, its ratings sagged and the cast's
contracts expired. Several cast members, including Campbell and
Wolf, who have burgeoning film and stage careers, were unlikely to
return.
</P>
<P>
   Keyser and Lippman also left the daily operation of the show
this season to pursue the ''Time of Your Life'' spinoff, which has
been temporarily pulled from Fox's schedule. They returned to
oversee the final ''Party'' episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last three months has very much been about preparing to
say goodbye,'' Keyser said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the show that almost wasn't. In its first year, Fox
nearly canceled the show until a fervent campaign by viewers and
media critics surfaced. TV Guide featured ''Party of Five'' as the
first of its annual ''The Best Show You're Not Watching'' picks.
</P>
<P>
   During the show's six-year run, the siblings faced a myriad of
problems, including confronting the driver who killed their
parents, an episode that earned Keyser and Lippman the Humanitas
Prize for writing. The show also picked up a Golden Globe for best
drama series in its second season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Party of Five'' never shied away from tough stories:
</P>
<P>
   --Julia struggled with the question of abortion after becoming
pregnant by her high school boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   --Bailey battled alcoholism and was confronted by his family in
an emotional intervention. Later, he nearly killed his girlfriend
in a car accident, lost his license and attended Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   --Charlie survived Hodgkin's disease.
</P>
<P>
   --Claudia dealt with the aftermath of attempted date rape.
</P>
<P>
   --Owen acted out violently when he no longer was the center of
attention for the siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The clan also faced drug problems, deaths, domestic violence and
many, many broken hearts.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the show's tiny moments -- buying a dress for prom,
getting married without Mom and Dad looking on, and the weekly
dinner out together that lent the series its title -- that were its
finest.
</P>
<P>
   It's that element that shines brightest in the finale with a
series of flashbacks -- not of the big story lines, but of intimate
moments. These remind viewers why they hung in all those years.
</P>
<P>
   The siblings face leaving their protective family circle in San
Francisco to pursue their own lives. Bailey debates going to
college in Pennsylvania. Julia contemplates taking an internship in
Washington, D.C. Claudia is offered a scholarship to a music
school. Charlie mulls selling the house.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, their decision is simple, emotional and, most of
all, real.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody leaves home.

<HEADLINE> Haider Quits As Freedom Party Chief  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA EDDY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Joerg Haider officially resigned Monday
as head of his far-right party in the same way he's led it for the
past 14 years -- with a speech lashing out at his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the annual Freedom Party congress overwhelmingly
elected Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer, Haider's personal
choice, to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Haider announced in February that he would be stepping down, but
the official change of office was left for the party's congress in
Klagenfurt, capital of Carinthia province, where Haider is
governor.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute speech to the congress, Haider, 50, called for
unity under Riess-Passer's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FPO should not change!'' Haider told the delegates, using
the Austrian acronym for his party. ''It must be our goal to work
so hard in the future that in the next election, there will be no
shift to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   In her first speech as party head, Riess-Passer, 39, told
Haider: ''You can always count on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came after several months of international and
domestic protest against the Freedom Party's inclusion in the
Austrian government. The party received 27 percent of the vote in
national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said that although Haider is no longer in charge,
he will continue to exercise an enormous influence over the party,
pointing out that Riess-Passer lacks his gift for public speaking
and populist flair.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, 50, gained notoriety for praising the ''orderly'' full
employment policies of Adolf Hitler, and calling Waffen SS veterans
''men of honor.'' He has repeatedly apologized for such remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But his apologies have done little to stifle international
criticism of Austria, also fed by the perception that the Freedom
Party is rabidly anti-foreigner. He hopes stepping down as party
head will change that.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Freedom Party joined the ruling coalition with the
conservative People's Party of Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel in
early February, other individual European Union countries have
frozen diplomatic relations with Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The European Community as a whole has threatened sanctions as it
has pledged to monitor closely the Austrian government's
performance and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Haider said Monday the Freedom Party would continue to pressure
the government to hold a referendum on what Austrians think of the
sanctions threat. Numerous polls have already showed that Austrians
resent any foreign pressure to change their government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the EU has been dealing with Austria is not compatible
from the European humanism that we would hope for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A referendum would also pressure Austrian President Thomas
Klestil -- a past critic of Haider -- to back the government in
protesting the sanctions, he said, something Klestil has so far
been reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president cannot act as though he had nothing to do with
this government. He approved it and is thereby required to stand by
it,'' Haider said.
</P>
<P>
   In his 14-year tenure as leader, Haider built the Freedom Party
up from a small group to the second-strongest party in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   He told the 690 congress delegates that his decision to step
down was a necessity, as it was no longer possible the party's
members of government ''to remain continually under the suspicion
of simply being marionettes whose strings are pulled in
Carinthia.''

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Seeks Remains of Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAEHWASAN, South Korea (AP) -- Lee Kyong-soo, a retired army
staff sergeant, watched Monday as soldiers hacked at a mountainside
with picks and shovels, searching for remains of troops slain in
the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fought here until we ran out of bullets. My fellow soldiers
died here, one after another. It still hurts to think of them,''
said the tearful 71-year-old Lee, who wore a military uniform
bedecked with medals.
</P>
<P>
   He was at a battlefield where about 1,100 South Korean soldiers
fought invading North Korean troops only two days after the Korean
War broke out on June 25, 1950. Most of the South Koreans were
killed in a three-day battle, and their remains were never
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, South Korean soldiers began digging up the
Kaehwasan Mountain on the outskirts of Seoul in a search for the
remains. None was found Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The excavation is part of a government plan to commemorate the
50th anniversary of the 1950-53 Korean War. Soldiers are digging in
two other areas and plan to increase the number of excavation sites
to 26 by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Before the digging began, government officials, veterans and
children of slain soldiers burned incense and prayed before a stone
memorial tower in a traditional show of respect for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Park Soon-hwan, a Buddhist monk, was 2 when his father, Sgt. 1st
Class Park Sang-rae, died at Kaehwasan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame that the remains of my father and other soldiers
have been buried here, abandoned for 50 years,'' Park said. ''I
feel grateful that they started this, even belatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   The government says it is doing the work now because it has the
money, technology and manpower to do so. An impoverished South
Korea was preoccupied with economic recovery in the years after the
war.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, U.S. and South Korean officials began field research
Monday to excavate an area at Seoul National University Hospital
this week. At least two sets of remains of American soldiers who
died in the Korean War are believed to be buried at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The planned recovery work at the hospital was prompted by
reports that workers found human bones and rusted helmets that were
possibly American during drainage work there in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the remains of 42 people believed to be U.S.
soldiers have been recovered in North Korea in joint recovery
operations. Most have not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 sets of remains believed to be those of South Korean
soldiers have been uncovered in other sites since April. The Seoul
government estimates the soldiers missing from the Korean War at
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the Korean War, South Korea and a U.S.-led U.N. force fought
communist North Korea, which was backed by the Soviet Union and
China.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 million Korean civilians and hundreds of thousands of
South and North Korean soldiers died. About 54,000 Americans died,
and 8,100 were listed as missing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States still keeps 37,000 troops in South Korea. No
peace treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War, and the
Korean peninsula remains tense.

<HEADLINE> Ailing Hostages Plead for Water  </HEADLINE>
By AARON FAVILA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALIPAO, Philippines (AP) -- The 21 hostages suffered from hunger
and diarrhea, and some pleaded for water. One said she could not
walk and wept in a bamboo hut where she and the others are being
held by Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages, including 10 foreign tourists, beamed Monday when
a doctor and several journalists arrived at the hut, 45 minutes
from the nearest road in the hills of a southern Philippine island.
</P>
<P>
   About 50-70 heavily armed Abu Sayyaf rebels, their faces covered
with hoods, guarded the area on Jolo island in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please give us water,'' several hostages beseeched the
visitors. Many complained of diarrhea from the unclean water and
meager food provided by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a doctor has seen the hostages since they
were abducted by boat from a Malaysian resort eight days ago -- one
of two kidnapping standoffs now ongoing in the Philippines'
southern islands.
</P>
<P>
   On the nearby island of Basilan, another group of Abu Sayyaf
rebels were able to escape with their 27 hostages when government
troops overran their mountain base this weekend, the military
admitted Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The army had been besieging the rebel base for days, trying to
rescue the hostages, mostly women and children who have been held
for more than a month. The abductions are not thought to be
directly coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   On Jolo, the hostages ate rice and cassava root as they lay on
the floor of the hut. The rebels allowed a provincial health
officer, Dr. Nelsa Amin, to bring them medicine, accompanied by
several reporters.
</P>
<P>
   One hostage, Renate Juta from Germany, twisted a towel with her
hands as she cried. She said she was unable to walk because of a
knee injury and had diarrhea and infections.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages include tourists from Germany, France, South
Africa, Finland and Lebanon, and resort workers from the
Philippines and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   The hut appeared to be different from a hut in which videotapes
of the hostages were taken Saturday, suggesting the captives had
been moved. The rebels, however, refused to allow such questions.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages asked the Philippine military to halt operations
near the hut, saying they had been awoken several nights earlier
and forced to walk barefoot to another location because of nearby
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Jolo is about an hour by boat from the Malaysian island of
Sipadan, the diving resort where the tourists were kidnapped Easter
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Consuls from the French, German and Finnish embassies delivered
11 boxes of medicine, clothes and food Monday to a Muslim official
who is serving as a go-between with the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   The consuls met for more than an hour with Nur Misuari, the
government negotiator, and rejected a rebel demand for direct
negotiations with ambassadors from the captives' countries.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two groups fighting for an
independent Islamic nation in the impoverished southern
Philippines, the homeland of the country's Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   On Basilan, about 50 miles northeast of Jolo, military officers
said a search of the captured Abu Sayyaf base had not found the
hostages or their captors. ''It appears that the rebels managed to
escape,'' Col. Ernest de Guzman said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the base Sunday, soldiers searched a tunnel complex
in the mountain base. They found children's sandals, generators,
weapons and 100 sacks of rice in the 650-foot tunnel, Col. Hilario
Atendido said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that we did not see the hostages was both good and
bad,'' Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said. ''Bad because we
were hoping they would be there. But the fact they are not there
indicates they are alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were among about 50 seized by the rebels from two
schools on March 20 for use as human shields after an attack on a
military outpost. The rebels later released some hostages, and
claimed two weeks ago to have beheaded two captives after the
government rejected some of their demands.

<HEADLINE> Monday's Supreme Court Actions  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Supreme Court took these actions Monday:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Agreed to decide in an Illinois case whether police who suspect
people of having illegal drugs in their homes can keep them from
going inside alone until a search warrant can be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   --Ruled in a Texas case that state and local governments can tell
their employees when to take the compensatory time off that they
agree to receive instead of overtime pay.

Iran, as a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   --Threw out some of a Texas man's convictions for sexually
assaulting his stepdaughter. The 5-4 decision said those
convictions were wrongly based on a state law enacted after he

<HEADLINE> Black Man Set on Fire in Britain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- A black man was verbally abused and
then set on fire Monday, an attack police said was racially
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old man, whose name was not released pending
notification of relatives, was listed in stable condition at Selly
Oak Hospital with burns to his face and right arm. His injuries
were not thought to be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ''There appears to be no motive for the attack apart from the
fact it was racially motivated,'' said Detective Chief Inspector
Neil James of the West Midland Police. ''It was a particularly
vicious attack aggravated by the fact that the victim was abused
verbally prior to being set alight.''
</P>
<P>
   Three white men were being sought for questioning, including one
described as a skinhead.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the victim was walking his girlfriend home in
the early hours when he was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic tests were being carried out to determine the liquid
sprayed in the man's face before he was set afire, and the street
where the attack occurred was sealed off so detectives could search
it.
</P>
<P>
   Police had not yet questioned the victim, who remained sedated.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham, which has a working-class image due its history as a
base for trade and manufacturing, is England's second-largest city,
located about 105 miles northwest of London.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To End Satellite System Dimming  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton ordered a halt today to the
military's long practice of intentionally dimming the pinpoint
accuracy of global positioning devices now used to help steer cars,
fly planes and find missing skiers and hikers.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, civilians using a U.S.-built network of satellites
for navigation got a less accurate reading than the military out of
fear that potential enemies could use the system to target
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, the United States will stop jamming the signal for
civilian users, but will still selectively block the improved
service to regions of the world where the U.S. percieves a threat,
a White House statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision follows development of new technology that makes
that kind of regional blocking possible, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in accuracy will mean a civilian will be able to
know the position of a car, ambulance or skier within about the
dimension of a tennis court. Now, the accuracy is more like within
the dimension of a football field.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 82; Dow Up 99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose for a third straight
session today, leading the broad market higher. Microsoft rose in
the first session since the Justice Department asked a federal
court to split the company in two to satisfy antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 99.90 at 10,833.81, building on early gains.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 82.56 at 3,943.22, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 19.12 at 1,471.55.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 2 15/16 to 72 11/16. Late Friday afternoon, the
Justice Department and 17 states delivered their propsed remedy for
Microsoft's antitrust violations: splitting the company into one
business for Microsoft's Windows operating-system software, and one
for Microsoft's Office and other applications products, plus
Microsoft's Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was widely expected, and many investors decided
that the possibility of a breakup had already taken its toll on
Microsoft stock. Before today's session, Microsoft's share price
had declined by about 40 percent since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether split up, or not, the sum of the parts are worth
around $125 to 135 a share,'' said Michael E. Stanek, a Microsoft
analyst with Lehman Brothers. ''Therefore, investor objections of
not owning the stock based on 'break-up' fears are no longer rooted
in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies that compete with Microsoft were mostly
higher. Red Hat, which sells the Linux operating system, was up 2
3/4 to 27 13/16. VA Linux rose 6 3/8 to 48.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's advance was led by General Electric, which rose 3 1/8
to 160 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Merger activity stimulated trading today. Rexall Sundown, a
maker of nutritional supplements and health products, rose 4 3/16
to 23 7/16 after Dutch specialty foods company Numico NV agreed to
acquire it for $24 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some modest support for the stock market came from the
National Association of Purchasing Management, which said America's
industrial sector grew for the 15th consecutive month in April. The
group said the economy's growth came at a slower pace than in
March, while prices for raw materials didn't rise as fast as in
earlier months.
</P>
<P>
   That offered some relief to inflation-wary traders. Most market
watchers expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the
sixth time in a year when it holds its next meeting on May 16. The
indication of modest growth raised hopes that only a modest,
quarter-point increase is in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 600.63 million
shares, behind Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 10.27 to
516.52.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Viet Leader Pham Van Dong Dies  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Pham Van Dong, who served as Vietnam's
prime minister through three decades of war and reunification, died
a day before the 25th anniversary of the communists' biggest
victory, government officials said Monday. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Dong, an architect of the communist revolution who combined
personal charm with political toughness, had been hospitalized on
life support for months before his death Saturday, the officials
said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Dong died at a Hanoi hospital. With no
newspapers Monday because of the May Day holiday, Dong's death was
to expected to be officially announced Tuesday. A state funeral was
planned for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dong was among a few revolutionaries who wrested Vietnam from
the French, then defeated U.S.-backed South Vietnam to bring the
entire country under Hanoi's rule on April 30, 1975. Official
ceremonies to mark the anniversary were held Sunday in Ho Chi Minh
City, the former Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   While Ho Chi Minh was the visionary and father figure, and Gen.
Vo Nguyen Giap was the battlefield hero, Dong was the diplomat and
government organizer. He became prime minister of North Vietnam
soon after independence in 1954 and headed reunified Vietnam from
1976 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, he was given the title of government adviser and
used occasional speeches and essays to warn of the dangers of
free-market economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly frail and virtually blind in his final years, he
made few public appearances. He emerged in December 1995 to meet
with visiting Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, and the two products
of French colonial education embraced and spoke in flowery French.
</P>
<P>
   Dong was often dubbed the Vietnamese Zhou Enlai. Like the
Chinese premier, Dong was articulate and sophisticated, an
administrative workhorse who tried to avoid personal feuds and mend
party disputes. And while Zhou had a long, intimate but subordinate
relationship with Chairman Mao Tse-tung, Dong was regarded as the
''best nephew'' of Uncle Ho.
</P>
<P>
   Dong was born March 1, 1906, in Quang Ngai province, then part
of the French protectorate of Annam. His father was private
secretary to Emperor Duy Tan.
</P>
<P>
   He imbibed nationalism in his youth at the prestigious Lycee
Quoc Hoc in Hue. In 1925, he joined a student strike in Hanoi and
fled to China when it failed.
</P>
<P>
   There he joined Ho's Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth Association,
which trained young nationalists in Marxism.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Vietnam in 1929 and began organizing communist
cells, but was quickly arrested by the French and spent about seven
years in the infamous island jail at Con Dao. Upon release he
resumed underground activities in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   After a failed 1939 communist uprising, Dong fled again to China
and linked up with Ho, who had established a temporary base there.
Dong spent the next few years recruiting revolutionaries in rural
northern Vietnam, occasionally crossing into China.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, Dong was a founding member of the Viet Minh, a
nationalist movement led by the communists but designed to draw
broader support.
</P>
<P>
   When the Viet Minh formed a provisional government in 1945 in an
independence bid, Dong was made finance minister. In a reflection
of his growing prominence in the party, he accompanied Ho to France
in 1946 for independence talks that failed.
</P>
<P>
   The Viet Minh continued guerrilla warfare for eight more years,
finally defeating the French decisively at Dien Bien Phu.
</P>
<P>
   Dong headed the Viet Minh delegation to the 1954 Geneva
conference, at which the major powers agreed to divide Vietnam
temporarily. The communists ruled in the North while the United
States emerged as chief supporter of the South.
</P>
<P>
   During the long war with the South, Dong was the North's main
spokesman to the world. Dong met with the handful of foreign
journalists and American anti-war activists who came to Hanoi, and
stressed his government's determination to keep fighting despite
punishing U.S. airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   But he was far from a heavy-handed propagandist. Adept at
charming visitors, he spiced his talk with quotes from French
classics and loud, disarming laughter.

<HEADLINE> ''Insider'' urges Pataki to sign fire-safe smokes bill  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Jeffrey Wigand, perhaps Big Tobacco's
biggest whistleblower, joined a coalition of anti-smoking groups
and firefighters Monday in pressuring Gov. George Pataki to sign a
bill mandating so-called fire-safe cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an opportunity for New York to take a leadership role
to really establish the mechanism by which children can be
protected,'' said Wigand, a former Brown &AMP; Williamson executive who
was the subject of the 1999 film, ''The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   Both houses of the state Legislature have approved the bill
requiring that only fire-safe cigarettes be sold in the state
starting in April 2002. Pataki has not said what he will do with
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 1,000 people who die in cigarette-related
fires each year, 150 to 200 are children, said Wigand, a former New
York resident.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand helped push the industry to a settlement of a
class-action lawsuit brought by the 50 states when he went to the
CBS television show ''60 Minutes'' in 1995 with claims of perjury
and other wrongdoing by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies, Wigand said, have for years known how to
create cigarettes that self-extinguish when the smoker stops
puffing, but have been resistant to change because no legislation
has pushed them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Help them do the right thing,'' Wigand said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Sciandra, of the Center For a Tobacco Free New York,
said he and others would meet with a Pataki counsel Monday to
discuss the legislation. In addition, Sciandra said his group's Web
site allows people to send Pataki electronic postcards endorsing
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The groups focused especially on cigarette-maker Philip Morris
because it has not been as active in opposing the fire-safe
legislation as other manufacturers. The company is test-marketing
fire-safe cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the issue would be more appropriately handled by
federal authorities, Andrew McGuire, executive director of the
Trauma Foundation, said that was true. However, he added, ''There's
no way in Washington to get it through. By having leadership in
this state push it ... we will get a federal solution.''
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, D-Manhattan,
said the bill he was a main sponsor of would probably be delivered
to Pataki Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's office said the governor would review the bill when he
receives it.
</P>
<P>
   Groups pushing for the legislation included the American College
of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the League of Women Voters and the
Islamic Society of Fire Department Personnel, Inc.

<HEADLINE> Three U.S. Warships Near Vieques  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Three U.S. warships slipped into the
waters off Vieques Island before dawn Monday, rattling the nerves
of protesters bracing for the arrival of federal agents to evict
them from a disputed Navy bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Several helicopters flew over the range Monday morning, and
nervous protesters blocking the main entrance to the Navy area
formed a circle for a prayer group, then began cutting up towels
that they soaked in vinegar and water for protection against tear
gas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like they're preparing an attack,'' said protester
Felicita Garcia, 65. ''I'm not scared, but I hope everything goes
peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-independence leader Ruben Berrios, who has camped out for a
year on the training ground just off Puerto Rico, warned on Sunday
that an assault would exact ''a high political price'' -- a
reference to fears that a raid will unleash anti-American feelings
in Puerto Rico and antagonize Hispanic voters in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are perhaps 50 protesters in several camps on the range.
Most, including Berrios, plan to surrender peacefully. But a few
radicals have threatened to scatter into the bomb-littered bush,
raising the specter of a long and dangerous hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy exercises in Vieques, which began in the 1940s, were
suspended a year ago after stray bombs killed a civilian security
guard, releasing a flood of pent-up resentments.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rican government in January agreed to let the Navy
resume exercises for three years using ''dummy'' bombs instead of
live ones, with a referendum among Vieques' 9,300 residents to
decide whether the Navy should leave. The protesters on the range
rejected the deal, and expectations have mounted that federal
authorities would expel them.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions increased with reports that two ships -- the USS
Nashville and the USS Bataan -- left Norfolk, Va., on Thursday and
picked up 1,000 Marines in North Carolina en route to Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, two U.S. ships appeared off the north coast of
Vieques, accompanied by two Coast Guard vessels. Navy spokesman
Robert Nelson would not comment -- but the hull number on one of
them was 13, corresponding to that of the USS Nashville, an
amphibious transport. The Bataan is an amphibious assault ship.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines reportedly would secure the perimeter of the bombing
range once protesters are removed. The actual arrests would be
carried out by federal agents in an FBI-led operation in
conjunction with the Justice Department, according to Pentagon
sources.
</P>
<P>
   An army barge also arrived carrying three vans of Puerto Rico's
anti-riot police, who are to provide crowd control during the
operation. On board a dozen men in green uniforms were visible. In
a channel farther out from Vieques a destroyer anchored Monday,
carrying two U.S. Coast guard helicopters, with blue-overalled
crews checking their aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, the three warships steamed off to Roosevelt Roads
Naval Station on the main island of Puerto Rico, about 1{ hours
away given the glass-calm sea, and the barge deposited the police
vans on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the Coast Guard said they were preparing to
blockade waters around the two-thirds of Vieques that is federal
land -- the eastern bombing range and a munitions store in the west
-- to prevent threatened demonstrator reinforcements from reaching
the protest area by sea.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters Monday repeated their promises to infiltrate the
base, cutting through fences and riding in by horseback, to replace
any demonstrators who are arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will go anywhere I'm needed for the cause of Vieques,'' Rosa
Garcia, 60, said from a protest camp that has blocked the land
entrance to the bombing range for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some were worried about violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are always two or three people who are going to try to
do their own thing,'' said Eunice Romero, 58, owner of Carolyn's
Gift Shop. ''Obviously, I wish the Navy would leave. But it's been
a year already, and I wish this would end.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Worried About Latin America  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Persistent poverty and ineffective government
in Latin America are threatening the democratic tide that began two
decades ago, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a series of positive developments in the area, ''there
is a troubling flip side,'' she said in a speech to the annual
conference of the Council of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fruits of growth in the last decade have not appeared on
every table within or among countries in our region,'' Albright
said. ''While many people enjoy higher living standards, many
others remain mired in poverty. And too often, government programs
and policies serve to increase -- rather than reduce -- these
inequalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright noted that a year ago she warned that ''the democratic
tide in Latin America may begin to recede'' if these problems were
not addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Countries may begin to be lured again down the dead end roads
of protectionist policies and authoritarian rule,'' she said.
''And, in fact, it is already starting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   To ease this threat, she said the United States is determined to
work with regional institutions to achieve stronger and more
equitable economies as well as a more cohesive democratic
community.
</P>
<P>
   She said one of the obstacles to meeting these goals is a
''culture of bribery and corruption that corrodes too many
institutions and transactions in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Needless to say, it also impairs the ability of American and
other international businesses to operate in a transparent and
predictable environment for trade and investment.''
</P>
<P>
   On Colombia, Albright expressed regret that the Senate has yet
to act on the administration's request for $1.6 billion in
assistance, mostly for counternarcotics activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The impact of this foot-dragging is already being felt in
Colombia as drug interdiction and crop replacement activities are
held back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also addressing the conference was Peter Romero, the acting head
of the State Department Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. He
expanded on Albright's comments on poverty in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well over 180 million citizens in our hemisphere still live in
poverty, or less than $2 a day,'' he said. ''The hemisphere has the
worst income distribution of the world. Within our nations there
exists sharp inequalities in nutrition, education, income,
technology, economic growth, and rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless we work to close these gaps, we leave our societies
vulnerable to lawlessness and violence that spring from
instability. Increasing the incomes of all segments of society
require our people to have the skills and the flexibility to adjust
to new circumstances,'' Romero said.

<HEADLINE> Pioneer Yacht Manufacturer Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. (AP) -- Pioneer yacht manufacturer and offshore
powerboat champion Richard Bertram has died from complications
related to Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   He was 84 when he died Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram popularized the now standard V-type hull that allows
boats to cut through rough waters. He was competing in the 1958
America's Cup trials when he noticed a small boat slicing through
the choppy waters.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued by the boat's V-shaped bottom, Bertram tracked down
the designer and asked him to build a larger version so he could
commute from his Coconut Grove waterfront home to his office in
downtown Miami.
</P>
<P>
   When the 30-foot ''Moppie'' was finished, Bertram entered the
boat in the 1960 Miami-Nassau race. The boat broke the course
record and beat the nearest competitors by two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moppie'' was then featured in many newspaper and magazine
articles, and boaters asked for replicas. That's when Bertram
started his Miami business, building luxury cruising yachts and
sports-fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   His clientele included Aristotle Onassis, the Aga Kahn, King
Hussein of Jordan and Prince Bertil of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The sailor's love affair with boating began on New Jersey's
Barnegat Bay, where his family owned a summer home. At 8, he sailed
his first vessel. He won his first race at 14, and as a student at
Cornell founded the school's yacht club and skippered two
consecutive championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram is survived by his wife, Franchesca Morales Bertram;
five daughters, five sons and a stepson; five grandchildren; and
one great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a memorial service were incomplete.

   ABC Gone From 7 Time Warner Systems
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A quarrel over transmission rights between Time
Warner Inc. and the Walt Disney Co. left seven Disney-owned ABC
stations off of local cable systems today. The only way for cable
customers to see such ABC programs as ''Good Morning America''
would be to rig their TVs to get an ABC station the old-fashioned
way, through an antenna. A Time Warner spokesman said a total of
3.5 million homes in seven markets were affected. Cable customers
were without ABC programming in New York City; Los Angeles;
Houston; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and small parts of
Time Warner systems in Fresno, Calif., and Philadelphia.

   Microsoft Shares Up on Breakup Plan
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Microsoft were up 3[ at 72~ this
afternoon as Wall Street painted the government's bid to split the
software maker into two companies as both unrealistic and maybe
even beneficial for investors in the stock. Many legal and industry
experts suggest that the plan is too severe and also unworkable,
and may not survive when Microsoft challenges it in the court of
appeals. In addition, the appeals process and ultimate resolution
of the case may take two years or so. Meantime, it's suggested,
investors may eye the two proposed companies favorably. The split
was recommended by the federal government and 17 states as
punishment for violating antitrust laws.
</P>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors decided today that the possibility of

   Construction Spending Rose in March
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spending on construction projects around the
country rose by 1.4 percent in March, led by a burst of activity in
big government projects. It was the third straight monthly
increase. The Commerce Department reported today that construction
spending was a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $765.2 billion, a
better showing than analysts had anticipated. Many were forecasting
no change and some others thought there would be a small decline.

   Manufacturing Grows at Slower Pace
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. industrial sector grew for the 15th
consecutive month in April, while price increases for raw materials
did not rise as fast as in earlier months, the National Association
of Purchasing Management reported today. The purchasing managers'
group said that its manufacturing index, based on a national survey
of executives who buy raw materials and other supplies for
industries, registered 54.9 percent in April, slightly weaker than
the 55.8 percent reported for March. April's number was below the
55.5 percent that Wall Street analysts had expected. However, any
reading above 50 indicates growth.

money with little risk. The firms neither admitted to nor denied
wrongdoing. The Federal Trade Commission, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission
announced settlements with the firms in which they agreed to drop
unsubstantiated claims of profits. The federal agencies also warned
consumers to be wary of false and misleading claims on Web sites
touting trading strategies or systems.

   Power Cos. May Team on Transmission
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Six power companies in the Northwest are in talks
to create a joint venture combining all of their power transmission
assets, a move that would make their network the second largest in
the region. Puget Sound Energy spokeswoman Dorothy Brackens said
today that her company was in ''preliminary discussions'' with five
other companies: Avista Corp. of Spokane, Montana Power Co. in
Butte, Mont., Portland (Ore.) General Electric Co, and two
Nevada-based companies owned by Sierra Pacific Resources of Reno,
Nev. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the venture
today, said the new company would manage power lines and
substations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and
Nevada.

   Prodi Shrugs Off Euro Weakness

fundamentals of Europe's economy were sound. Prodi, meeting with
reporters after talks with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori,
said he raised the subject of the European currency, which has been
weak in relation to the Japanese yen and U.S. dollar. ''In my
opinion the euro began well. The European Central Bank organized
itself in the way it should have organized itself. The fundamentals
of the European economy are sound,'' said Prodi, citing inflation

   Siemens To Buy Medical Tech Co.
</P>
<P>
   MALVERN, Pa. (AP) -- Siemens Medical Engineering Group is buying
Shared Medical Systems Corp., one of the world's leading suppliers
of services and information technology systems for the healthcare
industry, for $2.1 billion. The companies said today that they
expect the cash tender offer of $73 a share to be launched within
10 days. Shared Medical was the target of a $2 billion hostile bid
in March from Eclipsys Corp. of Delray Beach, Fla. Shared Medical
dismissed the $67 a share offer.

   Companies Can Dictate Time Off
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public employees who agree to take extra time
off instead of collecting overtime pay can be forced to use the
time off at their employer's convenience, the Supreme Court ruled
today. The justices, voting 6-3 in a case from Houston, said
governmental employers have the authority to control when such
time-off credits are used if no pre-existing labor agreement says
otherwise. The decision is a setback for 127 sheriff's deputies in
Harris County, Texas, and the AFL-CIO, which had supported their
legal argument.

Park Avenue, where they got another round of assurances from their
new multinational bosses that selling their Vermont-based ice cream
company wouldn't mean selling out their ideals of social activism.
The two hippie capitalists heard Unilever's U.S. chief executive,
Richard A. Goldstein, repeat his earlier promises that Ben &AMP;
Jerry's Homemade will operate as an independent entity. The
co-founders said they'll press Unilever to take a greater role in
social causes, but questioned how successful they'd be.

   Dutch Numico To Buy Rexall Sundown

   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The Dutch specialty foods company
Royal Numico NV is buying Rexall Sundown Inc., a U.S.-based maker

$1.7 billion. News of the deal disclosed today drove Rexall
Sundown's shares up 4 3/16 or about 21 percent to 23 7/16 in
afternoon New York trading. Rexall, based in Boca Raton, Fla. will
give Numico a strong position in the fast-growing American food
supplements market, the Dutch group said. Numico plans to finance
the deal -- already approved by Rexall's management -- by issuing new
shares and bonds and by refinancing existing loans, according to a
company statement.

Taiwanese computer firms were setting up factories in China,
attracted by its vast market and ample supply of engineers and
other technicians. The first quarter electronics investment
accounted for 57 percent of overall Taiwanese investment in China,

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 161; Nasdaq Up 103  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose for a third straight
session today, leading the broad market higher. Microsoft rose in
the first session since the Justice Department asked a federal
court to split the company in two to satisfy antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 161.17 at 10,895.08, building on
early gains.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 103.13 at 3,963.79, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 26.39 at 1,478.82.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 4 to 73 3/4. Late Friday afternoon, the Justice
Department and 17 states delivered their proposed remedy for
Microsoft's antitrust violations: splitting the company into one
business for Microsoft's Windows operating-system software, and one
for Microsoft's Office and other applications products, plus
Microsoft's Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was widely expected, and many investors decided
that the possibility of a breakup had already taken its toll on
Microsoft stock. Before today's session, Microsoft's share price
had declined by about 40 percent since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether split up, or not, the sum of the parts are worth
around $125 to 135 a share,'' said Michael E. Stanek, a Microsoft
analyst with Lehman Brothers. ''Therefore, investor objections of
not owning the stock based on 'break-up' fears are no longer rooted
in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies that compete with Microsoft were mostly
higher. Red Hat, which sells the Linux operating system, was up 3
to 28 1/16. VA Linux rose 7 1/2 to 49 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's advance was led by General Electric, which rose 4 3/16
to 161 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Merger activity stimulated trading today. Rexall Sundown, a
maker of nutritional supplements and health products, rose 4 1/8 to
23 3/8 after Dutch specialty foods company Numico NV agreed to
acquire it for $24 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also resumed seeking bargains among the technology
stocks that were pounded in a wave of selloffs in mid-April. Ciena,
a designer of telecommunications networks, rose 17 to 140 5/8.
Online information center About.com rose 13 13/64 to 47 33/64.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some modest support for the stock market came from the
National Association of Purchasing Management, which said America's
industrial sector grew for the 15th consecutive month in April. The
group said the economy's growth came at a slower pace than in
March, while prices for raw materials didn't rise as fast as in
earlier months.
</P>
<P>
   That offered some relief to inflation-wary traders. Most market
watchers expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the
sixth time in a year when it holds its next meeting on May 16. The
indication of modest growth raised hopes that only a modest,
quarter-point increase is in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 725.12 million
shares, behind Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.56 to
518.81.

<HEADLINE> Official: Vietnam Must Fix Economy  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- In an unusually blunt
assessment of Vietnam's ills, a top official said the communist
government must confront some hard realities -- a sagging economy,
rampant corruption and rising drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Chi Minh City Mayor Vo Viet Thanh's comments came after an
invitation-only 25th anniversary celebration of Vietnam's victory
over the United States. Thanh told the aging architects of the 1975
military triumph and 20,000 guests Sunday that the country had
failed the memory of those who died and should feel ''guilty at
heart'' for not doing more to clean up the economy and government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arbitrary and imperious behavior, wasteful spending,
embezzlement, bribery and other social evils, particularly the
increasingly widespread scourge of drug addiction, are sending
worrying signals of ineffective law enforcement and serious
degradation of moral and spiritual values,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the victory on the battlefield a quarter-century ago
brought the country together, Vietnam's rulers have failed to bring
real prosperity to its 76 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Despite huge potential, including a highly motivated work force,
Vietnam remains among the world's poorest nations, with an average
per capita income of $370 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment, which topped $8 billion in 1996, plummeted
to less than $2 billion in 1999 following the Asian financial
crisis and concerns that Vietnam was unwilling to undertake serious
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Thanh said a top priority must be to make the investment
environment more attractive, adding that his city, once known as
Saigon, ''welcomes with open arms'' foreign investors, businessmen,
and multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's parade on the grounds of the old Independence Palace
-- where communist tanks smashed through the gates on April 30, 1975
-- the focus was the military triumph, although the United States
was never mentioned by name.
</P>
<P>
   Old soldiers, their chests dripping with medals, drew the
loudest applause, along with rifle-toting women from the
''long-haired army'' who were part of the guerrilla campaign
against the Americans. Soldiers on several floats waved bouquets of
fake flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Banners flanking a giant portrait of revolutionary leader Ho Chi
Minh hailed the anniversary of the reunification of communist North
Vietnam and the capitalist South and called on the people to build
an ''economically strong country.''
</P>
<P>
   Only invited guests and participants took part in the palace
festivities, but the celebrations continued throughout the day and
night with an open carnival that drew tens of thousands into the
city streets. In the country's largest-ever amnesty, 12,000
prisoners were released. A mass wedding of 25 couples was also held
at a downtown park.
</P>
<P>
   Average Vietnamese have so far shown patience with the
government, as living standards have slowly crept up in the wake of
the economic reforms launched in 1986. But with the current
slowdown, that patience may start to wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   Dang Duc Hao, 40, an invited parade-watcher who was a teen-age
communist supporter in 1975, said he was very happy to be
celebrating what he called ''one of the most vivid examples of
national liberation in the world,'' but he complained about trying
to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family is in difficulty,'' he said, explaining that his
salary as an electricity worker is very low, his wife is sick and
he doesn't have enough money to support his four children.
</P>
<P>
   Among the thin crowd of spectators outside the palace -- now
called Reunification Palace -- was Nguyen Thi Chinh, 39, who
recalled his problems finding a good job after 1975 because his
sister had married an American. Three years ago, he finally got
work as a driver with a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things have gotten better, but I still worry about my
children's future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pham Chi, 70, a retired port worker who came to Ho Chi Minh City
hoping to watch the parade, also wound up standing outside the
palace because he didn't have a ticket. He said the country was
''much more advanced'' than it was a quarter-century ago, when he
watched the palace being bombed just before the city fell to the
communists.
</P>
<P>
   What are his hopes for the next 25 years?
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not be alive in 25 years,'' he laughed. ''Maybe at that
time, the Vietnamese people can fly to the moon.''

<HEADLINE> Early American Cop Is Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA SINDERBRAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officially, John Ryer was a respectable
cattleman and gentleman farmer in the sleepy 18th century Village
of Fordham in what is now the Bronx borough of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But even Ryer admitted he traveled with an unsavory crowd and
made a habit of ''almost every kind of vice, wickedness, and
debauchery.''
</P>
<P>
   When he drank too much while gambling at Levi Hunt's inn on May
17, 1792, Deputy Sheriff Isaac Smith and other officers were called
in to restore order. By the end of the day, Smith had become the
first American law enforcement officer to die in the line of duty,
felled by gunshots Ryer fired.
</P>
<P>
   More than two centuries later, Smith's name -- and those of 279
other officers killed in the line of duty -- joined more than 15,000
others already engraved on the marble walls of the National Law
Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the 280 officers whose names were chiseled into
the walls Monday morning died last year. The rest, including two
dozen killed before the 20th century, were recently discovered by
memorial researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund's annual
candlelight vigil honoring officers killed in the line of duty will
be held May 13.
</P>
<P>
   Ryer was eventually hanged for his crime.

<HEADLINE> Donkey Day in Mexico Is Festive  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTUMBA, Mexico (AP) -- This mountain-pass town saluted
international workers' day Monday with its annual homage to the
hardest worker of all: Mexico's prized burro.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people flocked to the 16th-century town of Otumba
for a festival of sport, savagery and beauty in what is probably
the world's only donkey fair. They came for the donkey races, polo
on donkey and bucking donkey rodeo, along with prizes for the
best-costumed donkey -- and, of course, the crowning of Miss Donkey.
</P>
<P>
   Imbued with tradition and more than a dose of tongue-in-cheek,
the 36th annual National Donkey Festival drew a record crowd to
Otumba's tree-lined central square northwest of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Donkeys serve us all day, so we have to realize that they
deserve their fiesta,'' said Martin Coyote Balderas, 70, who
traveled 60 miles with his family to see the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   The day started off eruditely enough with the polo match. The
players, four on each side, were mounted on a mangy assortment of
donkeys. They used brooms to hit both the beach ball and their
trusted steeds.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the game was spent motionless, as only two of the eight
players seemed to have even minimal control of their notoriously
stubborn animals. Spectators hooted as the goalie's mount -- a
particularly ornery white burro -- bucked him to the asphalt as the
ball rolled into the goal.
</P>
<P>
   And there were the costumes: donkeys decked out as everything
from presidential candidates to Pikachu, the Pokemon monster.
</P>
<P>
   One burro pulled a wagon in which another donkey represented
Mexican pop singer Gloria Trevi, who is jailed and awaiting
extradition from Brazil to face charges of corrupting minors. The
pop-star donkey wore lipstick, pantyhose, a wig and a bra.
</P>
<P>
   But the highlight for most spectators was the donkey race, in
which a sturdier group of beasts tore around the plaza, their
riders beating them with wooden sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite was Gateado, a gray burro that had won the race for
10 years running. Asked why the animal runs so fast, jockey Adrian
Hernandez boasted: ''Because I beat him harder.'' He came in second
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of the festival were a bit of a letdown. One of the
festival's tradition highlights, the beer-guzzling donkey, is no
more: Organizers say the burro took ill after a previous year's
binge and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Otumba earned its reputation as Mexico's donkey capital while it
was a way station on the route from Mexico City to Veracruz port.
Donkeys carried much of Spain's colonial loot over the route in the
16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The donkey festival started as a religious celebration in which
people brought their animals to church to be blessed. The festival
has grown year by year, especially after the donkey race appeared
in a 1970s movie starring ''Maria the Indian,'' a popular recurring
character in Mexican comedy.
</P>
<P>
   This year's donkey queen -- as the young lady with the crown
proudly called herself -- said there had never been such a big
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is fantastic, an unforgettable experience,'' said Lorena
Vianey, a 23-year-old college student who sold the most raffle
tickets to earn her crown. ''I'm just so happy.''

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Looks Out For Buchanan  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- National Reform Party leaders are trying to
quell a rebellion among state affiliates hostile to Pat Buchanan by
threatening to block them from voting at the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is touring state conventions in pursuit of enough
support to win the nomination, has run into state parties from New
Hampshire to Wisconsin to California willing to change their rules
to keep him out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just telling people that if they play games, their
delegations will not be recognized at the national convention,''
party chairman Pat Choate said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're not recognized, they can't be seated and if they
can't be seated, they can't vote,'' added convention chairman
Gerald Moan.
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials see Buchanan's tour across the country as
an attempt to take over the party founded by Ross Perot. Not all
national party leaders are happy with him either.
</P>
<P>
   He is outspokenly anti-abortion, for example, while the Reform
Party platform is silent because the party believes government
should stay out of such private matters. Buchanan's statements
about homosexuals and Nazis sit uneasily with many Reform Party
members. And the Buchanan camp rubbed national leaders the wrong
way last month by proposing to move the nominating convention from
Long Beach, Calif., to Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan camp had long proposed a meeting with the national
leaders to smooth things over. On Sunday in Washington, Buchanan's
sister and campaign manager, Bay, repeated the candidate's promise
not to try to force an anti-abortion plank into the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   She promised to think about party secretary Jim Mangia's
proposal that the candidate make a statement acknowledging
differences in opinions on social issues, Mangia said.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the national committee cracked down on state parties,
starting with Illinois, where the state convention was headed for
turmoil on Sunday. State chairman Larry Redmond, according to Moan,
was given the ultimatum by a regional representative and fireworks
were avoided. Buchanan captured most of the state's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Several state parties have split in two rather than accept
Buchanan or his supporters. Some states, such as Wisconsin, tried
to change the rules to exclude anyone running for party office who
hasn't been a member for more than six months. That would have
blocked many of Buchanan's supporters, since they came to the party
after their candidate bolted the GOP in October. There are now two
Wisconsin Reform Parties.
</P>
<P>
   As many as seven split state parties could end up at the
convention vying for seats and voting rights, Moan said. A
credentialing committee and the full convention will resolve such
disputes, and they won't look kindly on any parties that tried
''exclusionary tactics,'' Moan said.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Targets Payee Abuses  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social Security recipients who get help
managing their benefits may be targets for con artists.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration's Office of Inspector General
says it has uncovered scams by designated intermediaries -- known as
representative payees -- who have robbed beneficiaries of $7.5
million since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The agency estimates about $3 million of the $30 billion in
Social Security benefits disbursed through representative payees
each year are misused.
</P>
<P>
   ''The abuses are completely unacceptable ... The victims here
have fixed incomes. They rely on a monthly benefit check to pay the
rent and buy their groceries. They may end up hungry and
homeless,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the
Senate Special Committee on Aging, which has scheduled a hearing on
the problems Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   All representative payees must file a form with the Social
Security Administration once a year, accounting for how benefits
they managed were spent or invested. Onsite audits of organizations
acting as payees are being increased, said Deputy Social Security
Administrator Susan Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration also earlier this year
proposed legislation that would allow benefits to be reissued to
anyone who loses them to a dishonest representative payee. Current
law allows Social Security to reissue lost benefits in most cases
only if the money can be recovered from the payee.
</P>
<P>
   About 6.5 million Americans who get Social Security or
low-income benefits known as Supplemental Security Income have a
representative payee who receives their check and manages their
money. Most of these beneficiaries are deemed incompetent to handle
their own financial affairs, often because of mental illness or
substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Most representative payees are family members or friends. About
750,000 beneficiaries have an organization or institution assigned
to help them manage their money, however. It is these beneficiaries
who are most likely to be taken advantage of, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizational payees may be banks, mental hospitals, state or
local government agencies or private nonprofit groups. Some are
authorized to collect a fee for their services.
</P>
<P>
   In one case of abuse, a woman who acted as a paid payee for
Social Security beneficiaries in Phoenix and Denver stole $274,000
from 330 people before being caught.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Deal Faces Close Vote  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ending the annual review of China's trade
privileges will strengthen the hand of reformers in the Chinese
government while widely benefiting U.S. businesses, a senator who
supports the measure said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With a congressional vote on the landmark trade deal with China
approaching later this month, Sen. Max Baucus warned that defeat of
the measure ''not only won't achieve our goals, but will create
more problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing permanent normal trade relations with China was part
of a U.S.-China deal to clear the way for Beijing's expected entry
into the World Trade Organization this year. In return, Beijing has
promised to open its markets to foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
   China's admission to the WTO was overwhelmingly in the United
States' favor, Baucus told a gathering of the Council on Foreign
Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a one way deal; We don't give up anything, China makes
vast concessions,'' said the Montana Democrat, whose state would
benefit from reduced tariffs on agricultural exports to China under
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, who is struggling to reform China's
economy, has committed himself to bring China into the WTO. Zhu has
threatened to exclude U.S. companies if Congress doesn't give China
permanent normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus criticized arguments from labor and human rights groups
that the annual review of China's trading privileges offered the
U.S. leverage over China's human rights, environmental, religious
and labor policies.
</P>
<P>
   If China is a WTO member, it would be illegal for the United
States to impose conditions on trade with China that it does not
impose on other trading partners, Baucus said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have leverage now,'' he said, noting that despite
noisy debate, the China trade deal has gained approval from
Congress every year without conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Granting China permanent normal trade relations has support from
roughly 80 percent of the Senate, Baucus said. But he cautioned the
vote would be much closer in the House, despite lobbying by the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is eventually going to pass,'' Baucus said.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Make Gore CD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a CD recording just 10 minutes long,
Republicans hope to make Vice President Al Gore a radio star.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee produced 1,000 compact discs
featuring its favorite gaffes by Gore -- ''The Best of Al Gore: Hits
of the '80s, '90s and Today!'' the compilation is called -- and is
distributing them to radio talk shows around the country.
</P>
<P>
   One 6-second bit is Gore telling CNN last March, ''I took the
initiative in creating the Internet.'' Another has Gore telling New
Hampshire high school students, ''I found a little place in upstate
New York called Love Canal.''
</P>
<P>
   A sound bite from a White House press conference during the
height of his campaign fund-raising woes has Gore using the
infamous phrase ''no controlling legal authority'' three times in
93 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In four days, the RNC received 600 requests for the CD, said
spokesman Mark Pfeifle.

<HEADLINE> Senate Chair Backs Vet Health Care  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to vastly expand prescription drug
benefits for military retires over age 65 won the crucial
endorsement on Monday of Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman
John Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, R-Va., announced sponsorship of a bill that would extend
to all 1.3 million Medicare-eligible military retirees the same
benefits that are now available to 450,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   That includes an $8 copayment if the prescriptions are filled by
mail order and a 20 percent co-payment when acquired in retail
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Warner called the measure ''another step forward in the effort
to keep commitments made to military retirees,'' primarily the
promise of health care for life.
</P>
<P>
   He announced the program in a Senate speech on the eve of action
in his committee on the Pentagon's fiscal year 2001 budget request.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that he is incorporating the benefit
increase in the overall Pentagon measure before the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've held a series of town meetings. We've been in
consultation with a wide range of veterans groups. We've heard from
hundreds and hundreds of individuals,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure backed by Warner has been pushed previously by Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pharmacy benefit is the number one issue and priority of
military retirees, since pharmacy needs are the biggest drain on
the pensions of military retirees,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the mail-order and retail pharmacy benefits are only
available to retired military personnel who had been receiving
their prescription drug benefits at medical installations on bases
that have been closed.
</P>
<P>
   Since this covers only about a third of those who are retired,
it led to a dual system.
</P>
<P>
   ''By accident of where you had retired and by the results of the
Base Closure Commission, some retirees received the benefits and
others did not,'' said Kennedy. ''this legislation would treat
military retirees across the country the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 20-year retirees are entitled to free care at
military facilities on space-available basis, or they can join an
HMO-like military health care system known as Tricare. However, at
65, all retirees are switched to Medicare. Under the Medicare
system, there are no prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans complain that the closing of bases has reduced access
to military hospitals by 40 percent, that many health-care
providers are reluctant to deal with Tricare because of poor
efficiency and low reimbursement rates.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton wants to provide all 39 million Medicare
recipients with up to $1,000 a year in prescription drugs
initially, at a cost to each of $26 a month in premiums.
Republicans have balked; they say two-thirds of Medicare
beneficiaries already have private prescription coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
has proposed separate legislation that would expand the Pentagon's
mail-order pharmacy program to Medicare-eligible military retirees
-- but they first would pay a $150 annual deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's measure does not include such a deductible.
</P>
<P>
   His plan would cost an estimated $300 million in the first year.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Unraveling Brain Defect  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- About two dozen children cluster around Dr.
Max Muenke. Most sit in wheelchairs, their muscles either too rigid
to move or too floppy to hold them up. Many cannot speak. Some
faces bear signs of their illness: a misshapen head, cleft palate,
eyes pushed together. In the worst cases, babies may have one
centered eye.
</P>
<P>
   These children have a baffling brain defect called
holoprosencephaly, and their parents brought them to the National
Institutes of Health in desperate hope that Muenke can help unlock
the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime during the first few weeks of fetal development,
something went terribly wrong and stopped these children's brains
from dividing into normal right and left sides. Now, scientists at
the NIH and five new brain centers around the country have begun
the first real effort to attack this defect and improve these
children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: A wealthy Dallas family, frustrated at doctors'
inability to help their 4-year-old son, has raised almost $10
million bankrolling new ''Carter Centers for Brain Research'' to
study HPE and provide expert care.
</P>
<P>
   Muenke's quest is to test these children's genes, hunting which
ones went wrong. The first question a parent asks: Will the gene
testing provide a cure?
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to learn first how come your child has
holoprosencephaly,'' Muenke replies gently. ''I feel I would be
lying to you if I said I expect a cure in the next years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while he warns against false hope, Muenke is cautiously
excited. Already, drugs are helping some children move better.
Cutting-edge brain tests are revealing cognitive function. Tools to
help children learn and communicate are under development. Suspect
genes are under study.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pushing the envelope,'' said Dr. Stephen Kinsman of the
HPE center at Baltimore's Kennedy Krieger Institute. ''We're
saying, 'How is the brain working in this child and what are the
next brain processes we need to help in this child's development
that will give them more function?'''
</P>
<P>
   And the influence of the new Carter centers sparked the NIH to
bring together about 70 neuroscientists to share the latest
research with parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to ask how much more can I do for her. I want to know
if there is something more,'' said Irene Leal, who brought
4-year-old Jessica from Texas to be examined at NIH.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica can't walk or talk, but she has proved wrong doctors who
predicted she'd have no mental function: With a huge grin, she
promptly responds when her mom, in English or Spanish, asks her to
blow a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   HPE affects an estimated one in 10,000 live births and is
believed responsible for thousands more miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   Severe HPE can kill quickly, while some mildly affected children
may live largely normal lives. Moderate HPE, in turn, causes
varying disabilities: problems moving, seizures, inability to speak
or eat solid foods, facial defects.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists can help, yet parent after parent tells of doctors
who dismissed them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a huge amount of ignorance out there in the physician
community,'' said Dr. Hal Urschel III, who knew little about HPE
until his son Chance was born with it.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the hunt for care, his family's Don and Linda
Carter Foundation recruited specialists and established HPE centers
at Krieger, Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children in Dallas,
Stanford University, Rutgers University, and the Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The centers provide HPE exams, enroll patients in treatment
studies, and guide families to medical information and resources
for equipment like wheelchairs. Many services are free to families;
check http://www.stanford.edu/group/hpe for information.
</P>
<P>
   What these scientists learn about HPE could open new insight
into numerous other brain disorders, such as cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows what causes HPE. Mothers with diabetes or
abnormally low cholesterol levels seem at higher risk of having an
HPE baby. Occasionally is it inherited. Various drugs or chemicals
are suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can't rebuild a malformed brain. Still, ''we've seen a
lot of progress,'' said Nancy Clegg of Texas Scottish Rite,
describing drugs that ease some movement problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now cutting-edge brain tests promise to determine why one child
fares so much worse than another, and what cognitive function
patients who can't move or speak actually have.
</P>
<P>
   How? Rutgers scientists measure IQ by tracking a child's eye
gaze. Another test measures fleeting electrical impulses to
pinpoint which brain regions function best. Figure that out and
scientists might one day push those regions to work better, said
neuroscientist April Benasich.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing mental function is Step 1, says Urschel, who, after
discovering 4-year-old Chance has a normal IQ, outfitted him with a
prototype eye-tracking system to try communicating via computer.
''The progress is what we're all looking for.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Connecticut ranks last in reporting rate  </HEADLINE>
sdhfcdtfonrhfon
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut hospitals rank last in the
nation in the number of incidents per thousand doctors that the
state reports to a national database of problem physicians, The
Hartford Courant reported.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the newspaper said its analysis found that 60
percent of U.S. hospitals have never reported a doctor to the
National Practitioner Data Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The database, which is closed to the public, lists disciplinary
actions, practice restrictions and malpractice payments totaling
$25 billion affecting one out of six doctors in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner, a lawyer representing several hospitals in the
state, said the low reporting rate is due to the high quality of
doctors in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Connecticut hospitals are almost all nonprofit; we're up here
in the Northeast, where the education pool is so strong. I honestly
don't think we get the same kind of problems other places get,'' he
told The Courant.
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper highlighted two cases it said raised questions
about the reporting of problem doctors to the database.
</P>
<P>
   The Courant, using a version of the database with much
identifying information removed, matched those records with court
documents, regulatory files and other sources to identify the
doctors in question.
</P>
<P>
   In one, Dr. Syed Jamal left a three-year cardiac residency
program at Hartford Hospital after one year when senior doctors
questioned his skills.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo which came to light after Jamal sued for wrongful
termination, cardiology chief Dr. David Waters said colleagues
found Jamal ''not effective in emergency situations and looking
after common cardiovascular problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not feel that Dr. Jamal has the skills necessary to
become a good cardiologist and that it would be in his best
interest to find some other type of medicine to practice,'' Waters
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But because there was no disciplinary action against Jamal, the
hospital made no report to the national database. Moreover,
reporting of actions against doctors in training is voluntary, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal ''disagreed violently'' with the conclusion, Waters said.
His wrongful termination case was settled out of court and he has
apparently left the country, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the newspaper said obstetrician Dr. Brian
Hennessey left Bristol Hospital in 1993 after a difficult
childbirth case which is now the subject of a malpractice lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Courant said it could find no record that Hennessey's
decision to voluntarily relinquish his privileges at the hospital
was reported to the database.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessey, who did not respond to requests for comment from the
newspaper before the story was published, said in a telephone
interview Monday with The Associated Press that his decision to
leave the hospital stemmed from plans to return to his native
Canada and had nothing to do with the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had put money on a home in Nova Scotia and was
planning to practice medicine there when he left Bristol Hospital.
The move later fell through.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Pat Caputo, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said she could
not discuss details of the case but said the facility strongly
disputes any suggestion that it has ever failed to meet the
reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessey said his 33-year medical record is unblemished except
for the malpractice case involving the birth of Nicholas Caswell.
He said Caswell's mother, Judy Caswell, continued as a patient for
two years after the birth and only filed suit after Hennessey's
ex-wife called her and claimed he had been drinking before the
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said his ex-wife was bitter because her alimony
payments had been cut.
</P>
<P>
   State medical regulators reviewed the allegations but found them
unsubstantiated. Hennessey called the review process rigorous.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy to impress them that you're innocent,'' he said.
''And I proved to them that I was not at fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The malpractice case is still pending.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani's Wife Delays Performance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Donna Hanover, the wife of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, said Monday she's postponing her performance in the
sexually suggestive off-Broadway play ''The Vagina Monologues'' due
to family circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who is running for the Senate against Hillary Rodham
Clinton, announced Thursday he has early stage prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover didn't mention her husband by name. She issued a terse
statement that said: ''Due to personal family circumstances, I have
decided to postpone my performance in 'The Vagina Monologues.'''
</P>
<P>
   The play, written by Eve Ensler, consists of monologues
delivered by three different actresses and includes discussion of
orgasms, pelvic exams, sexual abuse, sexual fantasies and
childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover was scheduled to appear from May 30 through June 11 with
Kirstie Alley and Hazelle Goodman. There was no immediate word on
who would replace her, but producer David Stone said, ''We look
forward to having her rejoin the show at a future date.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover has appeared in films including ''The People vs. Larry
Flynt'' and on TV soap operas such as ''One Life to Live'' and
''All My Children.'' She also is the host of a program on the Food
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani refuses to discuss his relationship with Hanover
despite reports that their 16-year marriage is strained. Hanover
issued a statement of support last week after her husband's cancer
announcement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Create War Reparation Fund  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce announced Monday the creation of a fund to
solicit donations from American corporations to compensate victims
of Nazi forced labor during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the chamber nor the administration could say how much
American companies might contribute, although Deputy Treasury
Secretary Stuart Eizenstat said ''we certainly hope they will be as
generous as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Johnstone, the chamber's senior vice president for
international affairs, said the project is the result of requests
from a number of member companies who were ''interested in doing
this if the funds go to the victims and not into the pockets'' of
trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber, which represents more than 3 million businesses
worldwide, was approached by the administration and some major U.S.
corporations that have been threatened with lawsuits by survivors
and their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Several large American corporations, including Ford and General
Motors, have acknowledged that their German subsidiaries benefited
from slave labor after operations were taken over by the German
government during the war.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to compensation for victims of Nazi oppression,
Johnstone said the fund will allow companies to pool resources to
respond to many humanitarian challenges around the world, including
disaster relief following hurricanes and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   In December, U.S. and German negotiators, at the behest of
President Clinton and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
announced a deal to establish a $5.2 billion German fund to
compensate hundreds of thousands of people forced to work for the
Nazis and German companies during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Under that agreement, German companies would pay roughly half
the restitution and the German government would make up most of the
rest. American firms that had German subsidiaries during the war
have said they would contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said estimates put the number of slaves and forced
laborers who worked in German factories and farms at 12 million,
with 1 million still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation worked out by the German government and
companies would amount to payments of $7,500 for slave laborers and
$2,500 for forced laborers.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are dignified payments but hardly matching the suffering
they endured,'' Eizenstat said. He called the offer by American
companies to supplement these resources a ''generous gesture'' that
would ''show compassion to a highly visible group of elderly
people.''
</P>
<P>
   New York attorney Melvyn Weiss, who represents some victims,
said that good-faith contributions to the fund might help avert a
class-action lawsuit against at least 50 and perhaps as many as 200
U.S. companies, including Kodak and Exxon-Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the humanitarian aid fund on Monday came at
a chamber-sponsored forum, ''Charting the Way Forward in an Era of
Globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat told the business representatives that more needed to
be done to respond to anti-globilization protesters who showed up
in force last fall in Seattle and last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people, especially young people and workers, have the
view that impersonal forces and unfamiliar international
institutions are endangering their jobs and the environment,''
Eizenstat said.

<HEADLINE> BUCKLED UP: No special enforcement on first day of new seat beltlaw  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The ticket books have been updated, but New
Jersey State Police didn't plan checkpoints or any other special
enforcement Monday, the first day of a new seat belt law.
</P>
<P>
   Now officers across the state can pull over motorists for not
wearing a seat belt and write them a $42 ticket. The new law
replaces one that allowed cops to issue summonses only if they had
pulled the car over for another reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law is on the books, and how it is enforced is up to each
department's discretion,'' said Jeff Lamm, a spokesman for the
state's Division of Highway Traffic Safety.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, the legal mandate for drivers and
front-seat passengers to buckle up could only be enforced by police
as a ''secondary'' offense.'' The tab for violating that law was
$20 and it carried no additional points or surcharges from the
Division of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But the new law offered by a Burlington County lawmaker makes
not wearing a seat belt a ''primary'' offense.
</P>
<P>
   And the new price tag for offenders is $42, said John Hagerty, a
spokesman for the state police.
</P>
<P>
   All of the troopers patrolling the state's roadways Monday were
aware of the new law, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their summons books have been updated to reflect the change.
They know it's another law on the books that they can enforce,''
Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   State police were not tallying how many cars were stopped and
their drivers cited under the new law, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at it as yet another motor vehicle statute.
Enforcement will be out there,'' Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   But the troopers ''are not going to target any particular
place'' or plan any specific enforcement, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamm said the highway safety division also had no plans to
collect data on the new law's first day.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, sponsored the bill,
saying the change also will benefit children, who are the most
vulnerable to injury in automobile accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the law will also reduce fatal highway accidents and
severe injuries, said Conaway, who is also a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The Seat Belt Safety Coalition of New Jersey has said the
state's 62 percent compliance rate for seat belt use in the state
falls below the national average of 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA New Jersey Automobile Club reports that 60 percent of
children killed in automobile accidents weren't wearing seat belts.
The safety coalition predicts the greater enforcement will save up
to 50 lives and prevent nearly 2,900 serious injuries per year.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association
opposed the change, arguing that it would be difficult to enforce
and that the number of traffic deaths on New Jersey roads reached a
20-year low in 1999.

<HEADLINE> New Cancer Treatment May Pose Danger  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A compound that seemed like a promising new
weapon in the battle against cancer may face a clouded future
following the discovery that -- at least in the lab -- it kills human
liver cells.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, called TRAIL, has been under investigation for use
against many types of cancer because it causes cancerous cells to
die. It had proven safe in mice and non-human primates and human
tests were on the near horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But a team of researchers led by Stephen C. Strom of the
University of Pittsburgh discovered that human liver cells exposed
to the compound in lab tests were killed. Their findings are being
public in the May issue of the journal Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The drug firms Immunex and Genentech have been working together
on the development of TRAIL. Officials there said they were forging
ahead with the development while also working with Strom, who has
advised them of his findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are certainly not dismissing Dr. Strom's findings. In fact,
quite to the contrary, we are working closely with him,'' said Doug
Williams, chief technology officer at Immunex.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said there are questions about whether the molecule
used in Strom's tests is exactly the same as the type developed by
Immunex and Genentech and also whether its effect in a working
liver would be the same as in liver cells in a lab test.
</P>
<P>
   He said the companies ''are carrying out the requisite
preclinical and toxicology studies'' and have not yet filed an
application for human trials with the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stan Lipkowitz of the medicine branch of the National Cancer
Institute said Strom's finding is ''a very important piece of
work'' because previous studies have not shown any toxic effects
from TRAIL.
</P>
<P>
   But Lipkowitz, who is not connected with either Strom or the
drug firms, also suggested that the version of the drug used in the
Pittsburgh tests may differ from that under development by the drug
companies and thus may act differently.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Glenn D. Rosen of Stanford University was surprised by
Strom's finding. He suggested that processed cells like those used
in the lab may be sensitized and thus be more likely to react to
TRAIL than cells combined in a liver.
</P>
<P>
   Strom, a professor of pathology, said he made the finding while
studying whether chemicals like TRAIL, that can cause cells to
commit suicide, have any involvement in diseases such as hepatitis
and cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
   He tested human liver cells infected with hepatitis to see if
they were sensitive to the drug. When the cells were exposed to
TRAIL, they died.
</P>
<P>
   So Strom and his team did a control experiment using healthy
human liver cells. ''To our surprise, it killed the cells. We
repeated it many times and it killed the cells every time,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've shown that differences in the sensitivity of various
species to the same compound can prove critical. Significant
toxicity could result if TRAIL were used in human cancer therapy,''
Strom said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We became worried so we got (the report) out as soon as we
could,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   TRAIL stands for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, a
chemical that interrupts the normal life cycle of a cell causing it
to commit a form of suicide known as apoptosis.
</P>
<P>
   TRAIL had been considered a promising alternative to TNF -- tumor
necrosis factor -- a close molecular cousin prized for its ability
to boost anti-cancer immunity but impractical to use in the clinic
because it causes septic shock and liver failure.

<HEADLINE> Free Voice Mail Service Offered  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- From the people who introduced free computers
and free Web access for those who don't mind some extra ads, now
comes free voice mail for a home or business phone with the same
tradeoff.
</P>
<P>
   EVoice, which is being rolled out nationwide on Tuesday, joins a
crowded field of ''unified messaging services'' that can direct
phone calls, e-mail and faxes to a single in-box. Users pick up
messages by dialing in with a phone or logging on to a Web site,
where voice mail is delivered as an e-mail with an audio
attachment.
</P>
<P>
   The new service from eVoice distinguishes itself on the voice
mail side as the first that doesn't requireusers to give out a
separate phone number for would-be callers to leave a message.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, calls to an eVoice user's existing phone number that go
unanswered are forwarded directly to voice mail. Local phone
companies typically sell that service for $8 a month to consumers
and more than $10 a month for business lines.
</P>
<P>
   Users also save money because eVoice and rivals such as
Onebox.com and uReach.com provide a toll-free number to pick up
messages, while most phone companies charge for a local call.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that each time eVoice users call in for their
messages, they'll first hear a single advertisement lasting between
five and 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   If the ad-based strategy sounds familiar, it's worth noting that
one of eVoice's backers is idealab!, the same company that helped
launch NetZero, the free Internet service with 3 million users, and
Free-PC.com, an ill-fated venture that provided a free desktop
computer and Internet link.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, users agreed to let NetZero and FreePC commandeer
a small portion of their computer screens to show a stream of ads
whenever they were online.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a strong start, it remains to be seen whether NetZero
can live by ads alone. A recent investment by Qualcomm, a wireless
technology company that sees value in NetZero's established user
base, suggests that ad revenues may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC, meanwhile, was acquired in January by the computer
maker eMachines, which pulled the plug on the freebies.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's obvious that most people would rather avoid ads
altogether, eVoice may prove less intrusive because the ads aren't
continuous, analysts said. And on the flip side, eVoice may be a
more effective marketing venue because the audience consists of
people who are already listening closely to hear their voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing ads while listening to voice mail is new. You get a
very focused, captive audience, so it's opening up a new, premium
advertising opportunity,'' said Mark Plakias, an industry analyst
for The Kelsey Group, a consulting firm based in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''Consumers do not have a lot of experience
listening to advertisements over the phone, so one of the key
things to watch for is whether there is fatigue over time with
listening to audio ads.'' And while consumers may see the ads as a
worthy tradeoff for free service, ''We think there are equally
important segments of the market who prize time over saving money,
and will pay for an advertising-free solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, borrowing another page from the Internet playbook,
eVoice plans to offer a no-ads option for a few dollars a month, as
well as other add-on services like news updates, generating fees
that would lighten the company's dependence on ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''With free services, advertising just serves as a means to
recoup some of costs. The real value is to acquire customerswho you
can use to bring in other partners (selling other services) to
generate additional revenues,'' said John Cha, an industry analyst
at Frost and Sullivan in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Also, despite the cost of providing toll-free service, which has
dropped considerably in recent years, eVoice hopes its users will
call several times a day to generate more ad revenues.

<HEADLINE> Pulitzer Deals on Post-Dispatch  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pulitzer Inc. is buying out most of a longtime
partner's interest in its flagship newspaper, the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, in a deal announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Herald Co. had shared in 50 percent of the newspaper's
profits and capital expenses in an agreement dating to 1961. The
Herald Co., a subsidiary of Newhouse family-controlled Advance
Publications Inc., agreed to reduce that share to 5 percent in
exchange for $306 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for Pulitzer to complete the buyout no
later than 2015.
</P>
<P>
   ''This transaction has special meaning to me, because the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch was the first newspaper owned by my
grandfather, Joseph Pulitzer,'' Pulitzer chairman Michael E.
Pulitzer said. ''I am pleased that we are making this additional
investment in the St. Louis community.''
</P>
<P>
   The original arrangement was tied to a joint operating agreement
involving the Post-Dispatch and the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
Pulitzer managed the business operations of both papers until 1984,
when the Newhouse family sold the Globe-Democrat. The
Globe-Democrat ceased publication two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new joint venture arrangement is important because it
aligns our responsibility for operations more closely with the
results we achieve,'' said Robert C. Woodworth, president and chief
executive of Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Advance president Donald E. Newhouse said the company's passive
investment in the Post-Dispatch was unique among its newspaper
properties. Advance publishes daily newspapers in 22 cities along
with magazines and other publications.
</P>
<P>
   ''When our partners at Pulitzer indicated their desire to create
a joint venture which would more appropriately reflect their
continuing operating responsibility for the paper, we agreed that
these unique circumstances fully justified the new arrangement,''
Newhouse said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to dilute Pulitzer's earnings 6 percent to
8 percent for the first 12 months, and to become earnings neutral
in the fourth year, Pulitzer officials said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Scottish Officials Ready for Trail  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- More than 11 years after the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, victims' families were heading toward
a former U.S. Air Force base Monday to witness the trial of two
Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish court authorities said they were trying to keep the
trial as routine as possible, despite high emotions, hundreds of
reporters and unprecedented security.
</P>
<P>
   The old base, converted into an $18 million high-security
courtroom and detention center, was ringed by police and prison
staff for the start of hearings on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are charged
with murder, conspiracy to murder and endangering the safety of an
aircraft in the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988.
More than 270 people, 189 of them Americans, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of victims' relatives were expected to arrive in
Amsterdam early Tuesday and make the 40-mile drive to Camp Zeist,
where they will be housed in a nearby hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives will be given priority seating in the courtroom's
public gallery, behind bullet proof glass.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Swire, a spokesman for British relatives, arrived in the
Netherlands last week, eager to see the trial finally begin. ''It's
been a ghastly 11{ years. We expect the fairest obtainable verdict
as to whether these two individuals are guilty or innocent,'' he
told Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the court will hold sessions almost daily through
July 28 before adjourning until Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   John Grant, of Glasgow University School of Law, said the
prosecution apparently intends to work backward, first establishing
murder was committed before trying to prove the culpability of the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a murder trial, after all,'' he said. ''First they have
to prove that there has been a murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The early witnesses will include British aviation experts, as
well as police and investigators who sifted through the debris of
the exploded jetliner after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was expected to cost about $3 million a month, mostly
paid by Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have alleged that other terrorist organizations
operating in Europe at the time were responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The two defendants were visited Monday by Libya's ambassador in
their detention block -- an area surrounded by high concrete walls
and bales of barbed wire, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the defendants were being treated like any suspect
held in pretrial custody in a Scottish jail. They receive visits
from relatives and friends and meet each other and with staff
members each day.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements were made to provide food that meets Islamic
dietary guidelines. They were given prayer mats, and an arrow was
painted on the floor pointing to the holy city of Mecca for them to
direct their prayers. They also have satellite television links
that receive several Arabic-language channels, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Police Headquarters Attacked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Mortar shells exploded near Iran's national
police headquarters in central Tehran on Monday night, wounding six
people, witnesses and state-run Tehran radio said.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's state television said three mortars exploded near a
sports complex in Tehran's Vanak Square.
</P>
<P>
   But sources in the area said several mortars had landed at the
headquarters of the national police forces. Other mortar shells hit
a nearby Armenian club and in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces surrounded the area around the police
headquarters soon after the attack, the sources said, speaking on
condition they not be named.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran radio said six people were wounded, one critically.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel Mujahedeen Khalq group claimed responsibility for the
attack in a call to The Associated Press in Cairo. Spokesman Farid
Soleimani said the police, known as the State Security Forces, were
the intended target.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several military units of the Mujahedeen pounded with mortars
the command headquarters of the State Security Forces,'' Soleimani
said in a call from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Soleimani said the attack was carried out ''in solidarity with
student protests nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Students have been demonstrating against the closure of 16
reformist publications by the Press Court, which is dominated by
hard-liners opposed to President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   State television did not say who was responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi-based Mujahedeen has claimed responsibility for a
number of mortar attacks in recent months in which several people
have been killed or injured.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Stone Woman for Adultery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's hard-line Taliban
religious rulers stoned a woman to death in northern Afghanistan on
Monday after she was found guilty of committing adultery.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, identified only as Suriya by Taliban-run Radio
Shariat, was said to have confessed to adultery, a capital offense
in this war-ravaged nation. The radio did not say what happened to
the man involved. He was identified as Abdul Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   The stoning was carried out at a sports stadium in
Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan before a crowd of several
thousand spectators, according to the radio report.
</P>
<P>
   In the 90 percent of Afghanistan that it rules, the Taliban
religious army has imposed a harsh brand of Islamic law.
Punishments are harsh and public.
</P>
<P>
   The last execution of a woman in Taliban territory was last
November, when a woman was shot three times by a Taliban soldier
after she was found guilty of killing her abusive husband with an
ax. She was the mother of seven children.

<HEADLINE> Media Bias Charged in Hate Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Outside the courthouse where two black
men charged in the beating death of a disabled white man are to go
on trial this month, David Duke accused the media Monday of not
saying enough about black-on-white hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to call attention to the massive epidemic of hate
crimes being committed against white Americans across the United
States and to expose the lack of coverage that exists on this issue
in both America and locally,'' said Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan
leader in Louisiana and president of the National Organization of
European American Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which was scheduled to start Monday, was delayed
until May 22 because of problems with a witness.
</P>
<P>
   The two defendants and three other men are charged with
second-degree murder, with a hate crime enhancement, in the Aug. 13
beating and stomping of Gregory Griffith, 50. Griffith, who was
mentally disabled, died 13 days later from blunt head trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Police said one of the defendants told them the group planned to
attack the first white man who walked down the street.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Ledell Lawrence, 21, and Terrence McCray, 19, face
up to life in prison. Three other men, Marvin Jones, Mario Leathers
and LaFreddy Manns, will be tried later.

<HEADLINE> Albright Defends AIDS Position  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
suggested Monday that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was ''stuck
in the past'' in not recognizing AIDS as a threat to national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very important for people to understand what are the
threats to national security,'' Albright said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, a Mississippi Republican, said Sunday the administration's
declaration that the disease was a threat ''is just the president
trying to make an appeal to, you know, certain groups.''
</P>
<P>
   This came as hundreds of thousands of gay and lesbian rights
supporters marched in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't view (AIDS) as a national security threat, not to our
national security interests, no,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that with millions of people succumbing to the
disease ''AIDS is a national security issue.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the administration was asking for another $100 million
next year for prevention education programs and ''it is very
important for all those in leadership positions to understand what
the new threats to our societies are in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she included Lott, Albright said ''if the shoe
fits...''

<HEADLINE> Minorities complain about use of scanner on state property  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Black and Hispanic legislators were angry
Monday that a bone-density scanner being used to screen women for
osteoporosis in the state Capitol complex was not useful for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Assembly members staged an impromptu protest by
posting signs stating ''White women only'' around Bellevue Woman's
Hospital's booth at a health fair.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Matthews, a state worker from Albany who is black, was
among those upset by the test.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't understand why you would bring a machine for white
women only to a public place where there are multiple races. That's
very insulting,'' she said. ''It's like we're back in the '40s and
'50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Fidler, who was conducting the tests, said the genetic data
in the machine only applied to white women and she could not verify
the accuracy if the test was performed on nonwhite women. Fidler
agreed to pack up her machine and leave after state Assemblyman
Keith Wright, chairman of the state Black, Puerto Rican and
Hispanic Legislative Caucus, told her it shouldn't be used on
public property.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of white women who had been waiting in line for the
test dispersed. One got into a brief shouting match with
Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr. of the Bronx, claiming that he was being
selfish for wanting to deny the test to white women. He told her
she was the selfish one. However, the woman quickly reconciled, and
even hugged, other protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Ten million Americans have osteoporosis, a disease characterized
by deterioration of the bone that can lead to fragility and an
increased risk of fractures, according to the National Osteoporosis
Foundation. The disease is blamed for 700,000 vertebral fractures
annually.
</P>
<P>
   An X-ray machine that can scan nonwhite woman was too large and
expensive to bring to the fair, said Carole Salluzzo, spokeswoman
for Bellevue, located in Niskayuna about 10 miles west of Albany.
She said that heel testing machines like the one at the fair are
not marketed with databases that apply to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we were trying to do by having the density (testing
machine) there was just screen the most at-risk population which
are white women unfortunately,'' she said. ''The largest percentage
that have low bone mass are sadly white women. Women of color have
stronger bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the last few years, medical literature has been virtually
devoid of information about bone density in minority women, a
researcher at University of Connecticut's Center on Aging has said.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, conventional wisdom was that black women did
not get osteoporosis because they seemed to achieve a genetically
higher peak bone mass. The disease is much more prevalent in white
and Hispanic women.
</P>
<P>
   But a University of Connecticut study that performed bone
density scans on 100 black volunteers older than 65 found that
one-third of the women had osteoporosis or experienced enough bone
loss to put them at risk.

<HEADLINE> 'Ten Commandments Judge' Leads Race  </HEADLINE>
By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GADSDEN, Ala. (AP) -- A small-town judge who gained a national
following by hanging a plaque of the Ten Commandments in his
courtroom is the front-runner in a four-way Republican race for
Alabama Supreme Court chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel I have a responsibility to take what I have learned to
higher office,'' said Circuit Judge Roy Moore, who in 1995 took on
the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged his display of
the Old Testament laws at the Etowah County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 53, argues that American law is based on nature's laws,
''and nature is God.'' In Moore's view, that means God cannot
legally be removed from public life, whether it's prayer in public
school or a religious symbol in his courtroom. Years of court
rulings to the contrary are wrong, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The state's GOP power structure has lined up behind one of
Moore's pro-business opponents, Justice Harold See. But a poll
released last week showed that Moore is leading among likely GOP
voters in this Bible Belt state.
</P>
<P>
   A survey April 10-17 of 265 registered voters who are likely to
participate in the June 6 GOP primary showed nearly 38 percent
backing Moore, followed by 14 percent for Jefferson County Circuit
Judge Wayne Thorn, 10 percent for See and about 8 percent for
Criminal Appeals Judge Pam Baschab. More than 29 percent of the
voters were undecided. The poll margin of error is plus or minus 6
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Gerald Johnson said Moore's big lead reflects the fact
people have been hearing his name associated with the Ten
Commandments for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a general election, that identification might hurt,'' said
Johnson, who conducted the poll for the Alabama Education
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama is one of eight states that picks judges through
partisan elections, according to a 1998 American Bar Association
report. It said 13 other states pick judges in nonpartisan
elections, while the rest select jurists through nominating
commissions, appointments without nominating panels, or a
combination of methods.
</P>
<P>
   The only Democratic candidate for chief justice is Civil Appeals
Court Judge Sharon Yates. It is uncertan how Yates would fare
against Moore or another Republican nominee in a state where the
GOP holds most statewide posts but lost the governor's office to a
Democrat in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A West Point graduate who served in Vietnam, Moore was known to
few outside Gadsden until civil libertarians challenged his right
to display a handmade plaque of the Ten Commandments in court. The
fight made Moore a hero to conservatives, who flew him all over the
country to make speeches.
</P>
<P>
   A rally for the judge drew a throng to Alabama's Capitol in
1997, and his poetry decrying abortion, homosexuality and what he
sees as American moral decay is posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When the Alabama Supreme Court dismissed the battle over the Ten
Commandments on technical grounds, Moore was able to keep
displaying the plaque in his courtroom, where it remains today. He
was also cleared of wrongdoing by judicial investigators who looked
into a fund started by a supporter to pay Moore's legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   The decision helped clear the way for him to run for chief
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Moore earned his law degree from the University of Alabama. He
was a prosecutor and a lawyer in private practice before being
appointed circuit judge in 1992 by then-Gov. Guy Hunt. He was
elected to a six-year term in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Despite leading in polls, Moore trails See badly in
fund-raising. With only $18,341 in the bank to $366,885 for See.
Lacking money for TV commercials, Moore has spread his message by
holding in-home gatherings with supporters, meeting with GOP groups
and speaking from church pulpits.

   Dow Ends Up 77; Nasdaq Up 97
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors brushed off worries about Microsoft's
future today, sending its shares higher and fueling a rally in
technology stocks that spread to the broad market. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 77.87 to close at 10,811.78. The Nasdaq
composite index rose 97.83 to 3,958.49. Broader stock indicators
were also higher. The proposal by the Justice Department and 17
states to split Microsoft into two companies was widely expected,
and many investors determined that the possibility of a breakup had
already taken its toll on Microsoft stock. It was at 73 7/16, up 3
11/16. Before today's session, Microsoft's share price had declined
by about 40 percent since the start of the year. Technology
companies that compete with Microsoft were mostly higher. Red Hat
and VA Linux, which sell the Linux operating system, both rose.

   ABC Off From 7 Time Warner Systems
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an escalating corporate dispute, ABC was
blacked out in the homes of 3.5 million Time Warner cable customers
around the country today -- just as the ratings ''sweeps'' period
was beginning and Regis Philbin was about to quiz celebrities on
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' The only way many viewers could
see ABC shows was by disconnecting the cable and rigging up an
antenna. The Walt Disney Co., ABC's corporate parent, is fighting
over how much money Time Warner must pay Disney for the right to
carry some of its cable channels. The affected customers were in
seven markets served by ABC-owned television stations. About 1.5
million were in the New York City area, 665,000 in Houston and
440,000 in Raleigh-Durham, N.C.

   Manufacturing, Construction Rise

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector grew in April,
though at a slightly slower pace than the month before. The
increase in prices for raw materials also moderated. Yet the
figures from the National Association of Purchasing Management --
along with a separate government report of a surprising rise in
construction spending in March -- indicate such a strong economy
that Federal Reserve policy-makers may feel compelled to raise
interest rates more aggressively when they meet later this month,
economists said. Several analysts predicted a one-half percentage
point hike in short-term rates at the meeting May 16.

other companies: Avista Corp. of Spokane, Montana Power Co. in
Butte, Mont., Portland (Ore.) General Electric Co, and two
Nevada-based companies owned by Sierra Pacific Resources of Reno,
Nev. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the venture

   Companies Can Dictate Time Off

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public employees who agree to take extra time
off instead of collecting overtime pay can be forced to use the
time off at their employer's convenience, the Supreme Court ruled
today. The justices, voting 6-3 in a case from Houston, said
governmental employers have the authority to control when such
time-off credits are used if no pre-existing labor agreement says
otherwise. The decision is a setback for 127 sheriff's deputies in
Harris County, Texas, and the AFL-CIO, which had supported their
legal argument.

<HEADLINE> Search Reopens For U. of Fla. Head  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The search for a new University of
Florida president is starting over again because the last two
candidates pulled out Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Adam Herbert told a search committee for the state's
flagship university in Gainesville that Auburn University President
William Muse had withdrawn. Muse said he felt his time and talents
could be better used at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, James Catanese, president of Florida Atlantic
University, said he had been asked by students, staff members,
community leaders and university benefactors to stay on at the
school in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   Six candidates were recommended to the search committee by a
consulting firm, but Herbert said some of them were discouraged by
a faculty group resolution that called all the candidates
unqualified.
</P>
<P>
   He also said some wanted to avoid having their backgrounds made

<HEADLINE> Testimony to begin Tuesday in boy's slaying  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- The allegation led to outrage and
changes in the state's witness protection laws: an 8-year-old may
have been shot to death to prevent his testimony in a murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen
Clarke, were found in their home on Jan. 8, 1999. Police said they
were killed the night before as they returned home from grocery
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the first of two brothers charged in the killings is
scheduled to go on trial. Russell Peeler, 28, is accused of
planning the murders to silence B.J., who was scheduled to testify
against him in the 1998 killing of Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph
Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's brother, Adrian, who is accused of being the actual
gunman, will be tried later. Both brothers face the possibility of
the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last about four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors plan to call up to 80 witnesses, including a woman
who claimed to be an eyewitness to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Lee, who lived across the street from Clarke and her
son, originally told police that she heard the two brothers
planning the killings, then acted as a lookout for Adrian Peeler
and watched as he killed the mother and son.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee appeared to recant what she told police in a letter she
wrote to her lawyer in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that I have told them (police) is lies,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, she wrote three separate letters to
Bridgeport police officers in which she apologized for her role in
the killings and said she was grateful that the Peelers didn't kill
her.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers say they will use Lee's letter to try to
discredit her with the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that I can say without question that she was not
there. She didn't see anything that happened, and none of her
testimony is consistent with the forensic evidence that's known in
the case,'' said defense attorney John Walkley.
</P>
<P>
   Lee pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and agreed to
testify against the brothers in exchange for a maximum sentence of
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict said during a
pretrial hearing last week that Lee's letter is nothing more than
''cold feet'' from a woman who has a terminal illness and wants a
shorter sentence so she doesn't die in prison. Benedict said Lee
plans to testify to her original story.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors would not comment on their case against Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're prepared to present all of the evidence of this horrific
crime and leave it in the hands of a fair-minded jury,'' said
Assistant State's Attorney Joseph T. Corradino.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers plan to call about 15 to 20 witnesses. Walkley
said no decision has been made yet on whether Peeler will take the
stand in his own defense.
</P>
<P>
   The defense will try to show the jury that the crimes could have
been committed by someone else by pointing out that Snead -- like
Peeler -- was a drug dealer and had dangerous associates.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler was subsequently convicted of killing Snead and
is now serving a 105-year sentence. He was also convicted of
running a drug operation in Bridgeport and received a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Walkley said Monday that the defense plans to ask Judge G.
Sarsfield Ford to delay the start of testimony Tuesday by at least
a couple of weeks because of discovery material turned over by
prosecutors this weekend. Walkley would not elaborate on the
material, except to say that some of it involved Lee's testimony.
Ford has rejected several earlier requests for continuances by the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   After the killings, the state Legislature stiffened the penalty
for intimidating a witness and ordered the chief state's attorney
to offer protection to witnesses who want it. The program, named
after B.J. and his mother, also allows the state to take custody of
child witnesses if their parents fail to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport police say they initially placed special patrols
outside Clarke's home, but called them off after a few days because
Clarke said she found the police presence intrusive.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Prison Sweep Nets Arsenal  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- After a bloody inmate riot, security
forces conducted a sweep through a high-security prison,
confiscating two AK-47 assault rifles, as well as pistols and
explosives, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day search by 2,000 heavily armed soldiers and police
at Modelo prison also uncovered moonshine distilleries,
sophisticated communications equipment and even attack dogs,
national police chief Rosso Jose Serrano said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities mounted the raid, the first comprehensive sweep of
the Bogota prison in 15 years, after a battle between rival inmate
groups on Thursday that claimed 26 lives and left 16 inmates
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a center of crime, extortion, kidnapping,
prostitution -- even satanic sects,'' Serrano told reporters at a
news conference at which the confiscated weapons were displayed.
Along with the AK-47s., 26 pistols, 11 pounds of plastic
explosives, eight hand grenades and 5,000 rounds of ammunition were
also found.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption among guards has made it easy for prisoners to
smuggle weapons into Colombia's perilous, overcrowded prisons,
which have become increasingly unruly in recent years. In most
lockups, inmate subgroups virtually control separate cellblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Criminals have used Colombia's prisons to organize extortion and
kidnapping rings and other rackets, something President Andres
Pastrana's government has vowed to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,000 inmates are jammed into Modelo prison, which was
built for 1,900 inmates and is divided into dominions controlled by
right-wing paramilitaries and common criminals -- the combatants in
last week's bloodletting -- as well as by leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana declared a prisons emergency in February, authorities
have suspended 110 prison guards. Since 1997, nearly 500 inmates
have been killed and more than twice that number have escaped.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Soars; Grain, Soybeans Rise  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prices for corn and soybeans rocketed 5 percent higher Monday on
new dry-weather forecasts that heightened worries the nation's top
two crops will experience off years due to a worsening drought.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, natural gas futures rose to a six-month high
and coffee soared.
</P>
<P>
   Dryness concerns sent soybean futures to a 17-month high on the
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn rose the maximum allowed under
the exchange-imposed trading limit.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers said a potent combination of weather-related
developments powered the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts for weekend rains in the Midwest, which sent prices
sinking last Thursday and Friday, didn't pan out as expected. A
nationally televised farm show on Saturday predicted very dry, warm
weather for all of May. And earlier calls for rain next weekend
evaporated in revised forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   All those factors helped spur the unlikely event of a wild
drought rally by traders who came to work carrying umbrellas on a
rainy Chicago day.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of crop volatility we haven't seen for a long
time,'' said Tim Hannagan, grains analyst for Alaron Trading Corp.
in Chicago. ''But I think it's going to get worse. With all the
talk of the long term being hot and dry and carryover stocks being
down, we've got a lot ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem of abnormally dry soil conditions is exacerbated
because crop planting is way ahead of schedule due to the mild
weather. A U.S. Department of Agriculture report released after
markets closed showed 49 percent of the nation's corn crop planted
as of Sunday, compared with the historical average of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans also have been planted at more than twice the usual
pace -- 8 percent, compared with the past average of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dry May weather means crops will emerge poorly and develop weak
root systems, causing shortcomings that even late-spring rains
wouldn't be able to offset.
</P>
<P>
   Corn for July delivery rose the limit 12 cents to $2.44 a
bushel, while July soybeans rose 28{ cents to $5.67} a bushel.
Wheat prices were buoyed by the rally despite favorable crop
conditions in the winter wheat belt; July wheat rose 10 cents to
$2.64} a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas prices flowed sharply higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange amid shrinking production and dwindling storage
levels. U.S. production declined nearly 3 percent in the first
quarter of 2000, according to an industry survey, while storage is
down 25 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of summer cooling season, those data have
investors nervous.
</P>
<P>
   June natural gas rose 7.5 cents to $3.216 per 1,000 cubic feet
after reaching a six-month high of $3.235 -- the highest for a
front-month contract since Oct. 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee prices jumped amid speculation that major producers who
meet next week in London are making progress toward adoption of a
retention plan which, as OPEC did in the oil market, would withhold
supplies to drive world prices up.
</P>
<P>
   July coffee settled up 5.55 cents at $1.031 a pound after
reaching $1.038 on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Numico To Buy Rexall Sundown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The Dutch specialty foods company
Royal Numico NV is buying Rexall Sundown Inc., a U.S.-based maker
of nutritional supplements and consumer health products, for about
$1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   News of the deal disclosed Monday drove Rexall Sundown's shares
up by 21 percent in midday New York trading.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall, based in Boca Raton, Fla. will give Numico a strong
position in the fast-growing American food supplements market, the
Dutch group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will have combined annual sales of more than
$4.5 billion. Numico expects the merger will enable it to save
$22.8 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Numico plans to finance the deal -- already approved by Rexall's
management -- by issuing new shares and bonds and by refinancing
existing loans, according to a company statement.
</P>
<P>
   Numico is offering $24 per share in cash for Rexall Sundown's
shares. It will also assume $114 million in debt, boosting the
total value of the deal to $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall Sundown shares rose $4.18}, or nearly 22 percent, to
$23.43} a share in trading at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase is expected to be completed within two months.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Numico took over General Nutrition Companies Inc.,
which made up 50 percent of the group's profit growth in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Ex NATO Chief Warns of New Violence  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Touring separate parts of Kosovo,
Defense Secretary William Cohen and the departing NATO commander
Gen. Wesley Clark warned Monday of new Serb-Albanian violence.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon, who accompanied Cohen, said
120 more U.S. soldiers had arrived in Kosovo to begin surveillance
operations along Kosovo's eastern boundary with Serbia, where
concerns have been raised about insurgency and arms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have strengthened our capability of interrupting the flow
of weapons,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who leaves his post Wednesday as supreme Allied
commander, also warned the Kosovo Protection Corps, the successor
to the disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army, to stay out of an
insurgency in the Presevo Valley, a region just outside Kosovo, but
which has a majority Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   A newly formed ethnic Albanian rebel group has emerged, calling
itself the ''Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac''
after the three predominantly ethnic Albanian towns in the region.
Clashes in the area involving Serbian police have been attributed
to the new group.
</P>
<P>
   Clark stressed that the Kosovo Protection Corps was set up to
give help in nonmilitary emergencies like natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to allow them to get involved in providing
logistic support for any fighting,'' Clark said. ''They're not
going to be permitted to have a security role and certainly not a
logistics role.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen told 500 U.S. troops at Camp Bondsteel, the main U.S. base
near Urosevac in eastern Kosovo, that Kosovo remained ''a very
dangerous place'' and declined to speculate when peacekeepers may
leave the province. The 40,000 NATO peacekeepers arrived in June
after a 78-day NATO-led bombing campaign drove Yugoslav forces from
the province.
</P>
<P>
   ''The passions that still reside here are still pretty high, and
they are likely to remain high for some time to come,'' Cohen said.
''You are helping ... people to see the benefits of engaging in
peaceful interchange ... as opposed to the kind of hatreds that
mean digging more graves.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions are high between ethnic Albanians who form more than 90
percent of Kosovo's population and the approximately 100,000 Serbs
still remaining, with ethnically motivated attacks and killings
common.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, accompanied by U.S. Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the
joint Chiefs of Staff, did not meet with Clark, who toured part of
the volatile north in his last visit as NATO's supreme commander.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional visit for Clark, who directed the NATO
bombing -- the first military campaign conducted by NATO in its
50-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Clark walked through the tense northern city of Kosovska
Mitrovica, meeting with radical Serb leaders and was cheered in the
streets of the provincial capital, Pristina, by ethnic Albanians.
In Pristina, he kissed babies and shook people's hands. One man
shouted ''Thank you, Clark,'' in English.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kosovo has to belong to all the people that live here,'' Clark
said. ''People have to respect each other, they have to show
tolerance for each other.''

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Contestant Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, R.I. (AP) -- A contestant newly back from filming the
reality TV show ''Survivor'' was charged with child abuse after he
allegedly forced his son to go jogging, then roughed up the boy
when he stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hatch, 39, turned himself in after his son, a
fourth-grader, told administrators at his school that his father
assaulted him.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a management consultant who specializes in team building
and conflict resolution, had just returned home after spending 40
days marooned on a remote tropical island off Borneo being filmed
for the CBS show, set to air beginning later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old boy told police Hatch woke him at 4:30 a.m.
Thursday to go running because he wanted the boy to lose weight.
The boy said he got tired and started walking, when Hatch pulled
him by the ear and wrapped his hands around his neck to move him
along.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the boy had red marks on his right ear, around his
throat and on his upper arms, along with a scrape on his forehead
and right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch remains free on $10,000 personal recognizance. He did not
return a message Monday seeking comment. The boy is in temporary
state custody until the case is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch was among a group of 16 people left on the remote island
in March to live without running water or electricity. The
''castaways'' built rattan huts, caught fish and grilled rats for
protein and, every three nights, the contestants voted to eject
someone from the community. It was not known how long Hatch lasted.
The final person left at the end will get $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokesman Chris Ender said Monday the show would go forward
as planned with Hatch in it. ''Survivor'' will be aired weekly
starting May 31.
</P>
<P>
   The network has said that 6,000 people applied to be on the
show. It said it interviewed 800 people, then flew 48 to Los
Angeles for 10 days of grilling and six hours of psychological
tests before selecting eight men and eight women.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Co. Buys Life US Insurance Co.  </HEADLINE>
By KARREN MILLS, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- ReliaStar Financial Corp., the nation's
eighth-largest publicly held life insurance company, is being
acquired by ING Group of the Netherlands in a deal valued at $6.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase announced Monday follows ING's 1997 purchases of
Equitable of Iowa for $2.2 billion and the investment bank Furman
Selz for $600 million. With the addition of ReliaStar, the Dutch
financial group will have completed a major part of its
international strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''ReliaStar can be a perfect fit with our existing businesses,''
said Ewald Kist, who takes over as ING chairman Tuesday when
Godfried van der Lugt retires.
</P>
<P>
   ReliaStar's operations include life insurance and annuities,
employee benefits products and services, retirement plans, and
mutual funds. It has $38.4 billion in assets under management.
</P>
<P>
   Based on revenue from insurance premiums, Amsterdam-based ING
currently ranks 19th in the U.S. life insurance market. The merged
company will be among the top 10, the officials said. According to
ING, combined revenues from insurance premiums in 1999 would have
totaled $12.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ING agreed to pay $5.1 billion for ReliaStar's common stock and
assume $1 billion in ReliaStar's debt. The transaction, which
values ReliaStar at $54 per share, is expected to close late in the
third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory and ReliaStar
shareholder approval.
</P>
<P>
   ReliaStar's stock, which surged 43 percent on Friday amid rumors
of the impending deal, rose $7 per share to $51 in trading Monday
at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Few job cuts are anticipated at ReliaStar's Minneapolis
headquarters or elsewhere, said John Turner, chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ReliaStar employs 3,800, including 1,500 in Minnesota, while ING
has about 90,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a limited number of positions that are related to
ReliaStar having been a public company that will disappear, but I
expect those people will be given opportunities in other areas
within the company,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition also could mean more jobs at ReliaStar's new
service center in Minot, N.D., he said. Employment at the center,
which opened six months ago, is expected to go beyond the 600
already targeted before the acquisition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ReliaStar, which had revenues of $3.04 billion in 1999, edging
into the Fortune 500 list of the nation's largest companies at No.
500, had been mentioned recently as a potential takeover target by
several possible suitors. ReliaStar officials felt ING was the best
fit, Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was not an auction process. It was a process that was
controlled by us,'' Turner said. ''ING has historically
demonstrated a high degree of concern for the interests of the
employees of the companies they merge with.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner declined to comment on what other companies had been
considered as partners.

<HEADLINE> Minivan Accident Blamed on Motorist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, N.C. (AP) -- An accident last month in which a
minivan lurched in reverse, killing an 11-year-old boy, happened
when the 84-year-old driver mistakenly hit the gas pedal instead of
the brake, the district attorney said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges will be filed against the driver, Sara Bell
Kennedy, in the March 22 crash at Smithfield Middle School,
District Attorney Tom Lock said. Lock said it was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had dropped off children at the school and put her
minivan into reverse when it raced backward and hit the children in
front of the school. Byrone Murray was killed and six others were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no evidence to suggest that a mechanical defect or
malfunction caused or contributed to the collision. The accident
almost certainly was caused by driver error,'' Lock said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Lock said it appeared Kennedy touched the accelerator instead of
the brake pedal after backing a few feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''She probably panicked and overreacted by pressing even harder
on the gas pedal, believing it to be the brake pedal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lock said the state Highway Patrol reconstructed the accident
and interviewed more than two dozen witnesses. The van, a 1994
Dodge Caravan, was tested by an independent mechanical engineer.

<HEADLINE> Companies Can Dictate Time Off  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- State and local governments can tell their
employees when to take the compensatory time off that they agree to
receive instead of overtime pay, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision in a case from Houston said public employers
have the authority to control when such time-off credits are used
if no pre-existing labor agreement says otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The highest court's interpretation of the federal Fair Labor
Standards Act is a setback for 127 sheriff's deputies in Harris
County, Texas, and for the AFL-CIO, which had supported their legal
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing in the FLSA or its implementing regulations prohibits
an employer from compelling the use of compensatory time,'' Justice
Clarence Thomas wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Police Organizations, which filed a
court brief supporting the Harris County deputies, expressed
disappointment in the decision. The group's executive director,
Robert T. Scully, called the ruling ''a blow against public workers
and for public employers.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision does not affect private industry employees. The
federal law generally requires time-and-one-half payment for
employees who work more than 40 hours in a week, and does not make
a similar exception allowing the substitution of compensatory time
by private employers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas case, the deputies' 1994 lawsuit accused the county
sheriff's department of violating the federal labor law by forcing
them to use compensatory time-off credits when they did not want to
use them.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge had ruled for the deputies but a federal appeals
court ruled for the sheriff's department, saying public employers
can use workplace rules as long as they do not conflict with a
negotiated agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said that although the law ''imposes a restriction upon
an employer's efforts to prohibit the use of compensatory time when
employees request to do so, that provision says nothing about
restricting an employer's efforts to require employees to use
compensatory time.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer dissented.
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that Congress did not act
unlawfully when extending the overtime requirement to state, city
and county employers, Congress attempted to soften the financial
blow by allowing public employers to agree with employees to award
compensatory time instead of overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   The law was amended to let public safety workers accumulate up
to 480 hours of time off before employers have to pay them for any
additional overtime work.
</P>
<P>
   At the Harris County sheriff's department, employees nearing the
maximum amount of accumulated hours are asked to take time off, and
if they do not they are ordered to do so. The department also can
require an employee to use the hours at a time that serves its
personnel needs if the two sides cannot agree.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the deputies argued that Congress never intended to
let public employers have such authority -- a view shared by the
Clinton administration. Led by Thomas, the court said that
interpretation of the law was mistaken.

<HEADLINE> Castro Leads May Day March for Elian  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Fidel Castro took an active role in May Day
festivities for the first time in years Monday, marching in the
parade and ending a speech with a cell phone call to Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, who is fighting to bring his son, Elian, home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Castro traded his black boots for white tennis shoes, grasped a
red, white and blue Cuban flag and led hundreds of thousands of
people through the streets of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   With a white T-shirt peeking out from his traditional olive
green uniform, the 73-year-old leader who has ruled this island for
41 years guided a sea of chanting, flag-waving men, women and
children from Havana's sprawling Plaza of the Revolution to the
U.S. Interests Section almost two miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was reminiscent of Castro in his early years in power,
after the revolution that triumphed on New Year's Day 1959.
''Fidel! Fidel!'' chanted the crowd, obviously delighted by his
athletic footwear and his participation in the annual march that
traditionally involves workers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his years, the graying leader walked briskly down the
broad boulevards to the U.S. Interests Section along Havana's
Malecon coastal highway. With his hair mussed and sweaty from the
walk under the blazing tropical sun, Castro chatted with Elian's
grandmothers and others gathered outside the American mission.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Castro gave a speech before a festive crowd of hundreds
of thousands. He praised the Cuban people for their tenacity during
the five-month fight to bring 6-year-old Elian home.
</P>
<P>
   Although May Day marches in Cuba regularly draw hundreds of
thousands of people, this one appeared to be the largest in years.
The turnout reflected the importance the communist government has
placed on its battle to bring Elian back.
</P>
<P>
   No crowd estimate was immediately available from the government,
but Cuban state media estimated that millions of people had turned
out for May Day celebrations across the island.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Castro linked Elian's case to Cuba's struggle
against the U.S. trade embargo and international criticism of the
island's human rights record. He accused a ''Cuban-American
terrorist mob'' of fighting to keep the shipwreck survivor in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was obvious that they underestimated our people, who have
not rested a single day in fighting for something absolutely
just,'' Castro said, referring to the campaign for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not even Dante could have described the hell he (Elian) has
been through,'' Castro said. ''I wonder what the U.S. government
would have done if a similar situation had been created with a
barely 6-year-old American child kidnapped in Cuba and subjected to
the appalling treatment the child has received in that country.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro said he was not convinced that an appeals court in
Atlanta, which has set a May 11 hearing in the case, will rule in
favor of Elian's father. Father and son are staying in the United
States pending the hearing on a request by their Miami relatives
for a political asylum hearing for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Castro spoke by cellular telephone with Juan
Gonzalez as the crowd looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is Juan Miguel,'' Castro said after Foreign Minister Felipe
Perez Roque handed him the phone. ''On behalf of the children, of
all the companions there, he sends a special greeting for our all
of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   The enormous crowd roared approval. Many in the crowd wore
pictures of a smiling Elian with his father pinned to their shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It was Castro's first speech at a May Day celebration in years.
During recent May 1 gatherings, Castro has presided over massive
marches of workers but has left the podium to labor leaders and
other top officials.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering this year was also unusual in that it was being
described as an ''open tribune'' -- the government term used to
describe the mass concentrations regularly held to press for
Elian's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's case has absorbed Cubans and their government since Nov.
25, when the boy was found floating on an inner tube off the
Florida coast following a boating accident that killed his mother
and 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   The castaway quickly found himself at the center of an
international custody battle. His anti-communist Miami relatives
are fighting to keep him in the United States, while his father is
demanding to take the boy back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was reunited with his father in Washington last week after
a dramatic raid of the Miami relatives' home. Armed agents whisked
the boy away and flew him to his dad. The raid has been bitterly
criticized by the Miami relatives and many of their supporters in
South Florida's large Cuban-American community, as well as by
conservative members of Congress.

<HEADLINE> Minorities complaints about use of scanner on state propertyheeded  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A hospital says it will replace a scanner
that screens for osteoporosis after black and Hispanic legislators
protested Monday over the machine initially used in a health fair
at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Assembly members were angered that a bone-density
scanner was not useful to them. They posted signs stating ''White
women only'' around Bellevue Woman's Hospital's booth.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Matthews, a state worker from Albany who is black, was
among those upset by the test.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't understand why you would bring a machine for white
women only to a public place where there are multiple races. That's
very insulting,'' she said. ''It's like we're back in the '40s and
'50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Fidler, who was conducting the tests, said the genetic data
in the machine only applied to white women and she could not verify
the accuracy if the test was performed on nonwhite women. Fidler
agreed to pack up her machine and leave after state Assemblyman
Keith Wright, chairman of the state Black, Puerto Rican and
Hispanic Legislative Caucus, told her it shouldn't be used on
public property.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, the hospital said it would rectify the
situation by bringing a different machine Tuesday, according to
Carole Salluzzo, spokeswoman for Bellevue, located in Niskayuna,
about 10 miles west of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing what we know now, we aren't going to do that again,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten million Americans have osteoporosis, a disease characterized
by deterioration of the bone that can lead to fragility and an
increased risk of fractures, according to the National Osteoporosis
Foundation. The disease is blamed for 700,000 vertebral fractures
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last few years, medical literature has been virtually
devoid of information about bone density in minority women, a
researcher at University of Connecticut's Center on Aging has said.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, conventional wisdom was that black women did
not get osteoporosis because they seemed to achieve a genetically
higher peak bone mass. The disease is much more prevalent in white
and Hispanic women.
</P>
<P>
   But a University of Connecticut study that performed bone
density scans on 100 black volunteers older than 65 found that
one-third of the women had osteoporosis or experienced enough bone
loss to put them at risk.

<HEADLINE> President Shows His Lighter Side  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House was a little defensive -- and a
lot proud Monday of the video it presented last weekend in which
lame duck Bill Clinton joshed himself as being so underemployed he
had time to wash the presidential limo and run down the driveway
carrying a bag lunch for Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart captured the mood of
the president's aides: happy that the video was a smash but also on
guard against any suggestion that Clinton has so little to do that
he could spend unlimited time in taping sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing took two hours, said Lockhart. But another White
House official said earlier it was more like five or six hours.
</P>
<P>
   TV funnyman Jay Leno was impressed by Clinton's split-second
timing in his schtick Saturday night at the White House
Correspondents' Association annual black tie dinner -- Clinton's
eighth and last appearance as chief executive. The president did a
stand up comedy routine as well as starring in the video.
</P>
<P>
   Also impressed was Phil Rosenthal, creator and executive
producer of the sitcom ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' and producer of
the Clinton video.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very willing and gracious ... and he did it with
enthusiasm and, I think, tremendous talent. Very, very funny. I
would say 90 percent of that was one take,'' Rosenthal said Monday
on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Leno, host of NBC's ''Tonight'' show, went so far to suggest
that Clinton might find post-presidential work as a comic.
</P>
<P>
   An example of Clinton's humor:
</P>
<P>
   ''The clock is running down on the Republicans in Congress, too.
I feel for them. I do. They've only got seven more months to
investigate me. That's a lot of pressure. So little time, so many
unanswered questions. For example, over the last few months I've
lost 10 pounds. Where did they go? Why haven't I produced them to
the Independent Counsel?''
</P>
<P>
   Or:
</P>
<P>
   ''(John) McCain as (George W.) Bush's running mate? Hasn't the
man suffered enough?'' Clinton joked, referring to McCain's years
as a POW during the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   The video showed a bored Clinton answering telephone calls,
mowing the lawn, trimming bushes, washing his limousine and
watching clothes spin in the dryer. In one scene he chases after
Hillary's car with the bag lunch he made for her.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, at a White House briefing
Monday, was asked if he was disappointed at being excluded from the
president's video.
</P>
<P>
   ''One always has things to aspire to in life,'' he deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had one more gag up its sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Allison Janney stepped to the White House podium Monday
and, for a minute or so, played the part of the president's press
secretary -- something she does in the NBC series, ''The West
Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no comment today but I will take questions,'' she
opened. She was barely getting warmed up when someone asked about
the acting abilities of the real Clinton spokesman, Lockhart, who
starred in a gag video Saturday night with cast members from ''The
West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now hold on a second,'' Lockhart interrupted, cutting off
Janney's answer in mid sentence. He dismissed her with a quick,
''Thank you.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Keeps 'South Park' on Cable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cartman, Kyle, Kenny and the rest of the
twisted ''South Park'' crew will be on Comedy Central through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone will come up
with at least 10 new episodes of the irreverent and oftentimes
bawdy cartoon series each year for three years under terms of a
deal struck Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusive television and production development pact keeps
Parker and Stone at the cable channel through August 2003, Comedy
Central general manager Bill Hilary said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to continuing the wild ride that began with
'South Park' as we tap further into the artistic genius of this
extraordinarily creative team,'' Hilary said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year contract, which goes into effect in September,
was described as a multimillion dollar deal, but financial details
weren't disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The pact calls for a minimum of 30 new episodes of ''South
Park,'' a new series to launch in 2001, ongoing series development
and a partnership agreement with Parker and Stone concerning the
syndication of ''South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For the last three years we have been exceptionally lucky to
have our show on a network that respects creative freedom. We've
realized it is this freedom that has made us happiest, that's why
we've decided to stay with Comedy Central,'' Parker said in a
statement.
</P>

   Comedy Central, the only all-comedy network, is available in
over 63 million homes nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Group chided for survey in N.J. has role in national seminar onteens  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A nonprofit research group that helped
organize Tuesday's White House Conference on Teen-agers has raised
the hackles of parents in some states for asking students detailed
questions about sexual activity and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Three parents are suing the Ridgewood, N.J., school district for
distributing the 156-question survey written by the Search
Institute of Minneapolis. The survey asks youths how many times
they have taken various illegal drugs, whether they have tried to
kill themselves, and what protection they use if they are sexually
active.
</P>
<P>
   The Radford, Va., school board refused to allow the survey to be
distributed in schools. Some Colorado Springs, Colo., parents
objected to the survey as intrusive. So did some parents in the
Middletown-Monroe school system in Ohio, who argued that questions
about sexual protection should not be asked of adults, much less of
children.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Benson, the institute's president, was among about a dozen
experts consulted by the White House in scheduling Tuesday's
conference on ''raising responsible and resourceful youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson will also speak at one of the afternoon sessions on the
subject, ''Closing the gap: How can we provide positive
opportunities for all teen-agers?''
</P>
<P>
   Benson said the vast majority of questions on the survey are
designed to measure positive influences in a given neighborhood.
The limited number of questions about sex and drugs, he said, are
there because ''these are the public health issues that have been
framed in America for 20 or 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Search Institute says more than 1 million students have
taken the survey over the past 10 years, and the vast majority of
communities have been happy with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of the survey is really to understand young
people's experiences of positive, healthy, productive things in
their communities, in their lives, in their schools,'' said Marc
Mannes, research director for the Search Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the direct questions about sex, Mannes said, ''Sexual
activity is something that young people are engaging in, and we're
trying to get honest and accurate information so communities can do
best by young people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ridgewood, though, some parents were horrified that their
children were handed the survey in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one thing to take advantage of an adult, but it's another
thing to take advantage of a child in a public school environment,
a mandatory environment,'' said Frances Edwards, a mother of three
children in the Ridgewood school system. ''I find that insidious.
Their survey exploits the child, the (person) they say they are
trying to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1958, the Search Institute initially focused on
youths in religious settings. Though it still received money from
the Lutheran Brotherhood, the institute calls itself nonsectarian,
works primarily with public school districts and also received
money from the federal government, the Ford Foundation and such
corporate giants as Pillsbury and General Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the questions in the controversial survey help the
institute pursue a program it calls ''asset-building.''
</P>
<P>
   Under that philosophy, children need 40 ''assets'' or strengths,
such as a B grade point average or better, caring neighbors and a
sense of integrity, to become productive adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''The primary message we give to communities is that these 40
building blocks are extremely important,'' Benson said. ''You know
it, scientists know it, and too few of the kids in your community
have these assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson said the institute has worked with 1,000 communities and
found objections in perhaps 10 of them. Usually, he said, ''People
say 'Oh, I see the larger purpose of this work.'''
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody in Ridgewood was convinced.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of three families, the Rutherford Institute sued the
school district, charging that parents were not fully informed
about the survey before it was distributed to their children.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgewood school superintendent Frederick Stokley said parents
were given repeated notices throughout last year about the
forthcoming survey, including letters home.

<HEADLINE> Congressman's Entry May Help Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSSINING, N.Y. (AP) -- A former Republican congressman joined the
race for Senate on Monday, endangering Rudolph Giuliani's grasp on
conservative votes that have kept the New York City mayor
neck-and-neck with Hillary Rodham Clinton in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, they're popping the champagne corks at Clinton
campaign headquarters,'' GOP consultant and television commentator
Jay Severin said Monday after former Rep. Joseph DioGuardi
announced his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could almost run a dead body on the Conservative line and
attract enough votes to defeat the Republican candidate. Anybody on
that line -- Pee Wee Herman on that line -- poses a problem for
Giuliani,'' Severin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokeswoman Karen Dunn said the campaign had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his candidacy, DioGuardi said he would seek the
Conservative, Right to Life and Independence party nominations for
the November ballot. No Republican has won a statewide race without
the Conservative Party support since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that Giuliani isn't conservative enough; he's not
conservative at all,'' DioGuardi said. He said his decision had
nothing to do with the mayor's announcement last week that he has
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   State Conservative party Chairman Michael Long called DioGuardi
''the right candidate'' but held off on any formal endorsement. He
has refused to back the mayor because of his support for abortion
rights and other differences.
</P>
<P>
   Long said DioGuardi could ''blow this into a three-way race'' by
taking votes ''from conservative-minded Democrats and also real
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has said he would decide by the end of the month
whether to continue his campaign in light of his prostate cancer
diagnosis, said Monday he was pretty confident he would win a
Conservative Party primary.
</P>
<P>
   Two new polls show Clinton and Giuliani in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide telephone poll of 952 registered voters, conducted
April 24 through Sunday by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute
in Hamden, Conn., found 46 percent favored Clinton and 44 percent
wanted Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were statistically unchanged from the group's April
poll. The new poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A second telephone poll, conducted Friday and Saturday of 601
likely voters statewide, showed Clinton and Giuliani in a tie at 43
percent. That poll, conducted by Zogby International for the New
York Post and Fox TV, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the Zogby pollsters who would be the best choice to
replace Giuliani if he dropped out, Republican and non-Republican
respondents overwhelmingly named Gov. George Pataki. Rep. Rick
Lazio was a distant second.

<HEADLINE> Court rejects New York dairy trade group's challenge  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court made Carl
Peterson's day in the field a little brighter on Monday: The high
court put an end to a New York dairy trade group's challenge to a
compact that sets minimum prices for milk sold in New England.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, rejected the argument by New York
State Dairy Foods Inc. that the Northeast Dairy Compact
Commission's pricing plan discriminates against processors located
outside New England.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just confident that it (Supreme Court) was not going to
hear it because the lower court had a very strong ruling,'' said
Peterson, one of approximately 1,000 farmers in eastern New York
who sell milk to the compact. ''I'm not surprised, but I am
gratified.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, was Mae Schmidle, vice chair of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're extremely pleased with the outcome of this,'' she said.
''It certainly indicates the Northeast Dairy Compact is progressing
in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The compact was born in 1996, when Congress allowed
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont
and Maine to group together to regulate milk prices in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The group sets minimum prices, which can be higher than the
price set by the federal government. Milk processors make payments
into a pool, and money from that pool is sent back to the
processors for distribution to the dairy farmers from whom they
bought milk.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Northeast plan, processors located in New England
receive rebates based on the total amount of milk they sell,
whether in the six-state region or elsewhere. Processors located
outside the region get rebates based on how much milk they sell in
New England in liquid form -- not milk for making into cheese, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge by New York State Dairy Foods began in 1997. The
trade group, which represents New York-based milk processors
Cumberland Farms, Crowley Foods, and Elmhurst Dairy, said dairy
farmers get a higher payback from New England processors and
therefore farmers prefer to do business with them.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Boston upheld the pricing rules, and the 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last November.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the trade group said they were dismayed by Monday's
ruling and vowed to pursue a political solution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to oppose the unfair compact system through
legislative means here in New York state,'' Bruce Krupke, executive
vice president of New York Dairy Foods, Inc., said in a statement.
''We will also continue to try to enlighten our state's legislators
and dairy farmers on the negative impact the compact would have if
allowed to include New York state.'' He cited higher prices for
consumers as one of the negatives.
</P>
<P>
   New York, the third largest dairy producing state in the nation
behind California and Wisconsin, was denied admittance to the
compact last year after a bitter political battle broke out over
whether it should be abolished. The fight pitted the Northeast
against the Midwest, where there is widespread opposition to the
regional compacts.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, whose farm is located just west of Albany in Delanson,
said he wasn't sure what would happen if the compact was abolished
because prices are down so much, at their lowest in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in business 49 years and my son wants to stay in
business,'' said Peterson, who took over the family farm from his
father in 1961. ''It's like a safety net when prices drop low. It
would make it very, very difficult because we're just surviving
right now.''

<HEADLINE> Bergen County sheriff halts jail work, claiming big overruns  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- Bergen County Sheriff Joseph L. Ciccone
on Monday halted work on the latest phase of a jail-expansion
project, asserting he wants answers on why it is 35 percent over
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The county's top official, Executive William ''Pat'' Schuber,
reacted by seeking a court injunction to end ''the sheriff's
political charade.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuber, a Republican, was elected to his third term in November
1998, when Ciccone, a Democrat, was elected sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   State Superior Court Judge Sybil R. Moses is to meet with both
sides at 11 a.m. Tuesday in her chambers at the Bergen County
Courthouse, where she is the presiding judge.
</P>
<P>
   The old county jail had been scheduled for demolition on Monday.
Ciccone said it would be cheaper to renovate the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Schuber said the project is only about 5 percent over budget,
and that Ciccone's unauthorized lockout is costing the county
$25,000 to $50,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the project was completed last month, and
inmates moved into new cells. When completed, the jail will be able
to accommodate 1,128 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The old jail held about 1,000, but some had to sleep on floors
and the crowding prompted lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   When conceived seven years ago, the two-part project was
budgeted at $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Record of Hackensack has calculated the overrun so far as
$16 million, a figure endorsed by Ciccone, according to his
spokesman, Bob Nesoff.
</P>
<P>
   Schuber said the project's true starting cost should be $53
million, which takes into account costs for mandated work that had
not been anticipated in the original estimate: construction of a
road entirely around the facility, removal of contaminated soil,
additions made by prior sheriffs, and a three-year delay due to
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The project will probably finish about 5 percent above that
figure, or about $55.7 million, Schuber said.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase includes a laundry and kitchen for inmates, and
what Nesoff termed ''plush office space'' and an amphitheater for
staff.

<HEADLINE> Canada Suspends Ties With Vietnam  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Canada suspended government contacts with Vietnam
on Monday and put off annual meetings on development aid to protest
the execution of a Canadian woman convicted of drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We deplore this absolutely unacceptable conduct of the
government of Vietnam,'' Prime Minister Jean Chretien said in the
House of Commons in reaction to the April 24 execution of Nguyen
Thi Hiep.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen and her mother were arrested in 1996 after custom's
officers at the Hanoi airport found 12 pounds of heroin hidden in
art work. Nguyen was sentenced to death, while her mother received
life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities and human rights groups asked Vietnam to
delay the execution because of evidence the women were duped by
drug smugglers into transporting the heroin.
</P>
<P>
   But the execution proceeded without prior announcement last
week, prompting Canada to keep its ambassador at home and cutting
off help for Vietnam's bid to join the World Trade Organization.
Canada also boycotted last weekend's celebrations marking the 25th
anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the government announced it also was cutting off
ministerial-level contact with Vietnam, except in meetings
involving other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Canada said it would refuse to support Vietnamese
candidates for positions in international organizations and
suspended the upcoming annual talks on development assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials said Vietnam had failed to provide a
satisfactory explanation for why the execution took place after
previous assurances that Vietnamese authorities would wait to
consider new evidence from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Canada wanted
Vietnam to set free Nguyen's mother, Tran Thi Cham, who is 75, and
to return Nguyen's remains to her family. Nguyen had moved to
Canada in 1982 and become a Canadian citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian police say another woman arrested in Canada told an
identical story of accepting money to transport artwork from
Vietnam to a man in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, police say, the artwork contained packets of
heroin. The woman arrested in Canada was later released.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Adoptions Rising in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By CADONNA M. PEYTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Anfisa Luopajarvi's room is cluttered but
cozy, filled with furniture, stuffed animals and knickknacks.
</P>
<P>
   Her walls are covered with 17 posters of Leonardo DiCaprio. He
was once her favorite actor, she said, but now she likes Matt Damon
and Richard Gere more.
</P>
<P>
   Anfisa is not your average American teen-ager, though. The
16-year-old with a troubled past was born in Karelia, a northwest
territory of Russia, and was adopted in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say I'm Russian but it means nothing. I don't feel like
I'm Russian,'' Anfisa says.
</P>
<P>
   Each year more and more Americans -- single and married -- are
traveling to places like Russia, China, Guatemala and Romania to
add to their families.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign adoptions have risen from 6,536 in 1992 to more than
16,396 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Anfisa's mother, Natasha, was a prostitute. Her father, Genaldie
Ovchinicova, was a customer. They did marry, but only briefly,
before he left.
</P>
<P>
   With no way to care for her child, Natasha returned to the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   As a toddler, Anfisa was often left outside in freezing weather
to find her own supper.
</P>
<P>
   When Ovchinicova learned of his daughter's plight, he got
custody and they moved to a ''run down, rough neighborhood'' in a
poor area of St. Petersburg, Anfisa said.
</P>
<P>
   Anfisa's mother was killed by another customer.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was fine with her father, Anfisa said, until he lost
his job and started drinking and the neglect started all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   So Anfisa ran away, seeking refuge at a church until nuns placed
her in an orphanage. She was adopted after just a year.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, she has little or no accent and the only
evidence of her birthplace is a ''matrushka'' in her bedroom
window. The handpainted wooden doll, the size of a soda can, has
four other dolls inside. Anfisa will only say: ''It was a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Many children, especially the older ones who know and understand
where they came from, come to America and try to acculturate too
quickly, sometimes rejecting everything that has to do with their
own homeland, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very natural for kids to want to forget about that life,
because it was hard and they want to just shove it away,'' said
Sharon Roszia, a social worker and program manager at Kinship, an
Orange County adoption agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''But in the process of shoving it away, they literally bury a
part of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Igor McCamey's room, the only evidence of his heritage is a
couple of Russian books and a dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are not mine,'' he said. ''My mother put them there.''
</P>
<P>
   Igor, 13, and his older sister Natasha live in San Mateo, about
20 miles southeast of San Francisco. The siblings spent 10 years in
different Russian orphanages before being adopted almost 18 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Igor denies his heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not Russian, I'm American,'' he said, still with a strong
Russian accent. He pulls out a Pokemon collection as if to prove
his point.
</P>
<P>
   This is typical sentiment, Roszia said. During the years she has
worked with international adoptees and their families, she has
known children who reject their countries and their language. Some
have gone so far as to change their names to make them more
''American.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They feel an internal need to disidentify themselves from the
place from which they come,'' she said. ''A younger child will have
some issues. The older child is going to have more.''
</P>
<P>
   It is up to new parents to help the children find a healthy
identity embracing cultures old and new, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Parents must also teach the children about their countries and
encourage them to nurture their languages.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much of culture is transmitted through language. If you
don't speak the language, you lose the culture,'' Roszia said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her brother Igor, Natasha has no problem acknowledging
where she came from. Although she doesn't want to go back to live
in Russia, she calls it her ''home.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Igor, she hopes his attitude will change.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha, 16, reads a Russian newspaper sent to her home every
weekend. She also continues to use her native language with a tutor
that visits the home frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like America. It's a good country, but,'' she said, stopping
in mid sentence, ''I'm Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever language I speak, wherever I am, I will always be
Russian.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Showing Slight Edge on Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore
are locked in a close race for president, 49 percent for Bush to 44
percent for Gore, in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The five-point difference is within the poll's error margin of
plus or minus 5 percentage points for the 499 likely voters
surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Among registered voters, Bush had 46 percent, and Gore 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In this poll three weeks ago, Bush led 50 percent to 41 percent
among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-way matchup with third-party candidates Pat Buchanan
and Ralph Nader, Bush had 47 percent and Gore 41 percent among
likely voters. Buchanan and Nader were at 4 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was viewed favorably by six in 10, while Gore was viewed
favorably by just over half.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates were closely matched when people were asked
who was stronger on a number of personal qualities, but Bush was
favored on the question of strong and decisive leadership, CNN
reported Monday. Gore was slightly stronger on issues that are high
voter priorities like health care, while Bush was higher on crime.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,003 adults was taken Friday through Sunday and has
an error margin of 3 percentage points for the entire sample, 4
percentage points for registered voters and 5 percentage points for
likely voters.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 77; Nasdaq Up 97  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors brushed off worries about Microsoft's
future Monday, sending its shares higher and fueling a rally in
technology stocks that spread to the broad market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 77.87 to 10,811.78 and the
Nasdaq composite index rose 97.42 to 3,958.08.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 rose 15.82 to 1,468.25.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 3 11/16 to 73 7/16 in the first session since the
Justice Department asked a federal court to divide the company in
two to satisfy antitrust concerns. Late Friday afternoon, the
Justice Department and 17 states recommended splitting the company
into one business for Microsoft's Windows operating-system
software, and one for the company's applications products and
Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was widely expected, and many investors determined
that the possibility of a breakup had already taken its toll on
Microsoft stock. Before Monday's session, Microsoft's share price
had declined by about 40 percent since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether split up, or not, the sum of the parts are worth
around $125 to 135 a share,'' said Michael E. Stanek, a Microsoft
analyst with Lehman Brothers. ''Therefore, investor objections of
not owning the stock based on 'break-up' fears are no longer rooted
in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies that compete with Microsoft were mostly
higher. Red Hat, a seller of the Linux operating system, rose 2
13/16 to 27~ and VA Linux rose 18 7/16 to 60 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also resumed seeking bargains among the technology
stocks that were pounded in a wave of selloffs in mid-April. Ciena,
a designer of telecommunications networks, rose 16 7/16 to 140
1/16. Online information center About.com was up 15 5/16 to 49|.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology has taken back market leadership with a
vengeance,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment
strategist with Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York. ''We washed out the
market in April, and now investors are looking for stocks with
strong earnings growth. That means tech stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer maker Hewlett-Packard rose 4 to 139, leading the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the technology sector, merger activity stimulated
trading. Rexall Sundown, a maker of nutritional supplements and
health products, rose 4 3/16 to 23 7/16 after Dutch specialty foods
company Numico NV agreed to acquire it for $24 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Some modest support for the stock market came from the National
Association of Purchasing Management, which said America's
industrial sector grew for the 15th consecutive month in April. The
group said the economy's growth came at a slower pace than in
March, while prices for raw materials didn't rise as fast as in
earlier months.
</P>
<P>
   That offered some relief to inflation-wary traders. Most market
watchers expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the
sixth time in a year when it holds its next meeting on May 16. The
indication of modest growth raised hopes that only a modest,
quarter-point increase is in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a raging debate about what will come from the
Fed,'' Battipaglia said. ''I think we need some more data before
investors can figure exactly how high interest rates will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange and by a 5-to-3 margin on the
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.16 billion shares, compared with
1.18 billion in the previous session. The relatively low volume
exacerbated price swings, causing most market barometers to shift
dramatically over the course of the session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.68 to
518.93.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.4 percent.
European markets were closed in observance of May Day.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Interest Rate Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The price of 30-year Treasury bonds fell
modestly Monday, on interest rate fears and disappointment that the
Treasury won't increase its plans for paying down the U.S. debt.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark long-term Treasury fell ] point, or $3.75 per
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, rose to 5.99 percent from 5.96 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term notes were weighed down by inflation concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe the robust economy is rekindling
inflation. Traders fear the Federal Reserve will be even more
aggressive in trying to cool of growth. That could mean raising
interest rates by one-half percentage point, rather than a
quarter-point increase that had been expected at a May 16 meeting
of the central bank's policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation and rising rates erode the value of investments that
pay a fixed return, such as bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Bond traders were also disappointed that when Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said Monday that the Treasury intends to stick
with its previously announced plans for buying back U.S. debt.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that the Treasury would boost its
target for buying back debt. Previously, the Treasury has said it
will repurchase up to $30 billion in debt through the relatively
new buyback program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We plan to maintain our announced strategy with respect to
debt buybacks and the issuance of long-term debt,'' Summers said in
a statement released Monday afternoon. Summers was appearing at a
White House press conference to tout the administration's progress
on debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The more bonds that are bought back the more the supply is
reduced, which would increase their value.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the price of short-term notes fell 3/32 point to 5/32
point, according to Bridge Telerate, a financial information
service. Intermediate maturities were down \ point to 7/16 point.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.98 percent as the

<HEADLINE> GOP Names Platform Committee Chair  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has put a staunch abortion foe,
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, in charge of the platform committee
for the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment, announced Monday by the Republican National
Committee, suggests the party is unlikely to step away from its
blanket opposition to the procedure, a stance that prompted
dissension from GOP moderates before the 1996 convention in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor and presumed GOP presidential nominee,
opposes abortion except for in cases of rape, incest or when the
life of a mother is endangered.
</P>
<P>
   The platform has no such exceptions. The 1996 disagreement was
bridged when abortion rights supporters were allowed to add a
platform appendix.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Thompson is the senior Republican governor and an
articulate advocate of smaller, smarter government, greater freedom
and stronger families,'' RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson said. ''His
leadership and vision will be invaluable as our party crafts a
platform that reflects the hopes and ideas of Republicans and a
majority of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, first elected governor in 1986, said he looked forward
to ''serving on the committee to articulate our party's most
innovative ideas, the principles that bind us together and our
vision for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Thompson signed legislation outlawing a procedure
that opponents call ''partial-birth'' abortion. Bush has said he
would sign a similar nationwide ban if he is elected over Democrat
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's clear is that the Republican Party is going to continue
to play to its extreme elements that stand against a women's right
to choose,'' said Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway. ''Bush may say he's
a different kind of Republican, but obviously he clearly stands
behind the party platform on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer replied: ''The governor has full
faith in Tommy Thompson and his abilities to bring people
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Keane, a Thompson spokesman, said abortion is just one
issue the committee will digest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what they like about Governor Thompson is that he's
always been someone to handle issues in a unified manner. You name
the issue and the governor has been out front on it and able to
bring people together on it,'' Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Convention's Resolutions Committee, commonly
known as the platform committee, drafts the statement spelling out
the Republican Party's positions on an array of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Its membership consists of 107 delegates, including a male and
female delegate from each state and the District of Columbia, and
one each from the U.S. territories.
</P>
<P>
   Their resulting document must be approved by a majority of the
2,066 delegates at the convention, to be held July 31 to Aug. 3 in
Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Workers on Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) -- About 200 American Red Cross workers
who collect blood donations and deliver them to hospitals went on
strike Monday, leaving the organization understaffed but still
operating.
</P>
<P>
   A Red Cross spokeswoman said any collection shortfall would be
made up from national resources. Meanwhile, managers were making
deliveries and conducting a blood drive.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, the first by Red Cross workers in Connecticut in 25
years, could reduce daily blood collection in the state by as much
as 80 percent, spokeswoman Lynn Townshend said. The Red Cross had
some 6,500 units, about an 11-day supply, when the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   The workers on strike are technician-drivers, nurses, lab
workers and phlebotomists, who draw the blood, represented by the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   The workers are unhappy about long hours, frequent schedule
changes and increasing health benefit costs. On Sunday night, they
rejected the organization's latest contract offer 168-19. Some
called the offer insulting.
</P>
<P>
   Union negotiator Jeffrey Jump said Monday that a federal
mediator wants talks to resume by the end of the week.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Destroy Homes in Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELBERT, Texas (AP) -- A tornado destroyed several homes and the
local cotton gin, one of at least four twisters that struck
northwestern Texas as severe thunderstorms battered the southern
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries were reported in the Sunday storms.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms also pounded southwestern and central Oklahoma,
dumping heavy rain that pushed rivers above flood stage today.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Elbert ''got plenty of warning, got everybody
notified. We got word to them and got them into cellars,'' said Ron
Sadler, dispatcher for the Throckmorton County Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Three twisters were also confirmed by the National Weather
Service in neighboring Young County, with one described as
half-mile-wide funnel cloud near Olney. Damage was minor but fallen
power lines blocked roads, said Young County sheriff's Deputy Gary
Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to destroying the Elbert Gin, essential to cotton
growers in the area, the twister tore down power lines to the town
of 150 people.
</P>
<P>
   Barns in the town about 50 miles southwest of Wichita Falls also
were destroyed, and hail as big as tennis balls pounded some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma rainfall totals included 4.65 inches at Union City, 4.1
in south Oklahoma City and 3.75 at Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   The North Canadian River crested more than 3 feet above flood
stage early today in northeast Oklahoma City, but only low-lying
farmland was affected. The river was expected to fall below flood
stage during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding of agricultural areas and rural roads was expected in
parts of central Oklahoma as the river was expected to crest today
at Harrah at 16 feet, 2 feet above flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   Wind up to 74 mph blew away part of the roof at Parkview
Hospital in El Reno, Okla. No patients were affected by rain that
poured through the hole in the roof, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning started several home fires in Oklahoma City and three
juveniles had to be rescued from a swollen creek in the city, said
Fire Department Maj. Brian Stanaland. The youths had been playing
in the creek when they were caught by rising water.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids were a little cold. They're pretty lucky to be
safe,'' Stanaland said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Offers Report on Subway Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transit officials released a preliminary
report into last month's fire on the Washington Metro Monday, in
which they blamed an unusual design along the stretch of track
where the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The factors that caused this particular fire are unlikely to
recur in our system,'' said Fred Goodine, Metro Safety Officer.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the cable to the electrified rail is embedded in
a concrete slab running under the tracks. Two pieces of metal on
the ends of the slab cut into the casing and insulation surrounding
the wire, grounding the cable and causing the April 20 fire in a
subway tunnel under the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The grounded cable then opened high voltage fuses, which shut
off power and stranded a Virginia-bound train carrying 273
passengers. It took over 2{ hours to evacuate them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Metro, the scene of the fire -- between the Farragut
West and Foggy Bottom stations -- is the only place on the subway
system that has this kind of cable installation, which does not
meet Metro's current standards. Work is underway to replace the
cable.
</P>
<P>
   District of Columbia firefighters, whose radios did not work
underground, will use World War II era field phones if they have to
fight another blaze inside the tunnels. Acting Fire Chief Thomas
Tippett said Monday the field phones and spools of cable can be
hooked up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Metro said it would also provide two-way radios to firefighters,
should there be another emergency.

Nader Discusses UAW Endorsement   
By JUSTIN HYDE
AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Consumer advocate and Green Party presidential
candidate Ralph Nader discussed an endorsement Monday with leaders
of the United Auto Workers union.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said he didn't directly ask for the union's backing, and
added that it will not endorse a candidate until after a
congressional vote expected this month on providing permanent
normal trade relations with China -- which Nader, the UAW and other
major labor unions oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of asking for endorsements, Nader said: ''I just tell
people what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials were unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW broke with the AFL-CIO last October, when it endorsed
Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore, and hopes to use its own
endorsement as leverage.
</P>
<P>
   The union has been critical of President Clinton's trade
policies, opposing the North American Free Trade Agreement and
Clinton's push for ''fast-track'' trade negotiations. Since
enactment of NAFTA, automakers have turned to Mexican plants for
more goods, especially new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a music club two blocks from GM headquarters, Nader
said NAFTA has led to the loss of 100,000 auto jobs in the past six
years. He said new plants in Mexico had failed to improve the
economy there because wages and standards of living remained low.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let anyone ever use that phrase 'free trade','' he said.
''It's corporate managed trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said he would push for legal reforms aimed at
strengthening labor unions, including banning companies from hiring
replacement workers during strikes or lockouts, recognizing unions
through petitions instead of vote, and giving unemployment benefits
to striking or locked-out workers.

<HEADLINE> Iran TV Shows Jew Confessing As Spy  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) -- In a case that has raised Western concerns,
one of 13 Iranian Jews on trial for espionage appeared on state
television Monday and confessed to spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been accused of espionage for Israel. I do accept this
charge. I have been spying for Israel. In my trip to Israel in
1994, I was trained for my activity in Iran,'' Dani Tefilin said.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman promptly dismissed his
statement as ''ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   The confession was the latest development in a case that has
heightened an intense power struggle between the hard-line clergy
and reformers who want nothing to come in the way of improving ties
with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Convictions and heavy sentences in the spy case could provoke an
international backlash and set back the reforms Iran's judiciary
and other bodies have staunchly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The judiciary, which is controlled by hard-liners, has closed 16
pro-democracy newspapers and arrested six reformist activists in
the past two weeks in its confrontation with President Mohammad
Khatami's more liberal wing.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a prison uniform and appearing to be in good health,
Tefilin, 30, spoke to a television reporter in a room in the court
building where his trial resumed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter asked him if he was working alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' replied Tefilin, who was the first of the suspects to be
arrested more than a year ago. ''We were working in a network and
trying to collect information to be sent to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview was broadcast as part of the first item on the
state television's main 9 p.m. newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Tefilin was heard later on state-run Tehran radio saying that
Israel had paid him in installments of $500 that were deposited in
a bank account under his name in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   He also told the radio that his mother, two sisters and a
brother lived in Israel. He also has a brother in Iran, Omid
Tefilin, who is one of the three defendants in the case who have
been let out of custody on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, the provincial judiciary chief, Hossein Ali
Amiri, emerged from the closed-door trial to say that Tefilin had
confessed to passing ''sensitive information, including military
secrets,'' to Mossad, Israel's external intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''His case is finished,'' Amiri said, adding that Tefilin had
asked for clemency. He did not know when a verdict was expected.
</P>
<P>
   But Tefilin's court-appointed lawyer, Shirzad Rahmani, said the
state must still prove its case with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may been have confessions, there may have been an
intention to spy, there may have been several trips to Israel, and
there may even have been payments. But if information damaging to
Iran and beneficial to Israel was not actually exchanged, there can
be no charge of espionage,'' Rahmani told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has long said the charges against the 13 suspects are
baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attempt to present the Jews arrested in Iran as spies is
ludicrous and pathetic,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron
said in response to Tefilin's televised confession. ''Israel
emphasizes that all the arrestees are innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have been cautious about speaking publicly
about the trial out of concern that protests from the Jewish state,
Iran's sworn enemy, could adversely affect the Jews accused.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being closely watched in the West amid concerns
about its fairness. Several countries, the United Nations and human
rights groups have either condemned the arrests or called on Iran
to ensure proceedings are fair. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has said the case was ''of strong concern'' to her.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with French officials last year, Khatami promised a
fair trial. So far, no other reformers have commented on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Jews are being tried in a revolutionary court with no jury.
The judge serves as prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants' families and other members of Iran's Jewish
community, Western diplomats and foreign journalists milled outside
the courthouse in Shiraz, 550 miles south of the capital, Tehran,
as Monday's hearing began.
</P>
<P>
   ''The charges of espionage against me are completely false,''
said defendant Navid Balazadeh, standing outside the courthouse as
he waited to be called in. ''We have been treated well, and I trust
the judge to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Balazadeh was one of the three defendants released on bail in
February. At the time, an Iranian judiciary spokesman said they
were freed because the charges against them were less serious than
those of the 10 other Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Elahe Sharifpour-Hicks, a New York-based representative of Human
Rights Watch, said she had asked Judge Sadeq Nourani earlier Monday
to allow an international observer or a member of the Jewish
community to attend the trial. He refused for ''reasons of national
security,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials first accused the suspects of spying for the
United States and Israel. But when the trial opened, the judge said
they were charged only with spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians convicted of spying usually receive long prison terms,
but they can be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Iran maintains religion has no bearing on the case and notes
that eight Muslims also have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Haroun Yashayaii, head of Iran's Jewish Society, said the
foreign media ''have magnified the trial,'' saying the suspects
weren't arrested because of religion and no actions were taken
against their relatives, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian Jews numbered 80,000 before the 1979 Islamic revolution;
25,000 remain today. Jews in Iran are generally allowed to practice
their religion freely, but they cannot travel to or have any
contact with Israel.

<HEADLINE> 7 Arrested in Dominican Killing  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNAH E. NESMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Dominican police
arrested seven people for the slayings of two men by bodyguards for
the country's leading presidential candidate, an official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen other people were questioned and released in Saturday's
killings, said Lt. Col. Nelson Rosario. Police refused to provide
more details.
</P>
<P>
   Bodyguards for Hipolito Mejia, the opposition Dominican
Revolutionary Party candidate for president, shot and killed Luis
Terrero Gil, 41, an official in the governing Dominican Liberation
Party and director of the National Center for Science and Art.
</P>
<P>
   Also slain was Rafael Penalo, 29, a Liberation Party supporter.
The shootings occurred during a rally for Mejia in Moca, 85 miles
from Santo Domingo, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Terrero Gil and Penalo were buried in Moca on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The seven arrested are local Revolutionary Party members, party
official Janet Lugo said Monday. It wasn't immediately known if
they included the security guards.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Party claims Mejia's car was fired upon as it
was passing by Terrero Gil's house and that Mejia's guards returned
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were victims of an assassination attempt. Unfortunately, we
had to respond,'' Lugo said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party says the security guards shot first and that
members of the opposition party then invaded the house, killed
Terrero and beat up his wife and a son.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why would we make such an attempt from the house of a man who
was in shorts and no shirt, with his children and his wife in the
house?'' Ramon Fadul, a Liberation Party central committee member,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia is a left-leaning politician who has threatened to
prosecute leading members of the government for alleged corruption
if he wins.
</P>
<P>
   Government supporters fear a Mejia victory could reverse
progress made by the administration of Leonel Fernandez, which has
overseen a 50 percent expansion in the economy by privatizing state
companies and encouraging trade.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez is barred by law from running for another term in the
May 16 election, and Danilo Medina is running as the Liberation
Party candidate. Also competing in the election is former President
Joaquin Balaguer of the Social Christian Reformist Party.

<HEADLINE> Court Asked To Reject Elian Asylum  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juan Miguel Gonzalez asked a federal appeals
court Monday to reject the political asylum claims filed on behalf
of his son, Elian, by the boy's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The motion was filed in a brief submitted to the 11th U.S. Court
of Appeals in Atlanta by the lawyer for the senior Gonzalez,
Gregory Craig.
</P>
<P>
   The brief said the father believes that after a five-month legal
tangle in the United States, Elian ''craves the familiarity of his
own bedroom'' in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, attorneys for the boy's great-uncle in Miami, Lazaro
Gonzalez, filed a 40-page brief Monday, arguing the Immigration and
Naturalization Service subverted Elian's right to apply for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''The notion that an agency can, without preexisting criteria,
opt to avoid its mandatory duty to duly consider an individual's
entitlement by prejudging the merits in a cursory fashion in
advance of the required adjudication profoundly offends any
principle of fairness or due process,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   The great-uncle also asked the court to appoint an independent
guardian to represent the Elian's legal interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian is truly not invisible before the eyes of our laws and
urgently needs a guardian,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   The brief filed by Elian's father asked the appeals court to
uphold a March 21 ruling by a U.S. District judge in Miami that the
court has no right to second guess the government on matters of
asylum. The appeals court has scheduled a hearing for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   The March ruling was appealed to the Atlanta court by Elian's
Miami relatives. The Cuban boy stayed with them for almost five
months after his rescue at sea last November. He was forcibly
seized from the relatives by federal agents on April 22 and
reunited with his father. They are now staying at a private home at
a secluded area on Maryland's Eastern Shore, awaiting completion of
the legal process.
</P>
<P>
   Craig argued in the brief that when ''Juan Miguel speaks for his
son, he does so without conflict and without coercion.
</P>
<P>
   ''To prolong this case by requiring an asylum hearing, where the
Immigration and Naturalization Service has already found there is
no objective evidence to support a finding that Elian will suffer
persecution on his return to Cuba, would result in a substantial
interference with Juan Miguel's basic right to raise his child and
would cause great damage to his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also sought to debunk the notion that the elder
Gonzalez has not been free to speak his mind since his arrival on
U.S. soil on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day, ''Juan Miguel has been free to state his views
honestly and openly, without coercion, without fear of
retribution,'' the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   If he had wanted to defect from Cuba, there was ''no better
time'' than when he met with Attorney General Janet Reno and INS
Doris Meissner on April 8, Craig said. No Cuban diplomats attended
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The motion also said the father believes that a six-year old boy
found adrift in the Atlantic Ocean and now caught up in the
American legal system ''craves the familiarity of his own bedroom''
in Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Elian gets home to Cardenas, he will be greeted by his
friends and family,'' it said. ''He will return to school. He will
play in the streets of his hometown. He will make trips to the
beach and the resort where his father works. Juan Miguel intends to
raise his child as he sees fit and where he sees fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also ridiculed the asylum petition filed on Elian's
behalf by Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great uncle in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian signed an application for asylum apparently written in
English,'' the brief said. ''That this six-year old boy could not
have had the slightest understanding of the meaning of that form is
self evident, not only from life experience but also from the fact
that he does not read Spanish, much less English.''
</P>
<P>
   The motion suggested that Elian might have been under duress,
''perhaps susceptible, as children are, to subtle pressures and an
eagerness to please.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, the motion said that Lazaro Gonzalez's sole
contact with Elian occurred in 1998 when the uncle visited Juan
Miguel's home in Cardenas, about a two-hour drive east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to Juan Miguel, Lazaro paid no attention to the boy
during that visit,'' the brief said. ''Lazaro slept during the day,
went to the resort at Varadero Beach in the evenings and drank
during the night.''

<HEADLINE> ABC stations dropped from Time Warner cable systems  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an escalating corporate dispute, ABC was
blacked out in the homes of 3.5 million Time Warner cable customers
around the country Monday -- just as the ''sweeps'' period was
beginning and Regis Philbin was about to quiz celebrities on ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ABC programming, Time Warner customers saw a message
saying, ''Disney has taken ABC away from you'' on the channel that
normally carries WABC-TV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, the only way many viewers could see ABC
shows was the old-fashioned way -- by disconnecting the cable and
rigging up an antenna -- or finding a friend with a satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co., ABC's corporate parent, is fighting over
how much money Time Warner must compensate Disney for the right to
carry some of its cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   The affected customers were in seven markets served by ABC-owned
television stations. About 1.5 million were in the New York City
area, 665,000 in Houston and 440,000 in Raleigh-Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller numbers of customers in the Los Angeles; Philadelphia;
Toledo, Ohio; and Fresno, Calif., markets also lost service.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout was particularly ill-timed for ABC, America's
top-rated broadcaster. Its most popular show, ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' began its first celebrity week Monday. Viewers who
saw the opening night of the miniseries ''Arabian Nights'' on
Sunday risked missing the conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, ABC is airing the Kentucky Derby, the
Daytime Emmy Awards and virtually all of the season finales of its
regular series.
</P>
<P>
   Disney appealed for help from the Federal Communications
Commission on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Each side angrily blamed the other for the blackout, and each
said FCC law was on its side: Time Warner said it was against the
law to carry a station without a transmission deal, while ABC said
a cable operator cannot stop airing a broadcast station during a
sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeps, a period when ratings are used to set local
advertising rates, began Thursday and run until May 24.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides had no negotiations scheduled but were to meet
with FCC staff members late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Padden, executive vice president of governmental
relations at Disney, said it was a ''damnable lie'' to blame Disney
for pulling the plug.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are arrogant manipulators,'' Padden said. ''Some
deranged individual has deprived all of these people of ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney had offered a series of deadline extensions after the
original national transmission deal expired Dec. 31. The most
recent deadline, offered in March, expired at 12:01 a.m. on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner said Disney's demands to carry the Disney Channel
and separate cartoon and soap opera networks on its system would
have added $300,000 in costs to its customers; Disney said it had
offered a fair market price.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's abundantly clear to anybody who understands the real
situation -- this is about extorting money from cable customers,''
said Michael Luftman, Time Warner spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Since the blackout affects less than 4 percent of the nation's
100 million TV homes, the dispute isn't likely to shake ABC's hold
on the top spot in the season's ratings, said Jon Mandel of Grey
Advertising. But advertisers are expected to demand ABC compensate
them for the lost customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time such a dispute has deprived cable
customers of their favorite stations, but it is the largest outage,
said Simon Applebaum, senior editor of Cablevision magazine.
Earlier this year, a fight left some 400,000 Cox Communications
customers in the Washington, D.C., area without the Fox network for
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock fell on Wall Street Monday as investors worried
that a drawn-out battle could have an impact on the Disney's
earnings, which have been boosted recently by ABC's comeback.
Disney shares were off $1.62{ at $42 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Time Warner shares slipped $1.06\ to $88.87{.
</P>
<P>
   ABC filed a petition for emergency relief from the FCC. It is
unclear what the commission might do. Typically, the FCC does not
get involved in private contractual matters.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the FCC's cable bureau met with both parties
separately Monday, and agency officials continued to urge the
companies to work out their differences. In the absence of any
agreement, the commission has asked Time Warner to respond by the
end of Tuesday to the petition filed by ABC so that the agency can
conduct an expedited review of the matter, an agency spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides seemed to be settling in for a long haul; Time Warner
was offering to reimburse customers who bought a device enabling
them to switch to antennas, and Disney was mulling a plan to give
rebates to customers who buy satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that given the city's
canyons of tall buildings, the idea of getting an antenna is
''almost insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an example of what happens when you allow monopolies
to get too big and they become too predatory and then the consumer
is hurt,'' he said. ''For the life of me, I can't figure out why
the Justice Department has spent so much time on Microsoft and so
little on this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of phone calls complaining about the blackout came in
to the studio where ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee'' is produced,
a spokeswoman said. Philbin discussed the situation with his
co-host, Kathie Lee Gifford, calling the blackout a shame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can we go home?'' Gifford jokingly asked.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Locus of Terrorism Shifts  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three countries courted by the United States
for a better relationship -- Iran, Syria and North Korea -- were
again branded as sponsors of terrorism by the State Department
Monday along with Cuba, Iraq, Libya and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   A yearly report showed a shift in concern from the Middle East
to South Asia, where Afghanistan is a favorite haven for terrorists
and Pakistan has backed groups that engage in violence in Kashmir,
a territory contested with India.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sheehan, who runs the department's counterterrorism
office, said the Taliban, which controls most of Afghanistan,
professes to want good relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But numerous terrorist groups operate on territory Taliban
controls, he said at a news conference that coincided with release
of the 107-page glossy report.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the loosely linked al-Qaida organization, headed
by Saudi Osama bin Laden. He is accused of masterminding the
bombings last year of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. A
total of 230 people died.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Pakistan government has tolerated terrorists
living and moving freely within its territory and supported groups
in Kashmir that engage in violence, said the report entitled
''Patterns of Global Terrorism 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is not branded a sponsor of terrorism, though. Under
law, that would prohibit all but humanitarian assistance from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, however, is listed again. In 85 words, the government of
Fidel Castro is charged with continuing to provide haven to several
terrorists and U.S. fugitives. Colombia's two largest terrorist
organizations, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the
National Liberation Army, maintained a permanent presence on the
island, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has maintained long-standing
sanctions against Cuba and avoided any diplomatic overtures. It
also keeps an icy distance from Iraq and Sudan. The U.S. stance
toward Libya is under review.
</P>
<P>
   Two Libyans will be tried this week for the deaths of the 270
passengers, crew and residents of Lockerbie, Scotland, when a Pan
Am jumbo jet was blown out of the sky in December 1988. Among the
victims were 189 Americans aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said Libya will remain on the terrorism list. But he
also said world sanctions had driven Libya ''out of the terrorism
business'' and its links to terrorism have dropped dramatically
since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is weighing whether to
revoke a ban on U.S. travel to the North African country.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Syria and North Korea, all courted for a better
relationship with the U.S., were condemned in the report.
</P>
<P>
   It said Iran and Syria have continued to support regional
terrorist groups that seek to destroy the U.S. peace campaign in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, President Clinton journeyed to Geneva, Switzerland,
this year to urge Syrian President Hafez Assad to resume
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And Albright, in a landmark initiative, offered a dialogue to
Iran that could lead to a restoration of relations broken after
Iranian militants overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took its
residents hostage. Albright has stressed, though, that the agenda
would include U.S. allegations Iran backed terrorists and tried to
subvert the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is accused in the report of providing haven to
Japanese Communist League-Red Army Faction members who participated
in the hijacking of a Japanese Airlines flight to North Korea in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   American officials meet regularly with North Korean officials
and the United States provided food and arranged for two civilian
reactors and energy supplies in a trade-off for North Korea
suspending its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said the number of persons killed or
wounded in terrorist attacks fell sharply last year -- to 233 killed
and 706 wounded from 741 and 5,952, respectively, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the report was ''largely heartening,'' with the
number of Americans killed the lowest in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   She also criticized Congressional proposals to cut more than $2
billion from Clinton's request for international affairs funds.
''These reductions will harm plans to upgrade security and
complicate efforts to counter terror,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan rejected the report as unfair, saying terrorism is a
global problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Terrorism is a problem worldwide, one that everyone should be
concerned about and one that Pakistan's chief executive is
committed to fight against,'' said Javed Jabbar, a special advisor
to Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued in the Afghan capital of Kabul by the Taliban
foreign ministry dismissed the report as biased. ''It shows that
the United States is ignorant of our history and our religion.
Islam forbids terrorism,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Which Sonics Team Will Show?  </HEADLINE>
By LUIS CABRERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- It's an ongoing game-day mystery for Seattle
SuperSonics coach Paul Westphal: Which team will show up against
the Utah Jazz?
</P>
<P>
   Will it be the Sonics who came out lifeless for two first-round
playoff pastings by the Jazz last week?
</P>
<P>
   Or will it be the team that was in command from the start of an
89-78 home victory Saturday that warded off a sweep and forced
Wednesday night's Game 4?
</P>
<P>
   ''This team has been up and down all year,'' Westphal said after
an intense, refereed practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can beat anybody, and we can lose to anybody,'' he said.
''Let's just hope the good guys come out Wednesday and we can beat
Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz, back in Salt Lake City to prepare for Game 4, said
they knew the Sonics weren't going to roll over in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't do a lot of things, and they did everything,'' power
forward Karl Malone told The Deseret News. Malone scored 30 points
in the loss, following a dominating 50-point effort in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted it more; they got it,'' forward Bryon Russell said
of the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The victory came at ''desperation time, and Wednesday's going to
be the same,'' Sonics power forward Vin Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Key for Seattle will be the play of Rashard Lewis and a
re-energized Ruben Patterson, who made minimal contributions in
Games 1 and 2 but gave his teammates a lift off the bench in Game 3
with 13 points and crucial hustle plays.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 20, a 6-foot-10 forward who hits the 3 consistently
enough for Westphal to plug him in at guard on occasion, poses
matchup problems for 6-4 Jeff Hornacek and the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ''With me and Rashard in the game at the same time, that's a
real advantage for us,'' said Patterson, a 6-foot-6 small forward.
''I mean, who are they going to put Hornacek on? They can't put him
on me, and they damned sure can't put him on Rashard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis hit two quick 3s to open Game 3, and finished with 14
points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said he's been impressed by the veteran-quality play of
Patterson, 22, and Lewis, both second-year players with no previous
playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys aren't afraid,'' he said. ''Rashard has really
developed nicely. He goes out there and plays his game against
Utah. I guess he doesn't know he's not supposed to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said his confidence has grown as Westphal has increased
his minutes, and hitting the early jumpers helped.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm always going to be crashing the boards and getting the
rebounds, but if I'm hitting my jump shot, I'm going to have a good
game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the home-crowd lift was huge Saturday after two games
in the hostile Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the loudest crowd we've heard all year, and it helped
us. You saw it in Ruben and the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton took late command of the scrimmage Monday, barking
orders at teammates, motioning them inside or out, teaching on the
fly after botched plays. Payton, who didn't give interviews, had
spoken out after the two losses in Utah, saying the Sonics needed
him directing the offense at point guard instead of waiting on the
floor for an open shot.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal put Payton back at the point Saturday, and the All-Star
responded with 23 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds in 48
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a thing that was blown out of proportion to an
incredible extent,'' Westphal said Monday. ''We have some
competitive and even combative guys, and they don't like to lose.
If we go down, we're going to go down swinging.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Opens Debate on Education  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Democrats pushing for gun-control and new
teachers and Republicans touting voucher proposals and block grants
accused each other Monday of standing in the way of fixing
America's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's talk education reform,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said as the Senate began rewriting the law governing
federal K-12 school aid. ''Let's not get distracted by all kinds of
non-relevant, extraneous topics.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat leaders promised Monday to offer amendments -- proposed
changes to the law -- that they said would bring the nation more
teachers, smaller classes and gun-free schools. Without those
plans, the Clinton administration said Monday, the bill would be
vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties will battle over giving states more freedom to
combine or transfer funds they get for such programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''A block grant cannot teach a child to read,'' said Sen. Patty
Murray, D-Wash. ''Let's invest in the things we know work. Smaller
classes, a good teacher ... those specific things can help teach a
child to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Republicans criticized Democrats for not supporting
school choice and steering away from the basics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our students today are caught up in all kinds of studies of
minorities of one kind or another and fads of the day,'' said Sen.
Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. ''And they are not as well-educated about
traditional concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate lawmakers planned to meet Tuesday to hash out compromises
on how many proposals could be offered for the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act, a 35-year-old law that expires this year.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrat Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota has said the
education bill school safety programs can provide a good
opportunity for the Senate to address gun-control. Measures such as
mandatory trigger-locks have languished in a juvenile justice bill
since last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who can control the bill's fate, hasn't decided whether he
would try to block any gun-control proposals, said his spokesman
John Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're always searching for an agreement to try to get it
done,'' he said. ''Many would like to change it into a giant gun
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., who is helping manage the Senate's
work, said the Republicans are not out to limit floor debate:
''We're prepared for a lengthy debate with rational limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Any public discussion of education gives both parties a further
chance to tout their message on the popular election issue. Both
sides say Senate proposals in the coming weeks could mirror the
platforms assembled on the campaign trail by Vice President Gore
and Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gov. Bush is not a defender of the status quo,'' Coverdell
said. ''His ideas are very much in concert with what is being
discussed here.''

<HEADLINE> Working poor would get tax credit, under proposed bill  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Nearly 300,000 working families earning
$20,000 or less would get a state tax credit that could put as much
as $400 back into their pockets next year.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, A-40, passed the Assembly budget committee Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It expands the federal Earned Income Tax Credit to state
taxpayers and would be phased in over four years.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year, families earning $15,000 would get a check
from the state, ranging from $196 to $338. Those earning between
$15,000 and $20,000 would get a credit of between $114 and $229
that would offset their total tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   The amounts would increase each year until the program is fully
implemented in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, a bill sponsor, said the measure
would help working families who have trouble making ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the first piece of legislation that changes the income
tax structure in our state,'' Collins, R-Salem, said. ''When you're
working in New Jersey, we in the Legislature want to do what we can
to help, in any way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first year of the program, families would receive 10
percent of the Earned Income Tax Credit they get from the federal
government for the 2000 tax year.
</P>
<P>
   That would increase to 15 percent in 2001, 17.5 percent in 2002
and 20 percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the rebate depends on a family's income and size.
In the first year, a family with one child, earning $10,000 or less
would get a $238 check.
</P>
<P>
   When the program is fully implemented, families could get
anywhere from $238 to $823.
</P>
<P>
   Working poor families are also getting another break this year.
A new law, signed last year and also sponsored by Collins, raises
the threshold at which families have to pay state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   That threshold used to be $7,500. This year, anyone making
$15,000 or less doesn't have to pay state taxes. Next year, the
threshold will rise to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   That means that by tax year 2001, all families that qualify for
the state Earned Income Tax Credit would get a check from the
state, even though they paid no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ciro Scalera, director of the Association for Children of New
Jersey, said these two changes are helping to put New Jersey in the
forefront in helping the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two years ago ... New Jersey ranked among the lowest of all
states'' when it came to helping working poor, Scalera said. ''New
Jersey will be moving from the lowest of states to much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Others also applauded the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the type of program that helps people stand tall,''
said Marlene Lao-Collins, associate director of the New Jersey
Catholic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which Gov. Christie Whitman first proposed during
her budget address in January, would cost $48 million in the first
year, increasing to about $106 million after four years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money would come from federal welfare funds. The
state has saved millions on welfare, thanks to plummeting welfare
rolls that most credit to the economy and tougher welfare laws.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Joseph Charles, D-Hudson, praised Collins' measure,
but asked that he consider ''friendly amendments.'' Those included
expanding the income eligibility to $30,000 -- the same as the
federal government allows.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to make the program available to single people and
childless couples, like the federal program does. And, he wants to
do away with the phase-in, giving people 20 percent of their
federal tax credit in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblyman Paul DiGaetano, R-Passaic, a co-sponsor, said
Charles' version would cost too much, estimating the price tag to
be nearly $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kornmehl, assistant state treasurer, said expanding the
income limits to $30,000 would cost about $24 million more
annually, once the program is fully implemented. He didn't know the
cost for giving the tax credit to single people and childless
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the current legislation provides a good starting
point and that it could be expanded later.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey would become the 12th state to offer a state tax
credit for the working poor.

<HEADLINE> Israel Remembers Holocaust Jews  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Flags were lowered to half-staff throughout
Israel Monday evening as Israelis remembered the six million Jews
murdered in the Nazi Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Israel marks the day, officially called Holocaust and Heroism
Memorial Day, in part by honoring those who resisted the Nazis.
Israelis grow up on stories of national heroism and still find it
difficult to digest the fact that most European Jews were helpless
before the Nazi death machine.
</P>
<P>
   For Israelis, the Holocaust is proof of the need for an
independent Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The army's general staff held its weekly meeting at Lohamei
Hagetaot, a communal village in northern Israel founded by
survivors of the death camps and named after the Jews who revolted
against the Nazis in Warsaw and other eastern European cities.
</P>
<P>
   Army chief Lieut. Gen. Shaul Mofaz said holding the meeting at
Lohamei Hagetaot was ''a gesture of fighters to fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   At Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Memorial, six Holocaust
survivors kindled flames in memory of the six million victims.
Survivors recalled how the Holocaust ripped families apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw my brother Moshe bending over a German and striking him
with an ax,'' said Kopel Kolpanitsky, 74, who survived an uprising
among Jews trapped in a ghetto in Lakhva, Belarus. ''I shouted,
'Moshe, get away!' But he made a gesture meaning, 'You get away.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kolpanitsky, then 16 years old, escaped into the forest, but his
mother, two brothers and sister were killed in the revolt, which
began after the Jews learned the ghetto was about to be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never saw my family again,'' Kolpanitsky said.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony was broadcast on a video screen at the ceremony as
he lit one of the six beacons.
</P>
<P>
   Movie houses, theaters and other places of entertainment were
closed, and radio and television stations broadcast somber music
and interviews with Holocaust survivors. Tuesday morning, a siren
will sound for one minute, and Israelis will literally stop in
their tracks to stand silently in memory of the victims. The
observance begins at sundown Monday and ends at sundown Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shevah Weiss, chairman of the Yad Vashem executive council, said
the day recalled ''sad and terrible memories of the darkest period
in the world's history.'' Weiss, himself a Holocaust survivor,
said: ''Europe became a lake of frozen Jewish blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak said the state of Israel is the
decisive answer to Hitler's scheme to ''wipe the name of Israel off
the face of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who lost relatives in the Holocaust, promised that
''never again will a Jew be a son without a home, and never again
will a Jew be defenseless.''
</P>
<P>
   A report released Monday expressed concern over Holocaust denial
and anti-Semitism on the Internet. Experts at Tel Aviv University
said the number of attacks throughout the world has dropped in the
past year, but their severity increased.
</P>
<P>
   Peace negotiations with the Palestinians in the southern Israeli
city of Eilat were suspended until the memorial day ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''We share with the Israeli people the feeling of pain and
sorrow on this day, a day of tragedy in Jewish history,'' said
senior Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo. ''We hope that we
all learn the lesson of the necessity to end the days of tragedy
which both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples experienced.''

<HEADLINE> Reds-Pirates Game Postponed  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- This isn't the way the Pittsburgh Pirates
wanted to get Ken Griffey Jr. out.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds-Pirates game Monday night was rained out and will be
made up as part of a Sept. 8 twi-night doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle (2-0), the Reds' scheduled starter Monday, will
start Tuesday night in Philadelphia, with Steve Parris (1-3) moving
back a day to Wednesday and Pete Harnisch (0-3) starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates left-hander Jimmy Anderson (1-0), who was to have
started Monday, was bumped from his start so Jason Schmidt (0-2)
can pitch Tuesday night in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt has been on the disabled list since April 19 with
inflammation in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be fresh,'' Anderson said, who will go approximately 10
days between starts. ''I'll just go down to the bullpen and throw
harder than I normally would between starts. I don't like to miss a
start, but Jason needs to get out and pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his previous three starts when he threw as many as 137
pitches, Schmidt will be limited to about 85 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt last pitched on April 14, getting a no-decision in an
8-5, 12-inning loss to the New York Mets. In his other two starts,
he lost to the Astros 5-2 in the season opener and to Randy Johnson
and Arizona 1-0 on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to get him going,'' manager Gene Lamont said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds rallied to win two of the final three games of the
abbreviated Pirates series, with Griffey's three-run homer leading
them to a 6-2 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey continues to learn NL pitchers, and is still adjusting
to his new league, but has seven homers and 24 homers despite a
.217 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are off to a less-than-brisk 12-12 start, but manager
Jack McKeon isn't disappointed. He agrees with Griffey that it
takes time for new players to blend into their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a good club,'' McKeon said. ''We're just trying to
put everything together. A lot of clubs are trying to do that right
now. I like the way our starting pitching did the last time out,
and we've gotten pretty good production out of our bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds also started slowly last season, going 9-12 before
finishing 96-67.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a different ballclub than we had last year,'' McKeon
said. ''We've got some big hitters coming over here, and I don't
know this for a fact, but it seems like it takes a little while for
everybody to blend together. You go down the list, and we might
have 8-10 guys who weren't here last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes awhile for guys to get used to each other, to
understand what the other guy does, and develop camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates made a roster move, designating right-hander Brad
Clontz (0-0, 5.14 ERA in five appearances) for assignment to clear
a roster spot for Schmidt.

<HEADLINE> White House Hits GOP Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Congress poised to begin writing
election-year spending bills, the Clinton administration is lashing
out at Republicans for choosing to emphasize tax cuts at the
expense of schools, veterans health care, debt reduction and other
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to be delivered Tuesday, White House budget director
Jack Lew castigated Republicans for ''a bankrupt approach which
would lead either to misguided spending policies or undermine our
ability to pay down the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   A draft copy of Lew's address to the Urban Institute, obtained
by The Associated Press, laid down the administration's markers for
this year's budget fight. The White House wants a limited tax cut
and a focus on reducing the national debt, creating a new
prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, expanding health
coverage for low-income Americans and providing more money for
schools, technology and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''By passing an oversized tax scheme, Congress has effectively
made the decision that tax cuts are more important than any of the
other choices that might be made,'' Lew said in his prepared
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   And signaling that the White House is comfortable pitting GOP
tax cut plans against politically popular debt reduction, Lew
asked, ''Will we plan ahead with realism and responsibility or
simply live for the moment, hoping that everything will be just
fine in the future?''
</P>
<P>
   This week, subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations
committees plan to write the first of the 13 annual spending bills
for the coming fiscal year. GOP leaders hope to complete the
measures by early fall -- without a major showdown with President
Clinton -- so lawmakers can go home early and campaign for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   On April 14, Congress approved a GOP-written $1.83 trillion
budget for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1. It called for a
five-year tax cut of at least $150 billion and perhaps more than
$200 billion, depending on lawmakers' future decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The spending blueprint reserved the entire Social Security
surplus, projected at nearly $1 trillion through 2005, for debt
reduction. It also called for increases for some education,
veterans and other programs, and set aside up to $40 billion for
prescription benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Final decisions on tax and spending will be made as Congress
begins working seriously on such bills. But for now, Republicans
say their plans are a sound division of federal resources.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., said Lew's speech reflects ''the insatiable need of the
White House to spend more money.'' He said the administration is
trying to ''paint us as extremists when they know we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The speaker has provided balanced leadership and it drives
Jack Lew nuts,'' Feehery said.

<HEADLINE> Big Hurdle for Jets Testaverde  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J (AP) -- For all the hills he runs, the agility
drills he does and seemingly endless passes he throws, New York
Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde still has questions about the
Achilles' tendon injury that cost him last season.
</P>
<P>
   While the tendon in his left leg seemingly has healed properly,
Testaverde indicated Monday after playing 16 holes of golf at the
Upper Montclair Country Club that he had obstacles to clear before
he knows he's back.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to be the two-a-days, it's going to be the
first live game, preseason, when I have to step up, take off and
put pressure on that foot to push off and get away,'' Testaverde
said. ''That's the next hurdle for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde tore the Achilles' tendon in the second quarter of
the Jets' opener against New England trying to recover a fumble by
halfback Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has been running and working out and last month he
got together with new offensive Dan Henning and threw passes.
Henning taped the sessions and Testaverde said there was no
indication he was favoring either foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't just want to return as a player in the league,''
Testaverde said. ''I want to return as a player who plays on a
consistently high level each week, just like I did in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde led the Jets to the AFC title game in '98 and was
picked for the Pro Bowl in his best NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   While rehabilitation for the injury takes from eight months to a
year, the 34-year-old Testaverde said he could have played on
Monday if the Jets had a game.
</P>
<P>
   If and when he does return, Testaverde knows he will be playing
on a different team. Coach Bill Parcells retired and was replaced
by Al Groh. Keyshawn Johnson is also gone, traded to Tampa Bay just
before the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he wishes Johnson was still with the team,
Testaverde said the Jets will get by without him.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the changes we've had it will be hard to say how we
respond,'' Testaverde said. ''With all we went through last year,
this team has gotten mentally tough. I think we'll be pretty good.
I think we'll have a chance.''

<HEADLINE> Suns' Rogers Wins Sixth Man Award  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Rodney Rogers, soured by years of losing with the
Los Angeles Clippers, capped his season of renewal Monday as the
overwhelming choice for the NBA's Sixth Man Award.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Suns' forward received 104 of a possible 121 votes
from a panel of sports writers and sportscasters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of like Shaq for MVP,'' Suns coach Scott Skiles
said, referring to Shaquille O'Neal's expected runaway with that
award. ''I almost feel like, how could anybody vote for anyone
else?''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers received 86 percent of the votes, the second-largest
percentage in the 18 years the Sixth Man Award has been presented.
Cliff Robinson, now Rogers' teammate, received 90.8 percent of the
votes for the award when he was with the Portland Trail Blazers in
1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had big games when we needed big games. He hit shots when
we needed big shots,'' Skiles said. ''He's done that for us all
year long.''
</P>
<P>
   Four unhappy seasons with the Clippers left Rogers embittered
and disillusioned, attitudes that vanished once he joined the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I wanted to do was come in and be a winner and not lose
all the time,'' Rogers said. ''I'd been losing my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who signed a free-agent contract with Phoenix for the $2
million exception allowed over the salary cap, averaged 13.8 points
and 5.5 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7 forward was a threat inside and outside. He was
fourth in the NBA in 3-point field goal percentage at .439.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were 35-11 in games in which Rogers scored at least 13
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody wants to start but everybody can't start,'' Rogers
said. ''My main thing always has been if you're in there when the
game is on the line, that's more important than starting, when you
can help your team win ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is the third Suns player to win the award, joining Danny
Manning in 1998 and Eddie Johnson in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, an assistant to coach Danny Ainge when the Suns decided
to sign Rogers, didn't expect him to be this good. With the
Clippers, Rogers had a reputation of being overweight and lazy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had my doubts just from reputation,'' Skiles said. ''But it
was clear from the beginning that Rodney was nothing like his
reputation had been. He is such a great teammate, everybody likes
him so much and he works so hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a guy you're genuinely happy for when anything good
happens to him because he's really a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from lazy, Rogers missed only one practice all season. He
was the only Phoenix player to appear in all 82 games, 75 of them
as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're losing, a lot of things happen,'' Rogers said.
''You get very frustrated. Sometimes you get a temper, those sorts
of things. Like I said, I fell into a lot of bad habits playing
with Denver and the Clippers, falling into that category where
you're always supposed to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming here I had to change my whole attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' bad experience in Los Angeles turned worse in his final
season, when he was relegated to sparse playing time off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were trying to do whatever they could to hurt me,'' he
said, ''so I had to just sit there and rot until the season was
over. I was just glad there were a lot of teams interested in me
and Phoenix stepped up to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles kept Rogers as a reserve even when Tom Gugliotta went
down with a season-ending knee injury. Instead, rookie Shawn Marion
got the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, Rodney deserved to be a starter,'' Skiles said,
''but I just felt naked without having him come off the bench, and
he totally understood that. The way he's accepted that, coming off
the bench and still being productive, that's not an easy thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ''And obviously he's done it better than anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Workers Strike Ohio State Univ.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- About 1,900 janitors, drivers and other
workers at Ohio State University went on strike Monday, disrupting
trash pickup, meals and bus service on the 48,000-student campus.
</P>
<P>
   Some professors canceled classes or held them outdoors so
students would not have to cross picket lines. But campus life
seemed close to normal for many others.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between the university and Local 4501 of the
Communications Workers of America broke down early Monday, and no
further talks were scheduled. The previous three-year contract
expired March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The workers average about $10 an hour and want an immediate
$2-an-hour raise.
</P>
<P>
   The university has offered $1 an hour for the year beginning
July 1 for skilled trade and service workers and 50 cents an hour
in each of the following two years.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Josephson, president of the union local, said workers are
prepared to strike ''until we have fair and equitable solutions for
our members.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State President William Kirwan said ''it is in the
university's interest to have a fair, equitable and competitive
salary structure.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no intention of letting this drag out,'' Kirwan said.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Said Taking Toll on Tanzania  </HEADLINE>
By RODRIQUE NGOWI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- President Benjamin Mkapa said
Monday that AIDS is taking a heavy toll on Tanzania's economy as
large numbers of the country's trained work force are succumbing to
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some ministries lose about 20 employees each month to AIDS,
and 365 workers of the Tanzania Electric Supply Company died
between 1995 and April this year,'' Mkapa said in an address
marking May Day.
</P>
<P>
   He said the hardest-hit ministries including defense, education
and health.
</P>
<P>
   Mkapa's remarks came as the Clinton administration in Washington
defended its decision to qualify the worldwide increase in AIDS
cases as a threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Thurman, director of the White House Office of National
AIDS Policy, said AIDS has become such an epidemic that, in years
to come, it threatens to destabilize nations and the economies of
whole continents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to respond to this because we've never seen a crisis
like HIV and AIDS globally,'' Thurman said. ''We're beginning to
understand that this epidemic, not only has health implications,
but has implications as a fundamental development issue, an
economic issue and a stability and security issue.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pilot Shot Down by Soviets Honored  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEALE AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- The Air Force chose the 40th
anniversary of U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers' downing over the
Soviet Union to honor the Cold War pilot with medals he had long
been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Powers' family accepted a Distinguished Flying Cross, Department
of Defense Prisoner of War Medal and National Defense Service Medal
on his behalf during a ceremony Monday on the tarmac at Beale Air
Force Base in Northern California. Powers died in a helicopter
crash in Los Angeles in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Powers' spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union on May 1,
1960 and he was imprisoned there for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mind still boggles (over) what we asked this man to do:
Fly in a plane like this over downtown Moscow, alone, unarmed and
unafraid, then to suffer in prison during what indeed was a war,
the Cold War,'' said Brig. Gen. Kevin Chilton, who presented two of
the awards.
</P>
<P>
   Because Powers was considered a CIA employee, not a member of
the military, he wasn't recognized as a POW. That changed in 1998,
when declassified Cold War documents revealed the mission was a
joint operation by the CIA and the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ''My dad was a hero,'' said Powers' daughter, Dee Powers-Rogers,
42, a supervisor for Northwest Airlines in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Powers-Rogers accepted the medals with her brother, Francis Gary
Powers Jr., and their mother, Sue Powers.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Sign Outfielder Sierra  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers signed outfielder
Ruben Sierra to a minor league contract Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra, a four-time All-Star who played for the Rangers from
1986-92, will join Triple-A Oklahoma of the Pacific Coast League on
Tuesday. Sierra, 34, was playing for Cancun in the Mexican League,
where he hit .355 with three homers and 12 RBIs in 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ruben was very persistent in wanting to get another
opportunity with the Texas Rangers organization,'' Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin said. ''We feel this is a low-risk situation
and we'll evaluate him on the Triple-A level over the next couple
of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Sierra was a non-roster invitee in the
Cleveland Indians major league spring training camp before being
released in late March. He last played in the majors with the White
Sox in 1998, hitting .216 with four homers and 11 RBIs in 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra, a four-time Rangers player of the year, has a career
.269 average with 239 homers and 1,041 RBIs. He eclipsed 100 RBIs
in a season four times.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra hit .294 with 28 homers and 82 RBIs in 1999 with Atlantic
City in the Independent Atlantic League.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also announced left-hander Justin Thompson has been
recalled from his rehab assignment at Oklahoma and remains on the
15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson complained of pain in his left shoulder when throwing
on the side in Baltimore Sunday. He was 1-0 with a 6.32 ERA in
three rehab starts. He allowed seven earned runs in 5.2 innings in
his last outing April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has been sidelined since undergoing arthroscopic
surgery to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder last August.
It is not known when he might pitch again on rehab assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also signed left-hander Tony Mounce to a minor league
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Mounce, 25, was 5-3 in 45 games with New Orleans and Jackson in
the Houston organization in 1999. He was released by the Astros in
spring training.

<HEADLINE> Miami Mayor, Manager Continue Battle  </HEADLINE>
By MEG RICHARDS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- On the same day the mayor accused him of extortion,
the embattled city manager on Monday named a new police chief to
replace the previous leader who resigned after fallout from the
Elian Gonzalez raid.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Donald Warshaw appointed Raul Martinez, a 24-year
veteran of the Miami Police Department and a former assistant
chief. Martinez becomes the first Hispanic to hold the position in
the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two years, Martinez, 50, has been an assistant city
manager, overseeing the parks and public works departments. As a
police officer, he headed internal affairs and worked in
intelligence and community policing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pledge to all of you, to be the chief of police for the
entire community,'' said Martinez, who was born in Cuba and came to
the United States when he was 12. ''I ask that we put away our
differences and look at all the common things that we have, and
make this city a great city.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's hiring comes as the fallout from the April 22 federal
raid and the way police handled protesters has swelled into a
struggle between Miami Mayor Joe Carollo and Warshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo, angered that Police Chief William O'Brien had not
notified him when federal agents told him that they were headed to
the home of Elian's relatives, demanded that Warshaw fire him.
Warshaw refused.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, the mayor had fired the city manager and O'Brien had
resigned, saying that Carollo was too divisive.
</P>
<P>
   However under the city charter, Warshaw's firing can't take
effect for 10 days, which would be Sunday. The charter also
specifies that the city manager names the police chief, with no
requirement the mayor be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's appointment as chief comes on the same day Carollo
made allegations that Warshaw blackmailed him. Carollo also
launched an investigation into allegations Warshaw misused city
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city manager sent an extortion demand to me that if I
fired him he would take me out as mayor. ... would file criminal
charges against me ... (and) I would lose my pension,'' Carollo
said. ''No city manager should be allowed to extort a mayor in any
city in America.''
</P>
<P>
   While police chief, Carollo said Warshaw charged personal
expenses to an American Express card and used a youth group's
office at the police department as the billing address.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw has said none of the organization's money was used to
pay his bills.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a blackmailer. I'm not an extortionist. I'm not really
sure where the mayor was going with that.''

<HEADLINE> Deal close on Adriaen's Landing  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The Senate was close to an agreement on
the $455 million Adriaen's Landing project Monday night, three days
after a dispute over labor issues threatened to tank the deal and
unravel the state's $12.3 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has been meeting with Senate Democrats on an
individual basis today,'' Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said. ''The
vast majority of them say they're fine with details of the
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagani would not disclose any details, and called the pact
''tentative.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the Hartford waterfront development include a 700-room
hotel, a convention center, entertainment and retail space and
nearly 400 housing units. Also part of the package is a $90 million
stadium in East Hartford for the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,400 construction jobs and more than 1,100 permanent jobs
are expected to be created.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly must decide whether to sink about $455
million of public money into the project, which will cost more than
$771 million. The public funding portion of the project is
contingent on a commitment of $210 million in private financing.
Rowland has said that threshold has been met.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterford Group, which has developed the Mohegan Sun casino
in Montville and operates other Connecticut hotels, is one of the
project's major private sponsors. Operators Len and Marc Wolman
have said they'll spend $20 million to build the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wolman's threatened to back out of the deal Friday when
some Senate Democrats wanted to introduce a measure requiring
binding arbitration to settle disputes between unionized hotel
workers and their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland rejected the demand, and said the measure was an attempt
by the Hotel &AMP; Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union of the
AFL-CIO to muscle out other labor groups trying to represent the
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The tussle jeopardized a bipartisan agreement on the state's
$12.3 billion budget when Rowland said Friday he would not approve
it until the Adriaen's Landing deal was passed in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Pagani said Monday that Rowland would sign a necessary document
to implement the budget as soon as the Adriaen's Landing package
passes both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly would then be expected to pass the budget.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Leader in Court Over Flag  </HEADLINE>
By GINA HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- A judge ruled Monday that the state's
lieutenant governor violated the Mississippi Constitution by her
actions in a flap over efforts to remove the Confederate emblem
from the state flag -- a decision that was quickly blocked by a
higher court.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by black lawmakers this year to address the flag have
been met with indifference by legislative leaders. To stall the
legislative budget process and highlight their concerns, black
leaders want bills read aloud before final passage.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a bill can take more than a half-hour and is a
long-standing practice to express displeasure with legislative
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck, the Senate's presiding officer, has refused
requests for bill readings.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a chancery judge, Denise Owens, issued a restraining
order that prohibited Tuck from stopping bills from being read.
Owens on Monday ruled that a ''failure to read in full a conference
report is a violation'' of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, a three-judge panel of the Mississippi Supreme
Court blocked enforcement of Owens' ruling until justices could
hear from both sides on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   During Owens' hearing, Special Assistant Attorney General Hunt
said never before has a judge issued a restraining order against a
legislative leader while lawmakers were in session.
</P>
<P>
   ''If ever there's a case in which the court should not get
involved, this is it,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuck said Monday was that she did not think the Legislature
should get involved in the flag issue because ''right now we have
more pressing matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The state flag has the design of the Confederate battle flag --
red background and blue diagonal stripes containing 13 white stars
-- in an upper corner. While the flag debate in Mississippi has not
taken on the proportions of the dispute in South Carolina, where a
boycott has cost the state millions of tourism dollars, it is
growing.

<HEADLINE> Moiso, Rush Leave UCLA for NBA Draft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA sophomores Jerome Moiso and JaRon Rush
informed the school Monday that they will enter the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, a 6-foot-10 swingman, was the Bruins' leading rebounder
last season, averaging 7.6 a game, and was second in scoring at
13.0 points.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Guadeloupe, West Indies, Moiso played in all 33
games and had 10 double-doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a difficult decision for me,'' Moiso said in a
statement released by UCLA. ''Playing in the NBA has been a goal of
mine and I feel this is the time for me to take the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush, a 6-foot-7 forward, was suspended by the NCAA for 24 games
for taking improper payments from an AAU coach in his native Kansas
City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   When Rush returned to the lineup late in the season, he helped
the Bruins, who were in danger of not making the NCAA tournament,
close the regular season strong and then advance to the third round
where they were beaten by Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, who played in the first three games of the season before
being suspended, averaged 12.1 points and 5.7 rebounds for the
season as the Bruins finished 21-12.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the decision to leave UCLA was a difficult one.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, at this point in time, this is the decision that is
best for my family and me,'' Rush said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Steve Lavin, attending a Pac-10 coaches' meeting in
Phoenix, said in a statement: ''We certainly wish Jerome and JaRon
good luck as they pursue their dream.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we would love for them to stay and play for our team
next season, these two young men have evaluated their individual
situations and have made the decisions they feel are best for
them.''

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Sues in Medicaid Case  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. filed a federal lawsuit
Monday to bar the state of Arkansas from paying large drug store
chains less than smaller stores for filling Medicaid prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest retailer seeks to block the state from
following a two-tiered reimbursement policy that reduces payments
to chains that operate 11 or more stores in the state. The
Bentonville-based company said the lawsuit was filed with the
federal court at Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The policy is discriminatory and violates the equal protection
clause of the 14th Amendment, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Human Services, which oversees the
Medicaid program providing health services for the poor, elderly
and disabled, implemented the new policy Friday after several
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Hanley, the DHS medical services director, said the agency
had authority from the federal Health Care Financing Administration
to start the plan March 1. The agency went ahead with the policy
Friday after the pharmacy industry failed to offer long-promised
cost-saving alternatives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart spokesman Jay Allen said the state offered no rational
basis for discriminating against larger pharmacy chains. DHS
officials ignored Wal-Mart's proposal to accept the lowest rate any
pharmacy in the state accepts for a Medicaid prescription, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state is the largest Medicaid customer and they want the
lowest possible rate. We are willing to do that,'' Allen said.
''Our only request and requirement is that all pharmacies in the
state be treated equally.''
</P>
<P>
   Rex Nelson, a spokesman for Gov. Mike Huckabee, said, ''We feel
we are on very solid legal ground in trying to get the taxpayers of
Arkansas the best deal possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the lawsuit was the company's last resort after six
months of negotiations failed to produce an agreement. He said
Wal-Mart would not pass along to customers what it says is an
average loss of $4 per Medicaid prescription under the state's new
reimbursement plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley put the change at about $2.50 per prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart operates pharmacies at 86 of its stores in the state.
Allen said Wal-Mart is the largest provider of Medicaid
prescriptions in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1999, he said, the company's average price for
Medicaid prescriptions was $6.65 less than the average prescription
price of other pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're biting the hand that is saving them literally millions
of dollars annually,'' Allen said. ''We have encouraged and offered
to help the state deal with the long-term issue here -- rising
medical costs. They have shown no interest in that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanley said Wal-Mart could afford to charge less because its
Medicaid clientele is generally ambulatory and children needing
lower-cost generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not provide the more costly drugs and services
that small independents do, he said, such as delivery, charge
accounts, 24-hour service and no nursing homes business or service
for AIDS and mental health patients needing higher-cost drugs.

Time Warner Pulls Plug on Disney in Key Markets

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission plans to hold
negotiations tonight with the Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner after the cable
giant pulled the plug on ABC programming. Disney, ABC's corporate parent, is
fighting over how much money Time Warner must compensate Disney for the right to
carry some of its cable channels. Disney had offered a series of deadline
extensions after the original national transmission deal expired Dec. 31. The
most recent deadline, offered in March, expired at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, when
ABC was blacked out in the homes of 3.5 million Time Warner cable customers in
the New York City area, Houston and Raleigh-Durham, N.C.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Batters hit 931 homers, a major league record for one month
and 140 more than last April, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, baseball's
official statistician. Not including the four hit in March during the Mets-Cubs
series in Japan, there's been an average of 2.55 homers per game, up 13 percent

<HEADLINE> Chiapas Bishop Pushes for Peace  </HEADLINE>
By ALEJANDRO RUIZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- The new bishop for
Chiapas state took over Monday, saying there will be no peace in
the troubled region as long as serious injustices persist.
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel made it clear during his
inaugural Mass attended by thousands of Roman Catholics in this
colonial city that he does not support violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''There cannot be true and lasting peace as long as there are
serious injustices and exclusion. But guns only provoke more
poverty and misery,'' Arizmendi said. ''Jesus Christ does not
accept resorting to violent methods.''
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Bishop Samuel Ruiz became known among
supporters as the ''bishop of the poor'' for his work with
poverty-stricken Indian peasants. But the government and
conservatives criticized Ruiz, linking him with leftist Zapatista
National Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's southernmost and poorest state has become increasingly
polarized since the Zapatistas began a short-lived rebellion six
years ago, seeking greater rights for Indians. Sporadic peace talks
are at a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi, formerly the bishop of Tapachula on the Chiapas
coast, is known as a moderate with some conservative positions. He
has sharply criticized the Zapatistas for choosing to wage an armed
rebellion. Nonetheless, he also has supported Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi on Monday called for reconciliation -- asking the army
to respect human rights, and the rebels and the government to make
an effort to advance peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chiapas is hungry and thirsty for peace,'' Arizmendi said.
''No more war, because no reason or person is superior to another.
It is time for reconciliation and brotherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   A tearful Ruiz, who said goodbye to the parishioners one by one,
expressed confidence that Arizmendi would continue his pastoral
work in the indigenous communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no doubt that the work of the diocese will not only
continue, but will keep leading the way toward challenging and
resolving the conflicts that arise along the path of this
diocese,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U of Georgia. Holds Student Memorial  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- The University of Georgia student newspaper
is usually filled on Monday mornings with stories of overzealous
weekend partying or sports results. But this semester, death has
pushed it all off the front page.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, 11 young students on this campus of 30,000 have
died of various causes -- a heart attack, cancer, a drug overdose, a
wreck on the way home for Easter and a fraternity prank gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The campus has been shaken by so much death among those so
young. Three weeks ago, the death toll was eight, and school
officials scheduled a memorial service at sunset Monday. Since
then, three more students have died.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's profoundly sad,'' said Rick Rose, an assistant vice
president whose job is to offer the university's condolences to
parents and friends of students who die.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Georgia has never lost more than eight
students in one term. Any more than three in a semester is out of
the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's service, the chapel bell, usually silent except for
victorious football Saturdays and late-night student pranks, tolled
28 times -- once for each university faculty and staff member and
student who died this academic year, including the 11 since
January.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, administrators said, was to get the campus to think of
the deaths as more than just a number.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a tally sheet,'' Rose said. ''Each one of these
people is the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Weld, a freshman, came to remember one friend -- Philip
Walsh, who was killed in a car accident last month. But she was
struck by the magnitude of the death toll.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bells kind of make you think,'' she said. ''It doesn't
seem like such a big number until you see it in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Denison, a member of the university's student government
whose friend Chris Moseley also was killed in a car crash, said
students opened the campus paper every Monday almost expecting to
read about another death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every weekend they were dying,'' he said. ''It's so hard to
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   The students left behind mourning families across the state,
from the beaches of St. Simons Island to the mountain town of
Dahlonega to the suburbs of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the deaths received much attention outside this
college town: Ben Grantham, a 20-year-old student from St. Simons
Island, was killed in a late March car crash that authorities say
was a fraternity initiation prank.
</P>
<P>
   Grantham was riding in the cargo hold of an Alpha Tau Omega
brother's sport utility vehicle, handcuffed and possibly
blindfolded, when the vehicle flipped and hit a tree, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent death was that of Katie Elizabeth Turner, a
first-year graduate student from Columbus who died April 22 of
lymphoma -- the second student to die that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   To one of her professors, Robert Nozza, she was a star -- a
student who had taken to a hearing-impaired child at a summer camp
and devoted her life to helping similarly disabled children. She
had the perfect balance of intense study habits and gentle patience
to succeed, Nozza said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All these students, they don't realize this of course, but we
kind of think of them as more than just numbers,'' he said. ''More
than just names on a transcript. We get attached to them in ways
they don't even realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourners who attended Monday's service said the tremendous loss
had united the campus in grief.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish this evening that I could give you some explanation for
what we have endured as a community,'' university president Michael
Adams told the crowd. ''But I'm sometimes at a loss for answers,
and this is one of those times.''

<HEADLINE> Pa. Shooting Spree Suspect Arraigned  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY BAIR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A white man was charged with murder and hate
crimes on Monday in the shooting deaths of a Jewish woman, an
Indian man and two Asian men in a rampage that targeted minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Scott Baumhammers, who was arraigned Friday night in the
killing the shooting of a black man at a karate studio, pleaded
innocent to all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers' lawyer, William Difenderfer, said that he'll try to
mount an insanity defense and seek to have Baumhammers moved to a
mental hospital from jail.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about 450 friends and neighbors attended the funeral
of one of the shooting victims, 63-year-old Anita ''Nicki'' Gordon,
who lived next door to Baumhammers' parents in the affluent
Pittsburgh suburb of Mount Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no place in her for hate, there was no place for
evil,'' Rabbi Stephen Steindel said at the funeral. ''She opened
her door last Friday and met violence and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Gordon was shot at least six times, including
through her hands as she apparently tried to protect herself.
Baumhammers is believed to have set a small fire in a back bedroom
of the Gordon home after the shooting, which alerted police and
firefighters to the death.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends said Gordon knew Baumhammers since he was
4. Daughter Linda Gordon was the same age as Baumhammers and
attended school with him.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spree's lone survivor, 25-year-old Sandeep Patel,
who's of Indian descent, remained hospitalized in critical
condition Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers was charged Monday with four murders, one attempted
murder, one aggravated assault, seven counts of ethnic
intimidation, two counts of institutional vandalism, two counts of
arson, one firearms violation and two counts of criminal mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Difenderfer said Baumhammers' parents, dentists Andrejs and
Inese Baumhammers, asked the lawyer to apologize for them and
''convey their utter sorrow'' about the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, employees at the Ya-Fei Chinese restaurant where
workers Ji-ye Sun and Thao Pham were killed Friday tried to reopen
but were unable to because of their grief.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is very emotional. We all gathered together and
started crying and crying, and nobody can face the public right
now. We just can't do it. We are going to try again on Saturday,''
restaurateur Kathy Yee said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Tuesday
on signs the American economy is still going strong. Tokyo stocks
rose following Wall Street's rally.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 108.66 yen, up 0.68 yen from late Monday but
below its late New York level of 108.79 yen. The New York quote was
the dollar's highest level since March 1, when the currency bought
110.31 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 150.95
points, or 0.82 percent, to 18,554.03 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Monday, the average closed up 429.38 points,
or 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar's firmness remained intact on
the back of strength in U.S. financial markets and continued
strength in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said Monday
that the U.S. manufacturing sector registered further growth in
April, and the government reported separately on a surprising rise
in construction spending in March.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 99.55 yen, up from
98.56 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices continued to rise in line with gains
in New York stocks and higher futures prices in Monday's Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 77.87
points to close at 10,811.78 on Monday. The technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 97.42 to close at 3,958.08.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 15.24 points, or 0.90 percent, to 1,710.47
points. The TOPIX closed up 46.36 points, or 2.8 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7450 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7350 percent. Its price
fell 0.08 point to 100.47.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Rebels Urged To Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday
urged southern Sudanese rebels to join a renewed cease-fire so U.N.
agencies and charities can safely deliver food and medicine to
hundreds of thousands of embattled villagers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudanese government agreed to renew, for three months, a
cease-fire that expired April 15. The accord came after a meeting
between on Saturday Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail and
Mohammed Saliheen, the head of the U.N. World Food Program in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army has yet to say whether
it will join the cease-fire, but Annan, who is on a tour of Africa,
said he hoped they will ''contribute to the creation of an enabling
environment for humanitarian operations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Secretary-General counts on the continued support of all
parties for the unhindered and safe provision by U.N. humanitarian
agencies and non-governmental organizations of relief to all those
in need of humanitarian aid throughout the country,'' spokesman
David Wimhurst said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The truce, however, has been routinely violated by both
government and rebel forces, with each side blaming the other.
</P>
<P>
   After Sudan obtained independence from Britain in 1956, a civil
war erupted, mainly over the degree of autonomy for the largely
Christian and animist south from the Muslim, Arab north. A shaky
peace reached in 1972 broke down in 1983, and an estimated 2
million people have since died as a result of fighting and
war-induced famine.
</P>
<P>
   The SPLA draws its support from among some 1.7 million Christian
and animist people of the south.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program warned last week that its aid supplies
would run out by June, leaving about 2 million people in danger of
starvation. The agency appealed for increased aid, saying that it
had received only a fraction of the amount it asked for in January.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels reportedly blew up Sudan's only oil pipeline on Monday,
state television reported.
</P>
<P>
   The blast at Singat, 30 miles east of the capital Khartoum,
severely damaged the 1,000 mile pipeline from the Higlig oil field
to the Red Sea, causing a temporary halt to the flow, the
television said in its evening newscast.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline, which is capable of pumping some 150,000 barrels
of crude oil a day, is an important source of revenue for Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin said security officials found leaflets at the scene
signed by a group called the Beja Conference, which is made up of
four eastern tribes who are fighting for autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The report could not be independently verified and there was no
immediate claim of responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Marine's Remains ID'd After 25 Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- Some time later this month, the remains of
one of the last servicemen killed in Vietnam will be returned to
New Mexico for a full military burial.
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, 1975, Andres ''Andy'' Garcia was one of 18 Americans
lost or killed in a failed attempt to rescue an American cargo ship
on a small island near Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   It was called the Mayaguez Incident, historically considered the
last battle of the conflict in Southeast Asia. The servicemen, 14
of them Marines, are considered to be the final American casualties
of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 20, was pronounced legally dead -- but his remains were
never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 25 years later, on March 20, the Garcia family received a
call from the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, they called and said his remains have been found
and are going to be returned for burial,'' Andy's sister, Anita
Garcia Ybaben, said.
</P>
<P>
   Since they received the news, the family has been getting in
touch with their past.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been searching through old articles,'' said Sara Neff,
Garcia's sister. ''We were only teen-agers when this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The military is close to identifying several others of the
Americans lost in the abortive 1975 raid to rescue the crew of the
cargo ship Mayaguez, seized by Khmer Rouge guerrillas at Cambodia's
Koh Tang Island. The remains were recovered in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The merchant ship was on its way to Thailand and had been
carrying a non-arms cargo for military bases. It had been sailing
within the boundaries of international waters, but the Khmer Rouge
had recently claimed territorial waters 90 miles from the coast of
Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Sahara Parties To Join Conference  </HEADLINE>
By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A top U.N. envoy has invited the key
players in the dispute over Western Sahara to a conference in
London this month in hopes of breaking the territory's decades-long
political crisis, diplomats said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   James Baker III, the former American secretary of state, is
hoping for a political settlement to the lingering post-colonial
dispute not that new leaders are place in Algeria and Morocco, the
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco and Mauritania both claimed Western Sahara in 1976 after
Spain abandoned the northwest African territory. Morocco then
annexed the area and moved in settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel Polisario Front launched a guerrilla war for
independence that ended in 1991 with a U.N.-negotiated cease-fire
and an agreement to hold a referendum on independence or
integration with Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum has stalled for years, chiefly over the issue of
voter eligibility. In a February report, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said he doubted the referendum could be held as planned.
</P>
<P>
   After a visit to Africa in April, Baker returned convinced the
U.N. plan for Western Sahara was stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ''The settlement plan is not dead, it is very much still alive
but it is in the ditch. It is in trouble and it is in rather big
trouble,'' Baker said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to salvage the plan or devise an alternative, Baker
last week issued invitations to the four key players -- Morocco,
Mauritania, Polisario and Algeria, which has backed the rebels -- to
come to London beginning May 14 for a new round of talks, diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco is now ruled by King Mohammed VI, who ascended to the
throne last July on the death of his father, King Hassan II.
Algeria elected Abdelaziz Bouteflika president in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The two men recently held the first meeting between their
countries' leaders in nearly 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Special Ed Case Focused On Progress  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Baltimore Public Schools and lawyers for
special education students suing the district agreed Monday to
streamline a laundry list of demands, bringing a 16-year-old
lawsuit closer to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which focuses less on paperwork and more on
measurable results such as test scores and graduation rates, offers
the best hope to date of ending the dispute, said federal appeals
Judge David Tatel, who mediated what he called a final step toward
resolving the 1984 lawsuit over the lack of resources for special
education students.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each side compromised in the interest of improving
education,'' said Tatel, of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia. ''They got the court's message loud and
clear that they were not going to make commitments they could not
fulfill.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatel presented this latest agreement to U.S. District Judge
Marvin J. Garbis, who signed it Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not drop the lawsuit -- one of the longest of
several such class-action cases nationwide. Rather, it gives the
district and state education officials up to three years to meet
goals that could release them from a previous court order.
</P>
<P>
   Those goals include raising special-needs students' test scores,
ensuring more of them are educated in regular classrooms and
graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proof will be in the classroom,'' said Steven Ney, legal
director of the Maryland Disability Law Center, which brought the
lawsuit. ''This is clearly a major step in the case. It makes the
lawsuit a little simpler and more well-defined.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, which also include the city, school board and
the state of Maryland, said Monday they struggled for years to
please the plaintiffs. The plan pared 41 goals down to 14,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This agreement is the first realistic request of a school system
that is struggling to help all of its students, said Carol Ann
Baglin, who oversees special education for the state of Maryland.
The state must help the district meet some of the goals.
</P>
<P>
   Jodi French, a Baltimore school system official, said in an
interview these new goals could help struggling districts like
Baltimore focus on the complex federal special education law. The
1975 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act gives states money
to help end discrimination against disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before, we just had concepts,'' French said.
</P>
<P>
   The goals -- with two- to three-year timelines -- include:
</P>
<P>
   --Raising special education students' graduation rates from 32
percent to 41.6 percent;
</P>
<P>
   --Ensuring 58.8 percent of special education pupils are
''mainstreamed,'' or educated in regular classrooms;
</P>
<P>
   --Keeping 80 percent of newly identified special-needs students
in their community schools.

<HEADLINE> June Set For Burundi Peace Accord  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHE NKURUNZIZA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- President Pierre Buyoya on Monday gave
his clearest support yet to ending Burundi's seven-year civil war,
saying a power-sharing agreement with Hutu rebels and political
parties would be completed in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''The road to peace is open. There will be no winners and no
losers. All Burundians will triumph,'' Buyoya told thousands of
people gathered at the capital's Rwagasore stadium to mark Labor
Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya said former South African President Nelson Mandela,
mediator of the peace talks, will meet with Hutu rebel leaders in
South Africa next week to make sure they attend the next round of
negotiations in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next two weeks, a committee will present a draft
peace agreement to the 19 political parties and interested groups,
Buyoya said.
</P>
<P>
   Although not yet formalized, the agreement centers on a
transitional government; the integration of Hutu rebels into the
Tutsi-dominated army and an electoral system that will ensure power
sharing between the minority Tutsis and majority Hutus.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people have died in Burundi's civil war since
October 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Melchior
Ndadaye, a Hutu who won the country's first democratic elections.
The vote spread panic among some Tutsis who had been in control of
the army, government and economy since independence in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   From November 1993 to July 1996, a coalition government made up
of Tutsis and Hutus ruled the country.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya, a retired Tutsi major, came to power in a July 1996 coup
that toppled the largely ineffective government.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya promised that the agreement will make it possible for
more than 1 million Burundians who are either displaced in camps
inside the country or in refugee camps in neighboring Tanzania to
return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Arusha negotiations began in July 1998. Last year, Mandela
replaced late Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere as mediator and
invited all the Hutu rebel groups that had been previously excluded
to take part in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Cut in Calif. Park Fees Suggested  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HARRIGAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) -- Seizing on next year's huge state
budget surplus, Gov. Gray Davis on Monday proposed cutting entrance
fees in half at most of the 265 state parks, beaches and museums.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the Legislature, the move would reverse a series
of three fee increases during the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of this wondrous economy, we have been blessed with
additional resources,'' Davis, a Democrat, said during a news
conference at Tapia State Park, in the Santa Monica Mountains
northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the state general fund would make up for the $30
million estimated to be lost from the fees each year, Davis said.
That's just a fraction of next year's expected state budget
surplus, estimated at $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed fee cuts would begin July 1. Under the plan, the
daily fee to use a state park would be cut from $5 to $6 per
vehicle to $2 to $3 per vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 million Californians and tourists use the parks each
year.

Search for Deadly Pet Disruptes Toronto
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A full-scale search for a deadly pet snake had
all the trappings of a crime scene Monday, as police cordoned off
parts of a downtown neighborhood with yellow tape and officials
staged a stakeout of homes and shops.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive approach paid off when the search team discovered
the 45-centimetre saw-scaled viper coming out from under a radiator
in its owner's home late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The viper was one of up to 20 snakes kept in an apartment above
a strip of shops in a busy shopping and residential district of the
city's west end.
</P>
<P>
   Its owner reported the reptile missing after realizing it hadn't
been in its cage for three days.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed because a single bite from the reptile can kill,
everyone from police to firefighters and ambulance crews had
descended on the area called Parkdale, shutting down stores and
warning schools and day-care centers to keep children indoors.

Alberta Government Moves To Cut Off Debate on Private Health Bill
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Alberta's controversial private-health
bill -- being watched across Canada for its potential to change the
face of medicare -- is one step closer to becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Ralph Klein's Conservative government served notice
Monday it will unilaterally shut down debate -- to thwart opposition
stalling tactics -- and move Bill 11 into third and final reading.
</P>
<P>
   That move could come as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a tremendous amount of debate on this bill to
date,'' said Klein. ''At some time you have to have a vote. That's
the democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the bill is expected to pass third reading within two
weeks. Then, Klein said, after it has received royal assent by
Lt.-Gov. Lois Hole and regulations are written up, the goal would
be for cabinet to give its final OK -- called proclamation -- by the
fall to make it the law of the province.

Peschisolido Withdraws From Alliance Race, Endorses Long
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Toronto lawyer Joe Peschisolido abandoned his
low-profile campaign to lead the Canadian Alliance on Monday and
threw his support behind rival Tom Long.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement is good news for Long, who's selling himself as
the Alliance's best hope in Ontario, where the fledgling party
desperately needs a breakthrough in the next federal election.
</P>
<P>
   Peschisolido broke with his own advisers, who are endorsing
former Alberta treasurer Stockwell Day.
</P>
<P>
   Long is a key strategist for Ontario Conservatives who helped
Premier Mike Harris win two elections.
</P>
<P>
   Peschisolido has hardly said a word since January when he
announced his bid to lead the Alliance.

<HEADLINE> BoSox Pitcher: No Suspension  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pedro Martinez was still buzzing around the
Cleveland Indians' heads on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez started a brushback war between the Red Sox and Indians
on Sunday that eventually led to two bench-clearing incidents and
the Cy Young Award winner's ejection in the eighth inning of
Boston's 2-1 win for hitting Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar's drilling came after Martinez had knocked Einar Diaz
down with a high, inside pitch and taunted and stared down the
Indians catcher, who had doubled twice against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he definitely threw at Diaz's head,'' Indians manager
Charlie Manuel said before Monday night's game against the New York
Yankees. ''I think he was trying to hit him, that's my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the consensus in Cleveland's clubhouse afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes you lose respect for arguably the best pitcher in the
game,'' David Justice said. ''They have a whole bunch of cool
people on their team. We have a bunch of cool people on our team.
But they've got one guy who thinks he's God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were mad at Martinez on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   After Diaz doubled off the base of the left-field wall in the
fifth inning, Manuel said that Martinez said something to Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   ''What he said, I don't know,'' Manuel said. ''But it looked to
me like he was mad that Einar had hit two doubles off him.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in the seventh inning, Martinez's first pitch to Diaz was
high and tight and his third one sent the second-year catcher
sprawling.
</P>
<P>
   ''From my point of view,'' Manuel said. ''Pedro started the
whole incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians starter Charles Nagy took exception to Martinez's chin
music by hitting Jose Offerman in the side with his first pitch in
the top of the eighth. Both team's benches and bullpens emptied
with the exception of one player, Martinez, who stayed in the
safety of the Boston dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Only after several of the Indians pointed and yelled at him did
Martinez venture onto the field, and even then he didn't go any
farther than the first base coaching box where he stayed close to
hitting coach Jim Rice's side.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Nagy hit Offerman I didn't expect that,'' Manuel said.
''No one in our dugout had said anything. But after he hit him I
thought it was over, especially after the guy (plate umpire Tim
Tschida) warned us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez, who later said he was merely sticking up for his
teammates, nailed Alomar in the backside and was immediately
ejected along with Boston manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the suspensions and fines handed down against the
Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox last week for brawling by
baseball's vice president of on-field operations Frank Robinson,
Manuel was asked if a pitcher should be fined or suspended for
hitting a batter even after he was warned.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's got to be some kind of consistency,'' Manuel said. ''I
would imagine he (Robinson) will do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's inside pitching reminded Cleveland pitcher Bobby Witt
of a former Texas teammate who liked to back hitters off the plate
from time to time -- Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone took an exceptionally hard swing and showed him up
at all, he would throw inside,'' said Witt. ''That was his
mentality. And if someone even looked out at the mound they were
asking for it.''

<HEADLINE> Devils 5, Maple Leafs 1  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- If the Toronto Maple Leafs have
hopes of ending their 33-year Stanley Cup drought, they better find
a way to start beating Martin Brodeur and the New Jersey Devils
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur withstood Toronto's best period of the series and went
on to stop 22 shots in leading the Devils to a 5-1 victory over the
Maple Leafs on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott, Scott Gomez, Patrik Elias, Petr Sykora and
Alexander Mogilny scored as the Devils took a 2-1 lead in the
best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series. Elias also had
two assists as New Jersey dominated for the third straight game.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey could easily have a 3-0 lead if Curtis Joseph hadn't
stolen the opening game with a 32-save performance in a 2-1 Toronto
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs, who generated only a couple of scoring chances
in the opening two games at home, had seven outstanding chances in
the opening 20 minutes with Brodeur stopping odd-man rushes by
Wendel Clark, Igor Korolev and Dmitri Khristich and some good
close-in chances by Sergei Berezin and Adam Mair.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur came within 4:17 of recording a second straight shutout
before Kevyn Adams scored a short-handed goal.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph was just as good at the other end for a period, stopping
14 shots. However, he never had a chance once New Jersey got
rolling in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Mair picked up a four-minute high sticking penalty for cutting
Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko and it only took the Devils 37
seconds to cash in. Sykora made a nice play getting the puck into
the offensive zone and Arnott eventually tipped a Bobby Holik shot
past Joseph from right in front of the crease at 9:42.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, who was in danger of being benched for Game 2 despite his
rookie of the year credentials, stretched the lead to 2-0 at 15:03.
He beat Adams on a faceoff above the top of the circle, took a
skate pass from Claude Lemieux and beat Joseph low to the glove
side.
</P>
<P>
   Elias, who led the Devils with 35 goals this season, made a
great play to score short-handed 2:30 later. He intercepted a
Korolev breakout pass at the Toronto blue line, skated right at
Joseph and then went behind the net and scored on a wraparound.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora put the game away at 4:27 of the final period with a
tap-in goal set up by Arnott and Elias.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny closed out the scoring on a power play, putting the
rebound of a Lemieux shot into an empty net.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 105, Hornets 99  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHIILADELPHIA (AP) -- Aaron McKie picked a good night to have the
best game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   McKie, starting in place of the injured Eric Snow, hit four
consecutive 3-pointers and scored 13 straight points midway through
the fourth quarter as the Philadelphia 76ers beat Charlotte 105-99
Monday night to win their first-round series 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia plays the winner of the Milwaukee-Indiana series in
the Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   McKie scored a career playoff high 25 points and had 11 assists.
Allen Iverson, playing with a chip fracture in his right ankle and
an inflamed right elbow, scored 26. Matt Geiger came off the bench
to score 17 and grab 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   After Charlotte took its biggest lead, 85-77, in the first
minute of the fourth period, McKie took over. He nailed consecutive
3-pointers from the wing to cut it to 85-83.
</P>
<P>
   Elden Campbell's jumper made it 87-83, but McKie tied the game
by hitting another 3 and making a free throw to complete a
four-point play. After Campbell sank a pair of free throws, McKie
gave the Sixers the lead for good, 90-89, with a 3-pointer from
near the top of the circle.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Iverson's turn. He scored seven straight points on a
driving layup, a 3-pointer and baseline jumper to give the 76ers a
101-95 lead with 3:09 left.
</P>
<P>
   After the jumper, Iverson cupped his ear and circled the floor,
encouraging the raucous sellout crowd of 20,712 to make more noise.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte did not get closer than four points the rest of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Mason and Derrick Coleman each scored 21 points to lead
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Snow missed his second straight game with a chip fracture in his
right ankle. The 76ers struggled without their floor leader in Game
3, but McKie made sure the offense stayed in rhythm Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McKie shot 9-of-15, including 4-of-7 from 3-point range. He did
not commit a turnover in 36 minutes. The Sixers committed just
eight turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Kevin Ollie, who played two minutes in the first two
games, played 16 minutes and had six points and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   McKie, who held Eddie Jones to 18 points in Game 3, limited him
to 17 on Monday. He held Jones to just three shots in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, who injured his ankle in Game 3, was questionable,
though he insisted he would play. He aggravated his injured elbow
on a driving layup at the end of the second quarter that gave the
Sixers a 54-50 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson grimaced and jumped up and down while holding his elbow
as he walked off the court. He wore extra padding on it in the
second half. He finished 10-of-23 and had seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte tied the game at 62 after a 10-2 run midway through
the third. The Hornets scored six straight points on dunks,
including two by Coleman and one by Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte scored 11 of its last 15 points in the third quarter
on free throws to take a 79-75 lead. The Hornets hit 20 of their
first 22 foul shots and finished 23-of-28 at the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers started well, hitting their first six shots. George
Lynch, who was scoreless in Game 3, had four points in the first
two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, held without a field goal in Game 3 by Lynch and Toni
Kukoc, hit his first shot and had seven in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia opened with a 12-5 run and ended the first quarter
with a 12-2 run to take a 30-25 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Coleman, a former 76er who was booed unmercifully,
missed a pair of free throws late in the game that would have cut
Charlotte's deficit to 99-97. ... Former Sixers assistant coach
John Calipari sat courtside. Calipari left the team in March to
accept the head coaching position at Memphis. ... The Sixers had
their 12th sellout of the season. ... Geiger, booed throughout the
season, was cheered loudly when he entered the game in the third
quarter. He had 11 points and six rebounds in the second quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings turned to their Russian
connection for new life in their second-round playoff series with
the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings got goals from Igor Larionov and Sergei Fedorov on
Monday night in a 3-1 victory over the Avs, who eliminated Detroit
in the Western Conference semifinals last season.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Shanahan also scored for the Red Wings who lost the
first two games of the series in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg scored for Colorado, which had won 14 of its
previous 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   The best-of-seven series continues with Game 4 on Wednesday
night at Joe Louis Arena. Game 5 will be Friday night in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The first three goals came on power plays and Shanahan scored
into an empty net with 40 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings, who had looked a tad old and a step slow during
the first two games against the high-flying Avs, looked more like a
team bent on reclaiming the Stanley Cup championship during the
first period. Detroit outshot the Avs 36-23.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs had outshot their opponents in every playoff game this
season, but the Red Wings -- flashing the speed and precision that
made them the top-scoring team in the NHL during the regular season
-- had a 14-6 edge in shots during the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And they also had the lead for the first time in this series.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings, scoreless in their first nine power plays of the
series, took a 1-0 lead on Larionov's first goal at 9:38 while
Colorado forward Milan Hejduk was off for holding Tomas Holmstrom's
stick. The goal was set up by Nicklas Lidstrom who patiently glided
through the left circle with the puck before passing it to Martin
Lapointe near the left post.
</P>
<P>
   Lapointe tipped it to Larionov who had an open shot on the right
side before Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy could recover.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg, who had scored the winning goal in three consecutive
playoff games, tied it 1-1 with his fourth goal at 9:39 of the
second while Larionov was off for holding. Forsberg, taking a pass
from Ray Bourque, sent a slap shot over Detroit goalie Chris
Osgood's left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, however, bruised his left foot sometime during the
period and didn't come out for the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov's fourth goal, 30 seconds after Shjon Podein was sent
off for tripping, gave Detroit a 2-1 lead. Roy, partially blocked
by Holmstrom and Steve Yzerman, didn't appear to get a good look at
the shot from the top of the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs, who have scored 11 of their 23 goals on power plays,
had the man advantage when Shanahan was sent off for holding
Stephane Yelle's stick with 9:08 left in the third period, but they
got only two harmless shots on Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   The game was held up for about five minutes at 7:48 of the third
period after Larionov was driven into the boards by Avs forward
Serge Aubin.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings, who won consecutive Cup titles in 1997 and 1998,
have been eliminated from the playoffs the last three times they
have fallen behind 2-0 in a series: in 1996 against Colorado (six
games), in 1995 against New Jersey (four) and in 1992 against
Chicago (four).
</P>
<P>
   The last time Detroit fell behind 2-0 and won a series was in
the first round of the 1992 playoffs against Minnesota (now the
Dallas Stars) in seven games.

the first time in years today, marching in the parade and ending a speech with a
cell phone call to Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who is fighting to bring his refugee
son, Elian, home to Cuba from the United States. The 73-year-old Cuban leader
who has ruled for 41 years guided a sea of chanting, flag-waving men, women and

down the golden arches of a McDonald's and spray-painting a hammer and sickle on
a statue of Winston Churchill in a May Day protest. Prime Minister Tony Blair
decried the demonstrators, saying, ''The people responsible for the damage
caused in London today are an absolute disgrace.'' He added, ''To deface the
Cenotaph and the statue of Winston Churchill is simply beneath contempt. It is
only because of the bravery and courage of our war dead that these idiots can

carry some of its cable channels. Disney had offered a series of deadline
extensions after the original national transmission deal expired Dec. 31. The
most recent deadline expired at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, when ABC was blacked out

congress, Haider, 50, said that his decision to step down was a necessity and
called for unity. The meeting came after several months of international and

Canada Protests Vietnam Execution

   TORONTO (AP) -- Canada suspended government contacts with Vietnam today and
delayed annual meetings on development aid to protest the execution of a
Canadian woman convicted of drug smuggling. Nguyen Thi Hiep and her mother were
arrested in 1996 after custom's officers at the Hanoi airport found 12 pounds of
heroin hidden in art work. Nguyen was sentenced to death, while her mother
received life imprisonment. Canadian authorities asked Vietnam to delay the
execution because of evidence the women were duped by drug smugglers into
transporting the heroin. But the execution proceeded without prior announcement
last week.

<HEADLINE> Blair Counters Tabloid Criticism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair took the time to send
The Sun tabloid a handwritten reply to pointed criticism of his
first three years in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sun, in saying we have done nothing in three years in
government apart from create a strong economy, is more than a
little unfair,'' Blair wrote in a three-page letter, partially
reproduced in Tuesday's editions of the tabloid, the best-selling
newspaper in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Blair sharply rejected claims Labor was ''beginning to lose the
next general election,'' and said that creating a strong economy is
''no small achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 900,000 jobs had been created during his three years as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was reacting to a front-page story in The Sun bannered
''Mayday Mayday'' in which the newspaper said that ''it is only the
successful economy that is keeping Labor afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun singled out for criticism the uncertain future of Rover
cars, the furor over the rising number of asylum seekers, the
faltering Northern Ireland peace accord and the overburdened
National Health Service.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Blair seemed particularly stung by the NHS
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the NHS I accept fully we cannot turn it round overnight,''
The Sun quoted him as writing. Blair noted that that there are
5,500 more nurses, saying that was a ''huge increase in the number
of nurses and midwives in training.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Northern Ireland, he wrote, ''A few years ago, over a
hundred lives a year were being lost. There was no peace process,
no cease-fire. There were daily bombings and killings. Now there is
a process. Whatever its difficulties, it is the only show in town.
In the last year, only seven were killed -- quite a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair added: ''So yes, there is a lot to do. But there has been
a lot done. And since the Tories are committed to scrapping most of
the changes we have made, there is a lot to lose.''

Gertrude A. Barber:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ERIE, Pa. (AP) -- Gertrude A. Barber, who pioneered work with
people with developmental disabilities, died Saturday. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Barber was a civic leader who used her political clout to
improve the lives of mentally impaired people. The center named for
her operates group homes and other centers throughout Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. Tom Ridge presented Barber with a $2 million
check for Project 2000, a $7.5 million plan to build a national
institute for education, research and new services for people with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Barber was hired in 1933 by the Erie School District as a
special-education teacher. Later she was named assistant
superintendent of schools.
</P>
<P>
   Barber launched the Exceptional Children's Center in 1952, which
was the forerunner of the Barber centers.
Richard Bertram:
</P>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. (AP) -- Pioneer yacht manufacturer and offshore
powerboat champion Richard Bertram died Friday from complications
related to Parkinson's disease. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram popularized the now-standard V-type hull that allows
boats to cut through rough waters.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram was competing in the 1958 America's Cup trials when he
noticed a small boat slicing through choppy waters. Intrigued by
the boat's V-shaped bottom, he tracked down the designer and asked
him to build a larger version so he could commute from his Coconut
Grove waterfront home to his office in downtown Miami.
</P>
<P>
   When the 30-foot ''Moppie'' was finished, Bertram entered the
boat in the 1960 Miami-Nassau race. The boat broke the course
record and beat the nearest competitors by two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moppie'' was featured in scores of newspaper articles, as well
as Sports Illustrated, and boaters asked for replicas. That's when
Bertram started his Miami business, building luxury cruising yachts
and sports-fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   His clientele included Aristotle Onassis, the Aga Kahn, King
Hussein of Jordan and Prince Bertil of Sweden.
Mark Denis:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mark Denis, the voice of the Disneyland
Monorail and a fixture on Southern California radio for four
decades, died after suffering from a bacterial or viral infection
affecting the heart. He was 59.
</P>
<P>
   Denis, a radio traffic reporter for Los Angeles station KFI-AM,
began his career as a disc jockey in Hemet at tiny radio station
KHSJ-AM in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He later moved to KFXM-AM in San Bernardino and KGB-AM in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Denis returned to Los Angeles in 1969, working at KFI and KEZY.
He immersed himself in traffic reporting in the 1980s and delivered
nearly 9,000 midday traffic reports each year on KFI and it's
sister station KOST-FM.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the disembodied, baritone voice of the Disneyland
Monorail, announcing sights on the tour of the amusement park and
directing guests to their destinations.
William Francis Gallagher:
</P>
<P>
   WEBSTER, Mass. (AP) -- William Francis Gallagher, a retired
president of the American Foundation for the Blind, died April 19
after a long illness. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher gave more than 40 years of service to enriching the
lives of people who were sight impaired. Blind since boyhood,
Gallagher joined the foundation in 1972 as director of program
planning and later served as director of advocacy. He became the
foundation's director in 1980 and its president in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which also preserves the archives of Helen
Keller, credits Gallagher with helping improve standards for the
accreditation of specialized schools and agencies that offer
services to the blind.
Pham Van Dong:
</P>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Pham Van Dong, who served as Vietnam's
prime minister through three decades of war and reunification, died
Saturday. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Dong was among a few revolutionaries who wrested Vietnam from
the French, then defeated U.S.-backed South Vietnam to bring the
entire country under Hanoi's rule on April 30, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   While Ho Chi Minh was the visionary and father figure, and Gen.
Vo Nguyen Giap was the battlefield hero, Dong was the diplomat and
government organizer. He became prime minister of North Vietnam
soon after independence in 1954 and headed reunified Vietnam from
1976 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   During the long war with the South, Dong was the North's main
spokesman to the world. Dong met with the handful of foreign
journalists and American anti-war activists who came to Hanoi, and
stressed his government's determination to keep fighting despite
punishing U.S. airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   But he was far from a heavy-handed propagandist. Adept at
charming visitors, he spiced his talk with quotes from French
classics and loud, disarming laughter.

<HEADLINE> Notes from Monday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Entering Monday night's game, New York's relievers had
given up just six runs in their last nine games and hadn't allowed
a home run in the last 29 1-3 innings. At 7-0, the Yankees' bullpen
is also the only one without a loss this season. ... As competitive
as their matchups have been in the postseason, the New
York-Cleveland regular-season series have been fairly one-sided the
past few seasons. The Yankees were 7-3 vs. Cleveland last year and
have won the last four season series between the teams. ... New
York's 21-9 record is the best for any opponent at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Manager Charlie Manuel said No. 1 starter Bartolo
Colon, on the 15-day DL since April 16 with a pulled muscle in his
rib cage, will throw on the side Wednesday and will make a minor
league rehab start next week. ... The Indians' defense has been
steady and spectacular of late. Cleveland has not made an error in
its last four games and entered Monday leading the AL with a .987
fielding percentage. ... Manuel said he expects catcher Sandy
Alomar to come off the DL on time. Alomar has been out since April
with a pulled right hamstring.
Tigers-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: The Tigers were 1-82 last season in games they trailed
after eight innings. They were 0-15 in those situations this year
until beating the Chicago White Sox 4-3 in 12 innings Sunday. ...
Manager Phil Garner, third baseman Dean Palmer and pitcher Doug
Brocail served the fourth game of their suspensions for a brawl
April 22 with the Chicago White Sox. Garner and Palmer have four
more games to serve, while Brocail is eligible to play in Detroit's
next game. ... With Jeff Fassero pitching Monday and Pete Schourek
going Tuesday, the Tigers will have faced six lefty starters in 13
games. Righties started the first 12 games of the season against
them. ... C.J. Nitkowski had allowed just eight extra-base hits,
including four homers, to the 127 batters he faced this season. But
he gave up homers to Mike Stanley and Carl Everett in the first two
innings Monday.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Jose Offerman, Boston's leadoff hitter, finally got a
break when Red Sox manager Jimy Williams kept the slumping second
baseman out of the starting lineup for the first time this season.
A .280 career hitter, Offerman is batting .175 with 14 hits in 21
games. And he was hitless in his last 13 at bats. ''We need to give
him some time to work on some things,'' Williams said. ''This is
not a benching.'' ... Jeff Frye, who replaced Offerman, singled in
the first inning. ... With lefty Nitkowski pitching, Williams
benched two lefties -- Brian Daubach, hitting .354, and Trot Nixon,
hitting .310.
Athletics-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Oakland RHP Kevin Appier, once the ace of the Royals
staff, would have been a big draw pitching against his old team on
Tuesday. But he is on the DL with a strained forearm. Nevertheless,
the A's have been getting the best of the deal so far. Appier is
3-2 with Oakland this year while the three pitchers Kansas City got
in return -- Blake Stein, Brad Rigby and Jeff D'Amico -- have won two
games for the Royals. Stein is on the DL, Rigby has been dealt to
Montreal and D'Amico is at Triple-A Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals sent troubled starter Jay Witasick to
the bullpen Monday and moved Jeff Suppan to his start on Wednesday
against Oakland. Witasick was winless in four decisions with an ERA
of 8.46. ''I know he's been struggling,'' said manager Tony Muser.
''He's pressing. He's not feeling real good about himself and I
think he's thinking about his record.'''
Blue Jays-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays recalled OF Andy Thompson from Triple-A
Syracuse and placed OF Shannon Stewart on the DL retroactive to
April 29 with a right hamstring pull. Thompson was hitting .241
with one homer and seven RBIs. ... Frank Castillo will get the
start for the Blue Jays in Tuesday's game. The former Chicago Cubs
right-hander has struggled, going 0-2 with a 9.00 ERA in four
starts so far. ... The Blue Jays set a club mark with 43 homers in
April, eclipsing the former mark set in 1996 by one. ... Former
Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon was a pre-game dugout guest
of Blue Jays pitcher David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RF Magglio Ordonez decided not to appeal his five-game
suspension for his role in a brawl with Detroit last month. Ordonez
began serving it Monday. The White Sox moved Paul Konerko up from
fifth to cleanup to replace Ordonez in the batting order and used
Jeff Abbott to take his spot in right. RHP Tanyon Sturtze began
serving his three-game suspension. ... manager Jerry Manuel was
serving the fourth of his eight-game suspension and had hoped to
watch the game from a TV production truck located in a stadium
garage, but went home instead. ... Manuel said he would like to see
major league baseball send reps to spring training and lay out
guidelines on how brushback situations will be policed. ''They need
to go over that with each team,'' he said.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Astros-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: By going 9-14 in April, the Astros had their first
losing month since going 11-17 in May 1997. ... Roger Cedeno,
second in the NL last season with 66 steals, led the league with
nine going into Monday's game in Milwaukee. ... Richard Hidalgo has
been hit by a pitch seven times, which leads the league. He had
been hit only seven times in 749 previous at-bats. Hidalgo's
seventh HBP came in Sunday's 4-3 loss to the Astros, who lead the
NL by being hit 19 times in their first 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers are impressed by the pitching of reliever
David Weathers, the winner in Sunday's game. Weathers (2-0) pitched
2 1-3 scoreless innings and lowered his ERA to 0.50. ''He's been
outstanding,'' manager Davey Lopes said. ''He's been the best he
can be.'' Pitching coach Bob Apodaca said, ''Right now he's as good
a relief pitcher as there is in the National League. He's doing
everything for us. He does it with outstanding, impeccable command
of his pitches.'' ... SS Mark Loretta surprised his manager by
laying down a perfect sacrifice bunt on an 0-2 count Sunday against
Shane Reynolds. It didn't figure in the scoring. ''It was a
beautiful bunt,'' Lopes said. ''I didn't know he was doing it. He
did it on his own.'' Said Loretta: I just felt I could get it down.
I was kind of surprised I missed the first two (attempts).''
Expos-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: OF Vladimir Guerrero saw his NL-leading average fall
from .452 to .410 after going 1-for-10 against San Francisco. The
dropoff came after he was hit in the right hand by Colorado RHP
Kevin Jarvis last Wednesday. Jarvis was Monday night's starter
against the Expos. ... LHP Graeme Lloyd, who signed as free agent
in December, is scheduled to have surgery on his left rotator cuff
Tuesday and will be out at least two months. He has not pitched for
the Expos this season. ... Manager Felipe Alou said RHP Jeremy
Powell will be called up from Triple-A Ottawa to start Tuesday's
game. ... Alou, who was a minor-league manager in Denver in 1981,
got philosophical when asked what it is like playing at altitude.
''A thousand days is a like a day to the Lord. Well, playing a day
in Coors Field is like playing 1,000 days for a player or
manager.''
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: RHP Rolando Arrojo, who is on the DL with a strained
hamstring, threw 60 pitches in a simulated game Monday and is
expected to return to the starting rotation Saturday in San
Francisco. ''I don't see any reason I shouldn't be ready,'' he
said. ... The Rockies will have to move someone out of the rotation
to make room for Arrojo. The odd-man out could be LHP Scott Karl.
... C Scott Servais is eligible to come off the DL Wednesday but
likely will not join the Rockies until Friday as he recovers from a
sprained ankle. ... RHP Jerry Dipoto will undergo season-ending
surgery Wednesday to repair a bulging disc below his neck.
Braves-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Reliever John Rocker, suspended for the season's first
two weeks for offensive remarks that appeared in Sports Illustrated
over the winter, trotted from the bullpen to the dugout about 45
minutes before the game began and was booed by the few thousand
fans in Dodger Stadium at the time. However, he was cheered by a
small group of Braves fans near the dugout. ''I think he screwed
up,'' said 28-year-old Jose Kerch, who came to the U.S. from
Venezuela six years ago and was wearing an Andres Galarraga jersey.
''He already apologized. We can all make a mistake. It's time to
forgive him.'' ... Galarraga, who didn't play last season because
of cancer, said despite being around a long time, he's never seen
anything like the 13-game winning streak the Braves brought into
the game. ''It's something different every night,'' he said. ...
The Braves entered the game with a big league-leading ERA of 3.08 --
obviously a key factor in their winning streak. ''We've had other
runs through the years,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ''It's always
been good pitching, timely hitting and a lot of breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Gary Sheffield, who hasn't missed a start despite
spraining his right ankle in the season's first week, received a
scare before the game when he stepped on a baseball that was
underneath a tarpaulin near the batting cage and rolled his ankle.
After some 40 minutes of treatment, he took about 10 swings off a
batting tee and declared himself ready to play. ''It's sore,'' he
said. ''It was really sore last night, and it just so happened a
freak accident happened when it hurt the most.'' Sheffield, hitting
.349 with 10 homers and 22 RBIs, admitted to being scared at first,
but smiled and said, ''I'm going to keep going until it falls off,
I guess.'' ... The Dodgers were outscored 12-4 in losing a
three-game series at Atlanta last week. They outscored Florida
25-16 in sweeping a three-game weekend series at Dodger Stadium.
... Left-hander Carlos Perez, 2-1 with a 4.62 ERA and the scheduled
starter Wednesday, has given the Dodgers permission to option him
to the minors until May 31, if they so choose. A five-year player
can refuse a minor league assignment, and Perez reached that
anniversary Monday. ''He believes it's not an issue,'' GM Kevin
Malone said. ''He's pitched well.''
Mets-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Catcher Vance Wilson's stay with the Mets was a short
one. Wilson was recalled Saturday from Triple-A Norfolk after Mike
Piazza bruised his right wrist the night before in Colorado. On
Monday in San Francisco, Wilson was sent back Norfolk to make room
for pitcher Bill Pulsipher, who made his season debut in the opener
of a four-game series against the Giants. Wilson doubled his
previous stint with the Mets, when he was with the team for one day
last July 31. Meanwhile, Piazza missed a third straight game and
remains day-to-day while recovering from his wrist injury. ... New
York OF Derek Bell finished April with 40 hits, a club record. ...
Monday marked the nine-year anniversary of Rickey Henderson passing
Lou Brock as the top base stealer in major league history. The
Mets' left fielder was with the Oakland Athletics when he stole
third base at the Oakland Coliseum against the New York Yankees for
No. 939. Henderson now has 1,336 career stolen bases, two of which
have come this season before Monday night's game at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Giants slugger Barry Bonds hit his 455th career
homer Sunday off Montreal's Carl Pavano to take sole possession of
21st place on the career list. Dave Winfield is next at 20th place
with 465 career homers. Bonds finished April with 10 home runs, the
second-highest in an opening month for his career. He homered 11
times in April 1996. The most homers he's hit in a month is 15,
which he did last August. ... Giants RF Ellis Burks missed a third
game Monday since straining his left quadriceps while legging out a
triple against Montreal on Friday. ''He's getting closer,'' manager
Dusty Baker said. ''Hopefully, in the next couple of days, he'll be
ready. But we've just got to be careful because we don't want to
set him back and lose him for a week to 10 days.''
Marlins-Padres
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Reliever Dan Miceli is the latest former Padres player
to make his first trip back to San Diego. Miceli was traded to the
Marlins for RHP Brian Meadows on Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Going into Monday's game, the Padres had given up 25
runs on nine homers in five games. The damage included two grand
slams and four three-run homers. The Padres lost four of the five
games, including being swept by Atlanta during the weekend. ... The
Marlins are one of only three NL teams the Padres have a winning
all-time record against. Milwaukee and Colorado are the others.

<HEADLINE> Prostate Patients Seek Communication  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Fewer than a third of prostate cancer patients
believe their doctors discussed all available treatments, and 49
percent of urologists consider patients ill-prepared to make such
decisions, according to a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The large communication gap between urologists and patients
threatens effective treatment and points to the cancer's nature as
a taboo subject of frank discussion, said urology groups backing
the survey presented at the American Urological Association's
annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be a disconnect between physicians and
patients,'' said Dr. David McLeod, director of urologic oncology at
Walter Reed Medical Center. McLeod, who wasn't involved in the
survey, is the surgeon who successfully treated former Sen. Bob
Dole and Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, funded by biotechnology company Amgen, polled 307
men diagnosed with the cancer and 302 urologists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't explain it well,'' McLeod said of treatments.
</P>
<P>
   That's because doctors are frequently rushed by tight schedules
and because they often assume patients have performed more research
about the disease than they have.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the doctors -- 90 percent -- said they believed
patients used the Internet to learn about the disease. In fact,
only 19 percent said they researched online, opting instead for
newspaper and magazine articles, and talking with friends and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Joe Torre, the New York Yankees manager, did
when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God for my wife. I don't go in there on the Internet and
get information on stuff,'' Torre said Monday from Cleveland, where
his team had a game.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the prostate is the second most common type of cancer
found in American men. Early detection greatly increases the chance
of successful treatment. About 179,300 men were diagnosed with the
disease last year, while about 32,000 die from it annually.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Offer Satellite Navigation  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Global positioning devices used to steer cars,
fly planes or find missing skiers and hikers will be given pinpoint
accuracy previously available only to the military under an order
President Clinton signed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, civilians using a U.S.-built network of satellites
for navigation got a less accurate reading than the military out of
fear that potential enemies could use the system to target
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Under the order, which took effect at 8 p.m. EDT Monday
(midnight GMT), the United States no longer will jam the signal for
civilian users, but can still selectively block the improved Global
Positioning System over any given region at will, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The military will still use an encrypted, highly accurate
version of the system for guiding precision weaponry such as the
missiles used in the Persian Gulf War and last year's Balkan air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police, firemen, emergency crews will now be able to respond
more accurately to exactly where help is needed,'' said Neal Lane,
the White House science adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The change will make satellite navigation devices people already
own 10 times more accurate, Lane said, and will not require the
purchase of new machines.
</P>
<P>
   The difference will mean satellite navigation can be used to
track a missing person to an area about the size of a tennis court.
Until now, the area of intense search would have been more like a
football field.
</P>
<P>
   That level of imprecision was problematic in emergencies and
when trying to pinpoint such things as a stranded motorist's exact
location. With the less accurate system, a reading for the motorist
might include both sides of a busy highway or even several
different roads.
</P>
<P>
   The system, known as GPS, is used by more than 4 million people
worldwide for everything from navigating in traffic to oil
exploration. Boaters and hikers use handheld GPS devices, and
similar equipment is now installed in wristwatches and in the
dashboards of some cars.
</P>
<P>
   The market for GPS users is expected to double in the next three
years to more than $16 billion annually, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The system of two dozen U.S. satellites is free, but all kinds
of businesses profit from it. Commercial interests have long asked
the government to loosen its hold on the most accurate GPS
information, but officials said outside pressure was not a factor
in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The decision follows four years of discussion among the White
House, Pentagon, CIA and other agencies, and the development of new
technology that allows the U.S. to block certain regions while
offering the improved service everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur Money said the new service
will be available universally at first, and would only be denied in
response to a perceived threat.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, space policy analyst at the Federation of American
Scientists, a Washington think tank, said the United States will
benefit from the continued global use of its system and the control
that accrues to the U.S. military as a result. Offering the better
U.S. system for free takes away some incentive for another country
or consortium to build a competing system, Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ensuring that the U.S. is the only country with such a system
and making travel safer outweighs the problem of having to jam the
signal to prevent the bad guys from using it to target cruise
missiles,'' he said.

Castro Leads May Day Parade
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Fidel Castro joined the annual May Day parade today for the
first time in years and ended a speech with a cell phone call to Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, urging him to continue his fight to bring his refugee son, Elian, home
to Cuba. Castro led hundreds of thousands of Cubans from Havana's Plaza of the
Revolution to the U.S. Interests Section. ''Fidel! Fidel!'' chanted the crowd in
the annual march that traditionally involves workers. In a speech, Castro
praised Cubans for their tenacity.
</P>

Court Asked To Reject Elian Asylum
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juan Miguel Gonzalez asked a federal appeals court today
to reject the political asylum claims filed on behalf of his son, Elian, by the
6-year-old Cuban refugee's Miami relatives. The father's motion was submitted to
the 11th U.S. Court of Appeals. The brief asked the appeals court to uphold a
March 21 ruling by a U.S. District judge in Miami that the court has no right to
second guess the government on matters of asylum. The appeals court has
scheduled a hearing for May 11.

Blair Rips May Day Demonstrators

   LONDON (AP) -- Anti-capitalist demonstrators clashed with police Monday in
central London, daubing anti-war slogans on the Cenotaph war memorial, tearing
down the golden arches of a McDonald's and spray-painting a hammer and sickle on
a statue of Winston Churchill in a May Day protest. Prime Minister Tony Blair
decried the demonstrators, saying, ''The people responsible for the damage
caused in London today are an absolute disgrace.'' He added, ''To deface the
Cenotaph and the statue of Winston Churchill is simply beneath contempt. It is
only because of the bravery and courage of our war dead that these idiots can
live in a free country at all.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential campaigner George W. Bush's plan for
Social Security was dismissed today by the White House as set ''in a world where
budgets don't exist.'' Bush is considering proposing -- as Republicans in
Congress have -- a plan through which workers could invest a portion of their
Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market. White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said Bush needed to provide more details on his proposal and ''stop
talking about campaign promises in a vacuum.''

   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Trying to improve the climate in peace talks, Israeli

the Palestinians acknowledged Israel's pain on Holocaust Remembrance Day. But
negotiators reported little progress and awaited the arrival of a U.S. mediator
Tuesday to help draft an outline of a final peace treaty. Israeli officials said
they would not oppose a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but
said the Palestinians should accept that some Jewish settlements there will
become part of Israel.

Anger Linked to Heart Attacks

   DALLAS (AP) -- People who are highly anger-prone are nearly three times more
likely to have a heart attack, a study has found. The connection between anger
and heart attacks held true even after researchers took into account other major
risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking and obesity.
''The implications of our study are that anger could potentially lead to heart
attacks, especially among middle-aged men and women with normal blood
pressure,'' said Janice Williams, an epidemiologist in Atlanta who led the study
while at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

<HEADLINE> Panel Opposes Trade Status for China  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's new religious advisory panel
took strong stands Monday against two nations it accuses of abusing
Christians and others, calling for possible aid to Sudanese rebels
and rejection of permanent normal trade status for China.
</P>
<P>
	   The far-reaching advice of the U.S. Commission on International
Religious Freedom sparked criticism from an Islamic advocacy group
and dissent on the Sudanese recommendation by a Muslim leader on
the commission. The State Department immediately rejected the China
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10-member commission, formed last year to advise the
government on policies that will promote a global freedom to
worship, limited its report to Sudan, China and Russia. Panel
members include religious figures from several faiths, human rights
advocates and former diplomats.
</P>
<P>
	   China and Sudan ''are countries in which there are systematic,
egregious, ongoing manifestations of religious persecutions,''
Rabbi David Saperstein, the panel's chairman, told a news
conference releasing what is to be an annual report.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has protected religious freedom dramatically better than
the former Soviet Union, the commission concluded, but Vice
Chairman Michael K. Young said the panel is concerned with
President Vladimir Putin's order to ''liquidate'' religions that
don't register by year's end in accordance with a 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
	   ''We urge that the U.S. make reversal of this decree an urgent
priority in its discussions with the Russian government,'' said
Young, dean of the George Washington University Law School.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission's sweeping recommendations included: tightened
sanctions against Sudan, nonlethal aid for opposition groups if no
improvements occur in a year, restrictions on U.S. stock offerings
that might help oppressive nations such as Sudan, denial of any bid
by China to host the Olympics and an invitation to the Dalai Lama
to address Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ''While many commissioners support free trade, the commission
believes that the U.S. Congress should grant China Permanent Normal
Trade Relations (PNTR) status only after China makes substantial
improvement in respect for religious freedom,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has made PNTR for China a major
priority. The status would give China's exports to the United
States the same favorable conditions that other nations enjoy and
ease China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
	   In a joint statement, Assistant Secretary of State Harold Hongju
Koh and special religious freedom Ambassador-at-large Robert Seiple
welcomed many of the commission's recommendations but rejected
tying religious rights to China trade.
</P>
<P>
	   ''We profoundly believe that conditionality will not advance the
cause of religious freedom in China, and will not improve the
circumstances of any of the religious adherents about whom we are
all deeply concerned,'' the officials said. At the same time, the
administration remains committed to promoting religious freedom in
China and elsewhere, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Saperstein, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform
Judaism in Washington, said commission conclusions were unanimous
except for a dissent by member Laila Al-Marayati, a physician who
is past president of the Women's Muslim League.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Marayati, who did not appear at the news conference, objected
to aid for the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, saying it could
undermine U.S. credibility in the region. She said the group has
committed human rights abuses and is internally divided.
</P>
<P>
	   Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said
Muslims have been concerned since the commission's inception that
it was ideologically and religiously motivated with a bias against
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Our fears were not assuaged by the report,'' he said. ''We
don't mind people investigating religious and human rights abuses
worldwide if they use one central standard for all,'' Hooper said,
accusing the commission of glossing over abuses by Sudan's
Christian rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   On Russia and China, he said, the commission made only a passing
reference to the ''near genocide'' against Chechen Muslims and the
denial of religious freedom to millions of Muslims in China.
</P>
<P>
	   In support of proselytizing American churches, the commission
announced plans to develop U.S. policy options for promoting the
''right to change one's faith and the right to seek to persuade
others to change theirs.''

Gore To Offer Wider Felon Drug Plan   
By RON FOURNIER
AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to make inroads on a traditionally
Republican issue, Al Gore plans to propose expanded drug treatment
programs for convicted felons and continued federal funding of a
program to put police officers on the nation's streets.
</P>
<P>
   In an address being prepared for his visit Tuesday to Atlanta,
the vice president was proposing that police be allowed to carry
concealed weapons off duty. Democratic officials familiar with the
presidential candidate's plan, who spoke on the condition that they
not be identified, said some jurisdictions restrict police use of
guns off the job.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also was promising another 50,000 police on the street
under a program begun by President Clinton in his bid to convince
swing voters that Democrats can be trusted with crime and safety
issues. Some Republicans have balked at the federally funded
program.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Gore would call for more comprehensive drug
treatment for convicted felons in prison and those who have been
released. They also said he would draw a contrast between his plans
and the record of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who they said had
reduced funding for prison drug-treatment programs in his state.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was not expected to estimate the cost of the
initiatives, many of which were first unveiled in his July 1999
anti-crime address in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The speech comes as a new national poll showed Bush and Gore in
a statistical dead heat. Bush has cut into what should be Gore's
strengths. Despite polls suggesting that voters want restrictions
on guns, the latest USA Today-CNN-Gallup surveys shows that Bush,
who sides with the National Rifle Association, is viewed as the
most acceptable candidate on the issue of guns.

<HEADLINE> Salvador Election Outcome Protested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP)-- A conservative legislator was
elected president of the Salvadoran congress Monday, despite
protests from a party of former leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Ciro Cruz, 54, of the National Conciliation Party, won on a 47-4
vote, with 32 abstentions. All but one of those abstaining was from
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, FMLN. One legislator
was absent.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the former FMLN rebels for the first time won a
greater number of seats the ruling party, grabbing 31 of the 84
posts in the country's single-house congress. The ruling
Nationalist Republican Alliance holds 29 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative National Conciliation Party, which works
closely with the ruling party, holds 14 seats -- enough to keep
rightists in control of the Assembly. The remaining 10 seats are
held by other parties.
</P>
<P>
   The leftists organized themselves into a political party after
signing the 1992 peace accords, ending a 12-year civil war that
left 76,000 people dead.

<HEADLINE> Padres Make Bullpen Change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Padres started retooling their
porous bullpen on Monday by optioning right-hander Will Cunnane to
Triple-A Las Vegas and recalling right-hander Buddy Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   Cunnane was 1-0 with a 4.09 ERA in 12 appearances. He struck out
16 but walked nine in 11 innings, allowing five earned runs and
seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night against Atlanta, he replaced rookie starter
Rodrigo Lopez with a 4-1 lead and put two runners on before Carlos
Almanzar came on and allowed Andres Galarraga's three-run homer.
The Braves went on to win 7-4 in 12 innings. Almanzar gave up a
three-run homer in all three weekend losses to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Carlyle was 0-1 with a 6.45 ERA in four starts at Las Vegas.
Last year, he went 1-3 with a 5.97 ERA in seven late-season starts
for the Padres in his first big league stint.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, reliever Rodney Myers could be activated from the
15-day disabled list on Friday if his rehab assignment at Class A
Rancho Cucamonga goes well. He allowed one hit in one scoreless
inning Sunday and is scheduled to pitch again Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, acquired in an offseason trade with the Chicago Cubs, has
been on the DL since March 29 with a partially torn right rotator
cuff that eventually will require surgery.

<HEADLINE> Trainer Hopes To Buck Derby History  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- As the summer of '98 was winding down and
his stable had dwindled to two horses, trainer Alex Hassinger was
ready for a career change.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't working out for me with the caliber of horses I
wanted to train,'' Hassinger said Monday, ''and I felt it might be
time to make a change, maybe go back to the farm circuit in
Lexington.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a phone call that put Hassinger back in business in a
big way -- as the private trainer for Prince Ahmed bin Salman of
Saudi Arabia, who runs The Thoroughbred Corp.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the 37-year-old California-based trainer from New
Jersey will saddle 2-year-old champion Anees in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd say I'm anxious, not nervous,'' Hassinger, the nephew of
Gainesway Farm founder John Gaines, said after Anees breezed five
furlongs in 1:00 2-5 in his final Derby workout. ''I've dreamed
about winning the Derby ever since I was a kid and watched
Secretariat.''
</P>
<P>
   In Anees, Hassinger has a 3-year-old colt by Unbridled who has
failed to win in two races this year, finishing fourth in the Santa
Anita Derby and third in the San Felipe. At 2, Anees gave Hassinger
his biggest win in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   Anees also must overcome several jinxes to win a Derby that is
expecting a full 20-horse field: The last 2-year-old champion to
win the Derby was Spectacular Bid in 1979; and a Breeders' Cup
Juvenile winner has never won the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   And there's this: Since 1955 only one horse with two starts as a
3-year-old has won the Derby -- Sunny's Halo in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hassinger believes Anees is ready to run back to
the form that made him a champion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not the kind of horse that relished the Santa Anita
track; it's not the kind of track you can make up ground,''
Hassinger said. ''As far as I'm concerned, he's run two good races
after coming off a long layoff and he's come here and trained well
and seems to like this racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Anees bruised a foot at the start of this year and didn't return
to the races until the San Felipe in March.
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger, who saddled Breeders' Cup Filly champion Eliza for
Allen Paulson in 1992, works closely with racing manager Richard
Mulhall in planning the future for the 30-40 horses he trains in
California. Worldwide, The Thoroughbred Corp. has about 90 horses
in training, many in England.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alex is easy to work with and he's a good horseman,'' said
Mulhall, who then explained how The Thoroughbred Corp. operates:
''The prince has the final say in everything, I have the say in the
day-to-day operation and Alex trains, he doesn't have to ask me.
Then we discuss the future of the horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Working his new job, Hassinger also has a new assistant in Hall
of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who rode Anees as a 2-year-old but
retired with chronic knee problems. Stevens climbs aboard for
Anees' workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having Gary is an added bonus, he's our secret weapon,''
Hassinger said. ''He's a top class horseman and when he comes back
and gives a thumbs up, I know we're fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger came aboard The Thoroughbred Corp. in 1998 as its
trainer in Kentucky, Florida and at Saratoga. But when Wally
Dollase was fired as the group's private trainer in California,
Hassinger was shipped out west last spring.
</P>
<P>
   And now that he's back in Kentucky, Hassinger feels comfortable
at his old Barn 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things are a little different,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Something hasn't changed, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still have my lucky green jacket, the one I've worn for two
straight years,'' Hassinger said of his fleece pullover. ''Yes ...
I will have it on Saturday.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 5, White Sox 3  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A new month meant the same old power from the
Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer hit a two-run, tiebreaking shot in the sixth inning
-- one of four Toronto homers -- and right-hander Chris Carpenter
stayed perfect in six career decisions against Chicago as the Blue
Jays beat the White Sox 5-3 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto led the AL with 43 homers in April and picked it back up
on the first day of May. Raul Mondesi, Jose Cruz Jr., and Alex
Gonzalez also homered off Kip Wells (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter (3-3) won his third straight game this season and ran
his career record to 4-0 in Comiskey Park. He gave up five hits,
including back-to-back homers on successive pitches to Chris
Singleton and Carlos Lee in the fifth, and was replaced after
issuing two-out walks to Ray Durham and Jose Valentin in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch then retired Frank Thomas on a roller to third and
pitched the ninth for his sixth save. Koch allowed an RBI groundout
to Lee in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi led off the sixth with his fifth homer to tie the game
at 2. After Carlos Delgado doubled, Fullmer followed with a two-run
shot to right, his sixth, to give the Jays a 4-2 lead. Gonzalez hit
his first of the season in the seventh to expand the lead to three.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz homered to give the Blue Jays a 1-0 lead in the third
before Singleton and Lee, connected in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was the fifth time this season the Blue Jays have
homered four times in a game. The Blue Jays have homered in 21 of
their 27 games but had gone three straight without a long ball. ...
Carpenter had a strange start. As he tried to deliver his first
pitch, he caught his spikes and fell off the mound. ... Singleton
made a spectacular catch, diving after a long run to snare a line
drive to center field by Tony Batista, to save a run in the fourth.
... The White Sox have homered back-to-back four times this season.
... Thomas started as the DH despite a sore hamstring and limped
noticeably every time he ran to first.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Terrence Long drove in four runs and
Omar Olivares won for the first time since April 5 as the Oakland
Athletics beat the Kansas City Royals 7-5 Monday night for their
fourth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Long, recalled from Triple-A Sacramento on April 24, hit a
bases-loaded triple in the second inning and an RBI single that
capped a three-run in the eighth. The rookie is batting .290 (
9-for-31), getting hits in six of seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland trailed 5-4 in the eighth, then loaded the bases with
one out against Dan Reichert (1-1) and tied the score on Eric
Chavez's infield grounder. Pinch-hitter Olmedo Saenz singled in the
go-ahead run and Long followed with another RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares (2-3), whose other win was against Detroit, allowed
five runs and eight hits in seven innings. Doug Jones pitched a
one-hit eighth and Jason Isringhausen got three straight outs for
his fifth save in five chances.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City starter Chad Durbin gave up four runs, four hits and
four walks in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City took a 2-0 lead in the first on Mike Sweeney's
sacrifice fly and the first of two RBI singles by Carlos Beltran.
</P>
<P>
   After Long's triple in the second, Ramon Hernandez homered in
the third for a 4-2 lead. Beltran and Joe Randa hit RBI singles in
the third that tied it in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City went ahead in the fifth on Mark Quinn's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Royals are in the midst of their longest homestand of
the year (11 games), while the A's are on their longest road trip
(12 games). ... The A's are one of only two AL teams with a winning
record on the road (8-3) and a losing mark at home (5-10). ... Dye
was chosen AL player of the week after getting 11 hits in five
games, including three homers, four doubles and 24 total bases. In
the first inning, he dropped a high fly by Miguel Tejada with one
out for an error. Durbin struck out Adam Piatt for the third out.
... Grieve, 5-for-5 in his five previous plate appearances with a
grand slam and five RBIs, hit a ball to the warning track in his
first at-bat. ... Long's walk in the sixth was his first in 36
major league plate appearances.

<P>
   In Olympia, Wash., several hundred May Day protesters blocked
one of the capital city's busiest intersections to protest global
corporations. In New York City, more than 1,000 immigrants
protested outside City Hall. And about 400 Minneapolis marchers
clashed with police, beating drums and waving flags and signs as
officers surrounded them in riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   Portland police officers used clubs to shove protesters, whose
demonstration was organized by a loose coalition of workers' rights
groups. The chaos tied up rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters held signs reading ''Farm Workers Yes, Slavery No!''
''Globalize Freedom,'' and ''Bring Oregon Steel to Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Mike Hefley, city police spokesman, said 16 protesters had
been arrested for disorderly conduct and criminal mischief. Hefley
said the protest was illegal because it was held without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   A protester broke a Nike window and several threw fiery objects
at officers on horseback, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were demanding amnesty for undocumented workers,
the end of clearcutting in national forests and affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I belive ultimately we are in it together,'' said Jamey
Billig, a Portland UPS worker. ''Globalization effects not just
14-year-olds in Indonesia. It effects people in Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   In Olympia, people set up barricades of old televisions,
furniture, vines and refrigerators. Police and the Washington State
Patrol redirected traffic, but did not interfere with protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four protesters were arrested Minneapolis, most for
disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The New York rally was generally peaceful, although police made
22 arrests on minor charges.

<HEADLINE> Striking NY Nurses Reject Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NYACK, N.Y. (AP) -- Striking nurses at Nyack Hospital rejected a
tentative agreement on a new contract Monday night and said their
4-month-old walkout would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials expressed surprise and disappointment and
said they would resume hiring permanent replacements for the
strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Genovese, a spokesman for the New York State Nurses
Association, said the vote against the contract was ''greater than
2 to 1,'' but he would not give the exact numbers. The union's
bargaining committee had given the agreement a favorable
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we're very disappointed,'' said hospital spokeswoman
Nancy Kriz. ''We bargained in good faith, and we believe NYSNA did,
too. We felt the proposal met everyone's needs -- the hospital, the
nurses, the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But Genovese said the hospital's 425 striking nurses, who have
been out since Dec. 21, felt that the proposal was insufficient in
wage hikes and time off, which would compound staffing problems.
Genovese said picketing would resume Tuesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Gov. Hit in Face With Pie  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER WILLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) -- A protester hit Gov. George Ryan in the
face with a cream pie Monday night while he was speaking with
reporters following a public forum.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's bodyguards quickly grabbed the woman as Ryan
stepped from view.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan cleaned himself up in a nearby conference room and then
joked about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't taste too bad, kind of walnut or something with
cream. I don't think it was diet, though,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the forum, the protester identified herself as Dawn
Roberts, a member of an organization at Southern Illinois
University at Carbondale called Students for Excellence in
Education. She asked the governor about what she said were problems
at the university.
</P>
<P>
   She and others at the forum complained that the university's
board of trustees has more Republican members than the law allows.
Ryan is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the board became lopsided in favor of Republicans
when the board's chairman was reappointed in January, 1999. Three
professors filed a lawsuit challenging the makeup of the board, but
it was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he doubted there was anything illegal about the
board's makeup but promised to review the issue.
</P>
<P>
   After being hit with the pie, Ryan said he told his guards to
take the woman away and have her charged, and that he would sign a
complaint against her.
</P>
<P>
   Carbondale police would not say what crime she was charged with,
but said she was under arrest.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Higher at Midday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar gained against the yen Tuesday morning
on signs the American economy is still going strong. Tokyo stocks
rose following Wall Street's rally.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 108.56 yen in late morning, up 0.58 yen from
late Monday but below its late New York level of 108.79 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 77.81
points, or 0.42 percent, to 18,480.89 points at the end of the
morning session. On Monday, the average closed up 429.38 points, or
2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar's firmness remained intact on
the back of strength in U.S. financial markets and continued
strength in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said, however, the greenback moved in a narrow range
during the morning trading in Tokyo ahead of Japan's ''Golden
Week'' holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets in Tokyo will be closed Wednesday through
Friday because of national holidays. The markets will reopen
Monday, May 8.
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Monday, the greenback's late level of 108.79 yen
was its highest level since March 1, when the currency bought
110.31 yen.
</P>
<P>
   Also supporting the dollar was new data showing the U.S. economy
continues to grow at a rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said Monday
that the U.S. manufacturing sector registered further growth in
April, and the government reported separately on a surprising rise
in construction spending in March.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 77.87
points to close at 10,811.78 on Monday. The technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 97.42 to close at 3,958.08.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 99.58 yen, up from
98.56 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started higher in line with gains in
New York stocks and higher futures prices in Monday's Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Trading remained in a lackluster prior to the start of a
five-day holiday period, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 13.37 points, or 0.79 percent, to 1,708.60
points. The TOPIX closed up 46.36 points, or 2.8 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7400 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7350 percent. Its price
fell 0.04 point to 100.51.
