<HEADLINE> Russia to Stick to "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia, in a joint press
communique issued with China here Tuesday, reiterated its
commitment to "one China" policy and promised to keep its
connections with Taiwan at an unofficial level.
</P>
<P>
Russia will uphold its consistent position on the Taiwan issue,
namely, the government of the People's Republic of China is the
sole legal government of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part
of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
Standing on that principled position, Russia gives no backing
to concepts of "independence of Taiwan" in any form and supports
the stand of the People's Republic of China against concepts of
"two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Russia opposes the admission of Taiwan into the United Nations
and other international organizations that only sovereign states
have the right to join, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Russia also stressed that it will sell no weapons to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In return, China holds no objection to unofficial connections
between Russia and Taiwan in sectors like economy and trade,
science and technology, culture and sports, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
China also reiterated that it is in full support of the unity
and territorial integrity of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia have identical or similar positions on many of
the pressing international issues, including situations in the
Balkans, the Persian Gulf region and the Asia-Pacific region,
effects of the Asian financial crisis, situation in South Asia and
the reform of the U.N. Security Council, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
During Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia, the two
leaders also exchanged views on the international situation in a
deep-going way and on further strengthening of cooperation between
the two nations in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed to improve the dialogue mechanism at all
levels, particularly at the high level, between the two
nations. For this, they will fully use the secret direct telephone
line between Beijing and Moscow to exchange views on important
issues.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin held talks with his Russian counterpart
Boris Yeltsin on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Legislators Banned from Holding Cabinet Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's constitutional
court made a final ruling Tuesday, prohibiting members of the
State Great Hural, or parliament, from holding cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
As reported by Mongolia's national TV station, the ruling
handed down at a plenary court session was effective the same day.
</P>
<P>
An earlier ruling by the constitutional court, which declared
it unconstitutional to allow parliamentary members to serve in the
government, was rejected on November 12 by the Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian Constitution sets forth in Article 29 that
members of the State Great Hural "shall not concurrently hold any
posts and employment other than those assigned by law."
</P>
<P>
But the Great Hural passed an amendment on January 15 to add a
provision to the constitution, saying its members are eligible to
concurrently serve as prime minister and other cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
In return, the constitutional court at Tuesday's meeting
revoked the constitutional amendment as well as the parliament's
overrule of the constitutional court's ruling on November 12.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the court ruling would prompt the
parliament to revise the constitution and cause the four-month-old
government crisis to further escalate.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country's caretaker government is fully composed
of parliament members.

<HEADLINE> UK's Highest Court to Rule on Pinochet on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom's House of
Lords is to rule out on Wednesday whether Former Chilean leader
Augusto Pinochet enjoys immunity from arrest or whether he faces
extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords, the highest court in Britain, is to rule on
an appeal against a High Court decision that Pinochet's arrest in
a London hospital last month was wrong because the former Chilean
leader should enjoy the immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested last month, in a London hospital while he
was recovering from a surgery to his back, at the request of a
Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of responsibility for the deaths and
disappearances of more than 3,000 people during his 17-year rule
which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
If the appeal is rejected by a panel of five law lords,
Pinochet will be free to leave the north London clinic where he is
under police guard.
</P>
<P>
If the appeal is upheld, the British government has to decide
whether to go ahead with extradition proceedings. In that case,
Pinochet would have to appear before a London magistrate's court
unless his state of health means he cannot leave hospital.
</P>
<P>
The British High Court ruled out last week that Pinochet should
appear to a special court if he was not immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday is Pinochet's 83rd birthday. Two Chilean aircraft are
waiting at an airfield outside the capital where he was under
house arrest to take him home.

<HEADLINE> Swiss President Visits India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Swiss President
Flavid Cotti told Indian leaders Tuesday that the nuclear tests
conducted by India and Pakistan last May had provoked new tensions
in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Cotti, who arrived here Monday following a tour of Numbai and
Bangalore, told the press after his meeting with Indian Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee that his country strongly favored
elimination of all nuclear weapons including those owned by the
five nuclear weapon states.
</P>
<P>
Following India's nuclear tests, the Swiss government slashed
by five percent its development assistance of 350 million Swiss
francs for projects in central India.
</P>
<P>
Defending the nuclear tests, Vajpayee gave a detailed
exposition of the so-called security concerns that promoted the
country to carry out the tests, according to the Press Trust of
India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
Describing the present Indo-Pakistan talks as a very positive
development, the Swiss president expressed his hope that the two
neighbors would resolve their outstanding bilateral issues
amicably.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday evening, Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan held
a banquet in honor of Cotti, who is scheduled to leave the country
Wednesday at the end of his six-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Pesticide Residues Found in 3% EU Product Samples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Consumers of lettuce, grapes,
strawberries, apples and tomatoes in EU member countries and
countries nearby were given a warning of their exposure to
excessive pesticide residues on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The warning, published for the first time by the European Union
in the form of common data, tagged 3 percent of the 41,232 fruit
and vegetable samples as containing excessive pesticide residues.
</P>
<P>
As many as 15,996, or 39 percent, of the samples were found
containing pesticide residues, though the amount was below EU or
its member state national maximum residue levels.
</P>
<P>
The samples were monitored in the 15 EU member states and
Norway, including cereals in Finland and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Lettuce was found with the highest amount residues, followed by
grapes, strawberries, apples and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
Pesticide residue levels in foodstuffs are generally regulated
to minimize consumers' exposure to or unnecessary intake of
harmful pesticides, and to control the use of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
An earlier EU survey found that zero pesticides is the main
criterion for European consumers to regard a product as safe.
</P>
<P>
European Consumer Policy Commissioner Emma Bonino said, "EU
member states must make sure that the maximum residue levels are
respected by producers."
</P>
<P>
More than 800 pesticides are now used in EU member countries,
of which 73 have been given fixed maximum residue levels by EU,
and the rest, by the member states.
</P>
<P>
The commission promised to follow the pesticide residue issue
closely, and plans to implement a pesticide monitoring program and
submit a report on findings each year.

<HEADLINE> Key to Competitiveness: HK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- That quality is the key to
competitiveness is conventional wisdom and its rightness has once
again been proven in these difficult economic times, Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a presentation ceremony for the Hong Kong Awards
for Services, Tsang, who is chairman of the Central Judging Panel
for the second year running, said that the Awards scheme, although
still in its infancy, has no doubt become an effective means of
encouraging the pursuit of excellence in the services sector.
</P>
<P>
Firms able to deliver quality services will stand a better
chance of surviving and thriving, he said. "The more attention we
pay to raising quality, the better we will weather the storm and
prepare ourselves to ride it out."
</P>
<P>
"Stormy days are occasions a keen learner would not want to
miss. And Hong Kong has no lack of good learners after all the
storms it has gone through in the past. Every time we emerged
tougher, wiser and with more resilience," he said.
</P>
<P>
The important thing is that one must not lose heart now, he
continued. The biggest tragedy in life is losing heart in
difficult times.
</P>
<P>
Tsang recalled that, in his Policy Address issued earlier this
year, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa has set out a vision to make
Hong Kong the most cosmopolitan city in Asia, as good as New York
in America and London in Europe. "A sophisticated business sector
that delivers superb services is an integral part of that vision.
The government is committed to working together with the community
to realize our full potential and the Awards scheme is another
example of such efforts," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economic Growth Strongly Rebounds in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite of overseas
financial chaos, U.S. economic growth rebounded strongly in the
third quarter of this year, the Commerce Department reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP), the sum of all goods and
services produced within the country, went up at a robust 3.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in the July-September
quarter, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The growth was better than the 3.3 percent originally estimated
by the department. However, in its first look at third-quarter
profits, the department said after-tax earnings fell 1.8 percent
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 473.2 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Tuesday, the department said orders to
factories for big-ticket durable goods decreased 1.7 percent in
October, the first drop in five months. Orders for primary metals
such as steel fell for the fifth time in six months.
</P>
<P>
Orders rose for electronic components but declined for
industrial machinery, transportation equipment and military goods.
</P>
<P>
The profits decline was the third over the past four quarters.
Profits were down 6.2 percent from the same quarter a year ago,
the worst drop over a year since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter brisk growth came after much slower advance
at a 1.8 percent rate in the second quarter, and it might contain
the seeds of the slowdown that economists expect for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of
economic activity, increased at a 4.1 percent annual rate.
Purchases of big-ticket durable goods rose at a moderate 2.4
percent rate, even with the General Motors strikes.
</P>
<P>
However, the increase of unsold goods in inventory accounted
for nearly a fourth of overall growth. And business investment in
new equipment, a key factor in productivity gains on which
Americans' standard of living depends, fell 1.1 percent after a
run of stellar growth. It was the sector's first decline in nearly
seven years.
</P>
<P>
Business spending on new buildings and structures fell at a 1.5
percent rate.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, housing construction rose at a robust 8.6
percent annual rate. Government spending was up at a 1.6 percent
rate.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, as measured by a price gauge tied to the GDP, hit a
35-year low. Prices rose at a 0.8 percent annual rate.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls for Restoring U.N. Operation in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Tuesday it was necessary to fully restore the normal
operation of the United Nations Special Commission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In meeting Abd al-Ghani Abd al-Ghafur, a member of the Regional
Command of the Iraqi Baath Party, Ivanov said the first thing to
do now is to ensure the normal work of the U.N. Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
As reported by the Interfax news agency, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin quoted Ivanov as calling on all sides
to act constructively and avoid escalation of tension over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the full restoration of the inspectors' work was
necessary for the speedy transition to the next stage, namely an
all-round review of the implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolutions with an eye to ultimately lift the oil embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Rakhmanin said, Russia regretted that "some countries,
including Britain, are calling for toppling the Iraqi regime."
</P>
<P>
He said Russia favored settling the Iraq crisis at an earliest
possible date in line with the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
After Baghdad decided to resume cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors, the spokesman said, there had been positive changes
toward the settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Moscow urged all parties involved to avoid moves and statements
which may hamper the implementation of the decisions on Iraq, he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassy Bombing Suspects Trained by CIA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 24 (Xinhua) - Three suspects for
bombing the United States Embassy here were once trained in
military warfare by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in
early 1990s, the press here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A report by The Guardian and the US-based TIME magazine said that
they were trained to fight against the Soviet Union aggression in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
" The highly-skilled 'soldiers of fortune' were recruited by the
world's number one terrorist, Osama bin Laden, after the end of the
Cold War and paid to effect the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es
Salaam," the report said.
</P>
<P>
A reliable source close to the joint investigation team of the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and local Criminal Investigation
Department (CID) was quoted over the weekend as saying that there is a
network of mercenaries by Laden from Mombasa and Nairobi in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the early 1990s CIA had secretly recruited
youths from the Kenyan coastal cities of Mombasa, Pate and Lamu and
sent them to Afghanistan where they were given thorough training
including bomb making and military warfare.
</P>
<P>
"After the end of the cold war the CIA left the trained
mercenaries hanging with nowhere to go...bin Laden then used the
network of mercenaries to plan and co-ordinate the highly
sophisticated twin bombings of the US Embassies in East Africa," the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Forensic investigations revealed that the three suspects left for
Mombasa in a hurry following the explosion, leaving behind a 1989
white Suzuki Samurai car, in which articles of the bomb believed to
have been used to explode the U.S. Embassy were found.
</P>
<P>
So far, another two suspects, Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Rashid Saleh
Hemed, have been detained here facing 11 counts of murder charges.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack against the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam on August
7 killed 11 people and injured 85 others, while another against the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi on the same day left 250 people dead and more than
5,000 others injured.

city, and toured the Akademgorodok, or Science City, there.
</P>
<P>
Flying in from Moscow, Jiang toured the Nuclear Physics

After touring the Science City, Jiang told Chinese reporters

benefit not only the two countries but also the advancement of
science worldwide and the progress of the human race.
</P>
<P>
A city on the Ob River some 2,600 kilometers southeast of
Moscow, Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 as a stop on the
Trans-Siberian Railroad. It received its current name in 1925.
</P>
<P>
As many industries were moved here from combat areas in the
European section of the former Soviet Union during World War II,
the city prospered after the development of the Kuznetsk Basin.
</P>
<P>
Now a transportation hub, an industry center and the largest
city in Siberia, Novosibirsk hosts operations making mining
equipment, turbines, textiles, chemicals and heavy machine tools.

<HEADLINE> British Queen Announces Lords Shake-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth II announced an
end to the rights of hereditary peers to vote in the upper chamber
Tuesday amid the pomp and circumstance of a ceremony with
traditions in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
At Britain's annual state opening of Parliament, the Queen set
out a package of new laws which include the radical reform of the
House of Lords, the welfare state and education.
</P>
<P>
The Queen told Parliament that "like the first, it will focus
upon the modernization of the country, its institutions, its
public services and its economy."
</P>
<P>
The widely-expected reform of the Lords is the most radical of
the proposals and could pave the way for a year of confrontation
between the two Houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Queen said, "It will be the first stage in a process of
reform to make the House of Lords more democratic and
representative."
</P>
<P>
The government will publish a white paper setting out
arrangements for a new system of appointments of life peers and
establish a Royal Commission to review further changes and
introduce proposals for reform.
</P>
<P>
The Queen also announced legislation to modernize local
government, create a new Greater London Authority, as well as
measures to tackle transport problems.
</P>
<P>
Education continues to be the government's top priority, the
Queen said, and one of its greatest challenges.
</P>
<P>
"To raise standards in our schools, we must raise standards in
teaching," she said.
</P>
<P>
In health, the government wants partnership and efficiency to
replace the internal market and competition, announced the Queen.
</P>
<P>
Changes to the welfare state formed a core part of the speech,
with the announcement of Bills to reform benefits, introduce new
tax credits and create a Disability Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
The package would give "greater help to those in need," the
Queen said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Turkey for Map Publication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday criticized
Turkey for the recent publication by the Turkish Foreign Ministry
of a map which places Greece's eastern Aegean islands of Rhodes,
Samos, Ikaria and Chios within Turkish borders.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Daily News newspaper reported Monday that the map
was published to mark the 75th anniversary of the Turkish Republic
and was to be presented to foreign diplomats. The newspaper
described the publication of the map as "a scandal."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the publication showed that Turkey's
propaganda industry had failed to mislead public opinion
concerning historical reality in the region.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Greek government had already taken the
appropriate steps regarding the publication.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits, the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In March, Turkey questioned Greece's sovereignty of the Aegean
islands such as Fournoi, Agathonisi, Farmakonisi and Pserimos, but
Greece rejected Turkey's such claims, saying that the islands were
in fact Greek in accordance with the treaty of Lausanne in 1923
and the peace treaty of Paris in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Greece has always accused Turkey of trying to create problems
in the region by making claims beyond the bounds of reason and
contrary to international law.

<HEADLINE> Gaza Airport Opens to Traffic by Qi Deliang, Tan Xinmu, Dai Wei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat said Tuesday the opening of the Gaza
airport marked the peak of preparations for the Palestinians'
independence.
</P>
<P>
"I say to our Arab and Islamic nations, this inauguration is
the peak of preparations to declare the Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital if God permits," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"If God wishes, we will move soon from this airport towards
Jerusalem, which is the capital of the Palestinian state, and if
God wishes, we will land soon at Jerusalem airport."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his thanks to Jordan and Egypt for their
assistance in building this airport.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks when his presidential plane, carrying
a red-while-black Palestinian national flag, landed at the
airport hours after it was officially opened to traffic.
</P>
<P>
When they stepped down, the crew of the plane received warm
welcome by thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
The plane had been kept in Egypt and Arafat used to drive to
Egypt and then board the plane there.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday Arafat will set out on his presidential plane from
Gaza Airport to Paris to meet with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The airport, named Arafat International Airport, will greatly
facilitate and enhance direct air link between the Palestinian
territories to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
It embraced its first guests early Tuesday morning. An EgyptAir
Airbus was the first to touch down, carrying a high-ranking
Egyptian delegation headed by Minister of Information Safwat
Al-Sharif. The delegates included Egyptian lawmakers, businessmen,
intellectuals and actors.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and senior PNA officials walked along a red carpet to
greet the Egyptian guests.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the airport was part of the implementation of
the Wye peace accord signed last month in Washington between
Israel and the Palestinians. It had been held up for two years by
Israel, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
In all, seven flights were scheduled to arrive Tuesday, and a
special plane will fetch here European Union peace envoy to the Mideast
Miguel Moratinos.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister in charge of Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini
told Xinhua at the airport that for the Palestinians, the opening
of the airport was a big step toward an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are happy about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
PNA chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said that after years of hard
negotiations, this airport has finally been put into operation.
</P>
<P>
"The peace works," he pointed out, adding that "the opening of
the airport will also be helpful to the development of the
Palestinian economy."
</P>
<P>
A local Palestinian resident, Zeid Abu Elkerl, told Xinhua that
Tuesday is a wonderful day for the Palestinians because many
foreign flights came to this airport. This was the show of support
to the Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the airport's main building, four Palestinian girls and six
male staff members were busy with answering phone calls and
issuing tickets.
</P>
<P>
One of the girls, Sana Barbakh, said Tuesday was her first
official work day at the airport. "Today is the biggest happy day
for me in my whole life," she said.
</P>
<P>
The airport was built by Egyptian contractors with a total cost
of about 250 million U.S. dollars.

<P>
Under this resolution, Iraq is allowed to export 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil in a new period of 180 days beginning on
November 26, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The council requested the U.N. secretary-general to take the
actions necessary to ensure the effective and efficient
implementation of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The council decided to conduct a thorough review of all aspects
of the implementation of this resolution 90 days after it enters
into force.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq after its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. The Security Council adopted resolution 986 in
1995, which permitted Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil
every six months to buy food, medicine and other necessities for
its people.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the oil-for-food program began in
December 1996. To address the continuing deterioration of the
humanitarian situation in Iraq, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
recommended that the total sum of oil that Iraq was allowed to
sell be raised to 5.2 billion dollars in February, which was
approved by the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches Refugee Integration Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union started
Tuesday a campaign in cooperation with the United Nations to
integrate refugees into member state societies.
</P>
<P>
Apart from an educational program for European Union school
children, television, radio, newspapers and magazines were called
upon to arouse awareness in member states to support the joint
campaign by the commission and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
European Social Affair Commissioner Padraig Flynn said prior to
the start of the 12-month campaign that better information is
needed in schools, at workplaces and among the public that
refugees are ordinary people who have been forced to cope with
extraordinary situations and who are often highly-educated and
skilled individuals.
</P>
<P>
He described these people as having a huge amount to offer to
the societies they settle in.
</P>
<P>
"Europe's citizens should be prepared to see refugees not as a
threat but as people who are themselves threatened," he added.
</P>
<P>
The majority of refugees in the European Union live mainly in
Germany, France, Britain, Sweden and the Netherlands and the
European Union spends approximately 10 million ECU (11 million
U.S. dollars) each year on refugee integration programs starting
last year while the commission is financing some 100 projects
assisting refugee integration programs.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the commission, the executive body
of the 15-nation European Union, and the United Nations worked
together in an awareness-raising campaign of a large scale.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is represented in the campaign by its high
commissioner for refugees.

MOSCOW, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Customs Union of the four
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries -- Russia,
Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan -- was joined by Tajikistan
Tuesday, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
A decision to the effect was taken by the five presidents on
April 28, 1998. Now the move is legalized, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting of the heads of the five CIS governments, which
was held in Moscow Tuesday, Tajik Premier Yakhya Azimov told his
colleagues that the Tajik parliament had ratified the agreement
"On Deeper Economic and Humanitarian Integration" of March 29,
1996.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who also attended the
meeting, stressed that "restoration of common economic zone is a
way for economic regeneration of the countries of the Commonwealth
of Independent States."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that Russia welcomes the fact that "the Union of
the Four" turns to "the Union of the Five." The model of the
integration on this basis may extend to all the 12 CIS countries,
he said.

<P>
The Customs Union of the Four founded in March 1996 was aimed
at coordination of their economic reforms, deepening

MOSCOW, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The informal summit between
Russian and Chinese Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Jiang Zemin on
November 23 allowed the two countries to work out common stance on
strategic prospects of the bilateral partnership, the Russian
Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement signed during the visit "reflects the

According to him, during the meeting the two leaders reiterated
their close approaches to the situation in the Balkan region, the

<HEADLINE> Feature: Sanctions Wreck Iraq, Children Hit Most </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Six-month-old Ali Amer
struggled but failed to survive pneumonia, a curable disease, for
lack of antibiotics in sanction-wrecked Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's funeral procession, Amer was not lonely but
accompanied by other 31 little cronies. They are claimed to be the
latest 32 child victims of the eight-year-old devastating
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
When 32 cars, carrying their wood coffins, passing by the
U.N. weapons inspection center in Baghdad Tuesday, thousands of
tearful black-veiled women, unkempt old men and young students,
who took to the street to protest the sanctions, rushed to the
hearses to pay their last respect to the ill-fated children.
</P>
<P>
Amer's mother was too sad to say any words.
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with the innocent babies, they died of lack of
medicine, malnutrition and unjust sanctions," Fatima Haider, an
60-year-old woman, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She said her husband and three children have died of lack of
medicine and medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis shouted slogans and carried banners expressing
denunciation of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which
oversees Iraq's disarming of weapons of mass destruction as
required in U.N. resolutions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Iraq following
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and maintains that the sanctions
will not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Baghdad has cleared
of all banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused UNSCOM of serving the U.S. interests and
trying to prolong the sanctions. And there has been no visible
hope that sanctions can be removed in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The banners said "you (UNSCOM) are here to kill our children"
and "UNSCOM, you are here in our country to cover up the greatest
crime in history."
</P>
<P>
Shortages of food and medicine are the most immediate results
of the sanctions. Iraq claims that more than 500,000 children have
died since the outset of the sanctions, with one in every three
suffering malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Jassin Bassim attended the mass funeral procession with her
child in her arms. She said she wanted her child to remember this
tragic scene.
</P>
<P>
"I am here not to denounce any one, I hope the United Nations
lifts the sanctions and frees the Iraqi people of their
hardships," she said.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of our children, please lift the sanctions,"
said another weeping woman in black veil.
</P>
<P>
"We are born once, we die once, but we do not want to be killed
by weapons inspections," an angry Iraqi man shouted.
</P>
<P>
Due to the demonstration, the weapons inspectors, who were on a
routine inspection duty, did not go back to their office building
on time to avoid "unnecessary troubles."
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, the weapons inspections have been proceeding
smoothly since the UNSCOM inspectors returned to Iraq last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM inspectors were pulled out last week amid fears of
the U.S. airstrike against Iraq, sparked by Baghdad's decision on
October 31 to ban all the activities of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad backed off on November 14 and unconditionally allowed
the weapons inspectors to return when the U.S. was on its course
to launch an airstrike.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions remain unchanged, inspection missions continue
without new findings, children funerals become frequent. The
world attention seems to be drawn to the sufferings of the Iraqis,
especially the innocent children, rather than the weapons of mass
destruction, if any, in a country already crippled by the
sanctions.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Minister of
Tourism and Natural Resources Zakia Meghji said in Dar es Salaam
Tuesday that African countries should take eco-system into
consideration when they develop agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Closing a two-day conference of the Coalition of African
Organization for Food Security, Trade and Sustainable Development
(COASAD), Meghji said African countries must strike a balance
between the urgent need to increase grain output and the
constraints imposed by delicate eco-system.
</P>
<P>
She said: "We all know that in the tropics it does not rain
but it pours and the winds are harsh, the heat of the sun can be
very severe, and El Nino can easily be replaced by La Nina."
</P>
<P>
Man-made hazards such as setting fires in farmland,
overgrazing and dynamite fishing make eco-system even vulnerable,
she added.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that conflicts of interests should be
resolved if African countries want to develop sustainably.
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, tobacco industry needs cutting lots of
trees to cure tobacco leaves, causing environmental destruction.
One solution to the problem is to discuss with developers, grant
them a land and ask them to plant trees for industrial use.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day conference held in New Africa Hotel, COASAD
was officially formed after a constitution of the organization
was passed.
</P>
<P>
The idea to form COASAD was hatched in 1996 at the World Food
Summit and the World Forum of Non-governmental Organizations
(NGOs) in Rome to tackle problems of hunger, malnutrition and
poverty that are prevalent in the African continent. The Rome
assembly brought together 112 African organizations from 25
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The newly formed COASAD will on Wednesday open another meeting
to discuss key issues of sustainable food security and trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at the
University of Texas have designed an electronic "tongue" that
may be used by food and beverage manufacturers to taste and
analyze their products.
</P>
<P>
According to New York Times Tuesday, the device relies on
compounds that act as sensors, changing color in the presence of
specific chemicals. The researchers found a way to attach these
sensors to tiny beads that are then placed in microscopic
cavities machined into a chip of silicon.
</P>
<P>
When a liquid is placed on the chip, the sensors turn colors,
which are then read and analyzed by a computer.
</P>
<P>
They said that in theory the "tongue" could hold enough kinds of
sensors that would enable it to distinguish sweet, sour, salty,
bitter and the all the nuances among them.

ISLAMABAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdul

regional countries to bring peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Afghanistan is not a local problem. It is a regional problem
and we believe that a common position at regional level is

"There are many external and internal problems in the way of
peace in Afghanistan," he said. "There should be cooperation
between all regional countries and all major powers and parties
should play their role."
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Kamilov emphasized that Pakistan can
play "a very important role in peace process" in Afghanistan.
</P>

"We have been holding consultations with Pakistan on bilateral
and regional issues and we will continue cooperation with
Pakistan," the foreign minister said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Population, Food Production Targets Met </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam in 1998 has achieved the
targets on reducing the population growth rate and increasing food
production set for the year 2000, official media reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's population growth rate stands at 1.78 percent
this year, according to the General Department of Statistics,
compared with the goal of reducing the rate to below two percent
in 2000 put forth at the Eighth Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the birth rate for 1998 is 2.2 percent compared with
the 3.01 percent in 1989, which means an annual average reduction
of 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's food output in the past ten years increased by an
average of one million tons a year to reach 31.3 million tons in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The figure meets the target of between 31 and 32 million tons
set by the Eighth Party Congress for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
As food share per capita increased from 280 kg in 1989 to 400
kg this year, the country now is not only self-sufficient in food
but also has become the world's second biggest rice exporter with
3.8 million tons of rice shipped abroad in 1998.
</P>
<P>
These achievements have contributed greatly to eradicating
hunger and reducing poverty, especially in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Quebec's Bouchard Heads for Election Victory: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard
is heading for a solid victory in next week's provincial election,
according to a poll published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll shows that support for Bouchard and his separatist
Parti Quebecois (PQ) stood at 45 percent, while support for his
major rival Jean Charest and the Liberal Party stood at 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
Since Liberal backing is concentrated in a few ridings, "Jean
Charest would need at least a 4 percent lead to form the
government," according to the COMPAS poll for the National Post
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which interviewed a total of 678 Quebec voters, was
conducted between November 21 and 24. It was considered to be
accurate to within 3.9 points, 19 times out of 20.
</P>
<P>
An Angus Reid poll, made public Tuesday night, shows the PQ
with 44 percent of voter support, the Liberals with 39 percent and
the Action Democratique party with 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
When the 6 percent undecided voters were distributed, the
numbers were: 46 percent for the PQ, 41 percent for the Liberals
and 11 percent for the Action Democratique party.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard's popularity also remains high. Fifty-seven percent of
those polled believed he has the qualities needed to run the
French-speaking province, compared with only 37 percent for
Charest.
</P>
<P>
The Angus Reid poll was conducted for Radio-Canada from
November 18 to 23 and has a margin of error of three points, 19
times out 20.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Partner Threatens to Quit Govt Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The junior partner of the
coalition government in Nepal Wednesday threatened again that it
would pull out of the government if the prime minister does not
implement the agreements reached with it and nine left parties by
December 1.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) issued
the warning at its central committee meeting, Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
A four-member team was formed at the meeting to hold talks with
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and other leaders of the
Nepali Congress (NC) party, the state-run radio said.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML, which joined the minority government of the NC in
late August, had issued a sternly-worded ultimatum on November 17,
threatening to quit the government if the agreements are not
enforced by December 1.
</P>
<P>
The agreements include a 25-point one and a nine-point one the
NC reached separately in August with the CPN-ML and the nine left
parties including the CPN-ML. The agreements cover a number of
issues including the law and order situation in the country, the
withdrawal of Indian troops from Kalapani of far-western Nepal,
the review of the controversial 1950 Indo-Nepal Friendship Treaty
and holding the forthcoming elections in a free and fair manner.
</P>
<P>
The other left parties have decided to launch their first-stage
protest program peacefully and then resort to illicit means if
their demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), which has been pushing for early
elections, has also announced a two-month protest program starting
Friday to pressure the government for early, free and fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
Koirala has said that the elections would be held in April/May
next year, six months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, if the coalition government falls and
the parliament is dissolved, fresh polls should be held within six
months.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Rejects U.S. Demand for Inspecting Underground Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) has rejected a U.S. demand for inspecting
a DPRK underground facility which the U.S. suspects as a nuclear
one, a foreign ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Our side resolutely rejected the suspicion of 'underground
nuclear facility' as groundless and informed the U.S. side
of our consistent position of principle, " the spokesman told the
Korean Central News Agency (kcna) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the DPRK and the U.S. negotiated on
November 16-17 over an underground facility in Kumchang-ri, Taegwan
county of North Phyongan Province. And the U.S. suspected the
underground facility as a nuclear one and asked to inspect it.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has "faithfully implemented the DPRK-U.S. framework
agreement" since it was adopted in 1994, the spokesman said, noting
that his country, accordingly, "has no other underground nuclear
facility other than those frozen in the Nyongbyon area."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman admitted that there are many underground
facilities and tunnels in the DPRK owning to the "specific
conditions of the situation of Korea."
</P>
<P>
However, the underground facility under U.S. suspicion "has
nothing to do with nuclear activity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Calling the U.S. demand for inspecting the underground facility
and branding it as a nuclear one "a grave violation
of and insult to our sovereignty and dignity," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said his country has no obligation to allow the
inspection.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, if the U.S. makes adequate
compensation for its result to the DPRK, they may consider
allowing U.S. officials to visit the underground facility only
once as an exception, taking into account of the
DPRK-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. insisted it cannot make compensation,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.S. argued that the existence of the
DPRK-U.S. framework agreement is at stake if unconditional access
to the DPRK underground facility is not allowed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that if the U.S. wants to break the
framework agreement while having no plan of making compensation,
his country also no longer needs to observe the agreement
inconveniently.
</P>
<P>
"Our implementation of the agreement is unthinkable without
considering sovereignty, our lifeblood", he said.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and the U.S. are scheduled to hold their next round of
negotiation on the underground facility issue in New York in early
December.

<HEADLINE> EU Challenges U.S. Trade Law "Section 301" at WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
decided to launch a case within the World Trade Organization (WTO)
against Washington over its threat to unilaterally impose
sanctions on trading partners under its domestic legislation
"Section 301".
</P>
<P>
A senior EU official announced here Wednesday that a formal
written request will be made at a later date.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came at a time when the EU and the U.S. are at
the edge of a trade war over the EU's rules on banana imports
scheduled to be implemented on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Insisting that the revised EU rules on banana imports still do
not meet WTO criteria, the United States, backed by five Latin
American banana exporting countries, brought the case to the WTO
dispute settlement body.
</P>
<P>
There is now no official agenda when the banana case should be
ruled but the U.S. has set a deadline for a panel ruling on
January 15, 1999 and threatened to imposed sanctions worth 1.6
billion U.S. dollars a year on EU goods in February next year
under its trade law "Section 301".
</P>
<P>
The EU believes that the U.S. domestic trade law "Section 301"
itself would be a violation of WTO rules, saying that no one
except the WTO's dispute settlement body can authorize sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Brussels, EU trade commissioner Sir Leon Brittan
said that the EU would agree to a panel only if the U.S. suspended
its timetable for imposing trade sanctions, adding that the
U.S. also had to undertake to accept the ruling, even if it went
against itself.

STOCKHOLM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The danger of moving next
year's world table tennis championships from Yugoslav capital
Belgrade was over but the country is facing financial
difficulties hosting the event, a Swedish magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of Table Tennis magazine quoted the
International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) senior official
Nicke Bergstrom as saying that the ITTF had paid close attention
to the Kosovo issue in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
With the tension there somewhat assuaged, the danger of
Yugoslavia being stripped of the event slated for April next year
had been almost over, Bergstrom said.
</P>
<P>
But the funding for a new gymnasium built for the event has
not been fully accounted for, partly due to the past economic
sanctions imposed on the country.
</P>
<P>
Bergstrom said ITTF officials recently visited Belgrade and
met with government officials, who promised full support for the
hosting of the biennial event.

MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia now has 8,000 marine
troops and has no plan to further reduce it, General Pavel Shilov
told a press conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The marine force has been cut to one third of what it was in
1991, and is only one thirtieth that of the U.S. Marine Corps,
Shilov said.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, that number can be multiplied because the
equipment is being kept in good condition in warehouses, he said.
</P>

He said even though the supplies of new weaponry are
insufficient, some new communication hardware and weapons have
been arriving after the events in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
New BMD-3 landing combat vehicles and NONA amphibious guns are
being developed, he said.

<HEADLINE> UK's Highest Court: Pinochet Not Immune From Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom's House of
Lords ruled on Wednesday that Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet should not enjoy immunity from prosecution and he might
have to face extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords, the highest court in Britain, ruled on an
appeal against a High Court ruling that Pinochet's arrest in a London
hospital last month was wrong because the charges he faces took place
while he was head of state.
</P>
<P>
Among the five judges forming the special court, two voted in
favor that Pinochet should enjoy immunity while the other three
voted that he should not.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested on October 16, in a London hospital while
he was recovering from a surgery to his back, at the request of a
Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish judge accused that Pinochet is responsible for the
deaths and disappearances of more than 3,000 people during his
17-year rule which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
As the appeal was upheld by the panel, Pinochet will go on to live
in the London north clinic where he was under police guard.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was honored a permanent senator of Chile and came to
London with a diplomatic passport. Chilean government argued that he
should enjoy immunity from any prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The British High Court ruled out last week that Pinochet should
appear to a special court if he was not immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday is Pinochet's 83rd birthday. Two Chilean aircraft are
waiting at an airfield outside the capital where he was under
house arrest, previously ready to take him home.
</P>
<P>
Spain is the forefront country attempting to extradite
Pinochet. Other countries as Belgium also appealed that Pinochet
should be extradited to face alleged charges in their court.
</P>
<P>
The Court's decision was greeted by protesters outside the House
of Lords.

<HEADLINE> Pak, IMF Agree on 5.5B Dollar Financial Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Finance Minister
Ishaq Dar said Wednesday Pakistan has reached a crucial economic
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) without
compromising the national interests.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks between Pakistan and the IMF on a
proposed bailout financial package concluded here Wednesday after
almost two weeks of intensive discussions.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government reached the agreement with the IMF for
a 5.5 billion U.S. dollar financial package without giving into
the conditionalities of rupee devaluation and increase in utility
charges.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Dar said that "as per
commitment of the government the accord with the Fund reached on
the home-grown program without compromising the national
interests."
</P>
<P>
Dar said that of the 5.5 billion dollar financial package, an
amount of 1.33 billion dollars would be paid to Pakistan during
the current fiscal 1998-99 by the IMF, World Bank, Asian
Development Bank and other bilateral sources.
</P>
<P>
Out of the cash flow of 1.33 billion dollars by June 1999, the
World Bank and IMF would together provide 980 million dollars with
the remaining 350 million dollars from the Asian Development Bank.
Another 400 million dollars through bilateral sources have already
agreed upon, according to Dar.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the amount under the financial package would
include debt rescheduling restructuring of loans by the London and
Paris clubs.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Board of the IMF is likely to meet by
mid-December to consider the approval of the package, Dar said,
adding that the London and Paris clubs would be meeting
subsequently.
</P>
<P>
The minister assured there would be no increase in income tax
and wealth tax rates in addition to no forced liquidation of
Foreign Currency Deposits.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Wednesday by the IMF said that the program
has a sizeable external financing gap to be filled from several
sources. "The financing package envisaged under the program will
enable Pakistan to normalize its external payments relations," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Dar gave a categorial statement that the country will not
default on its foreign debt repayment. "We have already paid the
dues to the World Bank, IMF and Asian Development Bank (ADP) in
the first week of November."
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks between Pakistan and the IMF started
here on November 11 for the restoration of ESAF/EFF (Extended
Structural Adjustment Facility/Enhanced Financial Facility) and
approval of a financial bailout package.
</P>
<P>
Earlier two rounds of Pak-IMF talks were held in Islamabad in
mid-September and Washington in early October to finanlize the
restoration of the ESAF/EFF program, stalled after Pakistan's
detonation of nuclear devices on May 28.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Government Loses Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Coalition government led by Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
lost the vote by 214 to 314 in the 550-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Among the 528 deputies, 314 deputies, most of whom are from the
pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP), the True Path Party (DYP) and the
Republican People's Party (CHP) voted for the downfall of the
govenment.
</P>
<P>
The Yilmaz government was formed in June 1997 after the then
prime minister Necmettin Erbakan resigned under the pressure from
the military.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz is expected to submit his resignation to President
Suleyman Demirel at the presidential palace soon.
</P>
<P>
Under the Turkish Constitution, the parliament will be given 45
days to form a new government. If it fails to do so, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel, as head of state, will appoint a
care-taker cabinet which will operate until next April's general
election.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the ANAP and DYP, two center-right
parties, might reach a deal to form a new government with the
support from a small party.
</P>
<P>
The 17-month-old Yilmaz government has been accused by the
opposition parties of corruption and having relations with gangs
and mafia.
</P>
<P>
The crisis emerged after businessman Korkmaz Yigit claimed that
Yilmaz rigged the bidding process of the Turkish trade bank.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, IMF Agree on Crucial Economic Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- After three rounds of
marathon talks, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Wednesday reached an agreement on a bailout package of 5.5 billion
U.S. dollars for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
An IMF statement issued after Wednesday's talks said the IMF
mission has concluded discussions with the Pakistani government
and reached an agreement on a program of economic policies.
</P>
<P>
"After the review and approval by Fund Management, it will
serve as the basis for consideration by the IMF Executive Board of
reactivation of the ESAF/EFF (Extended Structural Adjustment
Facility/Enhanced Financial Facility) program," the statement
said,
</P>
<P>
The program has a sizable external financing gap to be filled
from several sources. The financing package envisaged under the
program will enable Pakistan to normalize its external payments
relations, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It also said that "effective implementation of the agreed
program, supported by adequate financing, will also pave the way
for restoration of confidence and resumption of high and
sustainable rates of growth."
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks between the IMF and Pakistan started
here on November 11 for the restoration of the ESAF/EFF program
and the approval of a financial bailout package.
</P>
<P>
Earlier two rounds of IMF-Pakistan talks were held separately
in Islamabad in mid-September and in Washington in early October
to finalize the restoration of the old financial program, stalled
after Pakistan's nuclear tests on May 28.

MOGADISHU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A mass exodus has begun in
the regions of Bay and Bakol Southwestern Somalia in the past few
weeks after the famine death rate increased dramatically in
Southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The refugees seem to be targeting Lower Jubba and the capital
Mogadishu where thousands of families with their children are
seeking food and shelter after serious food shortage accompanied
by armed hostilities which persisted in their home regions.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a thousand people have made their way to Hagar town,
170 Km Northwest of Kismayu, this week, according to the local
authorities of the town.
</P>
<P>
Abdi Afey Sheikh Ali, the district commissioner of Hagar town,
said that the people are mainly from the Bay and Bakol regions
who are now dying for lack of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
He said the community of Hagar has recieved Somali Shillings
4, 800, 000 (about 600 U.S. Dollars ) as the first local donation
for the internally displaced refugees. However, Afey said the
money is hardly enough for about a week.
</P>
<P>
The district commissioner also said the donation came after 13
people died of severe diarrhoea and malaria in this week while
dozens of others are also on the brink of death for malnutrition
related diseases.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Although the Southeast Asian
countries are still fighting to recover from the consequences of
the regional financial crisis, securities regulators of the region
reaffirmed their commitment to high levels of transparency and
disclosure in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
That is the message from a meeting here Wednesday attended by
the members of the Asia Pacific Regional Committee (APRC) of the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),
representing securities regulators from 16 regulatory bodies.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a follow-up to their Nairobi, Kenya, meeting in
September this year, in conjunction with the IOSCO Annual
Conference, to review their approach to the recent turbulence in
the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The delegates heard reports on market development and discussed
such issues as the operations of hedge funds, corporate
government initiatives in the region, recent reports issued by
global groupings such as the G22 and Year 2000 readiness efforts
in regional markets.
</P>
<P>
The delegates from 15 countries and regions decided to set up a
working group to gather information on hedge funds and to examine
the issues of regulation and better risk management of highly
leveraged activities.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to increase dialogue with banking
regulators in the region to improve the effectiveness of financial
market regulation in the region generally, to encourage its
members to actively support the development and adoption of high
standards of corporate governance, to improve regulatory
cooperation, including information exchange, so as to strengthen
market surveillance and maintain overall market transparency and
integrity.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom's House of
Lords ruled on Wednesday that Former Chilean leader
Augusto Pinochet should not enjoy immunity from arrest.
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords, the highest court in Britain, ruled on an
appeal against a High Court decision that Pinochet's arrest in a
London hospital last month at the request of a spanish judge was
wrong because the charges he faces took place while he was head of
state.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year old general might facing extradition to Spain if his
health permit.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested last month, in a London hospital while he
was recovering from a surgery to his back, at the request of a
Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of being responsible for the death and
 disappearance of more than 3,000 people during his 17-year rule
which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
As the appeal is upheld, the British government has to decide
whether to go ahead with extradition proceedings. Pinochet would
have to appear before a London magistrate's court unless his state
of health shows he cannot leave hospital.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday is the 83st birthday of the old general. Two Chilean
aircraft are waiting in an airport near the hospital where he was
under house arrest, previously ready to fly him home.
</P>
<P>
Spain was the forefront country attempting to extradite Pinochet
on genocide and torture charges.
</P>
<P>
A few other countries as Belgium also appealed to UK to extradite
the old general to their country to face alleged criminal charges of
murder or man-slaughter.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom House of Lords, the highest court in the nation
overruled an earlier High Court judgement giving Pinochet immunity
because of his situation as a former state leader.
</P>
<P>
The decision was greeted with cheers by protesters outside the
House of Lords.

<HEADLINE> New System Battles Computer Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A so-called firewall system
developed by the Beixinyuan Corporation to protect Novell Network
subscribers was released here today, marking the introduction of
the first domestic computer system designed to deter the mounting
incursions by hackers.
</P>
<P>
"We developed the system after thorough analysis of the
loopholes in the Novell Network," said Beixinyuan General Manager
Lin Hao. The corporation is one of China's major anti-virus
software developers.
</P>
<P>
The system, which features a device similar to the so-called
black boxes on aircraft, maintains a network login-in record
offering clues to incursion attempts by hackers, according to Lin.
</P>
<P>
Novell, a major international network producer, produces
operating systems widely used by governments, securities
exchanges, enterprises, and various institutions throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Development of the system is highly significant for efforts to
enhance the security level of China's computer network," said Qi
Jin, an official with the Supervision Bureau of Public Information
Network Security under the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
"The actual incidence rate for hacking is unavailable," said
Qi, adding that "the situation is nonetheless getting worse."
</P>
<P>
Several major computer hacking cases involving losses of
hundreds of millions of yuan were reported this year, up sharply
on figures for recent years.
</P>
<P>
Two young hackers in Yangzhou, east China's Jiangsu Province,
reportedly gained access to a local bank's computer system and
transferred 200,000 yuan from a local bank by hackering into the
bank's computer network.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Resumes Repatriation of Myanmar Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The repatriation of some 21,000
Myanmar refugees still living in Bangladesh resumed Wednesday,
ending a 16-month deadlock in the repatriation process.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of 46 Rohingya refugees of eight families
crossed the bordering Naaf river to return to their homes in
Myanmar, Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Mostafizur Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both governments and the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees were present when the refugees set out in
two boats from Teknaf, in Bangladesh's southeastern Cox's Bazar
district, on their way home to Arakan in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were received by Myanmar immigration officials at
the Kaningchong reception center across the border.
</P>
<P>
Although the resumption of the repatriation was regarded here
as a major diplomatic breakthrough in the Dhaka-Yangon relations,
the process of repatriation had moved rather slowly, Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were underway to expedite the return of the remaining
refugees, he added.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the latest arrangement between the two
countries, some 50 refugees would be sent back to Myanmar every
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Rohingyas from Arakan province of Myanmar crossed
into Bangladesh in early 1991, and took shelter in Cox's Bazar and
the hill district of Bandarban, also in southeastern Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
During the past seven years, 230,000 refugees have returned
voluntarily, and the remaining 21,000 in two refugees camps are
awaiting repatriation. The repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar
stopped in July 1997 reportedly as a result of the refugees'
refusal to return.

<HEADLINE> EU Sees Information Society as Job Creator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Half a million jobs will
easily be created in the European Union if job seekers have
matching skills in the Information Society-related industry, the
European Commission said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bright prospect for employment improvement was spelled out
by the commission when it adopted a report on job opportunities in
Information Society.
</P>
<P>
European Employment Commissioner Padraig Flynn said more
employment improvement in Information Society has been made, but
500,000 job vacancies still remained because applicants lack
adequate skills.
</P>
<P>
The Information Society-related industry, now producing 5
percent of EU gross domestic product, has employed more than 4
million people.
</P>
<P>
Between 1995 and 1997, more than 300,000 jobs were created in
the Information Society alone. And the Information Society-related
industry is now creating one fourth of new jobs in the union.
</P>
<P>
However, Flynn stressed that the union has to act decisively to
make the most of the potential of the rapidly-growing and
rapidly-changing Information Society-related industry.
</P>
<P>
It requires increasing efforts to promote an enterprise culture
in the union, a flexible but robust policy framework, and
increasing investment in job-related education and training,
according to Flynn.
</P>
<P>
Flynn also recommended that EU member states act swiftly to
ensure that the Information Society-related industry displays its
leadership in job creation, and that all member states work out
national Information Society strategies before June next year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16.6 million people are now unemployed in EU though
its monthly unemployment rate dropped to 9.9 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Employment has been a major concern for both European citizens
and officials, and each member state serving the rotating
presidency of the 15-nation union places the issue high on its
agenda.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Want Government to Help Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadians want their
governments to ease pressure on working parents and work out ways
to better help families, a recent poll said.
</P>
<P>
According to a poll conducted by the Southan News-COMPAS, 81%
of the respondents want the governments to make families the
cornerstone of a wide range of policies such as taxation, marriage
laws and financial help for elderly parents.
</P>
<P>
Eighty two percent of the respondents said the first priority
on the government's agenda is to change tax laws so that young
people could afford to support one parent to stay home.
</P>
<P>
There was equal enthusiasm for joint income tax returns that
would allow couples to pay lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
Canadians complain that their lives are emotionally and
financially strained by excessive work, job uncertainty, and
related pressures.
</P>
<P>
This suggests they are looking for government help, said the
poll.
</P>
<P>
Canadians also want governments to take a more practical and
direct role in helping families stay together. More than 60
percent of those polled favor compulsory pre-marriage courses, and
50 percent would favor a tougher divorce process for parents.
</P>
<P>
Women seem keener on pre-nuptial preparation than men. Asked
what degree of priority the government should place on pre-wedding
courses, 28 percent of women said "very high", compared with 20
percent of men.
</P>
<P>
However, more men favor making divorces tougher to get than
women, with 20 percent of men ranking a tougher divorce as the
high priority, nine percent higher than that of women.
</P>
<P>
Canadians also see inequity in the divorce system and want a
stricter enforcement of the law on both parents to improve the
situation of the children of divorced parents.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of Canadians say fathers and children get a
raw deal in divorce courts, and want stricter punishment for
custodial parents who deny legal access to non-custodial parent.

<P>
Yugoslavia now kept their unbeaten record intact with six

shouldn't forget how close every set was. Now we must forget this
victory and concentrate on tomorrow's game."
</P>

Italian coach Paulo De Freitas said: "I think it was a
one-sided game. Even if it hurts, you have to admit it when your
opponents are much stronger. They had a wonderful game.
</P>
<P>
"We always played at their rhythm and it was too bad. Their
receiving was excellent and they won the sideouts calmly. We tr
ied to make it even, but we were always behind them."
</P>
<P>
Also in Group H, China kept their chance to qualify for the
9th-place playoff alive, beating Ukraine 15-10, 10-15, 15-10 and
16-14.

very proud of my players. They are tired and in spite of being a
little depressed, they managed to find a great spirit this
afternoon."
</P>
<P>
Ukraine head coach Leonid Likhno said, "We made mistakes at
the end of the sets and our reception and setting were not
optimal. We have learnt a lot today: we need to control ourselves
better."

ISLAMABAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif said Wednesday he would hold talks with U.S.
President Bill Clinton on all issues of mutual concern during his
visit to the United States early next month.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made the remarks while talking to the media after
addressing a convention organized here by the Small and Medium

</P>
<P>
Apart from the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), F-16
fighters and other issues of American concern, the restoration of
military aid to Pakistan would also be discussed, the prime

</P>
<P>
"We will definitely talk about the restoration of military aid

more on its nuclear capability."
</P>
<P>
"The conventional military imbalance should be corrected, only
then things could progress in a better way," he said.

Meanwhile, Sharif said that America can play an important role

<HEADLINE> German Hoechst Talks Merger with French Rhone-Poulenc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- German chemical giant Hoechst AG
confirmed Wednesday in Frankfurt it was holding negotiations with
Rhone-Poulenc of France on the possible merger, but the outcome of
the negotiations is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the French daily Le Monde said that the merger deal
was on the verge of success and that an announcement could be
expected by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
The French daily said Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc are to
establish a parent company owned equally by the two, with
operations to be subdivided into two independent divisions, one in
Germany for agricultural chemicals, the other in France for
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The possible merger would create the world's second-biggest
"life sciences" chemicals company after the U.S. group Merck.
</P>
<P>
The new company, if established, would have its headquarters at
a site on the Franco-German border.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceuticals division will be based in Frankfurt and
headed by Richard Markham, a 48-year-old executive from the United
States. Currently, Markham is the head of Hoechst-Marion Roussel.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural chemicals division will be based in Lyon and
headed by a Rhone-Poulenc manager, Alain Godard, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce Procurator Ranking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing to introduce
a ranking system for its large contingent of some 160,000
procurators.
</P>
<P>
Procurators across the nation will be divided into four ranks
-- chief, grand, senior and procurator -- and 12 grades.
</P>
<P>
The system has been approved by the Ministry of Personnel, the
Organization Department of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, according to
a procurator attending today's national conference explaining the
system.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Procuratorate will introduce and
implement concrete methods for grading procurators in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
China's procuratorial system is based on four levels from the
Supreme People's Procuratorate down to county procuratorates.
Procuratorate chiefs at various levels lack distinct
titles, nonetheless they have quite different responsibilities and
power. For example, the chief of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate and heads of county procuratorates were all known as
procurator-generals.
</P>
<P>
"The outdated practice is detrimental to improving the
professional quality of procurators and to strengthening
the authority of the nation's legal system. It also adversely
impairs people's procuratorates from exercising their independent
procuratorial powers," according to the aforementioned source.
</P>
<P>
He said the new system will ensure quick and steady promotions
for outstanding procurators, while answering misbehavior with
demotions or severance.
</P>
<P>
He added that efforts to assign ranks and grades to
procurators across the country will be completed prior to the
end of March 1999.

<HEADLINE> Largest Optical Fibre &AMP; Cable Producer Set Up in Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze Optical Fibre &AMP;
Cable Co. Ltd. based in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, announced here today that it has become the largest
optical fiber and cable producer of the country following the
completion of its latest production expansion, the fifth over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
The company, a joint venture of China and the Netherlands
founded in 1988, now has the capability to produce 2.5 million
kilometres of optical fibre and 60,000 kilometers of optical cable
a year. It also boasts the most complete technology for optical
fibre production in China.
</P>
<P>
With an original investment of 72.5 million guilders, the
company now has total assets of nearly one billion RMB yuan, and
its total investment has surged to over 160 million guilders.
</P>
<P>
Investors of the company include the former Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications of China and the Draka Holding Co. of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said that six years ago, when the company
just started operation, China mainly depended on imported optical
fibre supply, but now the company has earned a 10 percent share in
the international market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company has provided optical fiber and cable for
the construction of a number of national telecommunications
arteries, such as the optical cable line linking Lanzhou, Xining
and Lhasa, capitals of northwest China's Gansu, Qinghai provinces
and the Tibet Autonomous Region in the southwest.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Urged to Implement Assembly Decrees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian House of
Representatives Speaker Harmoko Wednesday urged the government not
to be slow in implementing the decrees adopted by the recent
special session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
The MPR decrees include those on the holding of the May 1999
general election, limiting the presidential and vice presidential
terms of office, and launching an investigation into former
president Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko disclosed that the House leadership would soon convene
a consultation meeting with the government to discuss the
implementation of the MPR decrees.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the increasing corrections against
corruption, collusion and nepotism should be well attended to by
all parties through the legal channel.
</P>
<P>
He said this is in line with one of the decrees of the special
MPR session on clean governance.
</P>
<P>
Article four of this decree states that efforts to eradicate
corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately
upon any state officials, former state officials, their families
and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and
former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"It is our common responsibility, especially the government's,
to implement in full the people's message," Harmoko said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a suggestion by the ruling Golkar (Function
Group) faction in the House that Soeharto be put under house
arrest, Harmoko said the government should be responsive to
suggestions on current affairs from the people, including those
from factions in the House.
</P>
<P>
"But, observance of valid laws is also important," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, chairman of the Golkar faction in the MPR Marzuki
Darusman suggested that the government impose house arrest on
Soeharto for investigation on allegations that the former
president had amassed wealth during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko said that observance of valid laws would also be
indispensable because Indonesia is a law-abiding country.
</P>
<P>
Students and citizens in the country have held various
demonstrations recently, urging the government to bring Soeharto
to court on charges of corruption, collusion and nepotism.

<HEADLINE> Blair in N. Ireland to Save Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair held talks with Northern Ireland party leaders in Belfast on
Wednesday in an effort to salvage the peace process which is in
danger of collapse.
</P>
<P>
The process has been stalled because Protestant leaders are
refusing to allow the Irish Republican Army's political wing, Sinn
Fein, to take up seats in a planned new assembly in a row over the
disposal of guerrilla arms.
</P>
<P>
Seamus Mallon, the deputy first minister of the new Northern
Ireland Assembly, warned before meeting Blair that the effort to
achieve peace could be in vain unless decisions on the vital
issues are taken within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
He said he was "very afraid of inertia" and warned that details
over shaping new Northern Ireland institutions must be agreed by
the beginning of next week.
</P>
<P>
"If not, we will be in great danger of losing credibility in
this process," said Mallon, who is also deputy leader of the
nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP).
</P>
<P>
Blair, who was meeting all the main parties during the talks,
was hoping to narrow the gap between nationalists and unionists
over issue of shaping new executives for the Northern Ireland
Assembly and cross-border bodies.
</P>
<P>
According to David Trimble, the assembly's first minister and
Ulster Unionist leader, all sides are understood to be close to
agreeing arrangements for north-south institutions.
</P>
<P>
But there are still differences over the number of government
departments, which should be set up in advance of next February's
transfer of legislative powers from London to Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at Stormont to meet Blair, Trimble said, "There has
been a significant amount of progress but some issues remain
unresolved."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Attracts 250 Mining Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 25 (Xinhua) - Tanzania has issued more
than 250 mining licenses to local and foreign investors, from
last March to this September, to exploit its minerals,
a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Grey Mwakalukwa, the Commissioner for Natural Resources in the
Ministry of Energy and Minerals, was quoted Wednesday by local
press as saying that more businessmen from large investment
houses have become interested in the mineral prospecting in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He said that 171 licenses were issued to local prospectors and
85 to foreigners to exploit minerals of bauxite, beach sands,
chrysoprase, coal, cobalt, copper, diamond, dolomite, emerald,
gold, granite, graphite, gypsum, iron ore, limestone, marble,
mica, mineral water, nickel, niobium and clay.
</P>
<P>
The licenses also cover peridot, phosphate, pumice, ruby,
salt, sapphire, silica sand, soda ash, tantalite, tin, travertine
and uranium.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner explained that the objectives of the minerals
sector policy mean to guide the exploitation of natural
resources, boost the share of mineral sector in the national
economy, increase government revenue and ensure environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
"During the year 1997/98 fiscal year, more reserves of gold
were discovered, from 13.96m ounces known by June 1997 to 18.22m
ounces by May 1998," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Mines construction have already been started in five approved
projects, which were listed as Golden Pride project, Kahama
Mining Corporation project, Ashanti Goldfields project,
Anglo-American Corporation project and Rand Gold Resources
project.

<HEADLINE> Earthquakes in Ninglang Not Affect World Horticulture Exposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The two earthquakes which
jolted the Yi Nationality Ninglang Autonomous County of southwest
China's Yunnan Province recently will not affect the holding of
the '1999 Kunming World Horticulture Exposition in Kunming City,
capital of Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
On November 19, Ninglang County was hit by quakes measuring 5.0
and 6.2 on the Richter Scale, which killed three people and
injured more than 1,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Yan Fengtong, director of Yunnan Provincial Seismological
Bureau, said that the direct distance between the quake-hit area
and Kunming City is 300 kilometers and the quakes were not felt in
Kunming City when they occurred, for the two cities do not belong
to the same geological structure.
</P>
<P>
He said that the quakes will exert little impact on Lijiang
City, one of the major tourist cities of Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, there is no sign for greater quakes
on the basis of the data analysis from more than 400 quake
monitoring stations in the province.

<HEADLINE> China, Netherlands Ink Satellite Monitoring Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China and the Netherlands
inked a contract here today on a Sino-Dutch cooperative project to
use satellites to monitor desertification and crop yields.
</P>
<P>
The contract calls for the two sides to develop the world's
first remote sensing satellite system to monitor desertification
on the basis of evapotranspiration.
</P>
<P>
The system will also be the first to cover the whole of
China. The Chinese and Dutch governments will fund the project at
a cost of 32 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The National Desertification Monitoring Center under the State
Forestry Administration of China and the Environmental Analysis
Remote Sensing Company (EARS) of the Netherlands represent the two
parties in the project.
</P>
<P>
China's National Satellite Meteorological Center will provide
data from its Fengyun-II satellite, develop an efficient
receiving system, and compile a national energy and water balance
database.
</P>
<P>
The Integrated Natural Resources Survey Commission
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences will use the technology
over the next 2-3 years to develop a system for predicting the
nation's crop yield.
</P>
<P>
Extensive research conducted by EARS led to the development for
the system for mapping and monitoring rainfall and
evapotranspiration on a continental scale based on geostationary
weather satellite data.
</P>
<P>
Hofung, a Dutch trade company specializing in the transfer of
technology from the Netherlands and western countries to China,
will coordinate the project as a subcontractor.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that desertification and crop yields have always
been major concerns of the Chinese government. However, related
data on a national basis are difficult to obtain due to the vast
territory involved. The technology involved in this particular
project is expected to help solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> Renowned Archeologist Jia Lanpo Celebrates 90th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Jia Lanpo, the Chinese
archaeologist who stunned the world some 62 years ago when he
discovered three fossilized skulls of Peking Man, celebrated his
90th birthday today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Jia, senior academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), is noted for many great achievements in his studies of
Peking Man and other cultural heritages near Zhoukoudian in the
southwestern suburbs of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Pei Wenzhong, another leading Chinese archeologist, unearthed
the first broken skull of Peking Man who lived some 500,000 years
ago in 1929. The site has long been one of the world's major
archeological and paleoanthropological research centers.
</P>
<P>
"Academician Jia Lanpo is the forerunner who sparked the
dramatic development of research in China," according to Qiu
Zhuding, director of the CAS Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology
and Paleoanthropology. Qiu made the remark at a birthday party
organized for the well-known archeologist.
</P>
<P>
Jia and his colleagues have ascertained that Peking Man could
not have been the first human resident in China, and theorize that
there must have been a much older ape-like human.
</P>
<P>
The renown archeologist continues to work in spite frailty
resulting from his advancing age. He is also a foreign academician
with the American Academy of Sciences and has published 23 books
and more than 400 theses.
</P>
<P>
Jia expressed hope that the Peking Man ruins will be restored
conditions prevalent 500,000 years ago in order to provide younger
generations with vivid scene to the world at that time.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Intensifies Deep Sea Oil Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
intensified oil search in ultra deep water areas and completed
the first phase of a speculative seismic survey early this month,
The Guardian reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the government, an oil service
company called MABON Limited is being conducting the speculative
seismic survey on the nation's high sea, about 70 kilometers from
the shore line.
</P>
<P>
A Russian vessel, N.V. Akademik Lazarev, employed by MABON
Limited, has completed its first circle covering 700 kilometers
of 2-D survey in a water which has a depth of up to 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The survey job code-named Ar-5 has been split into two areas,
one in the south of Lagos and the other in the west of Port
Harcourt, Rivers State.
</P>
<P>
The survey, according to the paper, is aimed at raising the
nation's crude oil reserves from 25 billion barrels to 40 billion
barrels by the year of 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Special Adviser on Petroleum resources for Nigerian Head
of State, Aret Adams, alerted last week that the existing reserve
of 25 billion barrels would be exhausted within the next 34 years
at the current production rate of 2.0 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 25 exploration wells have been drilled in
the basin and the number is expected to exceed 30 wells by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
A reliable source in the oil industry confirmed that 23 new deep
offshore acreages were carved out by the government in 1991 and
more than 10 local and foreign oil companies have been
prospecting for crude oil in these areas since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"This singular act of opening up the deep offshore in
partnership with the federal government placed Nigeria's deep
offshore as the most active exploration basin in the world," the
paper quoted Aboki Zhawa, Permanent Secretary of the Petroleum
Resources Ministry, as saying.

<HEADLINE> European Commission Okays British DBES for Beef Re-Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union, on Wednesday approved
Britain's date-based export scheme (DBES), clearing further the
way for Britain to re-export its beef.
</P>
<P>
The commission made the move after the European council of
agriculture ministers approved the DBES scheme on Monday by a
simple majority of vote.
</P>
<P>
The commission can now wait to check on the application of the
control measures promised under the DBES scheme, and set the date
for re-export if the commission is satisfied with the check
results.
</P>
<P>
Only deboned beef and beef products obtained from cattle born
after August 1, 1996 and between six and 30 months of age can be
re-exported.
</P>
<P>
Potentially-contaminated animal feed, made from cattle, was
believed to have been removed from British farms after August 1,
1996.
</P>
<P>
At the agriculture ministers council meeting, 10 EU member
states voted for the DBES scheme, while Germany voted against and
France, Austria, Spain and Luxembourg abstained.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the exports of British beef was imposed in early
1996 after a link was established between the mad cow disease and
the Creutzfeld Jacob disease, a human form of the Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
In Britain alone, 28 people have died of the Creutzfeld Jacob
disease and over 175,000 cattle have been found with BSE.

<P>
Levy, who resigned as foreign minister in January over the
state budget issue and the lack of progress in the peace
process, has won certain concessions from Netanyahu for rejoining
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Beside taking the portfolio as national infrastructure minister,
he will be guaranteed the number-two spot on the Likud list in
the next Knesset's elections and join Netanyahu's inner "kitchen
cabinet" and take part in the final-status talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 400 to 500 Gasher members will be registered as
Likud Central Committee members and the state budget will
provide funding for the social concerns that prompted Levy's
resignation from the government in January.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had a telephone conversation Tuesday evening with
Levy on his return to the government and both agreed in principle
the above-mentioned conditions.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu delayed his European trip Wednesday and canceled his
visit to Switzerland in order to have more time Wednesday morning
to decide on Levy's return.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has some trouble within his coalition because the
National Religious party (NRP) openly rejected the Wye peace
accord signed last month in Washington with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Two ministers of the NRP voted against the accord while
several NRP Knesset members threatened to join the opposition in
the Knesset to bring the government down. Without Gesher, the
coalition only has 61 seats in the 120-member Kennset.
</P>
<P>
Some Likud members have voiced their rejection to Levy's
return. Communication Minister Limor Livnat said Wednesday she
would rethink her political future if Netanyahu accepted Levy's
return.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly made up his mind about the Levy
issue, but so far his office did not give any information on
this matter.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is scheduled to leave for London later Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has voiced his strong support
for Levy's return to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that Levy's return could
help boast Netanyahu's power in the government and the Knesset.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Gesher Party Decides to Rejoin coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli foreign
minister David Levy's Gesher Party decided Wednesday to rejoin
the coalition headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Gesher's key Knesset (parliament)
members in a meeting attended by Levy, his two brothers Maxim
Levy and Yehuda Lankri and other Gesher's Knesset members.
</P>
<P>
Levy agreed to take the post of minister of National
Infrastructure in the government.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who resigned as foreign minister in January over the
state budget issue and the lack of progress in the peace
process, has won certain concessions from Netanyahu for rejoining
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Beside taking the portfolio as national infrastructure minister,
he will be guaranteed the number-two spot on the Likud list in
the next Knesset's elections and join Netanyahu's inner "kitchen
cabinet" and take part in the final-status talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 400 to 500 Gasher members will be registered as
Likud Central Committee members and the state budget will
provide funding for the social concerns that prompted Levy's
resignation from the government in January.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had a telephone conversation Tuesday evening with
Levy on his return to the government and both agreed in principle
the above-mentioned conditions.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu delayed his European trip Wednesday and canceled his
visit to Switzerland in order to have more time Wednesday morning
to decide on Levy's return.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has some trouble within his coalition because the
National Religious party (NRP) openly rejected the Wye peace
accord signed last month in Washington with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Two ministers of the NRP voted against the accord while
several NRP Knesset members threatened to join the opposition in
the Knesset to bring the government down. Without Gesher, the
coalition only has 61 seats in the 120-member Kennset.
</P>
<P>
Some Likud members have voiced their rejection to Levy's
return. Communication Minister Limor Livnat said Wednesday she
would rethink her political future if Netanyahu accepted Levy's
return.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly made up his mind about the Levy
issue, but so far his office did not give any information on
this matter.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is scheduled to leave for London later Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has voiced his strong support
for Levy's return to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that Levy's return could
help boast Netanyahu's power in the government and the Knesset.

<HEADLINE> French National Assembly Speaker Defines African Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The French National Assembly
speaker (lower house of parliament), Laurent Fabius, said on
Wednesday that France will stick to its new African policy of
"neither interference, nor indifference."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement during a meeting with about 30 African
parliament leaders and Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore who
are here to attend the Franco-African summit to be opened on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While declaring that France and Africa need each other, Fabius
said that the French policy toward Africa would neither include
"paternalism," nor any "colonialist output" of the past.
</P>
<P>
He called on African nations to fight poverty, violence, acts
of intolerance, and conflicts, while cleaning up their financial
budgets, reducing deficits and opening up their market.
</P>
<P>
He also called on African countries to regard the Organization
of African Unity as an arbitration institution for solving
conflicts and maintain regional security in the continent.
</P>
<P>
"One should sometimes know how to impose an agreement (in
Africa)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that African nations establish a regional
peace-keeping mechanism with the support of its partners.
</P>
<P>
"Africa should have a system to maintain peace on a regional
basis with, if necessary, the logistic support of its friends," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is ready to provide support in building
such a system and that the reform of the French military
deployment in Africa is oriented toward this spirit.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the theories of both "Afro-optimists" and
"Afro-pessimists", and said that what is important is to
understand the reality.

<HEADLINE> Australia Faces Embarrassment Over Uranium Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia faces international
embarrassment over the Jabiluka uranium mine, with a U.N.
committee Wednesday demanding the mine be scrapped to prevent it
endangering the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area.
</P>
<P>
In a major embarrassment to the Howard government, the Bureau
of the U.N. World Heritage Committee found Kakadu was under
threat, raising the prospect that the committee will this week
make Kakadu only the 26th of the world's 552 World Heritage Sites
to be placed on its endangered list.
</P>
<P>
"The mission has concluded that Kakadu National Park is exposed
to a number of serious threats which are placing it under both
ascertained and potential danger," the bureau said in a report
after it sent a mission to Australia to examine claims by
conservation groups that Kakadu (National Park in Northern
Territory) was under threat from Jabiluka.
</P>
<P>
"The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and
mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed."
</P>
<P>
The finding was hailed by traditional owners and green groups
as a great victory, but Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted
the report as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go
ahead, according to Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Hill denounced the report as biased and unscientific and said
Australia would try to have it struck down before it is considered
by the World Heritage Committee in Kyoto this week.
</P>
<P>
He said he was astonished the report could call for the
scrapping of Jabiluka because of its perceived threat to Kakadu,
but did not object to the nearby Ranger mine, which had been
operating for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Northern Territory Chief Minister Shane Stone also accused the
report's authors of predetermining their findings.

</P>
<P>
The guidelines, among others, proposed that for offenses like

</P>
<P>
Ting said the guidelines were agreed to by the Cabinet at its
weekly meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the states are still enforcing the Cinema
and Public Entertainment Places Enactment 1958.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Fight Against Software Piracy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China has closed 72 compact
disks production lines in the past 26 months in an intense fight
against software piracy, according to Zou Bian, secretary general
of the China Software Alliance (CSA).
</P>
<P>
He says that many of the production lines were designed to
manufacture computer software as well as audio and video products
and that this piracy is causing at least 10 billion yuan in losses
for Chinese software producers every year.
</P>
<P>
A Center of Computer and Microelectronics Industry Development
Research (CCID) official says that China's software market is not
expected grow this year and revenues will be far lower than the
expected figure of 15 billion yuan at the beginning of the
year. Industry sources say that in addition to an economic
slowdown and shrinking demand, piracy is a factor in this.
</P>
<P>
According to a CSA study, there are 3 pirated copies for every
authentic piece of "CIBA" software on the market. CIBA is a
popular brand of software developed by Beijing's Kingsoft Company.
</P>
<P>
Over two-thirds of Chinese software producers regard piracy as
the major obstacle to expansion. A China Computer Software and
Technology Service's official says that, since software companies
have to have a high profit margin to compensate for high risks
and costs, they can hardly compete with piracy in pricing.
</P>
<P>
The cost to produce a pirated compact disk is only 2 or 3 yuan
(less than one U.S. dollar) so a production line can recover its
investment and begin making a profit with pirated software
in three months.

<TEXT>
<P>
But legitimate software companies can't sustain development if
they fail to sell a lot in the first 3 months after a new product is
released.
</P>
<P>
Zou says that piracy has driven many Chinese software companies
into financial difficulties and that these companies are weaker
than their overseas counterparts and have limited overseas sales,
so losing the China market means no growth for them.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the national software industry and fair
competition, the Chinese Government and software industry have
adopted strict measures to fight piracy.
</P>
<P>
The National Copyright Administration is expected to have some
progress in cracking down on piracy this year, after seizing
36,236 pieces of pirated software last year.
</P>
<P>
This year, customs officers in Guangdong and other provinces
seized several hundred million pirated compact disks, and the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region closed several underground
factories.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has decided to hold training programs to
teach government employees about protecting intellectual property
rights in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
China has given prison sentences of as much as 13 years to
copyright violators. The highest compensation that a Chinese court
has awarded in a software copyright violation suit amounted to 12
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
National Copyright Administration sources say that the most
urgent thing now is to compose an inventory of the country's
software producers to serve as a basis for industry regulations.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the software industry created more than 37,000 jobs
in China and it is estimated that for every 10 percentage points
in piracy decreases, China will add software sales worth 480
million U.S. dollars and other economic activities worth 820
million U.S. dollars, and 13,000 jobs. The government will also
add 77 million U.S. dollars worth of tax revenues a year.

XIAMEN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Scholars and specialists are
attending a symposium today to discuss the possibility of building
a tunnel under the Taiwan Straits to create a direct passage

</P>
<P>
The idea of building a cross-strait tunnel was first put

The symposium is sponsored by the 21st Century Development
Research Institute of Qinghua and a civil engineering, culture and

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy Expected to Grow 3.5 Percent Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy is
expected to grow by 3.5 percent next year and at least 5 percent
thereafter due to strong indicators showing an economic resurgence
in 1999, President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview here, Estrada said his administration will
continue to exert all efforts to revive the economy and pave the
way for renewed prosperity next year.
</P>
<P>
He said a strong peso and a bullish stock market are among the
favorable signs indicating that the economy will register a higher
growth rate next year compared with 1998 when an El Nino-induced
drought and the Asian contagion cut down official growth targets.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is showing signs of recovery, so be patient
because we are doing all we can to bring economic prosperity," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines is fortunate because it continues to
fare better than its neighbors in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Our peso is getting stronger against the dollar and our stock
market is on the way up. So these are good signs that the coming
year will lead us to the path to further progress," he said.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Wednesday released the last Iranian captive held in Afghanistan,
Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Manuchehr Amiri, an Iranian truck driver was handed over to
the Iranian representative in Heart, western Afghanistan, the
information department of the Foreign Ministry announced.
</P>
<P>
Amiri was arrested with dozens of Iranian truck drivers who
were accused by the Taliban of sending arms to the Iran-backed
the Northern Alliance headed by Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Before Amiri's release, the Taliban had freed 51 Iranians in
five groups since August 23 after Iran deployed more than 200,000
troops on its eastern border with Afghanistan following the
killing of eight Iranian diplomats and a reporter in Afghanistan
in August.
</P>
<P>
The release of Iranian captives held by the Taliban is
one of Tehran's conditions for any talks with the group.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Leader Meets French Trade Union Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, Standing
Committee member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee Political Bureau, met today with Louis Viannet, general
secretary of the General Confederation of Trade Unions of France.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who also serves as chairman of the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions (ACFTU), noted the long history of friendly exchanges
between the ACFTU and French confederation. He also pointed to the
steadily progressing relations between trade unions in the two
countries since Viannet visited China five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Friendly exchanges between the two organizations, and
industrial and local trade unions have also expanded, said Wei.
</P>
<P>
He cited the important role the confederation plays in all
aspects of political, economic and social life in France. He said
the ACFTU hopes to further promote friendship and cooperation with
the confederation based on independence, equality, mutual respect
and mutual noninterference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Wei said Viannet's visit will help promote the development of
relations between trade unions in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Wei briefed Viannet on the 15th CPC National Congress, the
First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) and
China's political and economic situations, as well as guidelines
and tasks outlined during the 13th National Congress of Chinese
Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
Chinese trade unions lack work experience related to new
circumstances arising with the socialist market economy and
are fully prepared to promote exchanges with the confederation,
said Wei.
</P>
<P>
Viannet said the confederation attaches great importance to
friendly ties with Chinese trade unions. He added that new
circumstances make it necessary to increase contacts
between trade unions in the two nations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that his visit will provide a good
opportunity for expanding relations between trade unions in the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> EU to Continue Investigating F-1 Broadcast Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
confirmed that it would continue investigating into the disputed
broadcasting rights for the Formula One motor racing.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's edition of the journal European Report quoted
commission sources as saying that the investigation by the
commission's fair competition watchdog is not going to be
concluded before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was launched in December last year when the
commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European Union,
found the current broadcasting rights contract scheme was
incompatible with the European Community Treaty.
</P>
<P>
European Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert, who
launched the investigation especially into the broadcasting
contracts, has labeled the way motor racing is run as "layer upon
layer of violations" of the competition rules of the union.
</P>
<P>
Bernie Ecclestone, the supremo of Formula One, requested
formal exemption from the European Union anti-cartel rules
enshrined in Article 85 of the Amsterdam Treaty for a network of
business arrangements on which the motor racing sport is based.
</P>
<P>
The Formula One Administration Ltd., the British-registered
company, however, argued that the concerns raised by the European
Commission have been dealt with and the concerns were described
by Ecclestone as only a few "minor issues".
</P>
<P>
The company has signed up a television broadcast contract with
the Federation of International Automobile, the governing body of
motor sports in the world, giving itself broadcast rights up till
2020.
</P>
<P>
One German television company, AETV, was angered by the
commission's slowness in the investigation. The company has
challenged the rules of the Federation of International
Automobile governing television broadcast contracts.

<HEADLINE> Estrada: First Pacific Deal to Promote Phone Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that the buy-in of Hong Kong-based First
Pacific into the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)
would vastly improve telecommunications services in his country.
</P>
<P>
The public would emerge as the ultimate winner in the deal
between PLDT and First Pacific because it would mean better phone
service and more foreign capital flowing into the country, Estrada
said in an interview here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this will benefit us because this would bring in
dollars and this is what we want -- the entry of foreign
businessmen making long-term investments here," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the U.S.-based Southwestern Bell also wants
to acquire a stake in PLDT, thus boosting further the prospects
for better phone service in the country.
</P>
<P>
First Pacific, the mother company of cellular phone firm Smart
Communications Inc., took over PLDT management Tuesday after
acquiring a 17.2-percent stake in the local telephone giant for
29.7 billion pesos (742 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
First Pacific managing director Manuel Pangilinan replaced
Antonio Cojuangco Jr. as president and chief executive officer of
PLDT.
</P>
<P>
Pangilinan expressed confidence that the consumers will be the
main beneficiaries of the takeover deal.

NEW DELHI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Police discovered an illegal

Allaharad, some 630 kilometers southeast of here, and arrested
three members of an inter-state gang linked with the factory.
</P>

The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that police recovered
finished and unfinished counterfeit notes in the denominations of
100 and 500 rupees along with costly dyes and different kinds of
color.
</P>
<P>
A huge quantity of costly papers and silvery thread used for
printing such notes were also seized, an area police chief in the
city said.
</P>
<P>
The seized notes resembled real ones, the police official said,
adding that the gang used to shift the place of operation to
escape police trap.

<HEADLINE> Car Credit Facing Uphill Battle in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A survey by Beijing's biggest car seller, the Beifang Car
Market, showed that only 2.9 percent of the people questioned
think that cars are cheap, and 61 percent of the people questioned
say they think they are too expensive and 73 percent of them say
that cars selling below 100,000 yuan would better suit China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cities, in any case, are already plagued with a serious
shortage of parking space. Beijing has 1.3 million vehicles and
needs over 1.5 million parking slots, according to international
standards, but has only 57,000 parking slots.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the down payment system of various car manufacturers
that started at the end of 1996, attracted some reluctant people
to the car market but had to be stopped because of a number of
incidences of bad debts and difficulties in making payments.
</P>
<P>
Bankers seem to have been prepared for the difficulties however
and remained cool-headed. Liu Ming, the manager of the Qianmen
branch of the Construction Bank of China, admits that the new
financial service could only be enjoyed by a small number of rich
people and that his bank could only make four or five deals to
date.
</P>
<P>
So, the bank has temporarily stopped taking customers' houses
and cars as mortgages because the bank can easily get embroiled in
legal disputes and needs to coordinate all this with a wide range
of government institutions that include land, judicial, industrial
and commercial bodies, as well as housing reform departments, in
arranging these mortgages.
</P>
<P>
And, if a company or institution fails to pay, they can take
their houses and even their staff, Liu says, but cannot very well
drive people out of their homes, because most likely they have
nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
A Beifang Automobile Market analyst says that because of an
inferior business environment, one should not expect consumer
credit to bring substantial growth to the car market in the short
run.
</P>
<P>
One should have a cautious, optimistic attitude about credit in
its ability to revitalize the market, he says.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Torch to Make First Journey Through Oceania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia announced
Wednesday the Sydney 2000 Olympic torch relay will spend 16 days
in the year 2000 traveling through Oceania, visiting 12 South
Pacific island nations on its way to the Sydney 2000 Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the route of the Olympic torch through Oceania,
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that the Pacific
island countries would share the spirit of the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The relay will begin with the lighting of the Olympic Flame at
Olympia, Greece, on May 12, 2000. After journeying around Greece
for nine days the torch will be flown to Guam, the first
destination in Oceania on May 23, 2000.
</P>
<P>
After Guam the torch relay will travel to the Federated States
of Micronesia, Nauru, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea
(PNG), Vanuatu Samoa, American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Tonga,
Fiji and New Zealand before arriving in Australia on June 8, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In PNG, the torch will visit the scene of one of Australia's
crucial battles of World War II, with a brief pilgrimage to the
Kokoda Trail.
</P>
<P>
In 1942, more than 600 Australians were killed fighting the
Japanese invading troops along the Kokoda trail, which crossed
the Owen Stanley mountains and linked the capital Port Moresby
with north coast beaches.
</P>
<P>
While exact details of the Olympic torch relay have yet to be
finalized, Howard said the Olympic flame would visit the village
of Kokoda.
</P>
<P>
The torch will travel an average 70 km each day on the 17,000
km journey through Oceania.
</P>
<P>
The relay will be marked by special events in the capital of
each country, while the torch will visit Auckland, Wellington and
Christchurch in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Describing the torch as the most memorable and evocative
Olympic symbol, the Australian prime minister said he wanted the
torch relay in Australia to touch the broadest cross-section of
the Australian community and the Australian experience.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he also wanted the relay to showcase the lives of
Australia's near neighbors of the region and help reveal to the
world a little more of the rich history and culture of the
Oceania region and its people.

<HEADLINE> One in Four Australians Knows an HIV-Positive Person </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one in four
Australians now knows someone who is HIV (human immunodeficiency
virus) positive, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three percent of Australians are personally aware of
someone with HIV or AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) --
higher than the world average (19 percent) but lower than the
United States (27 percent) and France (34 percent).
</P>
<P>
AAP said the annual Global Sex Survey conducted by condom
manufacturer Durex found that the British are becoming more
sexually promiscuous, but are among the least likely to worry
about contracting HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
One in four Britons does not worry about it at all and they
reported an increase in their sexual partners from 9.5 in 1997 to
11.6 this year.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the survey of 13 countries and one region shows that
one in 10 people has made a conscious effort to have fewer sexual
partners.
</P>
<P>
Only 5 percent of all respondents have been unfaithful several
times but nearly half of those who regularly cheat fail to protect
themselves against sexually-transmitted diseases with a new
partner.
</P>
<P>
Australians' reported condom usage is around 40 percent, lower
than the global average of 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although 65 percent of respondents overall were worried about
HIV/AIDS, almost half had not changed their behavior.
</P>
<P>
Only 6 percent of Australians had reduced their number of
sexual partners and 5 percent had started to ensure they use a
condom most of the time, Durex manager Tim Evans said.
</P>
<P>
"Our survey shows that despite educational initiatives, an
alarming number of people who carry on simultaneous relationships
don't use a condom during sex to protect both themselves and their
regular partner," he said.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that those over 40 years were least concerned
about HIV/AIDS, but 71 percent of the 16- to 19-year-olds said
they would use a condom with a new partner.
</P>
<P>
Ten thousand people were interviewed for the survey for World
AIDS Day in Australia, Hong Kong, Mexico, the United States,
Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Poland,
Russia, Thailand and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> EU to Continue Investigating F-1 Broadcast Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
confirmed that it would continue investigating into the disputed
broadcasting rights for the Formula One motor racing.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's edition of the journal European Report quoted
commission sources as saying that the investigation by the
commission's fair competition watchdog is not going to be
concluded before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was launched in December last year when the
commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European Union,
found the current broadcasting rights contract scheme was
incompatible with the European Community Treaty.
</P>
<P>
European Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert, who
launched the investigation especially into the broadcasting
contracts, has labeled the way motor racing is run as "layer upon
layer of violations" of the competition rules of the union.
</P>
<P>
Bernie Ecclestone, the supremo of Formula One, requested
formal exemption from the European Union anti-cartel rules
enshrined in Article 85 of the Amsterdam Treaty for a network of
business arrangements on which the motor racing sport is based.
</P>
<P>
The Formula One Administration Ltd., the British-registered
company, however, argued that the concerns raised by the European
Commission have been dealt with and the concerns were described
by Ecclestone as only a few "minor issues".
</P>
<P>
The company has signed up a television broadcast contract with
the Federation of International Automobile, the governing body of
motor sports in the world, giving itself broadcast rights up till
2020.
</P>
<P>
One German television company, AETV, was angered by the
commission's slowness in the investigation. The company has
challenged the rules of the Federation of International
Automobile governing television broadcast contracts.

BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of General
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), met here
today with Thananist Niemtan, commander-in-chief of Thailand's air
force.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who also serves as member of China's Central Military

development of cooperation in political, economic, cultural and
military areas since the forging of bilateral diplomatic ties.

with cooperation in army building, personnel training, military
industry and efforts in national economic development. The air
forces of the two countries have also maintained close ties, he

relief work in this summer.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Car Credit Facing Uphill Battle In China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Four Chinese banks can now
issue loans to people who want to buy their own cars to increase
domestic demand and help reach the national goal of 8 percent
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Construction Bank of China, the Bank of China, the
Agricultural Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China have started accepting car loan applications, but there
are a lot of sceptical remarks about prospects for getting credit
and many people wonder whether it will really help China's sleepy
car market.
</P>
<P>
A China Automobile Industry Association report says that the
credit comes in a sluggish market, with car demand plummeting in
the January-September period. Car sales had a yearly rise of only
3.65 percent in the nine-month period, compared with 27.2 percent
for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In China, cars selling for less than 100,000 yuan are limited
to the Charade and Alto, while most cars available, like the
Santana, Citroen, Jetta, Red Flag and Audi, range in price from
100,000 to 200,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the car loans is way beyond the reach of the
average Chinese, who make about 12,000 yuan a year, or average
household earnings of 20,000-25,000 yuan, according to a survey
done in 12 major cities in relatively developed eastern parts by
the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In addition, car owners have to pay annual inspection fees,
road maintenance fees, repair costs, and fuel costs, which amount
to about 10,000 yuan.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
announced Wednesday that all Airport Authority (AA) members would
be re-appointed for a further six months to ensure continuity.
</P>
<P>
The term of these members including Chairman Wong Po-yan and
Vice-Chairman Lo Chung-hing, which is due to expire on November 30
this year, will be extended from December 1 this year to May 31
next year.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said: "Given the recent transition of
the airport from construction to operation mode and that various
airport inquiries are in train, the government considers it
appropriate, as an interim arrangement, to re-appoint all the
members of the AA for a period of six months."
</P>
<P>
"It is premature at this stage to say what changes would be
made to the composition of the Board (Airport Authority) in
future. The government will give careful consideration to all
relevant factors nearer the time," he added.
</P>
<P>
A commission in Hong Kong is now conducting inquiries on new
airport problems which cropped up at the beginning of its
operation such as long flight delays, lost luggage and the air
cargo suspension due to a systems breakdown.

LAGOS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A center for space science and
technology education for English-speaking African countries would
be formally commissioned in Nigeria Thursday by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
A report Wednesday by the Nigerian Tribune said the center
would be located at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife,
Osun State, in southwest Nigeria.
</P>

The paper quoted Nigerian Minister of Science and Technology
Sam Momah as saying that the center would offer the best possible
education, research and applications experience to its
participants in all its programs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there was need for international cooperation in
space science for better applications and space exploration
programs, as it had the potential of benefiting all nations
individually and collectively.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for the provision of appropriate and
non-discriminatory assistance to developing countries to enable
them to build adequate capacity for sustainable space technology.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the decision to establish the center
was reached as part of the U.N. General Assembly's resolution
45/72 of December 11, 1990, to help member states enhance their
indigenous capacity.
</P>
<P>
Out of the six countries which vied for the location of the
centers in their territories, Nigeria and Morocco were selected

<HEADLINE> Iran Promises to Punish Attackers on U.S. Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Information
Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi has promised to punish those who
attacked American visitors in Tehran, the official news agency
IRNA reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Those involved in the incident will decisively be dealt
with," Najafabadi told IRNA in Kerman, central Iran on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, a group of Iranian shouting "Death to America"
smashed windows of a bus carrying 13 foreign visitors, mostly
Americans in northern Tehran. They accused the Americans of being
members of the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the attack as an "ugly act," the Iranian minister
said that investigations are under way.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any foreigner who enters Iran with a valid
visa must be respected and honored and if any action has to be
taken against anyone, it should be conducted through appropriate
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
Anyone acting on his own to pester or provoke tourists can not
be tolerated by the government, Najafabadi warned. He promised to
seriously follow the case up legally.
</P>
<P>
The minister also condemned the murder of the opposition
leader, veteran political activist Dariush Foruhar and his wife,
who were knifed at their residence in Tehran on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foruhar was the leader of the opposition Iran Nation Party and
served as minister of labor and social affairs in the provisional
government immediately after the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
He said that the murder case is being investigated by the
security forces and the judiciary, and any criminal involved in
this "horrendous and heinous crime" will ultimately be brought to
justice.

<HEADLINE> 1.2 Million Australian Homes Linked to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1.245 million of
Australian households were linked to the Internet in August 1998,
soaring above 1 million for the first time in the nation's
history, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of households hooked up to the Internet in August
represents an increase of 18 percent from May 1998 and 46 percent
higher than in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
More than half of these homes were using the Internet to access
or send e-mail rather than to surf the Worldwide Web and hardly
any was using it for home banking, a recent ABS survey found.
</P>
<P>
But additional ABS statistics found that 51 percent of those
households, or 633,863, only used the e-mail service on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of households on the Internet consisted of a
married couple with children while about a quarter were married
with no children.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said nearly 4.2 million adults, or one in three, had
accessed the Internet in the 12 months to August, up from 3.6
million in May.
</P>
<P>
Of those adults, 1.9 million accessed the Internet at home and
1.9 million at work.
</P>
<P>
Others used the Internet at other places, such as a friend's
house or a library. Most adults used the Internet two to six times
a week.
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of adults using the Internet in the past year
lived in capital cities and users were more likely to be male than
female.
</P>
<P>
People aged over 55 were less likely to access the Internet,
with younger people the most frequent users.
</P>
<P>
The survey also measured the extent to which adults used the
Internet to buy or order goods and services for private use.
</P>
<P>
It found 13 percent of adults bought something over the
Internet in the past year, mainly an overseas item, from a home
computer.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded near an
army barracks under construction in Swaziland last Friday, hours
before the blast in the capital of Mbabane, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Swazi police and army said Wednesday that the first bomb
exploded at Bethany, near Matsapha, in a forest next to where a
new army barracks was being built.
</P>
<P>
However, they would not say why the blast was kept secret
until now, according to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Residents thought the explosion was lightning, as a
thunderstorm swept over the area that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the blast, another bomb exploded at the
offices of Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Khoza in Mbabane, killing
one security guard and injured two other people.
</P>
<P>
An unknown group calling itself "the Tigers" has claimed
responsibility for the bomb at Khoza's offices.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, two bomb threats were made to government
departments at a hill top in Mbabane, causing hundreds of public
servants to evacuate their offices while police and bomb experts
searched the buildings. But no bombs were found.
</P>
<P>
Bomb experts have been making daily inspections at the 15
government departments and offices of Prime Minister Sibusiso
Dlamini and cabinet ministers since the blasts last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Offers to Give Foundations to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's former President
Soeharto said he would turn over to the government seven
foundations which he had "set up in his capacity as an ordinary
citizen," according to a senior minister here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Last Sunday, Soeharto sent President Habibie a letter dated
November 22, expressing his decision to hand over Supersemar,
Dharmais, Dakab, Amal Bakti Muslim Pancasila, Dana Sejahtera
Mandiri, Dana Gotong Royong and Trikora foundations to the
government," Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare and
Poverty Eradication Haryono Suyono said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Suyono said the president has decided to make use of these
foundations to help the destitute.
</P>
<P>
Three of the foundations -- Supersemar, Dharmais and Trikora --
will provide scholarships to poor students and orphans and offer
free health services to orphanages, he said.
</P>
<P>
The other four foundations will aim to empower poor families so
they could improve their financial status, he said.
</P>
<P>
Suyono said the president appointed the coordinating minister
for people's welfare and poverty eradication as coordinator of
these foundations' operations.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the evening daily Suara Pembaruan on
Wednesday, Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib said the government
will soon set up an independent commission to investigate
Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be made up of figures with strong integrity
and credibility, he said, adding that it will not include
government officials.
</P>
<P>
In September this year, President B.J. Habibie formed two teams
to investigate the wealth of Soeharto. An official at the Attorney
General's Office last week said Soeharto has 2.3 million U.S.
dollars in 72 domestic banks. But some estimates have put
Soeharto's wealth at 40 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's GDP Down 6.8 Percent in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's gross domestic
product (GDP) shrank 6.8 percent in the third quarter of 1998,
showing the third consecutive quarterly contraction amid a severe
economic recession, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sharp fall of GDP in the third quarter followed a 3.9
percent decline in the first and a 6.8 percent decrease in the
second.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, GDP dwindled 5.9 percent
on a year-on-year basis, said the central bank.
</P>
<P>
In terms of gross national product (GNP), the national economy
contracted eight percent in the third quarter, leading to a
seven-percent decline in the first nine months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output in the third quarter fell six percent due to
poor performance in the agricultural, construction and service
sectors, following a 6.2-percent decrease in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing industry posted a minus 7.9 percent growth in the
third quarter while construction and service sectors registered
minus 12.9 percent and minus six percent growth respectively.
</P>
<P>
Because of the International Monetary Fund-led retrenchment
program, the country's total consumption in the third quarter
plunged 11.8 percent from a year ago, resulting in a 11.5-percent
fall in January-September this year.
</P>
<P>
Last December, South Korea borrowed 58 billion U.S. dollars
from the International Monetary Fund after it was gripped by a
financial crisis triggered by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans
of financial institutions.

ISLAMABAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and India opened
talks here Wednesday on technical details of export of power from
Pakistan to India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Power Ministry Secretary Ibrahim Shah is leading the
Pakistani side while his Indian counterpart, Pradeep Baijal, is
heading a seven-member team in the talks.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides are working out technical details relating to
the purchase of surplus power in Pakistan," officials from the
Ministry of Water and Power said.
</P>
<P>
The quantity and cost of power are another subject on the
agenda of the two-day discussions, they said.
</P>
<P>
The talks are being held in line with an understanding reached
between Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian
counterpart, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in New York in September this
year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has a surplus of some 3,000 MW of power and India has
shown interest in buying the surplus power to meet a shortage in
the northern states of Haryana, Punjab and Rajastan.
</P>
<P>
If a sale-purchase agreement in the power sector between
Pakistan and India comes about, it could be a harbinger of change
in the other aspects of the commercial relationship between the
two countries, according to official sources.

<HEADLINE> Four State Assembly Polls Begin With Low Turnout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Polling began Wednesday
morning in India's four states on a dull note in the elections to
the state assemblies amid tight security and with a low turnout.
</P>
<P>
As the polling stations opened at 7 o'clock local time for the
10-hour polling in the states of Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh
and Mizoram, the turnout of voters was apparently lower than
expected.
</P>
<P>
In Delhi, where opposition Congress President Sonia Gandhi and
the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's Chief Minister Sushma Swaraj
were among the early voters, polling remained low-key in the 69
constituencies in the first few hours in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Polling in the 320 constituencies in Madhya Pradesh, where
2,511 contestants are in the field, had a listless start with
hardly any queue before polling stations, according to the Press
Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
In Rajasthan, where 1,422 candidates are in the fray for 197
seats, many polling stations wore a deserted look as polling began
on a low key, said PTI.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said polling began peacefully for the 40
Mizoram assembly seats for which 221 candidates are contesting.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 million people are expected to go to the polls
Wednesday to decide the fate of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) and the Congress, the main opposition party, in the four
states and another 12 assembly seats in six other states.
</P>
<P>
The fierce contest for the 626 assembly seats is seen as a
major test of popularity for the Congress, which is seeking to
rejuvenate itself under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi. It is as
crucial for the BJP, as a defeat for it might lead to a
realignment of political forces in the country, making the
eight-month-old BJP-led coalition government unstable.
</P>
<P>
Tight security arrangements were made in the four states with
seal of borders and deployment of tens of thousands of police,
security personnel, paramilitary forces and home guards to ensure
the smooth conduct of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said anti-incumbency factor coupled with people's
anger over the price rises and dismal performance of the Delhi
government is likely to play a crucial role in deciding the poll
outcome.
</P>
<P>
During the month-long campaign for the assembly polls, the
Congress accused the BJP of failing on all fronts and laid the
blame for crime rise and economic slowdown, particularly the price
rises, on the BJP rule while BJP said the previous governments led
by the Congress should be responsible.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Hopeful of Better Deal Between PAL, Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada expressed his hope Wednesday that Philippine Airlines
(PAL) can get a better deal from U.S.-based Northwest Airlines,
which can make Manila its operations hub in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview Wednesday morning, Estrada said PAL
Chairman Lucio Tan is now in the United States to get the best
terms possible for the national flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
Tan reopened negotiations with Northwest after calling off
talks with Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways due to a major
disagreement over the latter's insistence on retrenching thousands
of PAL pilots and other employees.
</P>
<P>
The downsizing plan runs counter to President Estrada's earlier
commitment to protecting the security of tenure of PAL workers.
</P>
<P>
"As a businessman, he (Tan) is looking for the best partner for
PAL," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
"That's a private matter between PAL and Northwest which we
won't interfere with," Estrada added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Estrada called on the management of PAL to
ensure the retention of its workers "at all costs" when
negotiating with foreign investors willing to buy into the
financially-troubled airline.
</P>
<P>
Tan earlier turned down Cathay's demand for firing workers,
including 200 pilots who stuck with him when PAL went on strike
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
PAL closed down on September 23 after talks between its
management and workers collapsed, but resumed operations on
October 7 after a series of talks brokered by President Estrada.
The talks led to the ratification by PAL employees of a
labor-management accord through a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The accord gave PAL employees 20 percent ownership in the
airline plus three board seats, in return for a 10-year suspension
of their collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the workers voted for the management proposal
after they were assured by Estrada that he would protect their
security of tenure in the company.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Lagging Behind on Y2K Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has been ranked

bottom in an international survey of 33 countries on Year 2000
computer compliance, The Dominion newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based daily said an Ernst and Young Global
Information Security survey shows that only 2 percent of New
Zealand
businesses have achieved compliance to ensure that their computer

information systems click over smoothly into the new millennium.
And
18 percent of the businesses surveyed have no budget earmarked for

Y2K projects.
</P>
<P>
But New Zealand is one of the top 10 countries leading the way
in
working on the problem with only 9 percent of respondents saying
they have no plans to deal with the issue, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that New Zealand appears more aggressive than
the
world average, with 46 percent expecting completion by the end of
this month, whereas the rest of the world is looking to next year.
</P>
<P>
There were 87 New Zealand respondents out of the 4,200
information

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders Urged to Look to Future With Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister

Jenny Shipley has urged every New Zealander to "look to the future

with confidence."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a New Zealand National Party gathering in South
Island's Dunedin Tuesday Evening, Shipley said her country has
weathered well the external shock of the Asian economic downturn
and
this year's severe drought in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a media release from the Prime Minister's Office,

Shipley said that Current Reserve Bank forecasts show "a faster
recovery than could have been expected even a month ago." The New

Zealand central bank "is now forecasting growth of 3.4 percent in
1999-2000 and 4 percent in 2000-2001."
</P>
<P>
"Given these forecasts there is every reason for optimism," she

said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand prime minister disclosed that in the year to
September, New Zealand's exports were up 1 billion NZ dollars
(about
540 million U.S. dollars) from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next 12 months government will continue to focus on
encouraging and facilitating enterprise, innovation and creativity
in
New Zealand to ensure continued economic growth," she said.
</P>
<P>
Shipley called for "maintaining political stability so the
economic recovery can occur uninterrupted."

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Host Pacific Vision Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Ministry of

Pacific Islands Affairs will host an international Pacific Vision
conference next July with global warming dangers on its top
agenda, a
Wellington-based newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post quoted the ministry as saying New Zealand must

prepare for thousands of refugees if their Pacific island homes
disappear under the sea.
</P>
<P>
Scientists fear that within a few decades low-lying Pacific
atolls,
in particular those barely above sea level such as Tuvalu and
Tokelau,
will disappear under rising sea levels. Parts of the islands are
below sea level, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The two island nations of Tuvalu and Tokelau have more than
12,000
inhabitants. Tokelau has been administered by New Zealand since
1925
and its inhabitants are New Zealand citizens, it added.
</P>
<P>
Sea levels are expected to rise 30-100 centimeters during the
next
century as the planet warms. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide
and
other gases contribute to the melting of ice caps, which raises
ocean
levels, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Survival fears are shared by all Pacific island nations. An
international alliance chaired by Samoa has estimated that at
least
500,000 Pacific dwellers are affected by the changes, it said.
</P>
<P>
Samson Samasoni, communications manager of the ministry, said
Pacific peoples face huge challenges in the new millennium and it
is
timely for New Zealanders to consider the future of their island
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"Pacific island people may pay the highest price of global
warming," he said, adding, "It's timely for Pacific peoples to get

together and talk about where they want to be in the new
millennium."

and the number of people infected with AIDS virus has increased by

self-named party who returned here Tuesday, said he welcomed the
political platform hammered out by FUNCINPEC and the CPP. At the
same time, he pointed out that "what is the most important is the
policy of the new government, not the persons or positions."
</P>
<P>
"We will not exchange the blood of the Cambodian people for
positions and power in government," Sam Rainsy emphasized.
</P>
<P>
But his words were immediately refuted by Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
"FUNCINPEC party is a party founded by the king. So we listened
to the king to have a negotiation to end nearly four months'
political deadlock and to form a coalition government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he cited international pressures, especially those
from the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "without political stability, we cannot build
our country and our people will live in poverty. Only our
politicians and our people can save our own country from the
bloody conflicts and suffering."
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's political situation came to a deadlock after the
July 26 election as the two opposition political parties,
FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party, refused to accept the results of
the polls, charging that the CPP led by Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen won it through fraud and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won the largest share of seats in the assembly, but the
party does not have enough parliamentarians to command a majority
in the house.
</P>
<P>
The nearly four months' deadlock was broken on November 12 when
the parties convened a two-day summit at the Royal Palace under
King Norodom Sihanouk's mediation. Concessions made by both sides
at the summit paved the way for the formation of the new coalition
government.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Becoming Important to China's Rural Economy(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sun Group is the largest
woollen fabric manufacturer in the world's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
Lu Keping, a farmer from Jiangsu Province, started this
business from scratch 12 years ago, and it is now the main
supplier of the country's top 10 garment makers. "We are blessed
with some of the most advanced equipment and develop an average of
1.5 new products each day," says the 55-year-old Lu.
</P>
<P>
Even state-owned enterprises can't compare with them, he
says. Sun produces 18 million meters of woollen fabric each year
and has more than 3.2 billion yuan in sales.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, such township and village enterprises
have emerged as a major part of China's rural economy and are
playing a greater role in the country as a whole, contributing a
third of the GDP, a third of the total exports, a fifth of the tax
revenues, and a third of farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Some are major manufacturers like the Shuangliang Group, the
large U-joint producer Wanxiang, the No.1 rubber ball manufacturer
Feida Rubber Group, and the leading magnetic materials supplier
Hengdian.
</P>
<P>
Some have a global reputation. Senda has 39 percent of the
Chinese shoe market and three Italian factories making 30,000
pairs of shoes a year under the "Senda" brand name.

TOKYO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
arrived here Wednesday afternoon for a six-day state visit to
Japan at the invitation of the Japanese government.

"Township and village enterprises no longer equate to smallness
and backwardness," says Fei Xiaotong, a prominent sociologist who
has been studying China's rural economy for decades and who used
to refer to the "grass-roots industry", but now says, "We have to
look at them with new eyes."
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, with the beginning of the reforms, some
Chinese farmers came to the industrial and commercial sectors with
a small investment and got involved in areas that were neglected
by state-owned enterprises and soon gained a foothold.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, more than 94.95 million farmers were working in
township and village enterprises, with a yearly output value of
701.8 billion yuan. But most of these firms were labor-intensive
and had obsolete equipments.
</P>
<P>
Then, in the early 1990s, township and village enterprises had
a set-back when they had to face challenges from the state sector
which had become more competitive. But, the former farmers did not
retreat and began to improve rural industries by changing the
product mix and industrial structure and improving management.
</P>
<P>
They now have 60 percent of China's technology patents and have
imported advanced technology and equipment and even closed down
64,000 money-losing or polluting firms.
</P>
<P>
So, China's rural industries survived the set-backs and the
country now has 20.15 million township and village enterprises
with 130 million employees and a yearly output value of more than
two trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,700 of these companies have grown dramatically and
each does at least 50 million yuan in sales annually, and 110,000
of them have a share in the international market.

<HEADLINE> Party Leader on Fight Against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China's anti-corruption
struggle is a serious political one involving life-and-death
issues for the Party and the state, a senior party leader warned
here today.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, made these remarks here today while conferring with
Nguyen Thi Xuan My, chairwoman of the Control Commission of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also secretary of the CPC Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, said the CPC is determined to fight against
corruption during the country's reform and opening-up, and to be
well alarmed against their dangers in the course of development.
</P>
<P>
"Preparing for a protracted anti-corruption war," he continued,
"We should make sure to win one struggle after another and step by
step. We should also stick to the principle of solving essential
and superficial problems at the same time, with education as the
basis, the legal system the guarantee, and supervision the kernel,
in a bid to wipe out any soil that breeds and spreads corruption."
</P>
<P>
Wei stressed that "anti-corruption is a lasting, arduous and
complicated task, in which we should not only punish corrupt
persons, but also base our struggle on education and keep an alert
eye to building an ideological and ethical line within the whole
party to fight against corruption."
</P>
<P>
"To tighten our efforts to improve the Party's style of work
and build a clean government, and to deepen the anti-corruption
struggle, it is essential to improve the Party's ability to fight
corruption, preserve the Party's advanced features and purity, and
increase the Party's fighting competence," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
The communist parties of China and Viet Nam and the two peoples
cherish traditional friendship, and especially in recent years,
relations between the parties and nations have enjoyed overall
development through joint efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As developing countries which stick to the socialist road
under the leadership of the communist parties, both China and Viet
Nam are now in the process of reform and opening-up and economic
development," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
"We share identical or similar positions on many issues, not
only in reform and opening-up and the economic development, but
also in building the Party," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both parties may learn from each other through exchanges and
cooperation between the two parties' discipline inspection organs,
help improve the Party's style of work, build a clean government,
and promote the anti-corruption war, Wei added.
</P>
<P>
Wei also briefed the Vietnamese guest on China's current
political and economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Thi Xuan My said she is happy to exchange experiences
with her Chinese counterpart on improving the party's working
style and building a clean government, saying this is conducive to
increasing mutual understanding and trust, and serves to promote
the traditional friendship between the two parties and the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
She congratulated China for its achievements in reform and
opening-up, economic growth, the anti-corruption fight, and for
its efforts to improve the Party's working style and build a clean
government.
</P>
<P>
She also briefed her Chinese host on Vietnamese circumstances
in these aspects.

<HEADLINE> More Refugees to Drift into Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- An official of United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said that the number
of refugees entering Zambia is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Oluseyi Bajulaiye, a UNHCR country representative to Zambia,
said here Tuesday that about 200 refugees from the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), where the rebels rose up in early August
to oust the government of President Laurent Kabila, entered
Zambia through Luapula and Northern provinces in the past several
days.
</P>
<P>
And a further 69 Angolan refugees had entered the country in
North-Western Province, Bajulaiye was quoted by Wednesday's Post
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite the marking last week of the fourth anniversary of the
Lusaka protocol to end the Angolan civil war, he said, there was
general pessimism about the prospects for peace to return to
Angola since new conflicts had emerged between the government
forces and the rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR official disclosed that a mission was sent Tuesday
to establish the presence of the refugees and address their
immediate needs.
</P>
<P>
The pre-emergency state and the gradual increase in new
arrivals from both Congo (K) and Angola was of some concern since
Zambia shared a long border with the two countries, said
Bajulaiye.
</P>
<P>
He added that UNHCR had put in place contingency plans in case
of large scale refugee influx into Zambia, which currently hosts
167,000 refugees.

<HEADLINE> Stability In Southwestern Chinese Ethnic Minority Autonomous Region (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- An emperor of the Qin Dynasty
(221-207 B.C.) had a canal dug in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region to connect the Yangtze and Pearl river systems
and to serve as a bridge between the Han people and the Baiyue
area (home of many tribes).
</P>
<P>
But, it did not protect Guangxi from the destruction of wars,
uprisings, and disputes between different groups. Guangxi has the
largest number of ethnic minorities in China and the largest
ethnic group, the Zhuang, as well as 36 others. The region
continued to cause questions about disunity up through the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911). French forces even attempted to enter China
through Guangxi at that time.
</P>
<P>
But, that is all a thing of the past because Guangxi now is an
ethnic group region with stability, says Huang Haikui, director of
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's Nationality Affairs
Commission.

ethnic group who lives with students from several ethnic groups in

</P>
<P>
In the village of De'e, the word "dispute" now seems strange to
local people, and Yang Jinliang, the deputy head of a township
here, says that farmers help each other during harvests and
marriages between different ethnic groups are common.
</P>
<P>
Scholars attribute these changes to the integration of
different ethnic groups in the course of the modernization that
began in the region 50 years ago and has gone faster in the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was established in 1958,
and different ethnic customs and traditions have been
preserved. In the process of modernization and greater regional
autonomy, the region has thrown away useless practices while
developing education and modern industry.

Schooling has long been regarded as the only way to become a
government employee, but only a few people went to school. At
present, 36 percent of the students in Guangxi's universities come
from ethnic minority groups and many have gone on to leading
positions after graduation.
</P>
<P>
Minority leaders at different levels now account for 36 percent
of Guangxi's total, which is equal to the percentage minority
people account for in Guangxi's population.
</P>
<P>
The greatest threat to Guangxi's stability now is not war or
crimes or religions, but poverty. But, the number of impoverished
people in the region dropped to 3.6 million in 1997 from 15
million in 1985, thanks to government efforts and the government
plans to eradicate poverty in the region before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Money has become a common topic among local people and Guangxi
has set up economic cooperation zones with other provinces in
southwestern China and power stations, railways, factories,
harbors and airports have become a new attraction.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xianyue, the Secretary of the Communist Party of China
Committee of the Bose Prefecture Commissioner's Office, says that
the region's new task is to correctly handle economic relations of
different ethnic groups in the market economy and many people
believe that Guangxi has become a place where people can make a
steady profit. A British sugar company spent 14 million
U.S. dollars three years ago on a factory in Hechi that is proving
profitable.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Striving to Increase Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- North China's Tianjin
Municipality has devised a plan to become a garden city and raise
the per capita afforestation area to well over seven square meters
by early next century.
</P>
<P>
To realize this goal, local horticulture and forestry
departments have told all real estate developers to make sure that
afforested areas account for at least 25 percent of all
residential quarters they develop.
</P>
<P>
As the largest port city of north China, Tianjin now has a
population of 9.5 million, including five million living in urban
districts.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, per capita living space in Tianjin
is now 12 square meters but afforestation area stands at only 3.8
square meters.
</P>
<P>
Local residents are becoming more aware of the possibilities
for more greenery in their city. Though the Huayuan residential
zone, developed by the New World Group of Hong Kong, is far from
downtown, it has become a popular choice for home buyers because
its location has a green zone covering 40 percent of the total
area.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Transportation Capacity Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is losing 20 million
U.S. Dollars annually to foreign haulier companies due to its
weak transportation capacity, Times of Zambia reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Roland Norton, chairman of the Federation of
Zambian Road Hauliers, as saying that 73 percent of the country's
imports and 26 percent of its exports are carried by foreign
transporters.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of capacity, Zambian based hauliers can only
manage to carry a limited amount of Zambian bound cargo and goods
destined for export, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Norton said that for sometime, Zimbabwean hauliers have been
carrying the bulk of Zambian goods under the provisions of the
third country rule enacted by the Zimbabwean authorities in which
they insist that their transporters carry Zambian cargo as long
as it transit their territory.
</P>
<P>
"But thanks to the Zambian government we now have a bilateral
agreement with Zimbabwe which allows for capacity management of
cargo, an arrangement under which the Zambian government can
limit the amount of cargo to be carried by Zimbabwean
transporters," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the capacity management provisions may not be
implemented soon on the Zambian side because its transport sector
still lacks adequate capacity to cope with the increasing volume
of cargo.
</P>
<P>
Current estimates put the total fleet strength for Zambia at
between 1,500 and 2,000 vehicles while Zimbabwe has a fleet of
about 6,000 vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Get Aid From Japanese Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that his administration will go full blast
on its centerpiece program of agricultural modernization and food
security as soon as it gets aid from a Japanese fund.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national gathering of municipal mayors here,
Estrada said his government will soon obtain fresh funding from
Japan's Miyazawa Fund that will enable it to bankroll projects for
rapid countryside development.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' share of a 30 billion dollar Japanese aid
package falls in the 5 billion to 8 billion dollar range, a
substantial chunk of which will be used for projects to energize
the long-neglected rural sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa Fund is named after Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa. Japan has allotted 30 billion dollars for Asian
economies hit by the 17-month-old financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese team is now in Manila to work out with Filipino
officials a list of priority projects that could be bankrolled by
Tokyo under its aid package.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Uzbekistan Call for Broad-Based Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Uzbekistan has called
for the formation of a broad-based government in Afghanistan
through political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made here Tuesday in the talks between Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and his Uzbek counterpart
Abdulaziz Kamilov, who is on a one-day visit to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Their talks also highlighted the need for regional cooperation to
help end the Afghan crisis, the Iranian official news agency IRNA
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Taliban militia should respect the wishes of the
international community and implement the U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers expressed grave concerns over growing
terrorism, insecurity and illicit trade in armaments and
narcotics in the region.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, they said that both Tehran and Tashkent are
determined to enhance bilateral ties and consolidate regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan attaches particular significance to expanding its
cooperation with Iran in commercial, economic and
telecommunications sectors, Kamilov said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said the economic potential, geographical locations
and the rich resources of Iran and Uzbekistan go far beyond
the present level of cooperation and this demands further
expansion of bilateral ties in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Kamilov arrived here on Tuesday and delivered a message
from Uzbek President Islam Karimov to his Iranian counterpart
Mohammad Khatami.

<HEADLINE> New Technique Grows Apples in Frigid Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese agronomist has
developed a unique method for growing apples in frigid zones as
far north as 47.3 degrees latitude.
</P>
<P>
Liang Tong, an agronomist in northernmost China's Heilongjiang
Province, succeeded in getting apple trees to survive the cold winter
by bending the fruit trees over the ground in July and burying
them under the earth in late autumn. In the following spring, he
unearthed the trees and found them to be safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
The warmer temperatures underground allowed the trees to survive
the harsh Heilongjiang winter, according to Liang.
</P>
<P>
In addition, apples grown at high northern latitudes look and
taste better than those from other areas because they receive more
sunshine, he added.
</P>
<P>
Previously, apples consumed in Heilongjiang were imported from
other parts of the country. Liang's method now enables local
residents to eat locally produced apples.
</P>
<P>
Liang has tried his method on several imported strains and
has achieved satisfactory results. One American strain bears apples
weighing from 200 to 400 grams.

<HEADLINE> Levy Poised to Rejoin Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Former Foreign Minister
David Levy is poised to rejoin the coalition government and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed his departure for Europe and
canceled a visit to Switzerland in hope of sealing a deal.
</P>
<P>
A notice issued by the Prime Minister's Office Wednesday said a
tentative decision approving Levy's Gesher (Bridge) Party's
reentry into the coalition is expected Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is to hold a meeting with Levy on Gesher's return in
the morning and fly to London in the afternoon, the Office said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Levy reportedly exchanged their first words in
the current reconciliation process in a phone conversation late
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Levy resigned as foreign minister in January in a huff,
ostensibly over the budget issue and the lack of progress in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The coalition's stability has been threatened by the National
Religious Party's opposition to the Wye peace accord with the
Palestinians. Its two cabinet ministers voted against the accord
while several of its Knesset (Parliament) members threatened to
join the opposition to bring the government down.
</P>
<P>
This perilous situation forced Netanyahu to consider asking
Levy and his party back to the government.
</P>
<P>
Levy is to summon his Knesset faction Wednesday morning to
decide on whether to reenter the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The deal facilitating Levy's return was hatched by Avigdor
Lieberman, former director-general of the Prime Minister's Office,
and Levy's loyalist David Appel.
</P>
<P>
Appel called on Netanyahu Tuesday and then relayed a detailed
offer to Levy - he could get either the Finance Ministry or an
expanded National Infrastructure Ministry, both of which Levy had
rejected in the past. Levy is seen as leaning toward the latter.
</P>
<P>
Levy told the Israel Radio Tuesday evening that a return to the
coalition is possible because the peace process has been moved
forward now.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Dialogue to Settle Iraq-UNSCOM Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday called
on the U.N. arms inspectors and Iraq to sit down and resolve
the document issue through dialogue and consultation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the U.N. Shen
Guofang presented the view to the U.N. Security Council when the
council met on the issue at the request of Britain.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, there is no crisis, there are only some
problems," Shen told reporters after the council meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The problem at this very moment is not Iraq's unwillingness to
cooperate with UNSCOM, the U.N. Special Commission in Charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, but is only
some differences between Iraq and UNSCOM on the document issue,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The document issue erupted late week, a few days after U.N.
arms inspectors returned to Iraq following Iraq's announcement to
resume cooperation with UNSCOM on November 14.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler wrote to Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tarik Aziz early last week, asking for more weapons
documents.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council on Monday, Aziz said Iraq
did not have any more documents to hand over to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China is looking forward to a comprehensive review
of Iraq's compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions
since Iraq has demonstrated its full cooperation with UNSCOM and
the International Atomic Energy Agency.

<HEADLINE> EU Inspects Kenyan Fish Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the European
Union (EU) are in Kenya to review the status of quality and
safety standards of the fish exports to the EU member states.
</P>
<P>
They are inspecting Kenyan establishments which deal with
fishing, packaging, processing, export and certification of the
industry, the East African Standard newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the team did not disclose which companies or
factories they have visited and will inspect. The team is set to
leave for Europe on November 27.
</P>
<P>
The team was also expected to disclose the standard
requirements demanded by EU for Kenya's fish produce, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
Safety concerns over fish exports from east Africa led to a
ban on fish exports to the EU early this year.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho lamented that
the introduction of stringent health and quality requirements on
the international markets has drastically reduced the volume of
Kenyan fish exports.
</P>
<P>
The requirements, the minister said, have led to an almost
total closure of the fish processing, fresh fruits and vegetables
sectors in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
The EU fish ban took effect on January 6 this year following
widespread reports of cholera outbreaks in Kenya, Mozambique,
Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's fish exports is estimated at four billion Shillings
(67.2 million U.S. Dollars) every year with major markets being
in the Netherlands, Britain, Spain, Japan, Israel and Australia.

MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The highway near the Datu
Piang-Shariff Agwak-Talayan complex in Maguindanao, the southern
Philippines, remains closed Wednesday as government forces and
rebels continued fighting for position along the Cotabato-Isulan
stretch.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported Wednesday that as fighting
between government troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
rebels went on, 300 families from at least eight villages in the
towns of Datu Piang, Talayan and Shariff Agwak evacuated to safer
areas so as not to be caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
A government army spokesman was quoted by the agency as saying
the government forces have ceased firing with mortar and artillery
on some selected targets for fear of hitting civilians.
</P>
<P>
At least seven government soldiers and two MILF guerrillas were
already wounded in the ongoing battle that started late last week,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
It said the government troops vowed to flush out the rebels
still holding the Labu-Labo bridge between Agwak and Talayan

</P>
<P>
About 500 MILF guerrillas are reportedly holding some 10
kilometers of the Isulan-Cotabato highway.
</P>
<P>
The fighting stemmed from a series of attacks by the rebels on
at least seven government army detachments in Datu Piang, Talayan

SOFIA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Most Bulgarian small and medium
enterprises, the main body of that country's economy, believe they
have recovered from the economic crisis of year 1996, a business
poll reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, only 22 percent of the polled manufacturers expect
their income to grow in 1998. The exporters, which make up 10 percent
of the polled companies, are on the whole more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by the Foundation For The Development of
Entepreneurship among 641 small and medium enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, more than 98 percent registered
companies in Bugaria are small and medium sized, employing less
than 100 staff.
</P>
<P>
In the poll, Bugarian companies cited German, Greek and Italian
business partners as most desired.
</P>
<P>
The exporters complained lack of capital, redtape and
insufficient risk insurance, and most of the companies want to see
state support in form of credit guarantee, export insurance and
leasing scheme.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Strongweman Tipped For Silver in Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is pinning its
hopes on Sri Indriyani to win a silver medal at the 13th Asian
Games weightlifting competition in Bangkok next month.
</P>
<P>
Budiono Kartohadiprodjo, executive chairman of the Indonesian
Weightlifting, Powerlifting and Body Building Association, said
Indriyani's only serious challenge in the women's 48-kg division
would come from the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"With the Chinese lifters looking invincible, Indri can expect
to finish second and take the silver. Indri has so far fared
better than her teammates in the training center," Budioni was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
World junior gold medalist Indriyani, who won the 46-kg class
at the 19th Southeast Asian Games last year, snatched 83 kilog
rams to surpass the International Weightlifting Federation's
standard in the newly introduced 48-kg class in August's national
selection event.
</P>
<P>
She also hoisted 100 kilograms in the clean and jerk, 12.5
kilograms below the world record.
</P>
<P>
The overall world record is held by Li Xuezhao of China who
lifted a total of 192.5 kilograms. Li scored 80 in snatch and
112.5 in the clean and jerk.
</P>
<P>
Budiono warned, however, that excess weight could cost
Indriyani a medal at the upcoming Asiad.
</P>
<P>
"She weighed about 50 kilograms when she surpass the world
standard. She has to reduce her weight by two kilograms if she
wishes to bag a medal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Budiono said the country's other medal-winning hopefuls would
be Supeni and Winarni, who both are in the 53-kg division.
</P>
<P>
A country is allowed to field a maximum of three
representatives in any weight division, but Budiono hinted that
the two women lifters would be split as part of the team's
strategy.
</P>
<P>
"They should not compete in the same category because it will
reduce our chances of winning medals. I'm optimistic that one of
them can steal a medal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Budiono said one of the two lifters might move up to the 58-kg
division.
</P>
<P>
Any participating team is allowed to decide which lifter will
compete in any weight category after the morning weigh-in prior
to the competition.
</P>
<P>
In the men's division, Indonesia will not expect too much from
Erwin Abdullah and Taufik, according to Budiono.
</P>
<P>
"They will face tough rivals from ex-Soviet countries and
China. They will be lucky if they can finish among the top five,"
Budiono added.

<HEADLINE> Precious Edition of Copernicus' Work Reported Stolen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Copy of the first Latin edition
On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres by Nicolaus Copernicus
was stolen on Tuesday from the library of the Polish Academy of
Sciences in Krakow.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Press Agency reported that a middle-aged man, who
had put a hold on the book earlier, claimed he was going to the
men's room after he got the precious edition, and then disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The first edition of the book, with a market value up to
300,000 zloty (some 90,000 U.S. dollars), was published in 1543,
the year when Copernicus died.
</P>
<P>
The report said an investigation into the theft is underway.
</P>
<P>
Poland now has a dozen copies of the first Latin edition, with
four of them in Krakow. Russia has three copies and Ukraine has
two, but one of them was stolen from the state library in August.
</P>
<P>
Copernicus, 1473-1543, was the proponent of the view of an
Earth in daily motion about its axis and in yearly motion around a
stationary Sun, a position that had profound effects on the
science and philosophy of succeeding centuries.
</P>
<P>
A finished copy of his complete work is believed to have been
brought to him on the last day of his life.

<P>
It would be the first time for Hong Kong Special

However, Hong Kong Skating Union has expressed strong
interests in vying in three events, such as hockey, short-track
speed skating and figure skating, he said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that Hong Kong squad would be so weak that they
probably could not get good results at the Games, but he said,
"Hong Kong's participation is a very meaningful thing."

Now the organizing body has received entry forms from 28
delegations, with 1,184 athletes registered.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Unemployment Rate Projected to Increase to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's unemployment
rate is projected to rise to 4.9 percent this year as compared to
2.6 percent last year, Malaysian Deputy Human Resources Minister
Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's unemployment figure is estimated to be 441,300
out of the 9 million workforce in the country, he told Parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual number of workers laid off following the
current economic problems is far lower than the projected
unemployment figure, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that between January and November 14 this year, 74,681
workers were reported to have been retrenched, with 89 percent
being locals and 11 percent foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector had the highest retrenchment with
39,406 workers or 52.8 percent of the number laid off, he said.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale and retail, restaurant and hotel sector
retrenched 9,364 workers or 12.5 percent of the total laid off,
construction sector 8,799 workers (11.8 percent) and the
agriculture, forestry, livestock and fisheries sector 4,623
workers (6.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
The Human Resources Ministry believes that retrenchment in the
country has only a slight impact on the projected unemployment
figure, he said, adding that based on the ministry's monitoring,
most of the local workers retrenched had obtained new jobs.

<HEADLINE> Economic Downturn Pushes Malaysia's Poverty Rate Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The poverty rate in
Malaysia is expected to rise to eight percent this year from 6.7
percent last year because of the economic downturn, Malaysian
Deputy Rural Development Minister K. Kumaran said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 417,200 households comprising 1,233,200 people were
classified as poor, with Sabah state, East Malaysia, and Kelantan,
a northeastern state of peninsular Malaysia, having the most with
67,700 and 61,500 households respectively, he told Parliament
here.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government uses different guidelines on poverty
for peninsular Malaysia, Sabah state and Sarawak state in East
Malaysia because of the differing costs of living in the three
areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The main causes of poverty included the location of settlements
in the interior, limited job opportunities, the inability to get
consistent incomes and a low level of mental development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Despite the economic slowdown, the government has
increased the allocation for poverty eradication to 700 million
ringgit (about 184.21 million U.S. dollars) under next year's
budget.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Political Crisis Deepens in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A Mongolian constitutional
court ruling prohibiting a concurrent parliament membership and
cabinet portfolio could force a rewriting of the constitution,
pushing the country farther down the path of political crisis.
</P>
<P>
In its final ruling on Tuesday, the court said it would be in
violation of the constitution for an incumbent member of the Great
Hural (parliament) to hold a ministerial post, overthrowing a bill
passed early this year by parliament which is dominated by the
ruling Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU).
</P>
<P>
The MDU, made up of the National Democratic Party (NDP) and the
Social Democratic Party (SDP), led the Great Hural in dismissing
on April 22 the government of Mendsaihani Enkhsikhan which did not
have a single parliament member.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural, after intense negotiations over power
distribution, approved in May the all-parliamentarian cabinet led
by NDP President Tsakhiya Elbegdorj.
</P>
<P>
The new government soon came under fire for its behind-the-door
move to merge the state-owned Renovation Bank with the private
Golomt Bank. The main opposition, the People's Revolutionary
Party, in a strong gesture against the merger along with President
Nachagyn Bagabandy, boycotted parliament for more than 50 days.
</P>
<P>
Elbegdorj resigned on July 24 after losing a vote of confidence
in the Great Hural, leaving the country with a lame-duck interim
government until now.
</P>
<P>
The past four months saw up to 10 candidates for the
premiership being turned down as the president, the Great Hural
and the MDU were sharply divided over who should head the new
government.
</P>
<P>
Among the potential candidates, Davaadorj Ganbold, chairman of
the Standing Committee of Economic Policy of the Great Hural, was
nominated six times by the MDU and rejected by the president as
many times.
</P>
<P>
Another MDU candidate, R. Amarjargal, acting minister of
external affairs, was approved by the president but rejected by
the Great Hural on the ground that no minister of the former
government should become new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On October 8, President Bagabandy gave the MDU a list of six
potential candidates for the premiship, all of which were rejected
by the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The People's Revolutionary Party has recently called for a
national referendum on the dismissal of the unicameral Great Hural
and early elections if the power vacuum persists.
</P>
<P>
Under the president's proposal, the ruling coalition and the
opposition have started talks on the government crisis and whether
to revise the constitution to allow parliament members to hold
cabinet posts. No progress has been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged political turbulence has seriously crippled
Mongolia's economy, which was already ailing with the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
On top of a soaring budget deficit, unfavorable trade balance
and a devaluing currency, the country was struck by heavy snows
that reduced its grain output to less than 200,000 tons this year,
meeting only half of the domestic demand.

</P>
<P>
It was disclosed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina while replying
a question in the parliament Tuesday, The Independent newspaper

0.74 million hectares of land damaged in the prolonged flooding,
she said.
</P>
<P>
To recoup these losses, she stated that the government has
already taken a number of steps including an immediate program of
460 million taka (about 9.48 million dollars) with government
allocation, donors grant and non-government organizations'
assistance.

Under the government's medium term program, the government has
proposed 1.02 billion taka (about 2 million dollars) to implement
four projects of the Department of Agriculture Extension and three

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Needs Backward Linkage Industries for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh needs to develop
backward linkage industries for its flourishing ready-made
garments sector, which has depended heavily on foreign fabrics.
</P>
<P>
An investment of some 140 billion taka (2.92 billion U.S.
dollars) is needed within the next four to five years to develop
the backward linkage industries in spinning, weaving and dyeing,
to support the garments sector, the Financial Express daily said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Around 85-90 percent of the woven fabrics the garments industry
requires is met by external sources, according to figures from the
Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters' Association.
</P>
<P>
But that is no easy job, experts said, as the textile and
cotton industries have incurred huge losses during the past years
and many public textile mills have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to shut down five more textile mills
in view of the staggering loss in the public textile sector and
cotton mills, according to a report of The Bangladesh Observer
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation now owns only 19
mills, with only one running on profit and the rest incurring
losses every year, after the government closed down 11 loss-making
textile and cotton mills during the 1997-98 fiscal year, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The garment industry earned approximately 3.8 billion dollars
in the 1997-98 fiscal year ending on June 30, 1998, contributing
about 70 percent to the country's foreign currency earnings and
nearly 12 percent to its gross domestic products.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Germany to Conclude Extradition of Kurdish Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Italy is urging Germany to
implement an arrest warrant it issued in 1990 and to follow up on
the extradition of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"We have clearly indicated that once a country issues an arrest
warrant, it has to follow the matter through and proceed to
extradition. This is what we expect Germany to do," Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who is Leader of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), was
arrested in Rome on November 12 and is now being detained in Italy
on a 1990 Germany arrest warrant that holds Ocalan responsible for
terrorist acts in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Ocalan has caused relations between Italy and
Turkey to deteriorate dramatically, as Italy has refused to
extradite the rebel leader to Turkey, where he is also wanted on
terrorist charges.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has branded him a "separatist terrorist" for leading the
Kurdistan Worker's Party in its 14-year armed struggle for a
Kurdish homeland in southern Turkey. But Italy's constitution
does not permit suspects to be extradited to countries where the
death penalty is still in force, as is the case with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Germany said on Tuesday that it would avoid requesting the
extradition of Kurdish separatist leader from Italy at least until
Italy and Turkey reached agreement on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Germany would like Italy and Turkey to resolve their
extradition problem first," Germany's Justice Minister Daubler
Gemlin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey's Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told a meeting
of his party that Ocalan's extradition to Germany or a third
country was "very probable." He also said the chances of Italy
granting Ocalan the political refugee status were "low."
</P>
<P>
Germany has 40 days to issues a request for Ocalan's
extradition, after which, the arrest warrant loses its validity
and Ocalan will be legally allowed to go free.

BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Beijing officially announced
Wednesday that it will bid for the 2008 summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held in the Great Hall of the People this
morning, Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin submitted the city's
application to Wu Shaozu, President of the Chinese Olympic
Committee (COC).
</P>
<P>
The COC will hold a meeting early next January to discuss the
Beijing's bid. If the application is accepted, the COC would
officially submit the bid to the International Olympic Committee (
IOC).
</P>
<P>
Wu, also Minister of the State Sports General Administration,
said: "After careful consideration, the Beijing municipal
government submitted the bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games. The
COC is very happy to receive the application."
</P>
<P>
"China bade for the 2000 Olympic Games but lost to Sydney by a
narrow margin of two votes at the IOC election in Monte Carlo in
1993. Many people in China and foreign friends have expressed
their hope that China would bid again for the Olympic Games," Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
"The COC and Beijing have both studied the feasibility of
another bid," he said. "We think that as the world's most
populous country with a vigorous and growing economy, China
should host the Olympic Games and make more contributions to the
Olympic movement."
</P>
<P>
Other countries that have already expressed their intention to
bid for the 2008 Olympics include Canada, Japan, Turkey, Spain
and Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Lawmakers Foresee Peace in Chiapas Before 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 24 (Xinhua)--The bloody conflict in
Mexico's southern Chiapas state could end before the year 2000,
Mexican legislators in a multi-party peace commission said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission, known as Cocopa, returned on Tuesday after the
first peace talks in two years with Chiapas rebel commanders came
to a deadlock last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held in the Chiapas city of San Cristobal, 730 kms
southeast of Mexico City, ended when the rebels accused the
commission of "racism", because it failed to supply proper beds,
telephones and fax machines in the convent where the rebels were
lodged.
</P>
<P>
Commission head Javier Guerrero attributed the rebels' refusal
to return to negotiations to a lack of mediation after leading
Chiapas mediator San Cristobal bishop Samuel Ruiz resigned in June.
</P>
<P>
Javier Gil, the deputy leader of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), said that despite the difficulties with
the rebels, the conflict could be solved soon if the two parties
remained "patient and prudent".
</P>
<P>
The government has accused the Zapatista rebels of deliberately
stalling peace talks since 1996 and turning the conflict into an
electoral issue to wrest power from the PRI in the 2000
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The Zapatista National Liberation Army staged a brief uprising
in Chiapas on January 1, 1994, pledging to defend the native
Indians' rights and democracy. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The State Economic and Trade
Commission is calling for a crack-down on the dumping of medicine
by growing numbers of medicine manufacturers engaged in price-war
competition.
</P>
<P>
This price war was triggered by nationwide overproduction.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the commission pointed out that because huge
production-cost differences exist among various localities, along
with wide differentials in medical and pension insurance
expenditures, medicine producers compete unequally and the price
war will benefit only a small number of enterprises while hurting
the majority.
</P>
<P>
"So the practice should be firmly banned," he said.
</P>
<P>
He especially called for strict adherence to unified prices
fixed by the State for certain medicines. "It is wrong to sell
these medicines at either lower or higher prices than those set by
the State," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for enhanced efforts in expanding the domestic
market and developing new products.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Factory Turns Coal Cinder Into Cement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A new technology developed by
the Shanghai Cement Plant which produces cement from coal cinder
recently passed official appraisal in this largest industrial
city in China.
</P>
<P>
With the new technology, the factory plans to replace the
existing cement-making process by adding an appropriate amount of
coal cinder instead of clay.
</P>
<P>
Experts consider this technology an effective way to deal with
pollution-causing coal cinder, as well as a step in the sustained
development of the cement industry.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai discharges about 6,000 tons of coal cinder every
day. In the past, municipal departments tried but failed to find a
proper method to handle this situation.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Cement Plant began a research project last year,
and researchers found that the composition of coal cinder was
similar to that of clay, one of the three major ingredients for
making cement. They then worked out the proper ratio of coal cinder
to other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
So far, the plant has produced 330,000 tons of cement made with
with 67,500 tons of coal cinder. A test conducted by the China
Cement Quality Inspection Center shows that this new product is up
to national standards.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Files for Marriage Annulment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman is on the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
His nine-and-a-half day marriage to former Baywatch actress
Carmen Electra is now in the hands of lawyers. The "worm" filed
papers yesterday seeking annulment and citing fraud and unsound
mind.
</P>
<P>
His agent says the Chicago Bulls rebound king was drunk when
the pair wed in a quickie Las Vegas ceremony on November 14.
</P>
<P>
"Dennis alleges he was so inebriated at the nuptials that he
didn't know his lawyer Gerald Phillips was quoted as saying
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rodman's agent Dwight Manley made the same claim two days
after the wedding.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, anyone that would marry somebody that was
intoxicated to the point that they couldn't speak or stand had
ulterior motives of some sort," Manley said at the time.
</P>
<P>
Electra's publicist denies that her 26-year-old client took
advantage of Rodman but acknowledges the marriage unraveled about
as quickly as it started.
</P>
<P>
"Carmen and Dennis spoke several days ago and mutually agreed
to end the marriage," Cindy Guagenti said.
</P>
<P>
The honeymoon apparently was short. The 37-year-old NBA
rebounding champion claims the two separated the day of the
wedding.
</P>
<P>
A handwritten note purportedly written by Rodman was released
soon after the wedding in which he professed his love for Electra
and apologized for "any false statements given on my behalf
regarding my marriage.
</P>
<P>
But Phillips said that Rodman didn't even write the note.
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is, the handwriting is not his, " he said.
"And it's not his language, either, Dennis does not talk that
way."
</P>
<P>
Guagenti denied the note was forged and said it was signed in
her presence.

<HEADLINE> Divorced Families Affect Children's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Divorce may seriously affect
children both physically and psychologically, according to the
latest survey by the Tianjin Municipal Children Development Center.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 80,000 children living in broken homes in
northern China's Tianjin Municipality, representing 4.8 percent of
all the children in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The divorce rate in Tianjin has been on the rise in the past
few years, with 6,900 divorces in 1990, and over 12,400 last year,
and over half of these divorces involved the question "who should
bring up the children?".
</P>
<P>
The survey chose 142 children of both intact and broken
families from three primary schools and eight secondary
schools. It was shown that the children of divorced parents have
difficulties in their studies and in relations with their parents,
teachers and classmates, and many of them suffer from both
physical and psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
Relationships between parents and children, of course, play an
important role in the healthy development of children. But most
of the children in broken families do not get enough care and love
from their parents.
</P>
<P>
Some divorced parents are not willing to take care of the
children and put their own interests first, and many do not allow
their ex-spouses to see the children as a way of taking revenge.

<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the children in broken families are lonely, cold to
others, have poor self-esteem and seem to care about nothing.
They are also more likely to cry, lose their temper or become
nervous and depressed.
</P>
<P>
Experts say there are many reasons for such behavior, but the
key factor is the divorce and improper family education. Fully 70
percent of the surveyed children from broken homes are either
disciplined too strictly or left alone by their parents.
</P>
<P>
About 18.3 percent of the children from broken families
get along quite well with their companions, but 11.2 percent of
them have bad relations with other children.
</P>
<P>
One secondary school girl lived with her father after her
parents divorced, but she has lived alone ever since her father
remarried and has lost her father's scanty love and care. Then she
began to spend her time smoking and drinking alcohol with other
classmates who were more or less in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that such problems can only be solved by
strengthening the implementation of related laws to ensure that
parents shoulder their responsibilities, and by inspiring schools,
communities, and people from all walks of life to show more care
and attention to such unfortunate children.

<HEADLINE> Wealth Coils Around Snakes in Yongzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, November 25 (Xinhua) -- It is safe to say that many
people have some fear of snakes, especially poisonous
ones. However, people in Yongzhou, central China's Hunan Province,
have deep affection for them.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, snakes brought farmers there
good fortune and made them rich.
</P>
<P>
Yongzhou, located in the hilly part of the province, has
subtropical temperatures and a warm, wet climate, which is ideal
for snakes.
</P>
<P>
There are over 70 kinds of snakes in Yongzhou. Peculiar snakes
include the long-nosed pit viper, cobras, and the green bamboo
snake, all of which thrive in this area.
</P>
<P>
"We have known that the snakes are of great value since we were
kids," Zhou Dawu, president of the Yongzhou Snake Company, said.
</P>
<P>
Raising a long-nosed pit viper will bring a farmer 200 yuan (24
US dollars) net profit per snake. Usually a farmer can raise some
200 snakes per year, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He developed Yongzhou Snake Wine with professors from Hunan
Chinese Traditional Medicine College and established a company
with eight other farmers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Making snake wine is more profitable than raising snakes,"
Zhou said, "Our products sell well in over 10 provinces and are
exported to Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada."

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Budget Deficit to Expand to 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 25 (Xinhua) -- More government spending to
stimulate the economy will increase the 1999 budget deficit to 5
percent of the gross domestic product from the current target of 3
percent, according to the Thai Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The bigger deficit target will be outlined in the sixth
quarterly report to the International Monetary Fund. It will call
for a 3-percent deficit in the central budget, with state
enterprises allowed another 2 percent. The previous target figures
were 1 percent and 2 percent respectively, officials from the
ministry were quoted Wednesday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report to the IMF also forecasts a sharp drop in inflation
next year, to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent, compared with 8
percent forecast for this year.
</P>
<P>
Increased deficit spending is intended to help kick-start the
economy and offset sharp declines in private purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said half of the 1999 fiscal deficit would
be funded through the country's treasury reserve. The rest would
come from 600 million U.S. dollars in loans from the World Bank
and another 600 million dollars from Japan's Asian economic
recovery program.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth report, or letter of intent, also forecasts official
foreign reserves climbing to between 32 billion dollars and 35
billion dollars, up from 28 billion dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
Other measures outlined in the letter include lower import
tariffs on basic consumer products such as milk power, paper and
educational materials, to help ease growing social pressures from
the economic downturn.

<HEADLINE> Pearl Industry in Beihai Leaping Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The pearl output in Beihai in
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, a city known for
producing the most precious pearls, is expected to hit 10,000
kilograms this year, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The bumper pearl harvest is attributed to a new variety of
pearl-producing mollusk called the Ma which has a high survival
rate.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other mollusks, the Ma increased survival rate by
15 percent with the help of laser technology, and young Ma
mollusks for the production of 24 million pearls have been
cultivated this year.
</P>
<P>
Although many places along the coast of China engage in pearl
production, Beihai's pearls are considered superior. The city's
Hepu County, for example, has a 2,000-year history of pearl
cultivation and is known as the Southern Pearl.
</P>
<P>
The production of Hepu pearls was in a slump for a long time
prior to the reform and opening policy established in the late
1970s. The city's total pearl output in 1984 was only 38
kilograms, compared with 8,483 kilograms last year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Tiancheng, deputy mayor of Beihai, noted that the key to
the development of the pearl industry lies in the substantial
growth of sea pearl cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Now, pearl processing and production have made great progress.
Various pearl products, including pearl jewelry, medicines, health
products and cosmetics are earning annual revenues of 200 million
yuan (about 25 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Beihai still lags behind Japan in pearl cultivation, especially
in processing technology, despite the city's high reputation,
according to industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with academic institutions such as Qinghua
University in Beijing, Beihai is now making new efforts to improve
pearl-cultivation-related technology by increasing research and
development projects.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Urged to Resolve Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The so-called Year 2000
computer problem has the potential to emerge as a serious crisis
for Indonesia, even as the country might be on its way towards
economic recovery, the World Bank warned.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here Tuesday, the World Bank asserted
that Indonesia had to understand the problem and implement
preemptive measures.
</P>
<P>
"This is more than a technical problem," said Ben Fisher,
director of operations at the World Bank's Jakarta office.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it could have very significant economic and
social consequences, and it was important that the Bank and the
Indonesian government worked out solutions with the team of
international experts gathered in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The bank and the government sponsored a two-day conference on
the Year 2000 computer problem, ending on Tuesday in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Fisher explained that this problem could affect the future
health of the financial sector, which was currently undergoing
serious reforms and restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"In order to prevent panic, needless stockpiling and emptying
of bank accounts, we must be effective, and gain the public's
confidence in addressing the Year 2000 computer problem," he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Minister of Communications Giri Suseno
Hadihardjono thanked the World Bank for its proposed provision of
grant funds to be used for developing a national Year 2000
computer problem plan, and noted that the lack of financial
resources due to the crisis was a major inhibitor to making
further progress on the matter.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that most Indonesian companies are not ready to
face the Year 2000 computer problem challenge due to the low level
of awareness of the issue, coupled by the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some organizations estimated that the government must arrange
1.6 billion U.S. dollars to resolve the Year 2000 computer
problem.

PANAMA CITY, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Panama has asked the
European Union (EU) Commission to urgently review a banana import
pact, accusing it of deliberately blocking Latin American
producers.
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Suescum, Panama's permanent representative of the World
Trade Organization (WTO), made the remarks during a meeting in
Geneva, which was requested by Mexico and Ecuador.

Suescum said the EU had done everything in its power to prevent

January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The EU has ignored our calls for a dialogue and our concerns,
and it has unilaterally enforced a regime which discriminates
against Latin American producers," Suescum said.
</P>

The Group of Six, formed by the United States, Mexico,

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Scales Down Privatization Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to privatize six state firms rather than the 12 originally
planned in the 1998-99 fiscal year due to bearish conditions on
the local stock market, the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An Assistant to the State Minister of the Empowerment of State
Enterprises Sofyan Djalil said the government would be unable to
privatize 12 state firms on schedule due to bearish sentiment.
</P>
<P>
"We will only privatize six state firms in this fiscal year
instead of 12 due to unfavorable market conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The six firms remaining on the list are cement maker PT Semen
Gresik -- which has already been partially privatized --
international call operator PT Indosat, state mining firm PT Aneka
Tambang, sea port operator PT Pelindo II, airport operator PT
Angkasa Pura II and plantation firm PTP IV, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first three are listed on the local stock exchange while
the latter three are not.
</P>
<P>
Sofyan said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had
agreed to the scaled-down privatization plans.
</P>
<P>
The IMF made the sale of government stakes in state firms one
of many conditions attached to the release of funds from a
49-billion-U.S.-dollar rescue package which it put together to
save the Indonesian economy from collapse.
</P>
<P>
The government originally expected to raise 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars in this fiscal year through the sale of shares in 12 state
firms.
</P>
<P>
Sofyan said the government would no longer be able to reach the
1.5-billion-U.S.-dollar revenue target as a result of the change
in plans.
</P>
<P>
So far, only a government stake in Semen Gresik has been sold.
Mexico's Cemex SA purchased a 14-percent stake in the company for
114.6 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government next plans to arrange for the sale of a
14-percent stake in Indosat, Sofyan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The White House has
decided to offter 1 million US dollars to fight drugs Tuesday and
urged the International Olympic Committee to award medals to
athletes who were beaten by cheaters.
</P>
<P>
The White House hopes to set up an independent doping agency
and universal adoption of uniform drug policies, including
year-round test to ensure all Olympians are drug free.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that the Olympics must adopt a comprehensive
anti-drug program that applies 365 days of every year, to all
Olympic athletes," Barry McCaffrey, an official of the White
House, wrote to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
He said both performance-enhancing drugs and recreational
drugs should be tested year-round.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was submitted as part of planning for a worldwide
drug summit called by the IOC for February 2-4. McCaffrey will
lead the U.S. government delegation to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Whitle House never before has committed anywhere near 1
millon dollars to battle doping in sports. The U.S. Olympic
Committee budgets more than 11 million dollars in its anti-drug
efforts.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey also asked the IOC to consider "supplemental medals"
for athletes who lost to documented acts of drug cheating.
</P>
<P>
The 1 million dollars research program would be administered
by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, working on its own
initiatives and on requests from Olympic authorities.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Customs, Police Uncover Major Fraud Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Local customs and police have
uncovered a major foreign exchange fraud scheme by local exporters
which has cost more than 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yulin, one of the two suspects, has been detained by the
police, but the other, Hong Hongbiao, is still at large.
</P>
<P>
From September 1997 to March this year, Chen, manager of the
Dalian Development Zone Company under the Shenyang International
Trading Company, carried out 53 imports transactions with the
Shanghai Youcheng Trading Company.
</P>
<P>
Later, local customs and police authorities discovered that the
Shanghai-based company, which has been proven to exist on paper,
was fabricating their invoices and that all their clearance
documents for imports were fake.
</P>
<P>
They merely remitted foreign exchange abroad under the pretext
of engaging in import activities.
</P>
<P>
The authorities found that all of the 53 contracts have been
paid for, involving a total of 19 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Through this fraud, Hong, the suspect still at large, had
stolen foreign exchange worth 900 million yuan from the State and
around 100 million yuan in illicit profit.

<HEADLINE> Reform Pioneer Walks Parallel to the Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Over a decade ago, a Chinese
woman initiated a series of reforms which causing a debate across
the country on which road China was to take, socialism or
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
This year, however, Guan Guangmei, the woman who advocated
reforms in state-owned commercial businesses, shocked the country
again by setting up the privately owned Wanmei Commerce and Trade
Ltd. Co. in the city of Benxi in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
"China's reform offers good opportunities,"she said. Over a
decade ago she made a name for herself by urging reform. "Now, as
long as I can seize opportunities, I will have more successes,"
Guan says, though she is already in her late forties.
</P>
<P>
Her company earned 10,000 yuan (1,250 U.S. dollars) in its
first deal early this year, and this was the first time Guan
transacted business solely for herself.
</P>
<P>
Although people are used to Guan's masterstrokes, many of them
still don't believe she has become a private business owner. "I
myself had never thought of this,"she said.
</P>
<P>
Discussing her greatest satisfaction, Guan said, " I'm not
going to lag behind other people."
</P>
<P>
She is creative by nature, many people have observed. When
Guan was head of a village production team in 1970, she
secretly introduced a small-scale household contract
responsibility system which was then totally forbidden in China.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the following remarkable reforms she took, the
first reform was nothing, her friends say.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Guan first contracted to operate a shop. A year later,
she became the first person to run a shop on a leasing basis, and
in 1987 Guan founded the first leasing business group in China.
</P>
<P>
Then these reforms produced earth-shaking effects while the
planned economy still played a predominant role. The media began
to refer to her as the Phenomenon Guan Guangmei.
</P>
<P>
"Guan Guangmei has made great contributions to China's reform,"
said Sun Baoli, deputy director of the commerce department in
Benxi. Now commercial businesses are taking various forms in
addition to contract and leasing.
</P>
<P>
Since Guan contracted for her first shop, dazzling changes have
taken place across the country as reform advances at an even
faster pace.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, Guan has changed jobs many times and
launched drastic reforms everywhere she worked.
</P>
<P>
Guan says, "I'm lucky to be around during China's reform
era. As long as reforms can benefit the country and the people, we
can try anything because opportunities for us to exhibit our
competence are everywhere."

<P>
NANJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province, a major
grain producer in east China, has been battling a severe drought
that has affected more than 93 hectares of local farmland.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has called for speeding up the
planting and management of autumn crops.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in drought-stricken areas are now busy irrigating
fields with water drawn from wells and other sources.
</P>
<P>
Since September, the province has had 50 percent less rainfall
and warmer weather than in normal years.
</P>
<P>
Local farmland, except that near rivers, has an insufficient
water supply, and the current drought has affected most
agricultural areas to varying degrees, with hilly land the hardest
hit.
</P>
<P>
So far this season, the draught has hampered the planting of
wheat and the transplanting of rape.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Coffee Output Down Due to El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A prolonged dry spell,
believed to have been triggered by the El Nino weather phenomenon,
is blamed for a 24-percent drop in Indonesia's coffee output for
the production year ending on September 30, the Jakarta Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's production fell to 5.7 million 60-kilogram bags
(342,000 tons) from the usual annual output of 450,000 tons,
Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Center official Oskari
Atmawinata was quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The drop was due to the severe drought in June-December period
last year which damaged coffee crops. This year, excessive
rainfall during the June-November flowering period damaged plants
and young pods while a dry spell from January to March damaged the
developing seeds, he said.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is caused by a warming of the Pacific Ocean which
interacts with other weather systems and typically produces freak
weather patterns, such as drought in some areas and heavier-than-
normal rainfall in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon, which occurs every two to seven years, has
unleashed natural disasters around the world, damaging crops for
two successive years and causing turmoil on world commodities
markets.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the world's third largest coffee producer after
Brazil and Colombia. Ninety percent of the country's production is
robusta and the remainder arabica.
</P>
<P>
The country is the world's largest producer of robusta, whose
harvest is between April and September and provides 24 percent of
the global robusta production. Robusta is extensively used in the
instant coffee industry.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) has said
the country's coffee exports dropped by 18.69 percent to 309,000
tons worth 550 million U.S. dollars in the 1997-98 coffee year --
compared to 380,000 tons and 675 million dollars in the previous
coffee year -- due to El Nino.
</P>
<P>
AICE's executive secretary Noer Madjid predicted the country's
coffee output would continue to decline this year by a further 30
percent because of the La Nina reverse weather pattern which would
cause higher rainfall than normal.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is Indonesia's third largest foreign exchange earner
among plantation commodities after rubber and palm oil,
contributing about 22 percent of the agricultural export value.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Daya Bay Nuclear Power
Plant in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, which began
operations in 1994, had generated 59.8 billion kwh of electricity
by this October.
</P>
<P>
The income of the plant, built with French help, has reached
3.35 billion U.S. dollars, of which 2.2 billion was generated from
the sale of electricity to neighboring Hong Kong, and after-tax
profits has amounted to 761 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Because of these fairly good economic returns, the plant has
already paid back 2.87 billion dollars worth of bank loans and
interest, accounting for 51 percent of the total loans payable.
</P>
<P>
Tests have shown that the technical, safety, and economic
standards of the plant, the first of its kind built in wealthy
Guangdong Province, south China, have reached medium to
upper-medium world standards.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, a Chinese manager became director of the plant, a
post previously held by a French director, and a five-year
development plan was worked out according to the requirements of
the International Atomic Energy Agency.

MEXICO CITY, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will maintain its
oil export quota to counter a price slump.

<P>
But it also warned that it would cancel its agreement to cut
exports if other producers break their commitment and flood

<P>
BONN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras defeated Russian
Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-2, 6-4 but Marclo Rios lost to Briton Tim
Henman 7-5, 6-1 in their first round-robin matches at the ATP
Tour World Championships in Hanover, Germany, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who is bidding to break Jimmmy Connors' record of
five successive seasons as number one from 1974 to 1978, wasted
no time in imposing his game on Kafelnikov, the last player to
qualify for the eight-man field.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old American improved his record over Kafelnikov,
who came into the event ranked 10th in the world, to 10 wins and
just two losses.
</P>
<P>
Rios needs to win at least two matches in the elite event to
have a shot at dethroning Sampras in the final rankings for the
year. But he simply faded after falling behind a break in the
second set.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean blamed a recurring back problem for his poor
performance and indicated he may even drop out of the
tournament.

SAN JOSE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Central American foreign
ministers will meet Wednesday in Honduras to study a joint
reconstruction program to repair the damage caused by Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will make a preliminary plan to be forwarded by
the presidents of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and
Guatemala to international financial groups and industrialized
countries at a meeting on December 10 and 11 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Roberto Rojas presented Tuesday a
report on the damage to the government council. Details of the
report were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The five Central American countries hope that the Washington
meeting will be followed by a large international aid package for
the region, where thousands died in floods and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican authorities said the flow of Nicaraguan refugees
who lost their homes after the hurricane has increased.

<HEADLINE> Tensions Spill Over in UEFA Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Tension erupted in the UEFA
Cup third round first leg matches on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Five players were sent off, in which four in all-French and
all-Spanish ties in the matches.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, 10 players were sent off and one second round
match was abandoned -- although this time at least, all the
matches were completed.
</P>
<P>
The first major European clash between two French clubs ended
in a 2-2 draw between Monaco and Olympique Marseille but both
teams finished with 10 men after Marseille's Florian Maurice was
given a marching order after 63 minutes and Franck Dumas of
Monaco followed him six minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Robert Pires had put Marseille ahead after 10 minutes before
David Trezeguet, who, like Pires was a member of France's World
Cup-winning squad, equalised with a 17th minute penalty.
</P>
<P>
Titi Camara restored Marseille's lead with a 39th minute goal
before Ludovic Giuly completed the scoring nine minutes into the
second half.
</P>
<P>
There was another hard-fought "derby" in Spain where Atletico
Madrid ended with nine men in their 2-1 defeat at Real Sociedad.
</P>
<P>
Atletico had Stefano Torrisi and Carlos Aguiler sent off
midway through the second half by English referee Graham Poll,
who also booked eight players in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
Atletico's Roberto Fresnedoso completed a miserable night for
the visitors by putting through his own net for Sociedad's winner
five minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian striker Juninho had given Atletico the perfect start
with a third-minute strike, but the home side equalised with a
Darko Kovacevic header on the stroke of half-time.
</P>
<P>
Olympique Lyon of France finished with 10 men but a goal more
than Club Bruges in their 1-0 win thanks to Jacek Bak's goal on
the stroke of half-time.
</P>
<P>
A minute earlier Lyon had been reduced to 10 men when Swiss
striker Marco Grassi was sent off for slapping Yugoslav defender
Milan Lesnjak in retaliation after a tackle.
</P>
<P>
The biggest winners on the night were Bologna who crushed Real
Betis 4-1 while the biggest goal-haul came in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
Grasshoppers, who reached the third round after Fiorentina
were disqualified following crowd trouble in their abandoned
second round match three weeks ago, shared six goals with
Bordeaux in a 3-3 draw.
</P>
<P>
Bordeaux threw away a two-goal lead and were trailing 3-2 with
only 17 minutes to go before France's top scorer Sylvain Wiltord
scored his second goal of the game to force the draw.
</P>
<P>
The narrowest win was by Roma who were made to fight all the
way for their victory by FC Zurich. The winning goal in their 1-0
win came from a last-minute penalty by Francesco Totti.
</P>
<P>
In Glasgow, Rangers saved themselves from a home defeat with
an equaliser from Rod Wallace in the 68th minute after Abel Balbo
had given Parma a 51st minute lead at Ibrox.
</P>
<P>
But four-time European champions Liverpool went down to a 3-1
defeat after some woeful defending against an impressive Celta
Vigo side looking to complete an English double after knocking
out Aston Villa in the previous round.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool, who had taken the lead through Michael Owen after
35 minutes, were still in with a chance until deep into injury
time when Vlado Gudelj took advantage of some comical defending
to sweep home the third and make Vigo odds-on favorites to reach
the quarter-finals in two weeks time.

<P>
ZAGREB, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Federica Faiella and Luciano
Milo of Italy shared the first with Russian's Natalia Romaniuta
and Danil Barantsev, following the compulsory dances at the World
Junior Figure Skating Championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The result was encouraging for Romaniuta and Barantsev as they
finished a distant seventh a year ago when the championships were
held in New Brunswick, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Silverstein, 14, and Justin Pekarek, 17, of the United
States, took third place at the early stages of this event, while
their compatriots, Melissa Gregory, 17, and James Shuford, 20,
placed eleventh.
</P>
<P>
Compulsory dances make up for 20 percent of the overall score.
The original dances, counting for 30 percent of the total, will
take place on Thursday, to be followed by the free skate on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the men's short program, rising Russian star Ilia Klimkin
made up in artistic impression what he failed in technical
elements to maintain an overall lead.
</P>
<P>
The eighteen year-old stumbled in his opening combination but
put up an outstanding display in the remaining essentials and
presentation to be aptly reward by the judges.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Vincent Restencourt, the winner of the short
program, moved to second place, followed by Japan's Yosuke
Takeuchi in third. The highest placed American was Mathew Savoi,
who landed seventh position.
</P>
<P>
The men's free skate, which will make up the remaining 50
percent of the final score and decide the title, will take place
on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Burns Wins But Sainz Goes Down in Flames </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- British driver Richard Burns
roared to victory in the British Rally on Tuesday -- but his
triumph was overshadowed by a dramatic climax to the world
championship.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Carlos Sainz, who only had to finish in the top four
to overtake Tommi Makinen and clinch the title, looked to be
coasting to the crown on the final stage of the event.
</P>
<P>
But in a heart-breaking finale, his Toyota Corolla burst into
flames just 300 meters from the finish line in Cheltenham.
</P>
<P>
With Sainz unable to complete the course, Makinen -- whose own
title chances looked to have been scuppered when he retired after
spinning off on Sunday -- secured a record third world
championship in a row.
</P>
<P>
Oxfordshire driver Burns won the rally in his Mitsubishi with
a clean sweep of all seven stages on the final day.
</P>
<P>
He finished three minutes 46 seconds clear of Juha Kankkunen
of Finland, with Belgian driver Bruno Thiry in third place.
</P>
<P>
It was a day of double delight for Mitsubishi -- the team
behind both Burns' and Makinen's victories.
</P>
<P>
But team boss Andrew Cowan was in humble mood. He said: "I've
been in rallying for 30 years but I've never known an occasion
like this."
</P>
<P>
"I feel very sorry for Carlos and the Toyota team -- they must
be devastated, " he added.

<HEADLINE> Women Pro Boxer to Make Debut in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The first women's professional
boxing bout in Britain takes place in South London on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine-year old Jane Couch -- also known as the Fleetwood
Assassin -- takes on Simona Lukic, 18, from Yugoslavia at Caesars
nightclub in Streatham Hill.
</P>
<P>
Jane, the world welterweight champion, has already won the
biggest fight of her career by overcoming the male boxing
establishment which at first refused her a licence to box in this
country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the struggle, she now feels it was all worthwhile for
her and all women who share her ambition.
</P>
<P>
"It gives them something to aim for. They now have the chance
to box as amateurs and learn the trade and aim for what I am
doing too. I think it is going to be a good move for women in
sport," said Jane.
</P>
<P>
After four successful amateur bouts she had to go to America
and Europe to fight as a professional and won her title in
Copenhagen in 1996. Then came the battle to get a licence in
Britain and a well publicised slugging match with the British
Board of Control before an industrial tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Backed by the Equal Opportunities Commission, Jane Couch
claimed that she was being discriminated against and the
subsequent tribunal hearing proved highly embarrassing for the
Board.
</P>
<P>
They were ridiculed for their defence that pre-menstrual
tension made women too unstable to box and they were
comprehensively outpointed by the tribunal judgement.
</P>
<P>
Jane got her licence earlier this year to usher in a new era
for boxing in this country.
</P>
<P>
But the bout has already attracted criticism from one leading
boxing figure -- Frank Maloney who manages male heavyweight
champion, Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
He has described the contest as a freakshow and is firmly
opposed to women's boxing. Others argue that it is a dangerous
sport for men and have questioned why women want to subject
themselves to the risk of brain damage as well.

WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Hockey

without pay by the NHL for punching Rangers defender Jeff
Beukeboom from behind in a game last week.

<HEADLINE> Legislation Urged to Curb Arms Flow to Central Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement to the press here, Peter Burleigh, president of
the Security Council for the month of November, said "Council
urges all States to adopt legislation to enforce and strengthen
controls on the movement of illicit arms."
</P>
<P>
The statement came following a devastating report from the U.N.
Commission of Inquiry that Rwandan Hutu rebels, known as ex-FAR,
were involved in the conflicts of Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
All countries needed to show "the necessary political will" and
follow council resolutions on arms embargoes, Burleigh, charge
d'affaires of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said.
</P>
<P>
"Council reaffirms its embargo on the shipment of arms and
ammunition to former Rwandan government forces and militia, as
previously set forth in several (U.N.) resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry commission report said that the Rwandan rebels,
who are mostly from former government forces, had become
significant players in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the inquiry commission, Mahoum Kassem of
Egypt, briefed the 15-member Security Council Tuesday on the
arms flow to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the region is rapidly heading for a
catastrophe. The danger of the repetition of the tragedy
comparable to the Rwandan genocide of 1994, but on a sub-regional
stage, cannot be ruled out," the commission chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 rebel groups, in addition to those from Rwanda, are now
operating in the region and forge links with other armed groups
from such countries as Angola, Burundi, Uganda.

WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Tuesday called for Internet assistance to bridge foster care
centers and families to help 100,000 children join families.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet holds the potential to shorten their wait, to
make an on-line link between foster care centers and families
looking to adopt," the president said at a White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Technology has given us an important tool and we should use
it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton directed the Department of Health and Human Services to
work with the courts and nonprofit agencies on a national Internet
registry of children legally eligible for adoption.
</P>
<P>
Of the agencies that already have online services, the largest
posts photos of just 1,000 waiting children.
</P>
<P>
House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley took the ceremony
as an occasion to press for an increase in the adoption tax
credit, saying he would reintroduce legislation next year to
increase the credit for adoption costs to 10,000 U.S. dollars and
make it permanent law.

<HEADLINE> UK to Study Link between Infertility, Ovarian Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- British researchers are to
investigate a possible link between infertility and ovarian
cancer, The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Almost 3,000 women investigated for fertility problems over the
past 30 years, a third of which have had infertility treatment,
are to be surveyed to establish whether they have gone on to
develop ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
The study, funded by Britain's Cancer Research Campaign (CRC),
will assess whether infertility or infertility treatment might
increase the risk of the cancer.
</P>
<P>
Several studies carried out in other countries have made a
connection, but this is the first major investigation of its kind
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a link between the treatments and the risk of
ovarian cancer or infertility and the disease, then we may be a
step closer to understanding the causes of the disease," Professor
Gordon McVie, Director General of the CRC, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that even if researchers find there isn't a link, then
it will reassure thousands of women.
</P>
<P>
The average woman has a one in 56 risk of developing ovarian
cancer in her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
If infertility itself is linked to an increased risk, the
consequences would be far-reaching and serious and it will be even
more important that women get the proper support and advice, the
researchers said.

WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday
approved an interest-free credit of 200 million U.S. dollars
equivalent to help Bangladesh Emergency Flood Recovery Project.
</P>
<P>
This project will assist Bangladesh in maintaining

associated with restoring infrastructure assets, production
levels and food grain stocks.
</P>
<P>
It is the first part of a three-part strategy to assist the
country to respond to the 1998 floods. First, the project will
help restore and sustain macroeconomic stability and contain
pressure on the balance of payments. Second, it will also maintain
and augment food grain stocks, contain inflation, and provide food
security. Third, the project will facilitate the resumption of
agricultural, industrial and economic activities disrupted by the
floods.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary
lending arm for developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman Says Clinton "Pleased" over McDougal Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is pleased that Susan McDougal, acquited of embezzlement charges,
is now "able to put some of these things behind her," a White
House spokesman said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said, "On a personal
level he was pleased that for someone who's had a lot of adversity
in her life -- some of which not brought on by herself -- that
she's able to put some of these things behind her."
</P>
<P>
A Santa Monica, California, jury declared McDougal innocent
Monday of charges that she stole from conductor Zubin Mehta and
his wife -- a case McDougal said was trumped up to pressure her to
testify against Clinton in the Whitewater investigation. Her
refusal to do that has already cost her 18 months in jail for
contempt.
</P>
<P>
McDougal and the president are friends and former business
partners from their Arkansas days.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at Britain's Oxford
University have designed a robot sheepdog which will cut the
stress levels suffered by herded animals.
</P>
<P>
The mechanical sheepdog, named Rover, has been developed to
test whether animals prefer to be directed by a robot than a
barking dog or a shouting human, the BBC reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
So far the robot has been tested on ducks. Standing 28cm high,
the radio-controlled robot has a built-in camera and computer
which allows Rover and the shepherd to identify relative position
and to steer the ducks in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Ducks will not be likely to mistake Rover for a real sheepdog,
as the robot is "resembling a hat box on wheels", researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
Rover's speed is four meters a second, enough to pursue any
reluctant ducks.
</P>
<P>
The research is intended to develop a greater understanding of
how animals' behavior can be controlled by machines, with the aim
of reducing their anxieties.

<HEADLINE> Global HIV Cases 10 Percent Up in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Global HIV infections rose 10
percent in 1998 with the HIV virus infecting 11 people a minute
worldwide during the year, a new report has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures issued by UNAIDS, the UN agency set up to combat
the spread of the HIV/Aids epidemic, paint a grim picture of a
disease leaving millions dead around the world.
</P>
<P>
"The epidemic has not been overcome anywhere. Virtually every
country in the world has seen new infections in 1998 and the
epidemic is frankly out of control in many places," UNAIDS said in
its annual update of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two decades into the Aids epidemic and despite new drugs
and improved prevention, nearly six million new cases and 2.5
million deaths were reported in the year of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Every one of these new HIV infections represents a prevention
failure, our collective failure." Dr Peter Piot, executive
director of UNAIDS, told a news conference to launch the report
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although sub-Sahara Africa continues to be the global epcenter
of Aids, UNAIDS's report indicates that the disease is rapidly
gaining new footholds in Asia and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
A total of 33.4 million people worldwide are known to be living
with the HIV infection, among them more than 22 million people in
sub-Saharan Africa, 6.7 million people in South and Southeast Asia
and 1.4 million people in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Four African countries estimate a quarter of adults carry HIV
Aids and South Africa alone accounts for one out of every seven
new infections on the continent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a number of countries in West Africa remain
relatively less affected, in part as a result of early and
sustained prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
In North America and Western Europe, the availability of new
more potent anti-HIV drug combinations has helped people with HIV
to live longer and deaths in the U.S. dropped by two-thirds
between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, new HIV infections have remained constant in North
America and Western Europe, indicating that preventative programs
are failing.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General Decides against Independent Counsel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno on Tuesday decided not to order an independent counsel
investigation of alleged political fund-raising abuses by Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the appointment of an outside prosecutor, Reno said
she found evidence that Gore lied to Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents about telephone fund-raising calls from his
office during the 1996 presidential election campaign "so
insubstantial that there are no reasonable grounds for further
investigation."
</P>
<P>
"During the past 90 days, we have vigorously pursued an
investigation to determine whether there was sufficient evidence
to warrant further investigation into whether the vice president
may have knowingly made false statements to investigators in
1997... I have found that there are no reasonable grounds for
further investigation," Reno said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
The Gore case arose out of two interviews during a Justice
Department investigation of 45 fund-raising calls he made from his
office before the 1996 election. Gore told FBI agents he believed
his calls were for large "soft money" contributions which were not
covered by campaign finance laws prohibiting fund-raising on
federal property.
</P>
<P>
But a White House memo discovered earlier this year appeared to
contradict the vice president's account and Reno opened an inquiry
into whether Gore had intentionally misled investigators.
</P>
<P>
Gore's office welcomed Reno's decision.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president is pleased that this preliminary review has
been concluded without the need for an independent counsel. Vice
President Gore will continue focusing on what he has been doing --
working with the president to prepare America for the 21st
century," Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. not Satisfied with Iraq's Response on Document Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday Iraq remained evasive about a U.N. request for documents
on its weapons programs but made clear that the dispute still did
not warrant a military action.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin, in its first
reaction to Iraq's answer to the request of the U.N. inspectors on
documents about Iraq's weapons program, said it showed the Iraqis
remained evasive.
</P>
<P>
"The response from the Iraqis demonstrates an Iraqi desire to
dodge their obligations rather than comply with their
obligations," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"The familiar tactics is used -- of shifting the blame,
changing the subject, primarily by impugning the professionalism
of UNSCOM and chairman (Richard) Butler," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said that compliance with U.N.
resolutions was "a multifaceted exercise" which goes beyond just
providing documents and that UNSCOM experts were best placed to
decide whether Iraq was complying.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking this day by day. We are examining the Iraqi
actions, judging them by what they are doing. Many of these
judgments are professional technical judgments and they can be
best made by the professional technical experts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to remain vigilant about this... We have no
illusions about this regime. We approach this problem with a high
degree of scepticism about their intention," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
reporters that Iraq must comply. "We are determined that Iraq meet
its commitments to the Security Council," she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Germany Agree on NATO Nuclear Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and Germany agreed
Tuesday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should
not change its nuclear policy by pledging not to be the first user
of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping made their agreement clear during a
joint press conference at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"There is no intention in my government to question any core
element of NATO strategy," Scharping told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed a controversy that broke out this week
between Bonn and Washington on the nuclear policy of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
"Based on my conversations with Minister Scharping, I think
that we have a meeting of the minds -- that the strategic concept
is critical for NATO's security, that the strategic concept as far
as the nuclear component should not be altered," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it continues to serve a vital security purpose for
the NATO organization and should not be changed," said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not there is debate at other levels of the German
government, it is clear from our perspective that we should adhere
to the policy we currently have and not change it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Scharping agreed. "As Secretary Cohen said, there is no
intention in my government to question any core element of NATO's
strategy," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO reserves the right to be the first side in any conflict to
unleash nuclear weapons in order to protect its members against
growing threats from chemical and biological, as well as nuclear,
weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, some critics want it to pledge only to use them in
response to nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
Scharping repeated that the German government did not want to
cause any rift within the alliance and had no intention of acting
unilaterally on the nuclear issue.
</P>
<P>
He called the long U.S.-German bilateral alliance "a very
solid, a very good relationship, indispensable for our future
based on common values, based on common interests, based on a
common heritage."
</P>
<P>
"NATO is the most successful alliance we have ever seen in
history so the main goal of our government in Germany is to
strengthen NATO and its cohesion and to make NATO able to face the
challenges for the next century," Scharping said.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves Soft Loans to Honduras and Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Tuesday announced the approval of soft
loans to Honduras and Nicaragua totaling 93.8 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest assistance brought to 196.8 million dollars the
total financing approved by the IDB to Central American countries
affected by the devastation of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
In the latest loan, Honduras will receive 45.2 million dollars
to support a family allowances program designed to promote better
nutrition, health, and education among the poorest of the poor
groups.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua will receive 48.6 million dollars for improvement in
the hospital system and maternal and child care services for the
most disadvantaged sectors of the population.
</P>
<P>
The Bank is also contributing a 50 million dollar loan to the
Honduras Social Investment Fund for small-scale public works and
it is redirecting up to 430 million dollars in previously approved
loans to Central America to help finance the relief, recovery and
reconstruction effort.

<HEADLINE> Judiciary Committee Democrat to Offer Censure Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A Democratic member on the
U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee said Tuesday he
will propose a resolution to censure rather than impeach President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The proposal by Representative William Delahunt of
Massachusetts would condemn Clinton's sexual relationship in the
White House with Monica Lewinsky, but would not include any
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Media reports quoted Delahunt as saying, Clinton "is in legal
jeopardy upon expiration of his term. There is a possibility that
if (Kenneth) Starr or any subsequent prosecutor has a case that
they feel is appropriate to charge a crime, whatever we do does
not terminate that decision."
</P>
<P>
However, Delahunt said the resolution would not prevent Clinton
from making a voluntary decision to personally apologize to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Although Delahunt's alternative is unlikely to sway the
committee's 21 Republicans, who appear to strongly support an
impeachment resolution, it could have an effect on the House
floor. At least four Republicans not on the committee have said
they would vote against impeachment, and two of them estimated
dozens of Republican lawmakers share the same view.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the committee has planned a hearing on perjury next
week, focusing on the consequences of perjury in the judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have argued that perjury under oath is a crime,
whether in a civil or criminal case, and no matter what the
subject.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have countered that lying to conceal a sexual affair
should not be a standard for removing a president from office.
They point out that all testimony relating to the Lewinsky matter
was barred from the Jones lawsuit by the trial judge, and should
not be a factor in the impeachment investigation.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican, is trying to focus
on the core issue for Republicans: whether Clinton lied under oath
to conceal his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
A central issue in Starr's report is the contention that
Clinton lied about the affair in his January 17 deposition in the
Jones lawsuit, and then testified falsely again in his August 17
grand jury testimony
</P>
<P>
The president is expected to review written answers to 81
questions submitted by Hyde on November 5, and send them to the
committee either Wednesday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hyde is reportedly planning for the panel to complete its work
the week of December 7. That would allow the House to convene the
following week to vote on any committee-approved articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
While no plans are set for procedures by the full House, a
number of lawmakers reportedly said that if an impeachment
resolution fails, there could immediately be a second vote on
censuring the president.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the inquiry reported their initial attempt to
delve into the Kathleen Willey matter has not produced significant
investigative leads
</P>
<P>
Republican officials have said the committee is not interested
in exploring any more examples of alleged sexual misconduct.
Clinton has denied making an unwanted advance toward the former
White House volunteer.
</P>
<P>
The Willey matter could be raised again next week, when the
committee has asked Democratic donor Nathan Landow to testify.
Willey has identified Landow as someone who spoke to her about her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled for depositions next week are Robert Bennett,
Clinton's lawyer in the Paula Jones case, and the president's
closest adviser, Bruce Lindsey.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Red Cross Spends Highest Relief in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The American Red Cross is
spending 160 million U.S. dollars on disaster relief in 1998, more
than any previous year, because of series hurricanes, tropical
storms and other natural disasters, the organization said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1, the Red Cross has responded to 239 disasters
affecting 300,000 families in 41 states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands, serving 3.2 million meals and providing
comfort to 200,000 people left homeless, it said.
</P>
<P>
The organization spent 46 million dollars on disaster relief in
1997 and 71 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross reported that it had spent more than 104 million
dollars for recovery from September's Hurricane Georges, which
damaged parts of the Florida Keys and then slammed into the Gulf
Coast of Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and north Florida. It
spent 81.5 million dollars on Andrew, the second-most costly
hurricane on record.
</P>
<P>
The United States was struck by tornadoes and flooding in the
first half of the year in many states in addition to Hurricane
Georges.
</P>
<P>
In February, massive flooding hit California and tornadoes
struck Florida; in March, tornadoes swept southern Minnesota,
Alabama and Georgia; in April and May, tornadoes brought disasters
to Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, North
Carolina, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, New York, Minnesota and
Wisconsin; while wildfires destroyed more than 200,000 hectares in
Florida in June.
</P>
<P>
In August, Hurricane Bonnie struck the coasts of North Carolina
and Virginia, and Tropical Storm Charley touched down in Texas. In
September, Tropical Storm Frances caused flooding in Louisiana and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
Florida was the state hit hardest by natural disasters in 1998
and the Red Cross set up 21 relief operations in the state,
compared to Texas, which had 19; Georgia and New York had 14; and
California had 13.
</P>
<P>
The organization is continuing spending on relief for clean-up
of damage from Georges in Puerto Rico; flood relief in Kansas and
Texas; tornado relief in Oklahoma; and clean-up of damage from
Hurricane Mitch, which struck the Florida Keys earlier this
month.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania earned 67.6
billion Shillings (about 100 million U.S. Dollars) from sale of
356,900 tons of fish last year, a senior fishery official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an annual meeting in Dar es Salaam Tuesday, Thomas
Maembe, the Director of Fisheries Department, said that the
amount of fish caught last year was 100 tons more over that of
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, the director said, 306,750 tons were caught from
fresh water areas.
</P>
<P>
Maembe said the daily catch of lobsters dropped from 434
kilograms in 1996 to 334 kilograms last year, showing that their
amount has been decreasing in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, lobster fishing continues to earn the
country foreign exchange and provide employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Maembe said nearly 700 tons of lobsters worth over 2.6 billion
Shillings were caught last year, earning the country some 172
million Shillings in revenue.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Employment Growth Lags Behind That of U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Employment growth in the United
States has outpaced gains in Canada since 1989, while the type of
employment created by each country has been vastly different.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada said Tuesday that since the recession of early
1990s, the pace of employment growth has been stronger in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Between 1989 and 1997, employment grew 10.4 percent in the U.S.,
compared with only 6.5 percent in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"The type of employment created during this nine-year period has
been quite different in the two countries," the statistics agency
noted.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, self-employment has been the engine of growth,
accounting for 80 percent of the overall employment increase. In the
U.S., self-employment accounted for only 10 percent of job creation
between 1989 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for this stark difference is not well understood,"
the agency said, adding that " may reflect differences in tax policy,
and higher payroll taxes and unemployment rates in Canada."
