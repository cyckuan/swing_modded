BRADLEY TV COMMERCIAL: EASING A WOMAN'S FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.H., Mass.)  (See also BAUER-COMMERCIAL) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a look at a 60-second TV commercial that former Sen.
Bill Bradley, who is running for the Democratic presidential
nomination, began showing in Iowa, New Hampshire and the Boston
area this week.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: The Kaplan Thaler Group and MacWilliams, Cosgrove,
Smith, Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The commercial opens with white letters on a
black background that say, ``Someone who listens.'' It then shows,
in succession, head shots of Maureen Drumm, a Philadelphia mother
of three, her husband, Christopher, and Bradley. Mrs. Drumm is
seated on a sofa, holding her infant daughter, flanked by her
husband and their eldest daughter. A relaxed Bradley sits
cross-legged in a chair, with a piano and fireplace behind him. The
spot closes with the words, ``It can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: Maureen Drumm: I really believe that thanks to Sen.
Bradley my third daughter is alive today, because he took the time
to care.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley: She was actually afraid that the child would die
because she would be pushed out of the hospital in 24 hours or
less.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Drumm: The insurance companies had instituted a
policy of 24 hours postpartum care.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Drumm: I wanted to ensure that I was guaranteed that I
would be in the hospital long enough that she wouldn't be
experiencing the problems that my first child experienced. So I
said to my husband, ``I'm going to call Sen. Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley: I knew the people were on my side, so even if the
insurance companies and HMOs were against me, that we could win.
Forty-eight hours should be a minimum. Introduced a bill. Passed a
law. Made 48 hours a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Drumm: That's the type of man I want in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: Bradley was the main sponsor of a law enacted in 1996
requiring health insurance companies to cover at least 48 hours of
hospital care for new mothers. However, Vice President Al Gore's
campaign has criticized Ms. Drumm's contention that her third
daughter is alive today because of Bradley _ a claim the Bradley
campaign also featured in a commercial released last week _ as
hyperbolic. Though this new commercial expands on Ms. Drumm's
complicated story, it still does not entirely explain the
assertion.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. Drumm, 34, said that ``I would not have had
the courage to go through another pregnancy'' without the 48-hour
law because her first two daughters both developed serious
complications more than 24 hours after delivery. Her insurance
company covered an extended hospital stay for her first child, but
it told her in 1995 that it would limit coverage to 24 hours for
her second child. So she called Bradley's Senate office, and he
brought her to testify before a Senate committee. Soon after, her
insurer agreed to cover 48 hours of hospital care for her second
daughter. Then in 1996, the 48-hour bill passed, giving her the
confidence, she said, to become pregnant for a third time, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: The commercial tries to show Bradley _ whom the Gore
camp has criticized as being ineffective in the Senate _ as a
no-nonsense legislator who gets things done. And in saying that he
had to fight insurance companies and HMOs to get the bill passed,
Bradley suggests that he will have the courage to take on
entrenched special interests in Washington, a central theme of his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the real aim of the commercial seems to be to woo female
voters, who support Gore in significantly higher numbers, polls
show. That may be the reason Bradley has focused on the 48-hour
bill in his first advertisements rather than the major proposal of
his campaign: a contentious plan to extend health insurance to
almost all Americans.

SHAQ KEEPS GOING, AND GOING, AND GOING ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first month of the season is nearly over, and
the gaudy stats Shaquille O'Neal is posting show no signs of
dipping into mortal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Not the points, not the rebounds, and certainly not the minutes
played.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson has pushed O'Neal to the limits _ he averaged
almost 44 minutes per game in the five games prior to Friday's _
and O'Neal has responded. During that five-game span, he was more
dominant than ever _ 37.4 points, 16.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists and
4.8 blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is undaunted by the marathon, and Jackson believes he's
playing better in part because he doesn't take long breaks on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not letting him sit too long, because I think he does cool
off and loses his feel for the game,'' Jackson said. ``We just
said, let's see if we can't refocus and somehow get your energy
back there. That's been the difference, because he's always been a
good starter. He really started games good and somehow ran out of
energy in the course of games. Right now, he's sustaining the
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   And the reason for that, oddly, might be those much-discussed
extra pounds O'Neal added this offseason. O'Neal reported at 345
pounds, which he chalked up to a muscle-building program, and that
strength has helped him endure the nightly beatings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so. I am stronger,'' he said, then quipped, ``and I've
been on my Krispy Kreme diet all summer. I'm feeling pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said the only toll has been on his legs, which have
required a little extra massaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel it on game day, but on certain days it's kind of
hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his recent streak of dominance, O'Neal said it's not
necessarily the best string he's played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did better in elementary school,'' he said ``I was averaging
50 in elementary. And they were going, `He's not 10. I want to see
his birth certificate.' For real. That's a true story.''
</P>
<P>
   As for O'Neal's minutes, Jackson said he'll look to play him 40
a night, unless the Los Angeles Lakers have a big fourth-quarter
lead, which has been a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make him lose weight,'' Jackson joked.
</P>
<P>
   Milestone: A.C. Green played in his 1,042nd consecutive game to
break the professional basketball record, earning a standing
ovation from the Staples Center crowd. Green tied former
record-holder Ron Boone on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Boone, now a Utah Jazz broadcaster, put together his streak over
13 seasons of ABA and NBA play.

ARIZONA TOPS KENTUCKY TO WIN PRESEASON NIT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the tourists crowding midtown Manhattan could not
get good seats to see ``Cats'' on Broadway Friday night, they had
another option for feline-titled entertainment in the same general
area.
</P>
<P>
   Two college teams nicknamed Wildcats _ Kentucky and Arizona _
played for the championship of the Preseason National Invitation
Tournament in Madison Square Garden. Plenty of seats were available
as only 12,560 customers attended.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, a 63-51 winner, improved its record to 4-0. Kentucky
fell to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is ranked No. 8 in the nation and Kentucky is No. 11.
Kentucky led by as many as seven points in the first half, but
Arizona held a four-point advantage at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona gradually built its lead to a comfortable level during
the second half, using the speed and shooting of Jason Gardner and
Gilbert Arenas, the guards.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona lead peaked at 16 points with about three minutes
remaining as coach Lute Olson's team began to dominate in almost
every aspect of play.
</P>
<P>
   Arenas led Arizona in scoring with 20 points. Gardner had 10.
Richard Jefferson, a forward, had 15 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   For Kentucky, Tayshaun Prince had 18 points and Desmond Allison
12.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona outrebounded Kentucky, 43-37. Arenas had five steals and
Gardner four as Arizona dominated in this category by 15-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason has told me all along he can play like a veteran,''
Olson said. ``Gilbert is only 17 and he doesn't realize there's any
pressure. We're going to try to keep him from finding out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson reflected on the array of strength in the Arizona
attack. ``We have so many different weapons that can beat you on a
given day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a pretty game by both teams,'' coach Tubby Smith of
Kentucky said. ``But it was a slugfest for a while from a defensive
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that his team shot only 35.6 percent from the field,
Smith found fault with Jamaal Magloire, the senior center, who
scored only four points and was 1 for 5 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamaal has jump shots and he was missing them for the second
night in a row,'' Smith said. ``We didn't capitalize on easy
attempts.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kentucky was intimidated by the inside game of Arizona
center Loren Woods, who had eight points and seven rebounds but no
blocked shots because not that many were taken in his presence.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona reached this year's final by beating Notre Dame on
Wednesday night before Kentucky eliminated Maryland. In Friday
night's consolation game, Maryland improved its record to 4-1 with
a 72-67 victory over Notre Dame (3-2). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's championship game was close and intense from the
start.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Arizona had a 29-25 lead despite trailing twice by
seven points midway through the first half.
</P>
<P>
   At intermission, the only player scoring in double figures was
Arizona's Arenas, who had 13 points on 4-of-6 field-goal shooting,
including 1 for 2 from 3-point range. He also had four steals.
</P>
<P>
   Prince led Kentucky scorers with nine points.
</P>
<P>
   In the consolation game, Maryland took its first lead just nine
seconds into the game on a dunk off a rebound by Lonny Baxter, a
sophomore forward who led his team with 17 points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But Notre Dame cut Maryland's 18-point second-half lead to one
point with two minutes left and kept things interesting until the
final horn.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's Juan Dixon secured the victory by making two free
throws with 19.3 seconds left. The sophomore Troy Murphy,
impressive again at power forward, led Notre Dame with 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Williams, the head coach of Maryland, said the Notre Dame
comeback was the result of his team's not working plays low to the
basket and back out again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really had to work hard for that win,'' Williams said.
``We're a young team and we're learning how to play. A lot of
people didn't think we could win this year, losing three guys to
the pros and Terrell Stokes, our starting point guard for three
years. We have to prove to ourselves and to our fans that we can
win. This certainly was big tonight.''

THE RANGERS' LONG SEASON IS FEELING LONGER AND LONGER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ If you threw out the second period Friday night,
the New York Rangers played a competitive game. But that's like
saying discount the first two months of the season and the Rangers
have the makings of a good team.
</P>
<P>
   Without their captain, Brian Leetch, who will be out for six to
eight weeks with a broken right arm, the Rangers were buried, 6-2,
by the Florida Panthers. The Panthers scored four consecutive
second-period goals, and five unanswered goals in all, to break a
1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Rangers feel they have an excuse in the absence of
Leetch, their best player, but there is no excuse for the way the
Rangers have begun the season. And no one in the organization _
from Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, to
Neil Smith, the team president and general manager, to coach John
Muckler to the team's high-priced core of veteran players _ is
exempt from blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody stepped up tonight,'' Muckler said. ``Nobody stepped up
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers supposedly play better away from home, but even with
a 6-3 victory in Tampa on Wednesday (their best performance of the
season), the Rangers ended their four-game road trip 1-3-0 with a
regulation tie. Over their last 15 games, the Rangers are 3-10-2
with that regulation tie. Through 23 games they are 7-13-3.
</P>
<P>
   Every shot they took Friday night _ 41, a season high _ seemed
aimed directly at Florida goalie Trevor Kidd's body. Every one
except the wrist shot that rookie defenseman Kim Johnsson snapped
from the top of the left circle off Kidd's catching glove 19
minutes 37 seconds into the first period that gave the Rangers a
1-1 tie heading into the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bottom dropped out before Alexandre Daigle scored with
3:15 left in the game to make it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers played without Leetch, Todd Harvey (knee), Manny
Malhotra (ankle), Tim Taylor (rib cartilage) and Stephane Quintal
(concussion). So, Muckler was forced to dress three inexperienced
defensemen, Johnsson, Jason Doig and Terry Virtue. Valery Kamensky
(forearm) was playing for the first time since Oct. 24 and just the
seventh time this season _ and the rust showed before Muckler took
him off Petr Nedved's top line and left him on the bench to start
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   That still does not explain what happened to the Rangers during
their second-period collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go brain-dead for a certain period of time,'' John MacLean
said. ``And we pay for it every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, who were humiliated at home, 6-1, by the
Philadelphia Flyers on Wednesday, drove Mike Richter from the net
at 2:55 of the second by scoring a pair of goals _ one by Radek
Dvorak, the other by Ray Whitney _ 95 seconds apart early in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bure, who had assisted on Florida's first goal (by
Jaroslav Spacek at 11:38 of the first period), set up Dvorak's
tie-breaking goal with a cross-ice pass to Viktor Kozlov. Richter
was able to make the save, but Dvorak batted the rebound straight
out of the air off his backhand past Richter for a 2-1 lead.
Whitney's goal came off a scramble in front with Richter lying on
his back in the crease. And it was 3-1 Florida, and Kirk McLean was
on his way in to replace Richter.
</P>
<P>
   A malfunction caused the scoreboard to read 5-1. That would be
the case soon enough. Kozlov scored on the power play at 11:49,
shortly after Theo Fleury had taken a penalty four seconds after
one to Daigle had expired. Scott Mellanby scored 27 seconds after
Kozlov, and it was truly 5-1. Maybe the scoreboard operator was
prescient. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bure fooled McLean with a wrister from the slot at 5:02 of the
third to give the Panthers a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we'd see Pavel Bure take off, we tried to play the
same way: fancy hockey,'' Mathieu Schneider said. ``There aren't
too many Pavel Bures in the league. We certainly don't have one.''

ARIZONA TOURISM OFFICIALS WARY OF STADIUM TAX  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tourism officials fear the task force looking into how to build
a stadium for the Arizona Cardinals will suggest taxing tourists to
help pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Already in the Valley, tourists are hit with fees for hotel
rooms and rental cars. Those tariffs have helped build America West
Arena and continue to support Cactus League baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a `Welcome' banner at the airport, but then (tourists)
get slapped with various taxes,'' said Rick Webster, a government
affairs agent with the Travel Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Webster, who monitors tourist taxes for the lobbying group, said
that cities started hiking such taxes within the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, taxes haven't dented tourism. But Webster warned that
convention planners and visitors could soon start comparing tax
tables when deciding destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism taxes in Phoenix are still below the average charged by
the nation's top tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix visitors now pay a 10.35 percent tax on hotel rooms,
including sales tax. That's less than the average of 12.5 percent,
according to a Travel Association of America study.
</P>
<P>
   The city's rental car tax at the airport is 23.8 percent,
including sales tax, plus a $2.50 Cactus League surcharge. The
average airport rate is 18.15 percent, with an average surcharge of
$2.45.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel taxes garnered about $92.4 million for the state last
fiscal year, according to the Arizona Department of Revenue. The
money goes into the general fund, some of it used to promote
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how much rental cars brought in because that tax is
lumped in with rentals of appliances and furniture. But the $2.50
surcharge on each rental brought in just over $5.4 million last
fiscal year, said Vince Perez, a spokesman for the state's tax
department.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One Ballpark, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks, was funded
partially with a quarter-cent hike in sales tax. That controversial
move culminated in the nearly fatal shooting of Maricopa County
Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox by a man upset at the hike.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist taxes don't carry the same political volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an easy sell if you've got to put it on the ballot,''
Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   A KAET-TV (Channel 8) poll last week hinted at more public
support for using taxes to build the stadium if those taxes were on
hotel rooms and car rentals.
</P>
<P>
   The poll indicated that 46 percent favored a stadium funded by
taxes on tourism, compared with 35 percent who supported funding
with a countywide tax.
</P>
<P>
   The task force looking into the new Arizona Cardinals stadium
hasn't addressed funding yet.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hodgdon, general manager of the tony Phoenician resort,
said that yearly guests recognize the bump in bed tax every time it
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our guests question it,'' he said, ``but they're not
at the point where they're sensitized to the point where they've
stated they're not coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has a hotel tax rate of 15.6 percent, which includes
funds for the Convention Center and the King Dome. The city also
recently raised its restaurant meal tax to help pay for Safeco
Field.
</P>
<P>
   But those taxes haven't affected tourism much, said Wolfgang
Rood, a consultant for the city's hotel industry. The occupancy
rate was 77.3 percent in 1998, up from 76.2 percent the year
before, Rood said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Austin, a spokesman for the Valley's Pointe resorts, said
that even though the taxes don't cause a noticeable dip in
tourists, the idea of making visitors pay for a stadium is patently
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it the right thing, or is it the cowardly way out of it?''
he asked. &QL;

BAUER TV COMMERCIAL: REACHING IN TWO DIRECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (See also BRADLEY-COMMERCIAL) 
(rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This 30-second commercial, ``The American Project,'' is one of
two that the Republican presidential campaign of Gary L. Bauer will
begin showing Saturday in Iowa, which has a caucus in late January.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Edmonds Associates, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The commercial begins with an image of the statue
of Abraham Lincoln inside the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and
then replaces that with a picture of the outside of the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to the gates in front of a churchyard, which slowly open,
and then to a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation, with which
President Lincoln freed the slaves in the rebellious southern
states. Next come three smiling children, one of them black, then a
woman pushing a stroller in front of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The camera pulls back to show that Bauer, who has been talking
all along, is there outside the memorial, too. Now Bauer speaks
directly to the camera. As he continues talking, he leans down
beside the baby in the stroller.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial ends with a Bauer for president logo, including
the slogan ``Advancing America's Values.''
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: ``Throughout history, our greatest presidents understood
that America is about expanding the circle of human rights and
dignity, from freedom of religion to the emancipation of slaves,
from civil rights to equal opportunities for women. I'm Gary Bauer.

basic of human rights. I won't stop until every one of God's

   SCORECARD: Bauer deftly reaches in two directions with this
advertisement. He appeals to the religious conservatives with whom
he is most popular by plainly stating his ardent, unyielding stand
against abortion. At the same time, he frames his argument for that
position in terms that are not religious, and thus seemingly tries
to avoid having other Republican voters pigeonhole him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his verbal and visual references to blacks and women
seem to move him toward a different end of the political spectrum _
a place closer to the center.

EURO TAKES A DIVE TO RECORD DEPTHS
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS figure in 3rd graf)

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Defying predictions of accelerated growth
in Europe, Europe's single currency sank to record lows Friday
against the U.S. dollar, the British pound and the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   In a move with tremendous symbolic value, Europe's 11-month-old
euro slipped to barely 1 penny above one-to-one parity with the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was introduced at nearly $1.18 on Jan. 4 amid buoyant
enthusiasm about new opportunities in Europe's unified market.
Friday, the euro sank as low as $1.0076 before closing at $1.0156.
</P>
<P>
   Though the decline was not in itself alarming, it provided yet
another reminder of Europe's nagging economic problems and its
inability to match the relentless growth of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The euro also hit record lows against the British pound, which
is certain to stir the new wave of hostility within Britain about
joining the European currency union.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's most drastic decline has been against the Japanese
yen, which has climbed sharply against all major currencies and is
now about 30 percent higher against the euro than it was in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's problems have repeatedly defied investors'
expectations. At the time it was introduced, the euro seemed so
strong that some economists and political leaders worried about its
climbing so high that it might make European exports too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the euro sank throughout the first six months of its
life and came perilously close to parity with the dollar in June.
The euro then recovered part of its lost ground, a rebound partly
attributed to signs of new economic growth and to speculators who
were convinced the euro was poised for a big bounce up.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's economy has indeed perked up in recent months, but it
is still growing much more slowly than that of the United States.
The U.S. economy expanded at a surprisingly strong rate of 5.5
percent in the third quarter of this year. By contrast, growth in
the 11-nation euro zone is about 2.5 percent this year and is
expected to reach about 3 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the euro had also been hobbled by growing
skittishness among Japanese investors, who have seen the value of
euro-denominated stocks and bonds plunge as a result of the yen's
surge.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank aggravated that skittishness on
Wednesday, when top officials said they would do nothing to shore
up the euro against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, many currency traders who bet on a strong
recovery in the euro last summer are now selling euros in order to
adopt a more neutral stance relative to other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about economic growth or this week's economic
numbers,'' said Michael Saunders, European economist at Salomon
Smith Barney in London. ``This is about investors' trying to reduce
their risks before year-end and trying to get back to neutral
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the European Central Bank, which governs monetary
policy in the euro zone, made it clear this week that they would
not try to shore up the euro through their trading operations.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenio Domingo Solans, the bank's board member in charge of
international issues, said Thursday that the bank had no intention
of intervening in the currency to prevent the euro from sinking
below parity against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And Wim Duisenberg, the European bank's president, in an
interview published Friday in The Financial Times, reiterated his
long-held position that the euro's exchange rate is only important
if it fuels inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the actual movement give rise to concern?'' Duisenberg
asked rhetorically. ``The answer is no. It doesn't matter very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Duisenberg admitted to ``some concern'' about
perceptions created by a falling euro. ``A continued further
movement in this direction would contribute to undermining the
confidence in the euro,'' he said. ``Unjustified, but still it is a
public perception.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Belgium, officials at the European Commission said
the euro's decline was attributable merely to strong economic data
in the United States rather than to fundamental weaknesses in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the strength of the dollar rather than the weakness of
the euro that has led to these developments in the past few days,''
said Gerassimos Thomas, a commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese central bankers and investors may well be the most
worried about the euro. The extraordinary surge of the yen against
the euro threatens to strangle Japanese exports to Europe because
Japanese goods cost more in European currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Although euro notes and coins will not enter circulation until
2002, the euro trades in financial markets and the existing
currencies of euro-member countries have been permanently locked to
the value of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Haruhiko Kuroda, a senior official at the Japanese Ministry of
Finance, was quoted by Reuters Friday as saying that the euro's
fall was unjustified. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has
previously said that Japan is ready to intervene if necessary, and
the Bank of Japan did in fact intervene, with assistance from the
European Central Bank, earlier this summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some analysts have speculated that the euro has been hurt by
recent political machinations in Germany. In the last week, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has inveighed against Vodafone
Airtouch's hostile takeover bid against Mannesmann, giving rise to
fears that Germany might try to block certain types of mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder kicked off another round of controversy on Wednesday,
when he orchestrated a $2.2 billion bailout of Germany's huge
construction company, Philipp Holzmann.
</P>
<P>
   But most economists say the euro's problems are rooted in more
mundane issues. They note that many institutions increased their
stocks of euro-denominated assets in the summers, convinced that
the euro had hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   But as the end of the year approaches, they said, investors are
shifting back to a neutral stance _ which means selling euros.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very uncertain about what the correct level of the
euro should be,'' said Jens Dallmeyer, an economist at Deutsche
Bank Research in Frankfurt. ``The boom in the United States is
still alive and kicking and everyone can feel it. But people are
still waiting for hard evidence of an economic upswing in Europe.''

<P>
   A private plane carrying a Maryland family home after
Thanksgiving in New York crashed in Newark Friday, killing all
three on board and injuring 25 others as it plowed along a street,
struck buildings and cars and broke into flaming debris that set
off fires, explosions and chaos in a largely residential
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash was not immediately determined,
investigators said, although weather may have been a factor. Two
employees at Linden Airport, eight miles south of Newark, had
advised the plane's owner-pilot, Itzhak Jacoby, an experienced
flier, against taking off in rain and dense fog.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby, 56, and his wife, Gail, 50, both senior officials of
federal health facilities near Washington, and their 13-year-old
daughter, Atira, were killed. On the ground, a 59-year-old man in a
car hit in the crash suffered critical burns, a 29-year-old woman
was severely burned and 16 others were hospitalized with burns,
cuts and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after takeoff from Linden Airport into a gray,
late-morning rain that had cut visibility to about 100 feet, the
single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza disappeared from radar screens,
went into a tailspin and plunged down in Newark's Central Ward,
about a mile west of the downtown area of New Jersey's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the aircraft struck the parapet of a three-story
factory, whose roof was set ablaze. Then, as a wing flew off, the
plane dived down on a street lined with multiple-family houses, hit
and set fire to nine cars, and at the end of a block hit a closed
restaurant. The impact sheared off the side of the plane, hurling
bodies out, and sent debris flying across a commercial avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told of a neighborhood suddenly plunged into chaos,
with the roar of the crashing plane, with car explosions that blew
in the windows and doors of houses, with power lines down and
zapping, and with flying glass and flaming debris that hit
bystanders and nearly decapitated a man sitting in a car whose roof
was torn away. Sixty residents were evacuated from damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a pretty holiday picture,'' Mayor Sharpe James
said as police officers cordoned off what seemed like a war zone in
the area of Kent Street and Springfield Avenue, while firefighters
battled flames, ambulances rushed burned and bleeding victims away
and federal and state investigators began an inquiry into the cause
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Itzhak Jacoby was director of the Health Services Administration
at the Uniformed Services University, the medical school of the
Department of Defense, and had been a member of its faculty since
1989. His wife was director of planning at the National Institute
on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who immigrated from Israel years ago and lived in
Bethesda, Md., with the younger of their two daughters, had flown
to Linden earlier in the week to spend the holiday with family
members in New York, acquaintances said. They were to fly Friday to
Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Va., and took off at
10:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man, his wife and daughter took off after being advised by
two linemen not to do so,'' Linden's Mayor John Gregorio said,
referring to two airport employees and recounting a conversation he
had with the airport manager, Paul Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes after takeoff, the plane vanished from
controllers' radar screens, James Peters, a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration, said. It was unclear what went
wrong, although James said in a briefing that the aircraft had
apparently experienced engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 1964 Beechcraft Bonanza with four seats, a V-shaped
tail and a cruising speed of about 200 mph, is regarded in aviation
circles as highly reliable. There are about 190,000 small planes in
the nation; last year there were 361 crashes involving such small
planes, with 621 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby's plane, white with red trim, took off in a northerly
direction and was to circle west and then south to travel the 220
air miles to Dulles. But it had flown only eight miles and had
gained little altitude when a Newark police officer, Wayne
Reynolds, saw it wobbling, its engine irregular.
</P>
<P>
   The plane then began spinning down out of control. Newark's
deputy police director, Rocco Malanga, said it came down over
Woodland Cemetery and hit the roof of an old factory at Kent and
Brenner Streets. One wing came off, and the factory roof caught
fire. Three workmen on the ground floor escaped uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft then skipped over the building's parapet and down
into Kent Street, where it struck several parked cars, setting them
afire and spewing flaming debris over the street, Malanga said. At
the end of Kent Street, the fuselage of the plane sideswiped a KFC
restaurant at Springfield and 18th Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant had not yet opened for business for the day, but
several patrons were waiting nearby, and they saw the side of the
aircraft shear open and the bodies of at least two occupants hurtle
out and fall in the restaurant parking lot. As the plane broke
open, debris shot across Springfield Avenue and scattered over a
wide area of sidewalks, yards and vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Perry, 53, was sitting in a parked car at 18th and Kent
when the plane zoomed down a block in front of him and began
closing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came straight down like an arrow,'' Perry said of the
plane. He ducked just in time, he said. A piece of the wing slammed
into his car, sheared away its hood, windshield and roof _ and cut
into the baseball cap Perry was wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Back down Kent Street, eight other cars were on fire _ five were
destroyed _ and a series of explosions ensued as flames reached the
gas tanks. The blasts blew in windows and doors of houses on both
sides of the street, sent plaster falling from ceilings and walls
and sent shards of glass flying.
</P>
<P>
   As firefighters fought the blazes, ambulances took 25 people to
University Hospital in Newark. A hospital spokesman, Rogers Ramsey,
said one Kent Street resident, Albert Walker, was in critical
condition with first- and second-degree burns over 15 percent of
his body and head and chest traumas. He said Rhonda Acey was in
fair condition with second- and third-degree burns and an ankle
fracture. Sixteen others were admitted with various injuries, he
said, while seven were treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 residents of the stricken area were evacuated to a
Salvation Army center where food and temporary shelter were
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Several agencies, including the National Transportation Safety
Board and the New Jersey State Police, were investigating the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethesda, Alan Schechter, who lives across the street from
the Jacoby house, said the couple moved to the neighborhood about
10 years ago. ``I knew he was an avid flier,'' Schechter said. ``He
had an airplane propeller attached to the carport of his house, and
I know from my conversations with him that he spent much of his
time flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Rene Bonnel, a neighbor in Bethesda, said in a telephone
interview Friday night that Jacoby had been born and reared in
Israel and had served as a pilot in the Israeli Air Force. ``He was
a very cautious pilot,'' Bonnel said, and, referring to the cause
of the crash, he added: ``It must have been mechanical. He would
not take any risks at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter B. Esker, director of university affairs for the Uniformed
Services University, said that Jacoby had been ``a very respected
member of the faculty'' for a decade, and had previously worked for
the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences. He
said Jacoby received a doctorate in operations research and
biostatistics from Cornell in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jacoby, who also graduated from Cornell, held a master's
degree in planning and analysis from George Washington University
and began with the National Institutes of Health in 1971. Dr.
Richard J. Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging, said
that she was the recipient of a number of awards, and was at the
heart of the institute's planning for research on aging.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bonnel, Atira Jacoby was a student at Walter
Johnston High School, in Bethesda, and was an accomplished viola
player who performed regularly with the Montgomery County Youth
Orchestra.

OVERMATCHED AGAIN: NETS LOSE TO THE LAKERS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last May, the New Jersey Nets offered Phil Jackson
a multiyear contract worth more than $7 million a season, but for
$1 million less he got Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Glen Rice and
a legitimate chance to win a seventh NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Nets are an adequate litmus test, but the Lakers
looked like contenders in flicking away the Nets 103-80 Friday
night at the Staples Center. With O'Neal having his way against
each of the three centers the Nets ran at him, Los Angeles improved
to 10-4. The Nets, who end this four-game Western Conference road
trip Saturday at Phoenix, dropped to 2-11.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal led everyone with 30 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists
and four blocked shots. Considering what he had done recently, that
line was tame. He had entered averaging 37.6 points and 16 rebounds
over his last five contests.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Ron Harper, pulling out a handful of fancy
finger rolls from his past, followed with 17 points, while Rick Fox
and Derek Fisher each scored 12.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Newman, scoring at least 20 for the second straight game,
led the Nets with 24 points. He was the lone bright spot, though,
as the Nets stars Stephon Marbury and Keith Van Horn struggled
mightily. Van Horn scored 20, but missed 9 of 14 field-goal
attempts. Marbury played perhaps his worst game this season,
recording 10 points and five assists on 3-of-16 shooting from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   After building a nine-point halftime lead, the Lakers, playing
without Bryant (broken right hand), broke the game open in the
third period behind 10 points by Harper and eight by O'Neal. They
combined for eight points as the Lakers opened the half with a 10-2
run to increase their lead to 17 points. Though the Nets once
pulled within nine, the result was never again in question.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Jackson spoke candidly about why he turned down
the Nets' generous offer, saying basically that they were far too
thin around the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons that I didn't take the job was because I
thought there were some holes in their team that were going to be
very difficult to make up,'' Jackson said. ``I think that it's a
team that's lacking the power players that are so important in this
game. This team doesn't have big bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Cage is playing for them, and they just solicited him,
didn't they? They just got a 37-year-old guy. In this game, you've
got to have your power players that clog that lane up and don't let
people penetrate with impunity. You've got to make them pay.''
</P>
<P>
   With the 6-foot-9-inch Cage starting at center against the 7-1,
300-plus pound O'Neal, the Nets were not in position to bully
anyone. The 6-8 Jamie Feick and the 7-1 Jim McIlvaine, who played
with a scratched cornea in his severely swollen right eye, spelled
Cage, but none of them had the power to slow down O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it looked as if O'Neal might rip the Nets for 50
points again _ the last time he scored that many was on April 2,
1998, at the Meadowlands _ when he scored six of the Lakers' first
eight points. His third basket came on a ferocious alley-oop slam
over Cage.
</P>
<P>
   The basket tied the game at 8-8 and began a 14-2 run that put
Los Angeles in control with three minutes left in the quarter. Rice
and Harper closed the spurt with consecutive 3-pointers, giving the
Lakers a 20-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But just when Los Angeles seemed poised to pull away, the Nets
rallied behind Newman. After cutting the deficit to 27-20 heading
into the second quarter, the Nets scored nine of the next 13 points
to move within two points. Newman led the charge with a layup, two
free throws and a 3-pointer that made it 31-29 with just under
eight minutes left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Lakers slowly began rebuilding the lead. O'Neal,
who had been relatively quiet after scoring 11 first-period points,
made the Lakers' final two baskets _ one on a turnaround jumper
from 10 feet, the other on a nifty spin move and reverse layup _ to
make it 47-38 at intermission.  &QL;

   NY-Y2K (New York) _ Last month, after searching and testing
nearly every computer and microchip in New York City's vast
inventory of technology, city officials took one of the final steps
in a four-year, $300 million effort to prevent any turmoil stemming
from the Year 2000 computer problem. They canvassed every city
agency to identify each jackhammer, bullhorn, tent, chain saw and
portable toilet. They made a list of every city employee who is a
qualified nurse, elevator mechanic, electrician, cook _ even scuba
diver _ so appropriate gear and specialists can quickly be
dispatched should trouble erupt after clocks and computers tick
from 1999 to 2000. The challenge is that despite spending more than
any other city in the world to fight the computer glitch, the
city's technology and emergency management experts say things may
yet go wrong _ and no one can predict exactly which things. By

   KENNEDY-JOHNSON (Dallas) _ Thirty-six years ago this week, John

of the great, romantic American heroes, his shortcomings obscured

Johnson is still remembered mainly as the president who presided

   BUSH-STYLE (Stratham, N.H.) _ When George W. Bush is not
reciting memorized lines during an official speech or rendering
careful answers during a formal interview, he is folksy and feisty,
a politician more playful than most of his peers. This disarming
demeanor goes a long way toward explaining the commitment and
confidence of Bush's core Republican supporters. But Bush's looser,
lighter style also contributes, fairly or not, to the questions
that opponents and reporters have raised about his intellectual
maturity. By Frank Bruni.

   ARISTA-DAVIS (New York) _ At age 66 _ or a whispered 67 _ Clive
Davis is a music man who usually plays it by ear, sensing hits and
nurturing artists like Janis Joplin, Barry Manilow, Whitney Houston
and Sarah McLachlan. But Davis is also a man with an independent
attitude and a passion for the New York-based company he founded.
And that style has drawn him into an epic Clash of the New Releases
(and Leaks) with Arista's corporate parents, BMG Entertainment and
its German owner, Bertelsmann. By Doreen Carvajal.

   NYGIANT-ZARB-SUIT (Undated) _ A former New York Giants football
star is contending in a lawsuit that Frank Zarb, the chairman of
the organization that runs the Nasdaq Stock Market, cut short his
career in the insurance industry by deceiving him about a $1.23
billion corporate buyout. The case is scheduled for trial on Monday
in the Superior Court of New Jersey. By Patrick McGeehan.

   SEGA-OUTLOOK (Tokyo) _ Sega Enterprises Inc., the beleaguered
video game company, commits itself to a radical reorientation of
its business aimed at harnessing the power of the Internet. The
maker of the new Dreamcast game system, which competes with Sony
and Nintendo in the multibillion-dollar home videogame industry,

Elisabetta Povoledo.
</P>
<P>
   EVEREST-MALLORY (Undated) _ Putting yourself in the boots of a
dead stranger to deduce what he thought and did in his final hours
is a detective's technique. But when the death occurred more than
75 years ago in one of the most remote points of the earth, the
task seems nigh impossible. The discovery on May 1 of the frozen
body of George Leigh Mallory high on Mount Everest has revived a
decades-old debate about what happened to Mallory and his young
companion, Andrew Irvine, on June 8, 1924, when they attempted the
first ascent of the world's highest mountain. By Christopher S.
Wren.

O'NEAL LIFTS LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Shaquille O'Neal, the Los Angeles Lakers'
40-minute man, needed a rest, he met the right opponent to give him
one Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, the new poster boy for the L.A. Marathon with his
wire-to-wire play, finally rested for most of a fourth quarter, as
his Lakers posted an easy rout of the New Jersey Nets, 103-80, at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal still hit the 40 mark for the sixth straight game,
playing 41 minutes straight. But he checked out with seven minutes
left in the game, his earliest exit in quite awhile, leaving with
30 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists and four blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he had to exert much energy to get any of that against
a Nets team that could only throw ancient Michael Cage and Stiff
Hall-of-Famer Jim McIlvaine at him. Somehow, 7-7 Gheorge Muresan
escaped punishment and stayed on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was never in doubt, but it took until the third
quarter for the Lakers to put the Nets away. And even then, they
had to withstand an 11-point quarter from Johnny Newman.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers opened the second half with a 10-2 run, capped by a
pair of fast-break buckets from Ron Harper, to make it a 17-point
game, 57-40.
</P>
<P>
   But before you could say, ``Hello, Newman,'' he had scored seven
straight points. That was enough to wake up the Lakers defense, and
they never let the Nets get within single digits, taking a 73-59
lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Lakers' non-Shaq highlights, they finally got a
double-digit scoring night from a bench player _ Rick Fox, with 12
points. Harper added 17 points for the Lakers, who improved to
10-4.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the Nets (2-11) looked like a team on the rise,
boasting the talented young tandem of Keith Van Horn and Stephon
Marbury. But it's who the Nets are missing that is most glaring.
Center Jayson Williams and guard Kendall Gill are on the injured
list, and Kerry Kittles is active but too hurt to play.
</P>
<P>
   That left 37-year-old Michael Cage starting at center and
journeyman Lucious Harris, of Cleveland High and Cal State Long
Beach, starting at off guard.
</P>
<P>
   The versatile 6-10 Van Horn started at small forward, an
apparent mismatch for Glen Rice, but Jackson decided against a
lineup change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to make a change,'' Jackson said. ``I thought
maybe Robert (Horry) could get out there and guard Van Horn, but
... A.C. has played so well for us, we just need his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their best lineup is probably a (smaller) lineup that does
include speed, and I don't think Van Horn playing the `3' (small
forward) is going to give them that speed,'' Jackson said before
tipoff. ``I think he'll do that, get a matchup with Glen Rice,
perhaps get him on the post, get him free a little bit, and then
he'll go back to the speed lineup, which is putting Van Horn at the
`4' (power forward) _ that's the lineup we have to be prepared
for.''
</P>
<P>
   No lineup did much good for the Nets, who shot just 33.3 percent
in the first half as the Lakers took a 47-38 lead. Van Horn led New
Jersey with nine points but was 3 for 10 from the field. Marbury
also made just 3 of 10 for eight points.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't nearly enough to keep pace with the Lakers, who got
19 points, 10 rebounds and five assists from O'Neal in the half.

USC BEATS LOUISIANA TECH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Great start. Better finish.
</P>
<P>
   USC went out with gusto Friday night, routing 25th-ranked
Louisiana Tech 45-19 before 45,070 at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Now if the Trojans could just have done something about those
middle five games it lost, this wouldn't have been such a
disappointing season. And maybe USC coach Paul Hackett wouldn't
have hinted at possible staff changes.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the kind of year it has been.
</P>
<P>
   This USC team has a penchant for the unexpected, and Friday
night, that meant shutting down one of the nation's most-explosive
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Much like its 62-7 season-opening victory over Hawaii, USC
dominated the Bulldogs in a game that made its mediocre play in
October only more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans contained Louisiana Tech quarterback Tim Rattay to _
get this _ 405 yards passing. It sounds awful, but Rattay is the
NCAA's No. 2 all-time leading passer, and did less damage than
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   He was rarely able to do much inside the 20-yard line, and threw
three interceptions. Rattay also had three touchdown passes, but
one came with 22 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech (8-3) averaged 37 points per game, so this was an
above-average performance by USC's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised we shut them down like we did,'' free safety
David Gibson said. ``He's an exceptional quarterback, but their
receivers weren't that good. I knew our secondary was better than
their receiving corps.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't mean Tech was prepared to give up. Rattay threw 68
passes, the most ever by a quarterback against the Trojans, and
completed 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets maddening to have to face 60, 70 balls,'' cornerback
Kris Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being severely tested by Rattay, USC's secondary, which
included true freshmen Kevin Arbet and Darrell Rideaux, stood firm
against the aerial assault.
</P>
<P>
   Arbet had the play of the game in the third quarter, when he
intercepted a pass and ran 75 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My running back instincts took over,'' Arbet said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a crowning moment for Arbet, who entered USC as a walk-on
before being awarded a scholarship just prior to the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was beautiful. I was running with him the whole way,''
said Arbet's stepfather, former USC wide receiver Jeff Simmons.
``Every step.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (6-6) seemed prepared to blow Tech out early,
running up a 21-0 first-quarter lead. On their first possession,
quarterback John Fox hit R. Jay Soward on a 53-yard touchdown pass.
Fox ended his evening by proposing to his girlfriend, Nicole
Barros, on the Coliseum's giant video screen after the game. She
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-yard reverse by Soward set up Chad Morton's 3-yard
touchdown run for a 14-0 lead, and Morton's 17-yard run made it
21-0 barely nine minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rattay completed just 4 of 16 passes in the first quarter but
then got hot, quickly leading Tech to a pair of touchdowns to cut
the lead to 21-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense rattled him early. I thought he looked out of
sorts,'' Hackett said. ``Once he got his rhythm going, you could
see how dangerous he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Rattay was accurate in the second half, but he threw two
interceptions in the third quarter that were crucial, including
Arbet's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to win, but we didn't expect to hold them to 19
points,'' said Richard, who had an interception. ``(Rattay) was
everything I thought he would be. He could throw the ball. He had a
great arm and was accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a satisfying victory for the Trojans, but not a
satisfying season, and that's why changes could be imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett didn't rule out some type of shakeup on the coaching
staff to improve the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give it some thought and figure out how to get
better,'' Hackett said. ``If that involves making changes, so be
it. But I haven't given it a lot of thought. That's what the month
of December will be for.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

FOR USC'S FOX, PRIZE COMES AFTER GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Louisiana Tech quarterback Tim Rattay piled up the
numbers again Friday evening at the Coliseum, setting one record,
nudging another.
</P>
<P>
   But USC quarterback John Fox got the win _ and the girl.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Fox was afraid to compare himself to Rattay. He didn't
want to embarrass the poor guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have killed myself if I tried to pay attention to (how
Rattay was doing), he's so good,'' Fox said after the Trojans beat
the Bulldogs 45-19 despite Rattay's 35-for-68, 405-yard passing
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't worry about trying to match him.'' The USC offense,
he noted, is ``not set up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Fox was just being polite, respectful.
</P>
<P>
   He knew better than anybody that the last act of the USC
football season wasn't about passes attempted and completed.
Football, and life beyond the final gun, require more than a strong
right arm.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, corny as this sounds, it's all about heart. Fox
proved it on the field for the third straight week, his earnest
efficiency and leadership a big reason the Trojans finish this 6-6
season with a three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Then he proved it on the stadium video screen for the remainder
of the crowd to watch.
</P>
<P>
   As USC players celebrated with family and friends on the field
minutes after the game, Fox knelt in front of girlfriend Nicole
Barros and presented her with an engagement ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicole, Will You Marry Me?'' read the video screen.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen fans propose to their sweethearts at a ballgame _ but
a player?
</P>
<P>
   ``She said OK,'' Fox said later in typical understatement.
</P>
<P>
   They kissed as fans cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Fox explained that he'd been planning the stunt for 12 weeks,
making sure it was all right with his coach, with the video crew,
with the NCAA rulebook.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve weeks ago, Fox was a linebacker, at the most improbable
stage of the odyssey that took him from starting quarterback for
nine games as a sophomore to taking nary a snap as a junior and
back.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't have known how perfectly it would all work out.
</P>
<P>
   USC head coach Paul Hackett gave Fox his approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I think it's a fantastic idea. I don't know if you
have the (guts) to do it, but I think it's a fantastic idea,'''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Fox had the (guts).
</P>
<P>
   He made sure Barros' mother was at the game, and asked his
mother to fly in from Nebraska for the occasion. He entrusted Jack
Ward, the trainer emeritus who has been a USC fixture since the
1950s, with holding the ring during the game.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Fox popped the question, nobody was surprised except
Nicole and the 45,070 football fans who shared the couple's
precious moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big surprise. I thought they were just going to show
pictures of the family (on the video screen),'' she said on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said she tried to pull away as she realized what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold on, hold on, let me get through this thing the way I've
been planning it for 12 weeks,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   She's a USC student too. They began dating at Centennial High in
Corona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just made my dream come true,'' Fox said. ``She's
definitely the one for me. To have my whole team behind me and
congratulating me... it was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the whole team was behind him. It has been behind him
ever since he reclaimed the starting quarterback job from Mike Van
Raaphorst following the fourth of USC's five straight losses.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't put up stats like Rattay's. Fifteen completions and
148 yards in the loss to Arizona State; 12 and 117 to beat
Washington State; 17 and 216 to beat UCLA last week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday he went 11 for 20 for 137 yards, 53 of them to R. Jay
Soward for the game's first touchdown. He didn't make mistakes,
though; a second-quarter interception marked his first turnover in
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know he's been the catalyst through the last three
weeks,'' Hackett said. ``I was just hoping for John that we would
win this one and win it big.''
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be Rattay's big night _ the nation's most
prolific passer facing a USC secondary missing the injured Antuan
Simmons and starting two freshmen and a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   And Rattay did show off, to the extent his fumble-fingered
receivers and the resolute young Trojans would allow. His 68
attempts were the most ever against USC and his 35 completions were
the most against USC since Oregon State's Erik Wilhelm had 37 in
1988 and his 405 passing yards were the most against USC since
UCLA's Tommy Maddox had 409 in 1990. His 113th, 114th and 115th
touchdown passes placed him second to BYU's Ty Detmer (121) in NCAA
history.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other nights for Rattay. He'll go high in April's
NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Fox might have played his last football game. He's been training
to become an elementary-school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Who would you rather have been Friday night?

CHANGES AWAIT AS USC LOOKS TO NEXT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC may make changes in its coaching staff,
something coach Paul Hackett did not rule out Friday night, but the
Trojans seem assured of changing some players' roles for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, it seems likely defensive end Kori Dickerson will
move to tight end for spring practice. Another likely switch is
moving linebacker Sultan Abdul-Malik back to his original position
of defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Malik had two sacks against Louisiana Tech, but those came
when he lined up as a defensive end. He was generally ineffective
as an outside linebacker this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bittersweet end: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward started out fast,
with a 53-yard touchdown reception, two runs for 46 yards and two
punt returns for 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But he became ill at halftime and was forced to watch the second
half from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disappointing year for him as it related to us, but
he'll have another day,'' Hackett said. ``He was totally exhausted.
It's been a tough year for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward finished his career with 25 plays of 40 yards or longer,
and 32 touchdowns, including 23 on receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking change: Hackett benched kicker David Newbury after he
missed a 46-yard attempt and replaced him with David Bell, who made
a 38-yard field goal and was 2 for 2 on conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd seen enough,'' Hackett said. ``I'm very disappointed in
the punting and kicking performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbury finished 11 of 20 on field goals this season.
</P>
<P>
   Iron man: Offensive tackle Travis Claridge started his 48th
consecutive game to become the first USC lineman of the post-World
War II era to start every game in his career from the day he set
foot on the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Other USC linemen have started every game but with the benefit
of a redshirt year.
</P>
<P>
   Up the charts: Tailback Chad Morton finished his career as USC's
eighth all-time rusher with 2,511 yards. His 1,141 yards this
season placed him 18th on the Trojans' single-season list.
</P>
<P>
   No coincidence: USC went 3-0 in its final three games and also
rushed for more than 200 yards in each of those contests.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery set: Linebacker Markus Steele said he will have surgery
on his left shoulder Dec. 14 to repair loose tissue that has
bothered him the second part of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Out of line: Two starters on the offensive line, guard Donta
Kendrick (flu) and center Eric Denmon (ankle), did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Alma mater: Former Louisiana Tech quarterback and current NFL
analyst Terry Bradshaw attended the game.

KELLY, RIDEAUX PROVIDE HOPE FOR FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC will begin the new century with a streak.
</P>
<P>
   And for once, it's a good streak. The losing streaks against
Notre Dame and UCLA have been terminated, and no longer will USC
trail them around campus like a piece of toilet paper stuck on
their shoe. USC will break into the 2000s with a modest three-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Considering USC's vagaries in the '90s, no one should take a
three-game winning streak for granted. Since the end of the 1992
season, USC has managed only two longer winning streaks, five in
the middle of 1994 and six to start 1995.
</P>
<P>
   No one's going to count Friday's 45-19 win over Louisiana Tech,
a scruffy team with an annoying offense, as fashionably as last
week's win over UCLA. But it beats losing to TCU in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a nice momentum swing for us,'' Trojan coach
Paul Hackett said after Tim Rattay's 68-pass assault. ``In a lot of
ways, it's a lot better than last year even though we went to a
bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This obviously wasn't a bowl game. But winning our last three
and beating UCLA was very positive for our young guys. A number of
them looked me in the eye after the game and said `next year,
coach, next year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Two of those young players eyeballing Hackett were Kareem Kelly
and Darrell Rideaux, the former Long Beach Poly standouts who
contributed much more to USC's season as true freshman than anyone
could have reasonably expected.
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux finished his season with starts in the last two games
and 27 of his 34 tackles in USC's last four games. After what he
called a bad game against the Bruins, he was an active and
effective corner against Tech's five-receiver sets Friday. He had
seven tackles, and all of Tech's big plays came against the other
side of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I played well (against UCLA). I had to regroup
against a quality quarterback and an offense that can shake you
up,' said Rideaux. ``I called my high school coaches (Poly
assistants Don Norford and Charles Clinton) this week for
reassurance.''
</P>
<P>
   They reminded him that when in doubt, he can always rely on his
technique. As a 5-9 corner often giving away four-to-six inches to
receivers, technique is what Rideaux has to rely on. But now he
knows what the college game is about, and few young athletes seem
to enjoy the learning process as much as Rideaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great learning experience,'' Rideaux said. ``I
obviously have a lot more to work on. I need to work on my
strength. But what I have now is game experience, experience
playing under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games like tonight, you work and learn to get better. But you
grow up against UCLA. There's a locker room full of young players
who grew up last week, guys who will come back next season as
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly actually had more rushing attempts (two reverses) than
receptions (one) Friday as USC's offense stayed on the ground to
keep Rattay off the field. But the wide receiver finishes the year
with 54 catches, 902 yards (both USC freshman records) and a lock
on freshman All-American honors.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had five catches or more in seven games this season and
four games with 100 or more receiving yards, topped by a nine
catch, 170-yard effort against Cal. With R. Jay Soward and Windrell
Hayes departing, Kelly will become USC's go-to receiver in '00.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew coming in that I would be used a little,'' said Kelly.
``We unfortunately had a few injuries and I had the chance to play
a lot more than I expected. It feels good to contribute. That's
what you want to do as a freshman, contribute any way you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't focus on any hype (about next year). I have to get
better. There are a lot of things I have to polish -- my routes, my
speed, my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting stronger and better won't nearly be as difficult for
Rideaux and Kelly as learning to deal with losses. Six Trojan
losses in '99 matched or exceeded their losses in multiyear high
school careers.
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux became a starter at Poly as a ninth grader and left with
a 49-6 career record. In three seasons, Kelly was 36-5, and he
suffered just two losses in his last 36 games between 1996 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go from winning every game to losing six in a season,
that's a (downer),'' said Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a freshman, you're told to be seen and unheard,''
said Rideaux. ``So I watched how the team would respond (to
losses), how no one pointed fingers, how players took their licks,
how the team leaders kept us together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually was kind of exciting. We experienced failure,
learned how to win and grew a lot closer as a team. I learned to
understand my role as a Trojan, and most of the guys here will be
back next season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans lose only two players from their defensive two-deep
lineup Friday. Kelly and fellow freshman receiver Marcell Allmond
will welcome back quarterback Carson Palmer, and while there's no
replacing Chad Morton's heart, Sultan McCullough (79 yards Friday)
is a more than capable runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the opportunity to do some super things,'' said
Rideaux. And without any nagging streaks attached.

FOX GETS THE WIN, AND THE GIRL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech quarterback Tim Rattay got the yards, 405 of them
to be exact, when the Bulldogs visited USC in the Coliseum on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the win went to USC senior quarterback John Fox. Oh yeah,
Fox also went home with the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Fox did his part in the 45-19 win over the 25th-ranked Bulldogs
by completing 11 of 20 passes for 137 yards, including a 53-yard
scoring strike to R. Jay Soward at the conclusion of the Trojans'
opening drive. However, his postgame performance was even more
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   With family, friends and teammates gathered nearby on the
Coliseum turf, Fox got down on one knee in the moments following
the game and proposed to his girlfriend, Nicole Barros.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said OK,'' Fox said about 20 minutes later with a smile
still plastered on his face. ``It just made my dream come true. I
just can't explain it. I don't think she knew it was coming. To
have my whole team behind me and congratulating me, it was
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an idea hatched in Fox's mind about the time the Trojans
kicked off the season in Hawaii. And one of the first people he
approached was USC coach Paul Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said absolutely,'' Hackett said. ``It was one of the best
ideas I had heard of. I didn't know if he had the (guts) to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which took 12 weeks to prepare and was shown on
the Coliseum video board, actually was easy on Fox's nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was something I wanted to do,'' said Fox, who has
been dating Barros for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was going to happen win or lose on Friday. But it
sure made it nicer after the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping for John that we won this one and won it
big,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   When the football season began, it appeared like Fox's largest
contribution to the USC football team during his senior year would
come when he was on one knee as the holder for field goals and PAT
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a 6-foot-4, 220-pound senior who was a Best in the West
selection after playing at Corona Centennial High for former Gahr
coach Steve Silberman, started nine games at quarterback in 1997
when John Robinson was the Trojan coach. However, when Hackett took
over, Fox slid down the depth chart. He moved to tight end during
fall camp last season and entered this year as a backup linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox returned to the quarterback rotation after Carson Palmer
broke his collarbone and Mike Van Raaphorst couldn't lead the team
to victory.
</P>
<P>
   His career ended with three consecutive wins, including the
streak-busting victory over UCLA and the duel with Rattay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy is so good,'' Fox said of Rattay. ``He's gonna go
far. But wins and losses are what counts most.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention getting the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Secondary importance: USC's defensive backfield for much of
Friday consisted of cornerbacks Kris Richard, Darrell Rideaux and
Kevin Arbet and safeties David Gibson and Ifeanyi Ohalete.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you without a score card, that is one sophomore,
two freshmen and two safeties who have been better suited for run
support. And they were facing a quarterback who has thrown for more
yards than all but one player in NCAA history.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive game plan called for pressure early to try and
keep Rattay from getting into a rhythm. The plan worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he looked out of sorts early,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans sacked Rattay three times and pressured him
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand Florida State only sacked him one time,'' Richard
said. ``That says a lot for our defensive line.''
</P>
<P>
   Rattay tied a career high with 68 attempts and completed 35 with
three going for touchdowns. But he also was intercepted a season
high three times, including one returned 75 yards for a touchdown
by Arbet, and was sacked twice by Sultan Abdul-Malik and once by
Aaron Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate giving up big plays,'' said Richard, who along with
Ohalete, had the other interceptions. ``But with 60-70 balls, you
can't stop everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pick and roll: Arbet, a true freshman from Stockton, walked on
at USC but earned a scholarship before fall camp was complete. His
biggest moment was undoubtedly the interception and winding 75-yard
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say about that interception return?'' Richard
said. ``I ran behind him and watched him making moves like he was
(O.J. Simpson).''
</P>
<P>
   Arbet said it was simply reverting to his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a running back in high school,'' Arbet said. ``When I
got the ball my running back skills took over.''

   The results were evident enough in his 30-point, 16-rebound
performance Friday night as he led an easy 103-80 rout of the New
Jersey Nets at Staples Center. Just an example of the virtues of
the triangle offense?
</P>
<P>
   More than that, said the scholarly O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like the Pythagorean theory,'' he said. ``Not too many
people know the answer to my game. Quote me on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy enough, but could O'Neal quote the Pythagorean theory?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I never knew it,'' he admitted sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal. The Nets, as O'Neal points out, had no answers
either.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal played the first 41 minutes of the game before finally
taking a breather, and by that time the Nets were dizzy with all
the math lessons _ including O'Neal's 14-for-24 shooting, his four
blocked shots and his season-high seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers led wire to wire for what could be
categorized as a routine victory over a very debilitated, 2-11 Nets
team that could only throw the likes of ancient Michael Cage at
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope its systematic, rather than routine,'' coach Phil
Jackson said. ``Routine connotes boredom or robotic kind of
behavior. We want systematic, we want to grind it out. We want to
have the type of team that can take people to a certain space and
make them pay almost 75 percent of the time (against O'Neal).''
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions in the second quarter, Jackson got what he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice struggled to a 1-for-7 night, but the Lakers found
alternatives easily against the Nets _ from Ron Harper's
season-high 17 points to 12 points each from Derek Fisher and Rick
Fox. Fisher fought through foul trouble to hit 6 of 7 shots, while
Fox shook off early jitters to hit 5 of 7 and record a rare
double-digit performance from a Lakers reserve.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal played 40-plus minutes for the sixth straight game, but
he didn't have to exert much energy against Cage and Stiff Hall of
Famer Jim McIlvaine. The two Nets centers combined for zero points
while 7-7 Gheorge Muresan stayed on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was never in doubt, but it took until the third
quarter for the Lakers to put the Nets away. And even then, they
had to withstand an 11-point quarter from Johnny Newman.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers opened the second half with a 10-2 run, capped by a
pair of fast-break buckets from Harper, to make it a 17-point game,
57-40.
</P>
<P>
   But before you could say, ``Hello, Newman,'' he had scored seven
straight points. That was enough to wake up the Lakers defense, and
they never let the Nets get within single digits, taking a 73-59
lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the Nets (2-11) looked like a team on the rise,
boasting the talented young tandem of Keith Van Horn and Stephon
Marbury. But it's who the Nets are missing that is most glaring.
Center Jayson Williams and guard Kendall Gill are on the injured
list, and Kerry Kittles is active but too hurt to play.
</P>
<P>
   Newman scored 24 points off the bench, but the Nets' stars
struggled. Van Horn shot 5 for 14, finishing with 20 points, and
Marbury was 3 for 16 for 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Shaq intimidated us, particularly with the shots
Stephon likes to get inside the paint,'' Nets coach Don Casey said.
``He's a monster, we were worried about Rice and people like that,
but Shaq clears his ground and the others just feed off him.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are pouring into Seattle this weekend in vans
and on buses, by air and on foot _ the college students and the
church groups, the environmental campaigners, the Teamsters, Ralph
Nader, Chinese dissidents and the man who became a hero in France
for defacing a McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   All of them say they are outraged at the growing power of a
group few even heard about five years ago, the World Trade
Organization. And so, with tens of thousands massing, they are
planning to turn what initially sounded like the yawner of all
international meetings _ a gathering of trade ministers from 135
countries to start the ``Millennium Round'' of trade liberalization
talks _ into the Woodstock of the era of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the WTO itself, with its paltry annual budget of
$80 million, not even enough to buy an F-22 fighter for the Air
Force, isn't the real target of the protesters. It's merely a
symbol, a bureaucratic metaphor for the idea that the markets have
become the real governing force of the '90s _ frequently with the
willing participation of governments and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The real target is a sense that the role of the private sector
and the role of the public sector that is supposed to rein in
market forces has become hopelessly blurred _ a bit like those
so-called non-commercials on public television that, with each
passing year, seem to turn into longer and longer plugs for
corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   It is not simply that governments have shrunk and the private
sector has risen. In fact, the public sector has increasingly
become the champion of private enterprise. That reflects a
sea-change in traditional political constituencies. The parties
that used to get elected by arguing that government must tame
capitalism's excesses and stand up for those left behind _
big-government Democrats, Europe's battered Socialists _ have
mostly re-tooled themselves and changed the priorities of
governments, aligning them more closely than ever with the
priorities of corporations and a swelling class of
worker-investors.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the shift has created a lot of political
confusion about whose interests are being protected. Consider the
union members in Seattle. True, the forces of globalized trade are
threatening to move their jobs to China. But like many workers
across America, their huge pension funds and 401-K's have been
spiking upward precisely because they are invested in companies and
countries that have benefited greatly from ever-freer trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that trade only affected major corporations,''
Mickey Kantor, the former trade representative and long-time
Democratic political strategist, said last week. ``Now it affects
people's jobs, their education and of course their portfolios. And
it creates some pretty wacky politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which left and right have unified to become the
champion of corporate priorities was on full display in the
congressional session that just ended. Democrats and Republicans
may be in a death-battle for control of the White House and
Congress, but they managed to find common ground on repealing
Depression-era laws preventing banks, securities firms and
insurance concerns from merging those businesses (while doing
nothing about those $1.50 ATM fees that drive most banking
customers crazy) and passing a law limiting lawsuits arising out of
Y2K disasters.
</P>
<P>
   And look at the bills that business interests got killed: There
was no increase in the minimum wage, no new limits on ``soft
money'' in political campaigns, no ban on agricultural mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Or look abroad: The generals who staged the coup in Pakistan
made their first priority a crackdown on corruption. The country's
terrible reputation among foreign investors, they warned, was as
big a threat to the nation as India's nukes.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say governments have entirely given up on reining
in market forces. Japan is focusing its attentions at Seattle on
retaining protections for farmers, steelmakers and other
industries. France is forever battling globalization. Here at home,
even the market-friendly new Democrats of the Clinton
administration have breathed new life into anti-trust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Drive a few miles north of the WTO meeting in Seattle, and
Microsoft employees will offer up an earful about how the Justice
Department is mired in old economic thinking, and is threatening
the economic engine that has driven one of the greatest expansions
in American history.
</P>
<P>
   But even those protests are muted by the not-so-secret belief
among Microsoft's investors that a breakup of the company might
turn into a bonanza for their shareholdings _ exactly what happened
after the government went after AT&AMP;T.

   So is the public good suffering as the role of government and
the role of business blur? It depends on what you think governments
ought to be doing for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Those promotional spots for sponsors on public television have
expanded precisely because there is increasing opposition to using
taxpayer money to fund TV or the arts. So now the P in PBS now
stands for something more like ``public-private partnership,'' and
it seems likely that public financing will play an ever-smaller
role.
</P>
<P>
   And of course the most sacrosanct of public functions _
education _ is a constant battleground in the public-private wars.
School vouchers, charter schools and for-profit educational
companies that run schools all blur the line between what
governments can achieve and what the private sector can.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these cases, good civic and economic arguments can be
made for more private financing. But with the loss of public money
inevitably comes a loss of public control, and less of a voice for
public debate over priorities.
</P>
<P>
   And that, at the heart of it, is the argument that will be
shouted on the streets in Seattle. People who don't usually have
much in common _ the Rainforest Action Network and the United
Steelworkers, for example _ are convinced that the WTO's rise
represents the ultimate victory for corporate interests that want
the rules of the global economy written on their terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough examples on the table now, from the arguments
over whether countries can ban genetically modified foods, or the
argument that we can't ban products made by child labor because it
violates some trade agreement,'' said Nader, the longtime consumer
advocate who years ago moved beyond auto safety to make the case
that a global economic rule-setter like the WTO is unsafe at any
speed. ``People aren't buying the idea anymore that globalization
is inevitable and their governments have to go with the flow of the
market. That's what is unifying the protesters you are going to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over genetically modified organisms is a prime example
of the alliance of governments and corporations _ and of the
continuing frictions between countries with different domestic
standards. While American companies and regulators argue that these
foods are safe, Europeans have banned many of them as threats to
consumer safety and the environment. The United States is
challenging rules that require labeling of all genetically modified
foods in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the explosive issue of how to handle the concerns of
labor. Unions will be in Seattle to argue that global trade
agreements should protect the rights of workers, just as they have
long protected intellectual property and investments abroad. They
want the new trade agreement to include provisions that set minimum
labor standards in factories around the world. They oppose imports
from countries that ban unions, China included. In an election year
in which Vice President Al Gore is desperate for deeper union
support, they have more than a little political leverage.
</P>
<P>
   But developing nations like India and China say that such
restrictions are simply a form of American protectionism. They
insist that labor issues are a domestic problem unrelated to
international trade, and want any rulemaking relegated to the
toothless International Labor Organization. The Clinton
administration supported that position a few years ago, but now
wants a ``study group'' within the WTO to take up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   To the protesters on the street, that's far too little action.
To the developing nations, it's far too much. All of this has
opened up the new divide of globalization, the argument over who
will make the rules, and on whose behalf. ``It's not going to be
the WTO with its closed-door, big-business policies,'' vows Nader.
He could be right: The very fact that a WTO negotiation is
triggering screaming in the streets could mean that the pendulum is
beginning to swing back, and that global politics may rear its head
and attempt to trump the imperatives of global economics.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For weeks, the story line on Sen. John McCain of
Arizona has been that he has a big, bad temper. But here's a news
flash: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has one, too. Even Bush does
not dispute a description by the writer Richard Ben Cramer that he
is the ``Roman Candle'' of the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   The word on Bush, a graduate of Yale and the Harvard Business
School, is that he is a cutup who lacks the intellectual heft to be
president. But why doesn't anyone ever mention that McCain ranked
fifth from last in the Class of 1958 at the United States Naval
Academy? Or that, like Bush, he was known for preferring carousing
over cramming?
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore still cannot shake the impression that
his public presentation is awkward and wooden and that he sometimes
seems condescending. The truth is, Bill Bradley can be awkward and
wooden and sometimes  &UR; he &LR;  seems condescending.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley is trying to counter a perception that he
was aloof from his colleagues when he was a senator from New
Jersey, and that he was not particularly affable. But Gore was a
loner who made few friends in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or unfair, the portrayals of presidential candidates by the
news media, the pundits and the late-night comics are often
exaggerated. They are certainly not complete depictions of who the
candidates really are. The images (some would say stereotypes) are
the product of many factors, including early widely reported
incidents that become ingrained and remain largely unchallenged by
the press.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because these images are often founded on some truth,
they can be impossible for politicians to overcome. It is not
implausible to suggest that Dan Quayle might still be in
competition for the Republican nomination this year were it not for
his placement of an unfortunate ``e'' at the end of potato seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The public's impression of candidates may be more important than
ever in the campaign of 2000 because there is a dearth of raging
issues dividing the parties. As a result, voters may place even
more emphasis on what they think of the candidates personally.
</P>
<P>
   That has led the contenders to scramble to define themselves
before their opponents define them first. A crucial event in this
rush to fill-in-the-blanks will take place later this week when
Bush, the Republican front-runner, participates in the first of a
series of nationally televised debates with his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   And several campaigns _ Republican and Democratic alike _ have
begun or are preparing barrages of TV commercials designed to shape
(or reshape) the images of their candidates. Bradley, for one, has
a new commercial portraying him as an engaged senator, with
tributes from two former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Jay Leno test,'' said David Axelrod, a Democratic
strategist in Chicago. ``If a salient quality of yours begins to
become a frequent repeat joke in Jay Leno's monologue, then you've
reached such a level of attention and penetration that that quality
will begin to define you. These things are almost always unfair.
People are more complex than one quality. Bush may not be a genius,
but he's not a moron either _ or he wouldn't be where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the current campaign season started so early and some
preliminary impressions have already been formed, the coming
debates may be less an opportunity for candidates to make positive
impressions or define themselves through their ideas. Instead, the
debates may be more about warding off destructive images and
avoiding gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debates can be more corrective than necessarily reinforcing
positive points,'' said Alan Schroeder, a journalism professor at
Northeastern University in Boston who is an authority on debates.
``Ross Perot in '92 was thought to be something of a joke. In that
first debate he really captured a lot of people's fancy and it
allowed him to be taken seriously _ briefly as it turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandy Grunwald, a Democratic media consultant, says debates
offer voters a rare opportunity ``to compare what they've heard to
what they consider the reality they can see with their own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the debate on Thursday, Bush has the most at stake because
the event is something of a coming out _ and because he needs to
combat the questions about his depth. Moving already to put those
questions to rest, Bush sought out interviews recently to
demonstrate he is no tenderfoot in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to head it off before it does filter down,'' said
Mark McKinnon, Bush's media consultant. ``The danger is to let a
perception become a reality.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But politicians have to take care to not appear as if they are
cynically reinventing themselves. Gore became the butt of new jokes
last March when, stumping in Iowa, he played up his farming bona
fides, glossing over the reality that he was raised in a hotel in
Washington. Recalling his youthful summers at the family farm in
Tennessee, he said his father ``taught me how to clean out hog
waste with a shovel and a hose.''
</P>
<P>
   Such setbacks explain why McCain, fearful that the temper label
might stick, did not dare dispute that he has one. Instead, he
raised the issue head-on in a debate last month by asserting that
people sometimes mistake his passion on policy for a temper. The
remark was part of a spin offense that has helped stoke a debate
over whether a hothead in the Oval Office was such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by candidates to undo existing perceptions are not
entirely new. Ronald Reagan, in his debate with Jimmy Carter in
1980, uttered the world ``peace'' over and over to overcome his
image as a warmonger. In his debate with Walter F. Mondale four
years later, Reagan quieted whispers about his age by teasing
Mondale about his youth and inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   It does not always work. Quayle's debate with Gore in 1992
became a test of manhood: He had to prove he was sharp and deep,
not a shallow caricature. Quayle drew many laudatory reviews, but
in the end he probably didn't get as much credit as he deserved:
his image was already set in cement.
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, the Democratic strategist, argues that reporters
will instinctively seize upon actions that confirm existing
impressions of candidates. ``The press will always lead with a
confirmation of an existing doubt,'' he said. `` `McCain, in a
flash of temper,' or `Bush didn't know the capital of New
Hampshire.' If Bush muffs a question, it hurts him more than if
McCain does. The question would be: Is he smart enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Carville said, ``If Gore comes off as stiff and
patrician, it will hurt him more than if Bradley does.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gore might not mind being called stiff and patrician
these days, as long as it deflects attention from other more
damaging impressions linked to his well-known fund-raising event at
a Buddhist temple, his high praise for Clinton during the Lewinsky
scandal and his (inaccurate) boast that he invented the Internet _
all of which have contributed to an image of Gore as another garden
variety pol who will do or say anything to get elected.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to counter that perception with new commercials
that show him in a nonpolitical role and highlight his personal
history as a Vietnam veteran and reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Another remedy for politicians who worry that they are not
fairly portrayed in the media is to personally interact with lots
of voters, especially in small states like Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   After observing a more animated Gore at a town meeting last week
in Council Bluffs, Iowa, several Democrats said they were
unexpectedly impressed. ``I've always heard how stiff and wooden he
was,'' said Brad Miller, 40, a construction worker. ``But he had
some witticisms today that really surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore may have wowed one voter, Leno is a harder sell.
In his monologue the other night, he described an ``Al Gore doll''
that comes with ``no moving parts.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For weeks, the story line on Sen. John McCain of
Arizona has been that he has a big, bad temper. But here's a news
flash: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has one, too. Even Bush does
not dispute a description by the writer Richard Ben Cramer that he
is the ``Roman Candle'' of the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   The word on Bush, a graduate of Yale and the Harvard Business
School, is that he is a cutup who lacks the intellectual heft to be
president. But why doesn't anyone ever mention that McCain ranked
fifth from last in the Class of 1958 at the United States Naval
Academy? Or that, like Bush, he was known for preferring carousing
over cramming?
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore still cannot shake the impression that
his public presentation is awkward and wooden and that he sometimes
seems condescending. The truth is, Bill Bradley can be awkward and
wooden and sometimes  &UR; he &LR;  seems condescending.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley is trying to counter a perception that he
was aloof from his colleagues when he was a senator from New
Jersey, and that he was not particularly affable. But Gore was a
loner who made few friends in the Senate.

   Here are some of the things that airline flight attendants have
watched passengers lug on board: Mariachi hats, potted palms,
boogie boards, shopping bags brimming with canned hams, a live duck
in a cage, cases of wine, covered-dish casseroles, multi-tiered
wedding cakes, a three-foot-tall religious statue for lawn display,
an automobile transmission and a freshly severed buck's head with
its antlers poking out of a trash bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen an animal head myself, but it wouldn't surprise
me one bit,'' said Tim Carey, a flight attendant who, like many of
his colleagues, dreads the long Thanksgiving holiday travel season,
which peaks today, the year's busiest single day for air travel. By
Tuesday, nearly 20 million passengers, a record, will have flown
domestic airlines during the 12-day Thanksgiving holiday travel
period, according to the Air Transport Association.
</P>
<P>
   And they're carting a lot more stuff aboard than ever before.
Today, 6 out of 10 passengers haul a suitcase with them onto
flights. In 1992, only 2 out of 10 did, according a survey cited by
the Association of Flight Attendants, a union that represents about
46,000 of the more than 100,000 domestic flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants have always traded war stories about the
things passengers bring on board. But in the past few years, as
fully booked flights have become the norm and a proliferation of
carry-on bags have overwhelmed already tight storage space, the
situation has deteriorated from an annoyance into what flight
attendants say is a serious safety problem. In fact, it's their No.
1 workplace complaint _ and a significant cause of flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Airline employees sometimes suffer back and other injuries from
hoisting carry-on bags into storage compartments. Other injuries to
flight attendants and passengers are caused when bags fall from
overfilled storage bins. Furthermore, loose-cannon carry-on baggage
can block aisles and exits during emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   While lawn statues and animal-head trophies make for colorful
anecdotes back at the hotel, the real problem comes from everyday
bags and laptops. The flight attendants union is lobbying the
federal government to adopt an industrywide law that would limit
carry-on luggage to a single bag, weighing 13 pounds or less, whose
combined length, width and height must not exceed 45 inches.
Laptops, briefcases, purses and even diaper bags would count under
that rule, which would replace the current hodgepodge of unevenly
enforced policies at individual airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers _ especially frequent fliers _ generally dislike the
idea of restrictions. Consumer advocates say the airlines created
the problem by reducing storage space, cramming customers into
planes, reducing connection times between flights and allowing
checked-baggage service to deteriorate to the point where 1 out of
every 200 passengers reports lost or delayed baggage.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a touchy one in the fiercely competitive airline
industry. In the last year or two, most major carriers have imposed
stricter limits on both the number and size of carry-on baggage.
But airlines are loathe to alienate their frequent flyers _
especially business travelers, who are their most profitable
market. To the dismay of the flight attendants union, for example,
Continental Airlines refit 150 of its aircraft last year with
bigger overhead storage bins to accommodate more carry-ons.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants say it's actually a small percentage of
passengers who cause the biggest problems. Among them are
infrequent flyers, especially those bound for foreign countries to
visit relatives, who trudge on board with live chickens, baskets of
food and overflowing shopping bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``People bring on jugs of gasoline because it's cheaper to buy
it here,'' said Henri Simonetti, a longtime flight attendant who,
like Carey, did not want to identify the airline he works for.
``Not that they intend to pose a safety threat, but please _ you
can't imagine a worse safety threat that a volatile fuel seeping
from the overhead bin.''
</P>
<P>
   Such passengers tend to be reasonable when the rules are
explained, flight crew members say. More difficult to handle are
hardened business passengers unable to find space for their
carry-ons. These customers are often paying full fare, and
traveling on a tight schedule that is vulnerable to the slightest
delay and conducive to frayed tempers.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core business-trip routes are considered to be the worst.
``Los Angeles to New York can be a  &UR; very &LR;  difficult trip,''
Simonetti said. ``You'll hear: `I'm a member of your frequent flier
club. I'm on your airline five times a week. Therefore, I should be
able to bring my five pieces of carry-on luggage on board,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher J. Witkowski, the director of air safety and health
at the attendants union, said the only solution is a federal law to
reduce carry-on luggage by 50 percent and leave no wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got assaults that occur because passengers take out
their frustrations on the flight attendants,'' he said. ``People
are being injured and it's got to stop.''

</P>

</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-UNIONISTS (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Northern
Ireland's biggest Protestant party votes to back a deal opening the
way for Northern Ireland's first genuine power-sharing government
of Protestants and Roman Catholics. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ How Russia, taking a leaf from NATO's
playbook, is managing the flow of information in its latest war in
Chechnya. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-RUSSIA (Istanbul) _ While nearly all of Europe has
condemned the Russian government's military assault in Chechnya,
the Turkish government has remained silent, not wanting to leave
itself open to criticism of its own long war against Kurdish
separatists. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-REBEL (Sigli, Indonesia) _ Abdullah Syafie is waging a
guerrilla war against Indonesia. But who has time to fight when the
foreign news media keep dropping by? By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-SCANDAL (Jerusalem) _ Scandal, and lots of it, was what
occupied Israel's attention this week, so much so that one leading
newspaper saw fit to run a full-page scandal guide, with boxes for
every major affair, its suspects, its allegations and the status of
its investigation. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-CLERIC-SENTENCE (Undated) _ Iran's most powerful religious
court imposes a five-year jail term and a five-year banishment from
political activity on a Muslim cleric, Abdullah Nouri, who has won
widespread popular support with demands for an end to authoritarian
rule by the country's religious hierarchy. By John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-REV-MOON (Jardim, Brazil) _ The Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the
78-year-old founder of the Unification Church who has been rebuffed
by the United States and is facing financial troubles in his native
Korea, is seeking to reinvent himself in a sparsely populated
corner of Brazil that he calls ``a new Garden of Eden.'' By Larry
Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   With a map.
</P>
<P>
   WTO-MEETING (UNdated) _ Why the latest negotiations of the World

Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-WOMEN (Milwaukee) _ Exclusive. Caseworkers rarely ask
and clients rarely tell, but growing evidence suggests that
disproportionately large numbers of women on welfare were sexually
abused as children, a finding that offers new insight into many of
the so-called hard cases that are an increasing focus of the
national effort to overhaul the welfare system. By Jason DeParle.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   BIZ-SCHOOLS (Undated) _ Michael Hyatt gained admission to
Stanford's business school and prepared to enroll this fall. During
the summer, however, he took an eight-week job helping a friend who
worked at a small Internet company in Southern California, and when
it ended, Hyatt, 28, was hooked. So he called Stanford to say
thanks anyway: he wouldn't be showing up in Palo Alto after all. As
many of the nation's most talented young workers rush to stake that
claim, business school has suddenly lost some of its luster. That
has had a significant impact on applications to some top schools,
particularly those that tend to attract the entrepreneurially
minded. By David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-VALET-PARKING (Los Angeles) _ A look at the California
culture of parking. By Todd S. Purdum.

Spanish-language network delves into domestic violence, sex
addiction and other issues common to daytime programming. But

program is a Roman Catholic priest. By Mireya Navarro.

   WASHINGTON _ At first, the survey results seemed depressingly
familiar: Nearly two-thirds of those who responded said they had
had a racially offensive encounter with a colleague during the 12
previous months, and there was a wide disparity in how blacks and
whites saw the state of race relations.
</P>
<P>
   What is startling is the setting in which the answers occurred.
This was not Simi Valley, Calif., or Decatur, Ill., or even a
typical college campus. This was the military, which has been held
up as the paragon of racial integration, tolerance and equal
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are contained in a 265-page report issued last week
on how the nearly 1.4 million men and women in the armed forces
view the racial climate there. More than 40,000 enlisted men and
women and officers responded.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 percent of black members of the military _ a rate five
times higher than among whites _ said they believed they had
received a worse evaluation than they deserved because of their
race. And while only 17 percent of whites said the military was
paying ``too little attention'' to racism and discrimination in its
ranks, 38 percent of Hispanic military personnel and 62 percent of
blacks felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   This racial Rashomon is nothing new in the civilian world. From
the O.J. Simpson trial to opinions about the police to the need for
affirmative action, whites and minorities, especially blacks and
Hispanics, have seen things through such different lenses as to
make one wonder if they are on the same planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is going on and those incidents are being experienced
in an environment that we think is doing pretty well on race, it
gives you pause to wonder what might be happening on the factory
floor or in offices around the country,'' said Edwin Dorn, a former
under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the report's findings raise the question of whether any
institution can ever do enough to bridge racially divided
perceptions, or whether racial attitudes are so deep-seated that
nothing can root them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesson number one is that blacks will always see race
relations in a more pessimistic way than whites,'' said Charles
Moskos, a Northwestern University sociologist who has studied the
military. ``This cuts across gender and rank and is not likely to
change in the foreseeable future. But it also shows that blacks and
white do not have to hold identical views of the racial situation
in order to succeed together. That's why we don't care about
attitudes. We care about behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a notion would, no doubt, cause jitters among liberals
since many of their favored ideas, like producing minority role
models and diversity training, focus on influencing racial
attitudes rather than discriminatory behavior.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that the military, especially the Army,
is far and away the most racially integrated institution in
American society. Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American men
and women make up 32 percent of the armed forces, although as in
civilian society they are more heavily clustered at the bottom
ranks than at the top.
</P>
<P>
   In the Army, the military's largest branch, blacks make up
nearly one-quarter of the staff sergeants, master sergeants and
first sergeants. More than 15 percent of all military officers are
members of a minority group.
</P>
<P>
   As Moskos and John Sibley Butler, co-authors of ``All That We
Can Be: Black Leadership and Racial Integration the Army Way,''
(Twentieth Century Fund) point out, at some point in virtually
every white soldier's career, his or her boss will be black; this
is something that few, if any, other institutions in the country
can claim.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of racial integration has flowed into other
areas. Studies indicate that the most racially integrated cities in
the country _ places like Fayetteville, N.C., Lawton, Okla., and
Jacksonville, N.C. _ are military towns. The armed forces also
devote a tremendous amount of time and effort to promoting good
race relations and equal opportunity. Incoming military personnel
undergo intensive training in race relations Military units have a
race relations adviser to make sure things are going well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet widely different perceptions remain about the state of race
relations and the military's efforts to improve things. Such a
finding leads to questions over whether whites understate the
problem to shield themselves from guilt or the charge of racism and
minorities overstate it out of pressure not to be out of step with
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Cooper &AMP; Seacrest, an Alexandria, Va., polling
company, inquired into racial attitudes in Fayetteville, N.C. In
their survey, 53 percent of black respondents who were interviewed
individually by black questioners and told that their answers would
be confidential agreed with the statement that ``as a country we
focus too much on issues of race.''When African-Americans were
asked the same question in a focus group, nearly everyone
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   But before Pentagon officials take comfort in a notion that the
study merely reflects the grousing that normally goes on in the
ranks they should contemplate one other finding. About 85 percent
of white, Hispanic and Asian respondents, and 79 percent of blacks,
said they did not officially report a bothersome racial incident in
the previous 12 months. The leading cause was that they didn't
think anything would be done.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at such a finding, Pentagon officials might well recall
the words of the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Colin L. Powell, the most successful African-American ever in the
military. ``The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is
the day you have stopped leading them,'' Powell wrote. ``They have
either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded you do
not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.''

<P>
   Soon after EgyptAir Flight 990 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean,
the personal-injury lawyers at R. Jack Clapp and Associates
marshaled their resources and mobilized their forces.
</P>
<P>
   Faster than you can say class-action lawsuit, the Washington,
D.C., firm, which specializes in aviation disasters, launched
EgyptAir990.com _ a Web site that at first blush appears primarily
concerned with helping the bereaved deal with loss, but on closer
examination is all about financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   Such online opportunism hardly burnishes the flagging reputation
of lawyers, a profession so unpopular that even the reviled HMO
industry now feels at liberty to smack them around.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to head off legislation that would strip health
maintenance organizations of their immunity from patients'
lawsuits, an HMO advocacy group last month broadcast a TV
commercial that explicitly portrayed lawyers as sharks: ``America's
richest trial lawyers are circling _ and your health plan is the
bait: Call Congress today.''
</P>
<P>
   But now some lawyers and bar associations are biting back _

   South Carolina's bar association, for instance, convened a
series of town meetings this year so people could air gripes about
lawyers and the legal system. The upshot: legal triage clinics
where lawyers advise walk-in clients pro bono, and sensitivity
training for cranky court personnel. In Louisiana, the bar
association has produced ``Louisiana Lawyers: Enriching Louisiana
Life(C),'' a six-minute video starring earnest lawyers feeding the
homeless at a soup kitchen; empathetic lawyers strolling with AIDS
patients; and wise lawyers teaching kids about the legal
consequences of illicit drug use.

<P>
   ``A lot of people think all we do is sit at our desks and bill
time,'' noted Michael Ferachi, a civil litigator shown painting an
elderly neighbor's house. ``But this gives us a chance to show
people that were interested in caring for others that can't care
for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To recast lawyers as protectors rather than predators, other bar
associations have also gone the feel-good route. Cut to a classroom
brought to you in a TV spot sponsored by the Ohio bar:
</P>
<P>
   ``Class, what do your parents do for a living?'' inquires a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad protects people,'' volunteers one boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so he's a police officer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, his dad is like my mom,'' chimes in a little girl. ``She
helps sick and hurt people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so they're doctors?'' wonders the teacher. No, say the
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the exasperated teacher asks, ``So what do your parents
do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're lawyers!'' cry the tykes in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Mills, a cultural critic and author of ``The Triumph of
Meanness: America's War Against Its Better Self,'' says the public
relations blitz may be too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't change the shark image when the lawyers who make the
headlines have gotten huge divorce settlements, thwarted the
Justice Department or outfoxed a district attorney on a criminal
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sorry image of lawyers has been rounded out lately by tacky
late-night commercials for ambulance chasers; the legal lobby's
opposition to tort reform; and the one-two punch of the O.J.
Simpson trial and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And many lawyers cringe at the proliferation of obnoxious TV
judges past their prime (time), presiding over video kangaroo
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hollywood's portrayal of the profession isn't all bad. Paul
Levinson, a professor of communications at Fordham University,
believes that the popularity of TV dramas like ``Law and Order''
and ``The Practice'' has had the curious effect of both idealizing
the profession and pointing up its real-life deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   The committed, diligent TV lawyers on both shows deserve
admiration, he explains, but their decency may signal
disillusionment with actual lawyers. ``When doctors stopped making
house calls in the Sixties, `Marcus Welby' became a hit,'' Levinson
said. ``It fulfilled our wishes for an old-fashioned doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same holds true for the lawyers on `The Practice,' who are
utterly devoted to clients. We fervently wish we could fulfill
fantasies of such lawyers as knights in shining armor.''
</P>
<P>
   And now such yearnings have some lawyers looking to heal
themselves. Carl Bogus, a professor at Roger Williams University
Law School, who this year organized a soul-searching conference,
Lawyer Collaboration With Systems of Evil, argues that lawyers
needn't indulge litigious clients who file questionable suits.
Notable cases arguably include the coffee drinker who sued
McDonald's after scalding herself or, more recently, the parents of
the Columbine High School gunman who intend to target his school
district for not doing more to prevent his carnage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers used to say no to clients more often,'' Bogus
complained. ``Lawyers used to say, you may have a right to make
this argument but there's something offensive to making this
argument. Go get yourself another lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   But as for clients, they're pretty happy with the lawyers they
have _ suggesting the limits of a legal charm offensive in a system
that is by its nature adversarial and often cutthroat. A recent
survey by the American Bar Association, for example, found that 75
percent of people expressed satisfaction with their own lawyer's
performance, regardless of what they thought about the profession
in general. ``People think about lawyers like they think about
congressmen,'' said Stephen Gillers, Vice Dean of New York
University Law School. ``Lawyers are a bad group, but my lawyer is
real good.''

   Soon after EgyptAir Flight 990 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean,
the personal-injury lawyers at R. Jack Clapp and Associates
marshaled their resources and mobilized their forces.
</P>
<P>
   Faster than you can say class-action lawsuit, the Washington,
D.C., firm, which specializes in aviation disasters, launched
EgyptAir990.com _ a Web site that at first blush appears primarily
concerned with helping the bereaved deal with loss, but on closer
examination is all about financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   Such online opportunism hardly burnishes the flagging reputation
of lawyers, a profession so unpopular that even the reviled HMO
industry now feels at liberty to smack them around.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to head off legislation that would strip health
maintenance organizations of their immunity from patients'
lawsuits, an HMO advocacy group last month broadcast a TV
commercial that explicitly portrayed lawyers as sharks: ``America's
richest trial lawyers are circling _ and your health plan is the
bait: Call Congress today.''
</P>
<P>
   But now some lawyers and bar associations are biting back _
adopting a range of strategies to reverse the profession's slide in

SPORTS COLUMN: KITNA REMEMBERS BARCELONA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They were living across from the beach. One day, three
of the American football players decided, and quite admirably, hey,
we're playing for Barcelona, we ought to check out the big town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' said Jon Kitna, telling this story on himself. ``So we
took the train downtown, but there was nobody around. It was so
quiet, and everything was closed. By the time we figured out it was
siesta, we had to get back. It was a wasted trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna did go back often enough, maybe a dozen times in the four
months he was over there, to catch one of the world's great cities
in full blast. He made the most of his time in Spain, in every way.
He played quarterback in 10 games all over Europe in the spring of
1997, improving enough to qualify for the National Football League
the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback from the Barcelona Dragons now has the second
highest ranking in his conference for the Seattle Seahawks, who
have won eight of their first 10 games. The Seahawks play Tampa Bay
Sunday in terminally sodden Seattle, totally justifying the
existence of the dismal Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to going to Barcelona, Kitna has made a lot of other
adjustments in his life. While at tiny Central Washington
University, he gave up his carousing and sought out a spiritual
rebirth, and now, at 27, he is an exuberant but mature family man.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna was mature enough to handle the challenge of playing in a
continent where people are more attuned to low-scoring games in the
real futbol between Barcelona and Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   As a spring training league, NFL Europe is clearly paying
dividends. Ten percent of the players (that is, 176) on the
opening-day NFL rosters had played in Europe, including 20
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the quarterbacks playing significant time are Kurt Warner
of St. Louis, Scott Mitchell and Stoney Case of Baltimore and Damon
Huard of Miami. They all benefited from rules that are altered
slightly (no more than six players rushing at a time) ``to give the
offense an advantage,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't want to have a lot of 7-6 games over there,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The formerly tough kid from Tacoma made a stop in the
sophisticated Catalan city of Barcelona after throwing for 99
touchdowns, more than any quarterback in the history of the state,
albeit for a tiny NAIA school up in the outback.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna might have never made it to the NFL except that one of his
teammates, Jamie Christian, is a nephew of Dennis Erickson, who was
beginning what would be a four-year hitch with the Seahawks. The
nephew virtually forced the uncle to conduct a private workout for
Kitna, who earned a free-agent contract to the practice squad in
1996. After that, the Seahawks told Kitna about the Barcelona
Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't force me to go; I could see it was a good idea,''
said Kitna, who had given his wife some hard times in college, and
now that he had settled down, ``I did not want to be away from
Jennifer for four months.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna added: ``But then the coaches told me they were bringing
their wives, and they encouraged the players to bring their wives,
too. I went over first and then my wife joined me. Actually, she
was pregnant when she came over, but we didn't know it. She had her
test in Barcelona.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, so did Kitna, who was the most valuable player in the
38-24 victory over the Rhein Fire in the World Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to tell Jon Kitna that he has a great, great
future,'' blurted his Barcelona coach, Jack Bicknell, formerly of
Boston College, who had once coached another quarterback named Doug
Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna has great loyalty to Erickson for giving him a chance, but
he has prospered under Mike Holmgren, who came over with his two
Super Bowl rings from Green Bay. Holmgren said he might have
underestimated Kitna at first.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback is a long way from Barcelona. And, yes, Kitna
did get back downtown. He and Jennifer walked the Ramblas, the
picturesque boulevard of markets and snacks and chairs and flowers,
where crowds have been strolling for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were so nice to us,'' Kitna recalled. ``We didn't speak
much Spanish and they didn't speak much English, but they took care
of us. Our hotel was in Sitges, right across from the water. It was
great. I'd love to get back there soon.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be too soon. As anybody knows from following the two
most recent Summer Games, Atlanta is not exactly Barcelona.
However, Atlanta is where the Super Bowl happens to be this season.
Kitna would not mind making a detour before any sentimental
journeys back to Barcelona, this time not during siesta.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: RAISING AN OLD QUESTION ABOUT RACE AND IGNORING THE
REAL ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the late '80s, wired from having attended Knicks games, Tom
Brokaw would buttonhole colleagues at NBC News, an Ancient Mariner
with a burning modern question: Why were African-Americans
dominating basketball? He would not take environment for an answer,
and he eventually brushed aside both the cautious and the righteous
who warned him that even asking the question could be construed as
racist.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting 1989 documentary and panel discussion, ``Black
Athletes: Fact and Fiction,'' was variously criticized as timid,
racist, liberal and, most fairly, as inconclusive. That was the
short-term reaction. The long-term reaction was more telling. The
question was tabled. No one else wanted to push a stick into that
scorpion huddle.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw went on to write a current best-seller about heroic old
white men. But the documentary's producer, Jon Entine, has come
back after 10 years with a book to be published in January called
``Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to
Talk About It'' (Public Affairs). This consistently interesting,
readable, provocative, possibly wrongheaded book will, if it does
any good at all, help reignite public discussion on the fuzzy
definition of race, or it will disappear like a stone into the deep
well of denial.
</P>
<P>
   Entine's basic premise is that ``the scientific evidence for
black athletic superiority is overwhelming and in accord with what
we see on the playing field.'' Using tables and statistics, he
maintains that athletes who trace their ancestry to West Africa
have a biological advantage in sprinting and jumping because of
proportionately greater muscle mass and percentage of fast-twitch
muscles, a higher center of gravity, and more testosterone and
anaerobic enzymes.
</P>
<P>
   East Africans, who dominate in distance running, have larger
lung capacities, more slow-twitch muscles, a typically slighter
body profile and the ability to process oxygen more efficiently.
Whites, according to the scientists Entine quotes, fall physically
between East and West.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is startlingly new, and for many it is disturbingly
evocative of the so-called race science used by many societies to
dehumanize the ``other.''
</P>
<P>
   One indefatigable champion of the egalitarianism that grew out
of the Holocaust, World War II and the drive for human rights,
Richard Lapchick, founder of the Center for the Study of Sport in
Society, dismissed the 1989 NBC documentary at the time as
pseudoscientific prattle. Last week, he wearily dismissed Entine's
book by saying, ``Didn't we hear all this in Germany in 1936?''
</P>
<P>
   Another critic, Harry Edwards, the Berkeley sports sociologist,
has said that such scientific data was an ``underhanded way'' of
saying that blacks were ``closer to beast ... than they are to the
rest of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Entine, who seems up for a controversy, agreed in an interview
last week that ``there's a slippery slope out there but it's worth
risking because sports can offer such a clear way to frame some
important issues that affect all aspects of society.''
</P>
<P>
   He is hardly hard-core on nature over nurture, concluding that
the African biological edge is not great, but that it creates a
cultural advantage that becomes a biosocial ``feedback loop,''
nature and nurture fueling each other.
</P>
<P>
   Sports race science can be viewed as simultaneously silly and
dangerous. Even if valid, it would have no real purpose except to
give management another evaluating tool. Add the ancestry check. A
Nigerian grandmother? Put that runner in the sprints. What, his
father was a Kenyan? Make him a marathon man instead. Entine
writes, ``It's neither racist or a myth to say `white men can't
jump.''' OK. So what?
</P>
<P>
   Entine says the issue will be unavoidable once the human genome
project puts our biodiversity in our faces. Genetics is destiny.
But others see the discussion as a diversion; let us cure such
genetic diseases as Tay-Sachs and sickle cell anemia before we fund
a study about the color of the 100-meter dash. And, of course, as
Entine admits, it's divisive in bad hands.
</P>
<P>
   So let us get to the true issue, which is class, not race, and
the real problem in sports. Dump the geneticists and flood the
locker rooms with cultural anthropologists. The consistently
prophetic Edwards predicted 20 years ago that as more athletes from
the so-called underclass were recruited, the survivalist values
they brought from their dangerous streets would infect their games.
Their behavior patterns would influence their working- and
middle-class teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Since many athletes are black, comparing them on a class basis
should not be construed as racist. Fans have no problem
understanding that Michael Jordan, Ray Lucas and Lennox Lewis may
be in the same race, whatever that means, as Dennis Rodman,
Lawrence Phillips and Mike Tyson, but they were not in the same
socioeconomic class. And everybody knows what that means, even if
they say they do not, or claim that class does not exist in
America. Where do you think the sensibility that produced last
week's pro football epidemic of throat-slashing taunts came from?
The white suburbs or the inner city.?
</P>
<P>
   It has been 10 years since Brokaw asked about race; now it is
time for that hardy rock-climbing anchor to ask why bad behavior is
dominating sports. He is still going to Knicks games, so he is
still in play. Or maybe this question is just too taboo.

COMMENTARY: EGYPTAIR 990 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When EgyptAir Flight 990 went down I thought of writing a column
about the passenger list. I was struck by how many Americans, and
particularly American Jews, were on the flight, sitting alongside
33 elite Egyptian Army officers who had been training in the United
States, as well as a host of other nationalities. I thought back to
the first time I visited Cairo in 1972, when Egypt didn't even have
diplomatic relations with the United States, let alone American or
Jewish tourists. We forget, but for Americans, going to Egypt back
then was almost like visiting North Korea. So it seemed to me this
tragedy underscored how far Egyptian-American and Egyptian-Israeli
relations had actually come since those dark days. While this was
no balm for the victims' families, one hoped their common grief
might bind their countries even more.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Before I had a chance to put those words down on paper,
Egyptians and Americans were back to looking at each other through
their most encrusted, us-vs.-them stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   What triggered the downward spiral were leaks, based on the
cockpit voice recorder, suggesting that an EgyptAir co-pilot,
Gameel el-Batouty, may have deliberately disconnected the plane
from its autopilot and pitched it into a downward spiral, all the
time uttering the Arabic phrase ``tawakilt ala Allah'' _ literally
``I put my faith in God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tawakilt ala Allah'' is not the normal rallying cry of Islamic
extremists. Its standard usage is: ``OK, God. Stand by me now.'' No
matter. All that Americans needed to hear was that the co-pilot had
uttered the word ``Allah,'' and it triggered visions of a maniacal
suicide pilot. It is no surprise that Egyptians get upset at the
thought that Americans believe any Muslim prayer must be the
prelude to killing people.
</P>
<P>
   There was something else going on with Americans. After the
still-not-fully-explained crashes of the TWA and Swissair
jetliners, in nearly the same location that the EgyptAir jet went
down, there was an even more intense desire here to have a clear
explanation for the Flight 990 disaster. It is as if every traveler
was saying, ``Please God, not another unexplained crash.'' It's too
scary to think that our high technology has fatal flaws that we
can't find. So when the crazy co-pilot theory emerged, it was
seized on here with relish and relief.
</P>
<P>
   But Egyptian knees jerked just as quickly. The idea that an
EgyptAir jet or pilot might not have performed up to standard
triggered all the Egyptian insecurities that the world looks down
on Arabs as not quite mastering the Information Revolution.
Egyptian newspapers and pundits quickly slid into shameful
conspiracy theories _ claiming U.S. or Israeli plots to shoot down
the EgyptAir flight. I don't expect the Egyptian government to
control its press. But after 20 years of U.S. aid to Egypt,
approaching $40 billion, I would expect the Egyptian leadership to
be clearly and unambiguously educating the Egyptian public that
America is a friend, not an old, sinister imperialist. Where is the
official Egyptian denunciation of such conspiracy theories? Egypt
is too important and serious a country to resort to such fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   We need a timeout here, in which the U.S. government and the
Egyptian government each prepares its public to accept the idea
that its favored explanation might not be the one science
indicates. Americans may have to accept that there is no conclusive
proof that this was pilot error, suicide or mechanical error. It
may be just one more mysterious reason not to fly.
</P>
<P>
   And the Egyptian leadership needs to prepare its public for the
possibility that the overwhelming evidence may indicate this was a
suicide. It can't afford to let the dominant explanation in Egypt
become the notion that this crash was a U.S. or Israeli plot to
weaken Egypt. ``They have to rebut those arguments head on,'' notes
the University of Maryland Mideast scholar Shibley Telhami,
``otherwise how will Egypt be able to continue to pursue a
pro-American, pro-peace-with-Israel foreign policy?''
</P>
<P>
   I still believe the passenger list of EgyptAir 990 tells us
something good about how far Egyptian-American and even
Egyptian-Israeli relations have come in the last 25 years. But the
mistrust so easily triggered by the inquiry tells us we still have
a long way to go. So, one hopes we can agree quickly on what
happened to the dead in this crash, because there is a lot of work
to be done among the living.

<P>
   I can't remember what I was looking for; it was something easy
to find on the World Wide Web, a fact or a song lyric or a recipe.
The original search topic was quickly forgotten when the search
engine replied with a non sequitur: ``Altavista knows the answer to
this question: What is the meaning of life?''
</P>
<P>
   When had the search for Web sites turned into the search for
meaning? How many clicks away was the meaning of life? And what
else did Altavista know?
</P>
<P>
   I selected the answer. A message appeared: ``Unable to connect
to the site. The site is down, overloaded, or unreachable. Try
connecting again later.''
</P>
<P>
   Overloaded, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone had figured out the meaning of life and posted it
on the Web, and Altavista had found it for me. Maybe users had
generated the question. Surfers in the throes of inner questioning
could have asked it. Readers of the ``Hitchhikers' Guide to the
Galaxy'' could have asked it, remembering the supercomputer in the
book that spends years pondering the meaning of life and finally
says the answer is: 42.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Internet search sites served as helpful road maps. With
advances in artificial intelligence, one day they might be
brilliant secretaries. But today, they are in a state of
transition, slouching toward the human, growing more philosophical.
Mixing mechanical and personal elements, they have turned into
accidental wisefolk, spiritual advisers and drive-by
psychoanalysts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Renaissance, poets drew parallels between geographical
maps of newly discovered lands and the landscapes of the human body
and soul. Today, the newly discovered lands are virtual places
where users may seek themselves. A spiritual pilgrimage used to
mean having to leave the house, but with the Web getting more
metaphysical, seekers can pursue truth right at their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers began asking the major questions online five years ago,
when visionaries noticed the Web was a city built without a map and
launched Web directories like Yahoo and search engines like Lycos,
Infoseek and Altavista. In the beginning, the goal was clear: to
serve as tour guides in a foreign land.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines send a ``robot'' known as a ``spider'' or
``crawler'' to scan Web sites. The spider feeds data into an index.
Software then sorts and ranks indexed information. Yahoo uses human
indexing rather than mechanical indexing, with individuals mapping
out the territories of cyberspace. Such sites have spawned
imitators and ``metasearchers'' _ search engines that search other
search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Today more than 3,000 engines scan, search and ``spider'' other
sites, holding up virtual lanterns and giving directions, waiting
for the day they will have the technology to behave with real
intelligence. Meanwhile, they approximate intelligence and
sometimes end up sounding like a maddening cocktail party guest or
an idiot savant.
</P>
<P>
   Altavista has always had a stunning number of Web pages indexed
_ estimated today at more than 250 million. But that wasn't enough.
This spring, the folks behind the curtain decided that Altavista
should speak English. The Queen's English.
</P>
<P>
   Altavista had licensed the technology from the ``Ask Jeeves''
search engine (www.ask.com). That engine, of course, is modeled
after the ingenious, efficient butler from P.G. Wodehouse's
fiction, casting the user in the role of Bertie Wooster, the
cheerfully incompetent narrator who couldn't find socks already on
his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Users would type questions in English _ ``What is the highest
mountain in Uzbekistan?'' _ and Jeeves would answer or raise a
related question: ``Jeeves knows the answer to these questions:
`Where can I go mountain-climbing?'; `Where can I ski in Aspen?';
`What is Uzbekistan?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Jeeves came off like an infuriating salesperson,
trying to sell you sandals when you specifically asked for rain
boots; sometimes he would surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   The personalities of these engines were clear: Jeeves spoke
English, Altavista spoke full-text search indexing. Jeeves liked
questions, Altavista liked phrases in quotation marks. Jeeves
seemed like an aging, avuncular know-it-all, Altavista seemed like
the woman who keeps winning Double Jeopardy. Their
technology-sharing agreement made for strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is unnerving when Altavista claims to know things _
using the same sentences that Jeeves did, without a helpful smiling
cartoon to suggest personhood. But it is comforting to think the
answers to the big questions are just a click away.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site _ answers.com _ attempts to indulge this fantasy.
Instead of referring to other sites as search engines do,
answers.com gives answers right there _ to such questions as ``Does
extraterrestrial life exist?'' ``Where do babies come from?'' and
``Can you kiss your own elbow?''
</P>
<P>
   When answers.com launched, the site charged for individual
answers depending on the difficulty of the question, starting at
$1.79 for an easy answer, and up to $11.99 for custom research.
``What is the meaning of life?'' was the site's most popular
question in 1997 and cost $1.79.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that people want the answers to the big questions
but they don't want to pay for them. So the site now answers
questions for free, as developers prepare for a re-launch in
December, when answers.com will license its technology to other
companies, using the interface to help weed through frequently
asked questions on corporate Web sites. Individuals will still be
able to ask the pressing questions at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for the complimentary answer to the meaning of life,
answers.com replied, ``When you find out, let us know!'' One hopes
that the $1.79 answer had more substance.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the most popular question has been ``Why is the sky
blue?'' The site deals with the topic deftly. It also handles the
classic, ``If a tree fell in a forest, and no one was around to
hear it, would it make a sound?'' The answer explains how
physicists and philosophers can have different definitions of
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the oddest free answer offered to me came one autumn day
when Altavista performed a search on some dry academic question and
then added, ``Altavista knows the answer to this question: Am I in
love?''
</P>
<P>
   This question only raised more questions. Who was Altavista,
anyway? Ideally, the engine was a mind-reader able to give
different answers to each emotionally conflicted user. Or was
Altavista itself in love, and sure of it?
</P>
<P>
   And who wrote the question? Had the programmers anticipated that
it might be asked? Or was the engine spitting out a question that
had originated with a user? If so, who was this poor soul who
yearned for romantic advice from a computer?
</P>
<P>
   Computers have already created poetry and art. Futurists say
that one day supercomputers will know loneliness, lobby for legal
rights, and learn how to feel.
</P>
<P>
   But if we teach computers how to know and how to feel, can we
teach them to know how they feel? That's an entirely different
lesson, one that human beings can barely process themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If Altavista is in love _ and I imagine Jeeves wouldn't be right
for her anyway _ and if she really knew it, artificial intelligence
will have reached a new high.

COMMENTARY: TRUMP SHRUGGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greed is good, again.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Gekko's ``Wall Street'' homily and Ayn Rand's paeans to
selfishness are the manifestoes of our giddy materialism.
</P>
<P>
   As a young capitalist in Ms. Rand's novel ``Atlas Shrugged''
explained: ``When I die, I hope to go to heaven ... So I want to be
prepared to claim the greatest virtue of all _ that I was a man who
made money.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's not only Wall Street that is go-going; it's Main
Street. Everybody wants to spin that wheel and make a mil _ on TV,
on the Internet, on stocks and on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump is talking about ponying up $100 million to run for
president. So, in this season of giving some and getting more, I
asked the high-rolling plutocrat, spending the holiday weekend at
his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach, for a soliloquy on the
subject of greedisgood.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is not very different than the '80s,'' Trump says.
``In the '80s, people had limos. Now they have all-terrain
vehicles, which cost more than the limos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an anti-'80s feeling for a while, everyone cutting
back, but now the mood is `Let's just do it!' I just got back from
a golf course I built in Florida. It costs $300,000 to join. In the
'80s, there was no such thing. Rich people are handing me checks
like Godiva chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed is not good. The line played well in a movie. But a lot
of things play well in words _ like `All men are created equal' _
that sound magnificent and beautiful, but that doesn't necessarily
make them so. Greed is the bad part of success. And people have
wanted to be successful from the beginning of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My entire life, I've watched politicians bragging about how
poor they are, how they came from nothing, how poor their parents
and grandparents were. And I said to myself, if they can stay so
poor for so many generations, maybe this isn't the kind of person
we want to be electing to higher office. How smart can they be?
They're morons. There's a perception that voters like poverty. I
don't like poverty. Usually, there's a reason for poverty. Do you
want someone who gets to be president and that's literally the
highest paying job he's ever had?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need money to get beautiful women. All my life, I've
had friends who were successful and can't get a date, let alone a
date with a beautiful woman. I have watched men worth hundreds of
millions who have all the trappings _ a G-5 (Gulfstream jet), the
Fifth Avenue apartment, the Palm Beach estate _ and they cannot get
a date. They're sitting at home watching television. They're
brilliant all day long and at night, they don't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people who eat people alive for a living, come 7
o'clock, they see a girl who's a solid 5 _ not supermodels, 10s _
and they look at her in awe, but they develop lockjaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fixed up a very well-known powerful, rich man with a very
nice and very beautiful woman he'd been trying to meet for a year
and a half. She called me the following day and said, `Don't ever
do that to me again,' and an hour later he called me and said, `It
was unbelievable. Could you call her and arrange a second date?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, a woman can't make love to a G-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``People believe there's more glamour to being a very wealthy
person, but there really is a lot of work. Once, a very rich guy
calls me up and asks if I can get him reservations that night for
Le Cirque. He can't get in. So I got him in, and he calls the next
day and says: `You got me the best table. But how do you deal with
all that publicity?' Look, what's the point of being successful if
nobody knows who you are?
</P>
<P>
   ``This dot-com nonsense? I think a lot of it will go away. Maybe
it's all a mirage. It's pretty fragile. Every single IPO coming out
goes through the roof. I just don't see anything tangible. I like
to see and feel and touch something _ bricks, mortar.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend called me up the other day and talked about investing
in a dot-com that sells lobsters. Internet lobsters. Where will
this end? The next day he sent me a huge package of lobsters on
ice. How low can you stoop?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley would be bad for the economy. He's a Marxist. As far
as he's concerned, Communism is just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the market goes down, we'll all be cleansed and brought
back to reality. If I'm president, it won't happen for a long time.
If I'm not, it will happen immediately.''

SHE'S NOT THE FIRST LADY TO LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE BEHIND

 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House, with 132 rooms of grandeur and its
aura of power, has often seemed confining to the wives of the men
who lived there. Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking power that she did
not have to exercise through her husband, announced last week that
she was moving to an 11-room house in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is not the first president's wife to find the White
House stifling and to leave a husband rattling around in the
whitewashed old pile on Pennsylvania Avenue. Louisa Adams, wife of
John Quincy Adams, appears to have been the first, but not the
last, to refer to the White House as a gilded prison.
</P>
<P>
   Several presidential wives sought refuge from the burdens of
first ladyship, from the wretched heat of Washington summers, from
painful marriages. They fled to the seaside oasis of Oyster Bay,
N.Y., to family homes in Independence, Mo., and Hyde Park, N.Y., to
an artists' colony at Cornish, N.H., and a peanut farm in Plains,
Ga. They left the White House seeking solace, solitude or personal
fulfillment. Ellen Axson Wilson, Woodrow Wilson's first wife, went
away for months at a time to practice art in New Hampshire. Louisa
Adams spent summers apart from her husband because their
relationship had soured and she despised the political atmosphere
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these first ladies called a news conference to
announce a move out of the White House to live in another city.
Mrs. Clinton said Chappaqua, a suburb of New York, would be her
permanent residence as she campaigns for the Senate. She plans to
return to Washington ``from time to time,'' to attend to social
affairs such as state dinners and the New Year's Eve millennial
celebration. ``It does sound weird,'' said Carl Sferrazza Anthony,
an authority on first ladies, ``because it's unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is, at least in this sense: While all the others may have
felt personally hemmed in, even frustrated, by White House life,
Mrs. Clinton is the first to declare that she has a political life
distinct from her husband's, one that requires her to leave his
house.
</P>
<P>
   The job of first lady is nowhere defined in law or Constitution;
it has evolved over the years into a combination of national social
secretary and sometime presidential adviser. While some first
ladies, like Nancy Reagan, gloried in their hostess roles, others
discharged their duties sporadically, said Anthony, author of the
two-volume ``First Ladies'' (William Morrow and Company, 1990).
Jacqueline Kennedy spent dozens of weekends with her children at
country homes near Middleburg, Va., and commuted to Washington for
state functions; Bess Truman, who hated the White House and
decamped for her family home in Missouri every chance she got,
would often miss them altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Roosevelt used her fieldstone cottage, Val-Kill, on the
Roosevelt family estate in Hyde Park, and an apartment on
Washington Square in Manhattan as places to write her newspaper
columns and to socialize with her tight circle of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Truman, who referred to the White House as the ``Great
White Jail,'' left Washington as often as she could, according to a
biography written by her daughter, Margaret. She claimed she had to
return to Independence to care for her aging mother or look after
the family house, but ``these reasons were essentially
rationalizations for Bess' retreat from the White House, the
presidency, the whole rigamarole of playing first lady,'' Margaret
Truman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   What will become of this long-distance relationship between the
Clintons, two congenital pols, one at the dawn of an electoral

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House, with 132 rooms of grandeur and its
aura of power, has often seemed confining to the wives of the men
who lived there. Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking power that she did
not have to exercise through her husband, announced last week that
she was moving to an 11-room house in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is not the first president's wife to find the White
House stifling and to leave a husband rattling around in the
whitewashed old pile on Pennsylvania Avenue. Louisa Adams, wife of
John Quincy Adams, appears to have been the first, but not the
last, to refer to the White House as a gilded prison.
</P>
<P>
   Several presidential wives sought refuge from the burdens of
first ladyship, from the wretched heat of Washington summers, from
painful marriages. They fled to the seaside oasis of Oyster Bay,
N.Y., to family homes in Independence, Mo., and Hyde Park, N.Y., to
an artists' colony at Cornish, N.H., and a peanut farm in Plains,
Ga. They left the White House seeking solace, solitude or personal
fulfillment. Ellen Axson Wilson, Woodrow Wilson's first wife, went
away for months at a time to practice art in New Hampshire. Louisa
Adams spent summers apart from her husband because their
relationship had soured and she despised the political atmosphere
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these first ladies called a news conference to
announce a move out of the White House to live in another city.
Mrs. Clinton said Chappaqua, a suburb of New York, would be her
permanent residence as she campaigns for the Senate. She plans to
return to Washington ``from time to time,'' to attend to social
affairs such as state dinners and the New Year's Eve millennial
celebration. ``It does sound weird,'' said Carl Sferrazza Anthony,
an authority on first ladies, ``because it's unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is, at least in this sense: While all the others may have
felt personally hemmed in, even frustrated, by White House life,
Mrs. Clinton is the first to declare that she has a political life
distinct from her husband's, one that requires her to leave his
house.
</P>
<P>
   The job of first lady is nowhere defined in law or Constitution;
it has evolved over the years into a combination of national social
secretary and sometime presidential adviser. While some first
ladies, like Nancy Reagan, gloried in their hostess roles, others
discharged their duties sporadically, said Anthony, author of the
two-volume ``First Ladies'' (William Morrow and Company, 1990).
Jacqueline Kennedy spent dozens of weekends with her children at
country homes near Middleburg, Va., and commuted to Washington for
state functions; Bess Truman, who hated the White House and
decamped for her family home in Missouri every chance she got,
would often miss them altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Roosevelt used her fieldstone cottage, Val-Kill, on the
Roosevelt family estate in Hyde Park, and an apartment on
Washington Square in Manhattan as places to write her newspaper
columns and to socialize with her tight circle of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Truman, who referred to the White House as the ``Great
White Jail,'' left Washington as often as she could, according to a
biography written by her daughter, Margaret. She claimed she had to
return to Independence to care for her aging mother or look after
the family house, but ``these reasons were essentially
rationalizations for Bess' retreat from the White House, the
presidency, the whole rigamarole of playing first lady,'' Margaret
Truman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   What will become of this long-distance relationship between the
Clintons, two congenital pols, one at the dawn of an electoral
career, the other in its twilight?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people want answers right away,'' said Anthony. ``But
we don't have any idea how it's going to work, we don't know how
it's going to play out. It is just a unique circumstance.''

   STIMLJE, Kosovo _ Valerie Petignat Wright, a 33-year-old Swiss
official, is a symbol of all that is wrong and right with the
United Nations effort to run Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of 29 prefects appointed by the United Nations to run
Kosovo's municipalities and is in charge of the lives of more than
30,000 people around this battered town. She has intelligence,
verve and all the will in the world, but after more than two months
here, she has little money or staff to back up her titular
authority.
</P>
<P>
   In front of her office, the road that runs through town looks
like the surface of the moon _ cratered, pitted and
bone-shattering. It is constantly clogged with traffic, and Ms.
Wright would like to fix it. ``But there's no money,'' she said
darkly, hugging herself in the cold because the electricity is off
again. ``There's no money for anything.'' She sighed, then smiled.
``It's a bit of a strange status. Nothing is quite clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few yards away is the larger, warmer office of Ruzhdi
Jashari, 44, who was appointed mayor by the Kosovo Liberation Army
and its provisional government a day before NATO forces entered
Kosovo in June.
</P>
<P>
   Jashari, a kind of village ideologue, worked in education and
joined the guerrillas relatively early, and by October 1998 he was
in charge of public relations for civil order in areas that they
controlled. He spent the war in the mountains within a few miles of
here.
</P>
<P>
   He says he respects the United Nations and is happy to work with
Ms. Wright, but he makes it clear that he believes he exercises
what passes for official control here. He sits at the head of a
long conference table. He runs education and has people's respect
as a fighter, but he has no money to fix the road, either.
</P>
<P>
   The former Kosovo Liberation Army, which has supposedly
transformed itself into a civilian force with no military or police
responsibilities, is not the only challenge to the authority of the
U.N. Mission in Kosovo, known as Unmik; the mission is also
undermined by the international civilian agencies that are supposed
to serve it, and by the sheer size and resources of the NATO-led
force here _ 42,000 troops _ whose role tends to be defined only as
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian agencies have large organizations and budgets. They
rely on many of the same donor countries for their own financing as
the U.N. Mission here. And in many cases, they are struggling with
the mission and its director, Bernard Kouchner of France, over
responsibilities and even glory. Each of those other agencies has
its own massive office building in Pristina, its own vehicles, even
its own identity cards.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is in
charge of the return of the 850,000 refugees, their temporary
housing and their food. It coordinates the many aid agencies that
bustle (in so far as anyone bustles) around Stimlje. The European
Union is responsible for more permanent reconstruction, but all of
that, European bureaucrats have decided, will have to wait until
next year. And the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe is supposed to help build Kosovo's future society along
democratic lines. Effectively, that means training police and
judges, preparing elections, developing education, media and
human-rights programs.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and Kouchner have two tasks that are hard to
reconcile: while running Kosovo's civil administration until
self-governing institutions can be put in place, they are also
supposed to be in overall charge of everyone, including the
better-financed agencies that are planning those new institutions.

</P>
<P>
   This adds up to a lot of agencies competing with each other at
the expense of accomplishing tasks they might be dividing up more
efficiently. For example, the Europeans are emphasizing planning
for the future rather than fulfiling commitments to help address
housing needs, even as a hard winter sets in. And while the OSCE is
planning how to democratize a multi-thnic Kosovo, a more urgent
requirement might be to work harder now with the peacekeepers to
stem the wave of hatred, killings and arson designed to drive out
Kosovo's remaining Serbs and Gypsies, further poisoning chances for
real democracy.
</P>
<P>
   There is significant overlap and conflict. In particular,
officials of both organizations say, the head of the OSCE in
Kosovo, Daan Everts, has been working successfully to take control
from the United Nations over the key human-rights portfolio, the
job of media oversight and development, including the licensing and
running of new media outlets, and the election schedule.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Everts' success _ like the bureaucratic
infighting _ is not surprising. The United States and Britain
wanted the OSCE, an organization of more than 50 nations, to run
Kosovo, rather than the United Nations. The OSCE's members
represent the richest members of the United Nations, and the
organization easily has twice as many foreign officials here as
does Kouchner's office.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, as the United Nations begins to be blamed for
foreseeable problems of organization and inefficiency, its main
member governments, which have been slow to provide funds and
manpower, prefer to evade responsibility. And senior OSCE officials
are relieved to be responsible ``for the future'' rather than the
present morass.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright is one of Kouchner's volunteers. Trained in
psychology and women's studies, she had run an aid agency in
Guatemala giving vocational training to street children. She was
working on vocational training for the Swiss government when she
heard that ``people were wanted for Kosovo.'' She volunteered
without a job description.
</P>
<P>
   Now she finds herself the mayor and more for thousands of people
whose language she doesn't speak and whose history she is only
beginning to understand.
</P>
<P>
   While the NATO-led force known as KFOR patrols the center of
Stimlje, there are as yet no United Nations police because
governments have not yet met their manpower pledges. Nor is there
any fire brigade. Of the 2,000 Serbs in Stimlje last year, she
says, ``there are now 24 Serbs, and I know them all.'' They are
elderly and come from a few families, and KFOR is here to protect
them. A lot of her job is to mediate quarrels over vacant
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   She and an assistant from Cameroon, Gilbert Nantsa, are
preparing a local newsletter, to be published in English, Albanian
and Serbian. ``Well, there will be 24 copies in Serbian,'' Ms.
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multi-ethnicity isn't going to happen,'' she said bluntly.
``At best people will live side-by-side without killing each other.
They never really lived together before. Why should they start
now?'' The largest number of Serbs in her area, 180 of them, along
with some Gypsies, are actually in the mental hospital nearby,
which is run by the Norwegian Red Cross. She laughed ironically.
``It's the only multi-ethnic institution in the area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest problem? ``Money. It's supposed to be coming, but
with no funds it's hard to make a budget or have an impact. I can't
pay city workers, teachers or health-care workers.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Jashari meet every week, she said. Ms. Wright, a
problem-solver, will work with anyone who can help. She has noticed
that initial KLA hostility to the United Nations has ebbed lately,
in part because the former guerrillas understand that people's
frustration at the mess and inactivity hurts them too.
</P>
<P>
   Jashari pulls on a cigarette and says: ``We are facing a lot of
problems here.'' Some 15 percent of the Albanian population have
not yet returned from abroad, and some are bound to be dead, he
said. ``And the people who are back lack housing,'' he said. He
says there is a desperate need for personal documentation, identity
cards and passports. ``While we were ready to do a lot of things,
because of our respect for Unmik, we handicapped ourselves and
didn't do anything,'' he said with a straight face. So even the
KLA, which resisted U.N. authority, is blaming the United Nations
now.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright is amused, but in a somber way. ``Everyone is more or
less panicky, because nothing much has been done before the
winter,'' she said. ``The ex-fighters promised a lot but didn't
deliver. Of course, neither has Unmik.''

   NIRELAND-UNIONISTS (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Opening the way
for the immediate startup of a new power-sharing administration in
Northern Ireland, the Ulster Unionist Party voted Saturday to
approve having its leaders enter a new government with their
ancient rivals from Sinn Fein, the political ally of the Irish
Republican Army. The yes vote sets off a series of steps by the
British and Irish governments, beginning on Monday, to transfer
power from the British Parliament in London to the new Northern
Ireland Assembly in the Stormont parliament building in Belfast by
Thursday. By Warren Hoge.

   IRAN-CLERIC-SENTENCE (Undated) _ Iran's most powerful religious
court imposes a five-year jail term and a five-year banishment from

<P>
   BEIJING _ As a greeting, it seems peculiarly unsuited to the
themes of life in modern urban China. Imagine this: ``Comrade, do
you like Starbucks' &UR; 13 &LR;  caffe &UR; 14 &LR;  latte &UR; 15 &LR; ?'' Or this: ``Comrade,
how did you do on the GRE's &UR; 16 &LR; ?'' Or even this: ``Comrade, did
your stocks go up today?''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was perhaps no surprise that the latest edition of
China's dictionary of record, Cihai &UR; 17 &LR;  (The Sea of Words),
narrowed the definition of the word tongzhi &UR; 18 &LR;  _ or comrade _ out
of everyday life, concluding that it could no longer be regarded as
 &UR; the  &LR; greeting among China's citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1979 ``Sea of Words,'' ``comrade'' was ``a general form
of address among the citizens of our country.'' At the time,
comrade was China's universal salutation. In the 1989 revision of
the dictionary, ``comrade'' was ``a general form of address among
the citizens of socialist countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But the newest edition, published last month, drops all such
descriptions, noting: ``In the era of reform and opening up,
`comrade' is no longer the only form of address among ordinary
people. The Chinese words for Mister, Ma'am &UR; 19 &LR; , Master and Miss
have returned as terms of respect and cordiality.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is very rare to hear the word ``comrade'' today in
ordinary conversations; when it appears, it sounds like a blast
from the past, like those Little Red Books of Mao's sayings that
are sold as curiosities in street markets. Even among the Communist
elite, the term appears to be waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``For everyday use, I've basically stopped using the term,''
said Dong &UR; 20 &LR;  Yuyu &UR; 21 &LR; , a editor at the Communist Party-run
newspaper, Guangming &UR; 22 &LR;  Daily. ``But, of course, on official
documents and official meetings it's still employed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked when they were last referred to as ``comrade,'' many
people can only think of only one recent example: when they saw
President Jiang &UR; 23 &LR;  Zemin &UR; 24 &LR;  on TV last month, wearing a Mao suit
and addressing his countrymen to celebrate the 50th anniversary of
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinking sphere of the word has, of course, directly
paralleled the shrinking relevance of ideology to everyday life in
this still nominally Communist state.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was hard to find any ``tongzhi's' &UR; 18 &LR; ' around.
Bring up the word `comrade'' with young people and you are likely
to get a bemused smile, as if you were suggesting the use of an
ancient greeting like ``squire'' or ``goody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Comrade?'' said a 17-year-old with the surname Nie &UR; 25 &LR; . ``No
I've never thought of calling anyone that.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, the Communist Party has intermittently
struggled against the waning use of ``comrade,'' endeavoring to
insure at least its partial preservation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, in the wake of the crackdown on student pro-democracy
protests in Tiananmen Square, the Standing Committee of the
Politburo decried the emergence of terms like Mister and Miss,
saying that ``comrade'' was the best salutation for use among
ordinary people, according to one scholar. ``Miss'' was too
reminiscent of prostitutes in pre-revolutionary &UR; 26 &LR;  China, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, an essay in the People's Daily, the Communist
Party newspaper, said that ``comrade'' should be preserved as the
greeting at least among party members. And it bemoaned the fact the
some party members were addressing others with decidedly
un-socialist &UR; 27 &LR;  greetings, for example referring to their
immediate supervisors at work as the ``lao &UR; 28 &LR;  ban,'' or boss.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, usage has declined steadily, although there remains
a bit of a generational divide regarding the term. Older Chinese
still sometimes fall back on ``comrade'' to greet peers with good
Communist histories, and in formal situations at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In social situations I just use and Mrs., but at the
university we still use `comrade' for official documents or
meetings,'' said a senior philosophy professor and Communist Party
member.
</P>
<P>
   The word now translated as comrade originated some 2,200 years
ago in the early Qin &UR; 29 &LR;  Dynasty, when it was defined as pertaining
to people who have the same ethics and ideals. In the years before
the Communists took power in 1949, it took on a more modern cast:
The version of ``Sea of Words'' published in 1936, when
``tovarich' &UR; 30 &LR; ' was well established in Moscow, defined
``comrade'' as ``a mutual form of address among people with the
same ideological convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   It soon became the principal salutation of the rigidly
egalitarian Communist state, where even soldiers were forbidden
from acknowledging their rank, calling each other ``comrade.''
</P>
<P>
   How to address a friend or stranger is an issue that looms large
in China, where first names are rarely used and polite sentences
often start with a surname and an identifying salutation.
</P>
<P>
   And the gradual loss of the all-purpose ``comrade'' has created
something of a void, now filled by a large variety of options that
emphasize the stratification and many social distinctions of
today's China. Comrade Zhang &UR; 31 &LR;  of 1976 has become General Manager
Zhang &UR; 31 &LR; , or teacher Zhang &UR; 31 &LR; , or Miss Zhang &UR; 31 &LR;  or Classmate
Zhang &UR; 31 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't call people comrade,'' said Wang Bing, a salesman, who
was strolling on Beijing's Jian Guo &UR; 32 &LR;  Men Wai &UR; 33 &LR;  Street, under a
large array of billboards advertising Internet sites and computers.
``I call young girls Miss. And men I call Mister. Or other times I
use their titles, like Director or Manager. Why? Because everybody
does.''

 A MIDDLE EAST CHOICE: PEACE OR DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by
special arrangement only. Asian and European points: contact Karl
Horwitz 9  in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11;
FAX: 47-42-80-44). Latin American points: contact Olivia

 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the last several months, even as a final peace
between Israel and the Palestinians has come to seem more
plausible, a new element of uncertainty has been creeping into the
Middle East. The static pantheon of Arab leaders is beginning to
crumble, and generational change has started to sweep through the
region as aging and entrenched leaders give way to sons or
designate heirs. So these are anxious times, as iron men begin to
fade and courtiers plot their futures. Within five years, say
experts on the region, the current lineup of Arab leaders is likely
to be totally transformed.
</P>
<P>
   And so a new question has entered the calculations of those who
plan for peace or war in the region: Would democracies or
dictatorships make the best neighbors and partners in the emerging
peace with Israel?
</P>
<P>
   In the West, it is common to assume that the answer is simple:
democracies. But the Arab Middle East is a vast area where
Western-style democracy exists only in its infancy, if at all. Its
countries are riven with tribal, religious and ethnic fault lines,
and in many places extremes of wealth and poverty have left the
mass of people young, ill-educated and disaffected.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not a simple question whether opening the floodgates to
free expression of the tensions in these societies would provide
the quickest way to regional peace. These are places where
anti-Israeli sentiment is sometimes a passionate rallying cry for
all kinds of opposition groups, and where a monarch or dictator can
take a lead that a president who depends on consensus might not. On
the other hand, any regime maintained through repression risks,
over the years, lapsing into tyranny and instability, which are
among the worst of long-run risks to peace.
</P>
<P>
   So the question of how to think about balancing the goals of
democracy and peace is increasingly being wrestled with in
Washington as well as in Israel _ a democracy itself, but one that
has long made deals with whatever regimes would accept it, even as
it pointed out the absence of democracy in its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region is coming to the end of the postwar era, where
countries were ruled by a king or a military personality,'' said
Stephen P. Cohen, vice president of the center for Middle East
Studies in New York. But as the era ends, the style of rule is
unlikely to evolve much, he said. ``We're in a very sensitive time
concerning the self image of the Arab world. The idea that the
fundamentalist threat can only be controlled by hard military
rulers prevails.''
</P>
<P>
   One common thread runs through the process: the new leaders are
likely to emerge for reasons of bloodline rather than merit, and it
gives some analysts pause, no matter how pro-Western or pro-peace
these leaders are.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not being chosen for competence in modern
society but for loyalty and kinship,'' said Lisa Anderson, the dean
of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia
University. ``There is not a layer of technocrats who appear to be
poised to take the reins of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The two countries where change has occurred this year _ Jordan
and Morocco _ are monarchies that managed smooth transitions: King
Abdullah succeeded his father, King Hussein of Jordan, and
Mohammed &UR; 12 &LR;  VI succeeded his father, King Hassan &UR; 13 &LR;  of Morocco.
Both sons are in their 30s &UR; 14 &LR;  and have experienced life in Western
democracies: King Abdullah in Britain and America, King
Mohammed &UR; 12 &LR;  in France.
</P>
<P>
   Both of their fathers were partners of Israel in making peace,
and the sons both see the need for economic reform to alleviate
poverty. So they may turn out to be the most open and forward
leaning of the new rulers in the region. Jordan, notably, has an
active Parliament and its new king sees the peace with Israel as a
lynchpin &UR; 15 &LR;  for his country's future.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, by contrast, the dynastic impulse in a tightly run
dictatorship is literally impeding peace. President Hafez &UR; 16 &LR;  Assad
is so busy organizing the succession of his son Bashar &UR; 17 &LR; , who
faces challenges from other pretenders, that he has put any
negotiations for peace with Israel on hold. And a driving
motivation for the Israeli prime minister, Ehud &UR; 18 &LR;  Barak, as he
negotiates on final status issues with Yasser &UR; 19 &LR;  Arafat is the
belief that the ailing Palestinian leader may well be a more
reliable partner than anyone who might succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, the most immediate question is what will happen in
Syria, where Assad, who is from the minority Alawite &UR; 20 &LR;  tribe, has
fashioned the army, the Ba'ath &UR; 21 &LR;  party and other institutions
around fealty to him. Now 69, Assad is reported to be suffering
from memory loss. He looks haggard and is no longer able to sustain
the marathon negotiating sessions of the past, a recent American
visitor said.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has also resisted reform, and this will not help his
successor establish a peaceful transition. ``Assad knows if he
opens the door, the wind will carry him off,'' said Fouad
Ajami &UR; 22 &LR; , a scholar of the region. ``He doesn't want to be the
Gorbachev of Syria. I don't know if he can hold it together.''
</P>
<P>
   For two decades now, Egypt has played a pivotal position in the
Middle East's peacemaking, and Americans often identify with it as
if it were a like-minded democracy. In reality, despite the
trappings of elections and a parliament, the system is tightly
controlled by one party and the military; corruption is endemic, as
is tension over Islamic activism and the repression of it. A new
class of businessmen has emerged in recent years, providing an
elite interested in keeping the peace with Israel. But it is not
much interested in basic reforms, preferring to use state and crony
contacts to maintain its income, experts here say.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, President Hosni &UR; 23 &LR;  Mubarak &UR; 24 &LR; , who is 71, declared
that his son Gamal &UR; 25 &LR; , a banker, would not succeed him, drawing a
distinction between Egypt and its neighbors. But that doesn't mean
a democratic succession. Ajami &UR; 22 &LR;  thinks the army will designate a
successor if Mubarak &UR; 24 &LR;  dies in office, which has become the
standard way of giving up power in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson gives credit to Israeli leaders for placing value
on democracy as they think about their neighbors' futures, even as
they recognize that Israel is probably the last country that could
promote democracy in them. ``The Israelis are quite aware of the
dilemma they are in,'' she said. ``They think democracy is a good
thing but if they make it known, they run the risk of being a
political football in the domestic politics of these countries. So
there is a temptation to say: `Let's sign on with this person, even
if he's unpopular at home.'''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles A to Z, an encyclopedia of this city's
history and folkways published by the University of California
Press, lists ``automobile'' as ``a feature of the regional culture
so dominant as to defy brief description,'' and that seems a safe
understatement. Here in the region that perfected drive-through
banking, drive-in restaurants and drive-by shootings, people do
almost everything with their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, that is, except park them.
</P>
<P>
   By the millions, Southern Californians routinely leave that task
to others. In a city where the phrase ``service economy'' is taken
for granted, valet parking thrives, and not just at restaurants,
hotels and airports, where the service is increasingly popular
around the country. Here you can leave the keys with Jeeves at
hospitals and minimalls, movie theaters and grocery stores, the
occasional Starbucks and at least one gym, not to mention
practically every fancy private party for 20 people or more. The
Yellow Pages features 45 listings for Parking Attendant Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angelenos are lazy,'' said Chuck Pick, owner of Chuck's
Parking Service, who has been parking cars for 40 years and
provides valet service at special events for his third generation
of Hollywood society. ``No, not lazy,'' Pick quickly amended
himself. ``Service-oriented. But when I ever write a book, it's
going to be how people lose their feet and legs when they go to a
party. Suddenly, they can't walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have women call me up and say, `Oh, I need valets,' and I
say, `Can I ask you a question? Do you walk from Saks to Neiman's?'
And they say, `Sure,' and I say, `Well, why can't you walk across
the street?'''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there are so many cars in greater Los Angeles, and
so many neighborhood parking restrictions, that valet parking is
often the most efficient way to cram cars into a limited space.
This is, after all, a city that had more than one car for every two
residents as early as 1925, and where married couples still
invariably arrive at workday movies or restaurant dates in separate
cars, and where the affluent often provide separate station wagons
just for their nannies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have grown to accept and expect it,'' said Herb Citrin,
77, the chairman of Valet Parking Service. Citrin pioneered the
industry here beginning in 1946 when he opened the parking
concession at Lawry's Prime Rib in Beverly Hills, which he still
serves today, along with about 60 other restaurants and hotels like
the Regent Beverly Wilshire, plus the Burbank Airport. Citrin's
business has 1,600 employees, many of them recent Hispanic
immigrants, who earn an average of $6 to $7 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's a major, major necessity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, valet parking is so common that drivers of $70,000
luxury cars who would not entrust them to their own teen-agers
routinely hand them over to complete strangers, and sometimes
assume that restaurants offer the service, even if they do not. At
the Grill in Beverly Hills, the reigning power-lunch place for
agents and moguls, there is no valet stand at lunch, because
parking is so tight at that hour in Beverly Hills that it would
cost the restaurant too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every once in a while, we will have somebody who pulls up,
leaves their car running and goes in and eats lunch,'' said Bob
Spivak, one of the restaurant's founding partners and now president
of its parent company. ``And they come back two hours later and the
car's still sitting there, parked in the driveway with a ticket on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most restaurants charge about $3.50, plus tip, for valet
parking. On the other hand, even nonvalet parking in downtown
office towers can easily cost four to five times as much.
</P>
<P>
   In scores of places, though, valet parking is free for at least
two hours, as it is in several municipal and merchant-sponsored
lots in Beverly Hills. At the Century City Shopping Center, the
sort of place where Betsy Bloomingdale goes to the movies, valet
service is free with a $25 purchase of groceries at Gelson's, an
upscale supermarket. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center has valet service,
and so does the Commons at Calabassas, a giant mall in the suburban
San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always valet park at Macy's men's store,'' said Marcella
Benson, an office manager who was retrieving her gray Jaguar from
the valet stand at the cavernous Beverly Center mall in Los
Angeles, where valet parking is free with store validation. ``It's
convenient, they're trustworthy and no matter where you are in the
mall, you always know how to get back here.'' Besides, Ms. Benson
added: ``I'm all for putting out money. It's good for the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Sports Club/LA, perhaps the city's most luxurious gym,
about 400 of the 1,600 daily visitors use valet parking, at $2.50 a
car, twice the price for self-parking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really tried to coin the phrase of an urban country
club,'' said Phil Swain, vice president and director of operations
at the club, where a standard membership runs $1,250 for the
initiation fee and $130 a month in dues. ``It's a popular service,
and members develop relationships with the attendants the way they
do with their trainers. It really adds to that service aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Maureen Sullivan, a former shoe saleswoman to the stars
in Beverly Hills, had the idea of using aspiring actresses for an
all-female parking service, and now her Valettes Ltd., at $21 per
attendant per hour, is a fixture at private parties here. The
attendants dress in black jackets and pink tuxedo shirts and give a
single rose to each car at the end of an event.
</P>
<P>
   ``In L.A., the parking's just gotten worse and worse, especially
in the hills or the canyons,'' Ms. Sullivan said. ``I have a lot of
repeat business.''
</P>
<P>
   At Chuck's, whose attendants wear distinctive royal blue
jackets, Pick is gearing up for his busiest season: 200 parties in
the next two and a half weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nowhere else in the world that I could be making a
living as nice as this, doing what I do,'' said Pick, who began
parking cars at the old Romanoff's restaurant, a movie star haunt
in Beverly Hills, and has parked cars at events for every president
since Kennedy. ``We do it all, whether it's one man or 100,'' he
added. ``We go from birth to death. We did a bris last week and
we're doing two funerals this weekend.''

   Microsoft Faces Flurry Of Class-Action Suits
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's antitrust troubles are attracting a growing number
of class-action lawyers. Three long-time class-action lawyers filed
a suit on behalf of millions of computer users in California,
alleging that the users were overcharged for Microsoft's Windows
operating system. Those lawyers were soon followed by Stanley
Chesley, a longtime opponent of the tobacco industry who filed suit
in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The suits came in the wake of a federal judge's findings of fact
earlier this month in the Justice Department's case against
Microsoft. The judge concluded that Microsoft was a monopoly that
had harmed consumers. The class-action lawyers, however, must prove
their cases largely on their own, against a company with deep

   Iraq Cuts Oil Sales
</P>
<P>
   Iraq cut off the oil it is allowed to export in exchange for
food, medicine and other supplies, protesting a two-week stop-gap
extension of the U.N. Nations program, which is normally rolled
over for six months.
</P>
<P>
   The goods will continue to arrive, however, because many orders
were in the works when the Security Council deadlocked over whether
to alter the terms of the program, which allows President Saddam
Hussein to sell limited quantities of oil to mitigate the effects
of stringent international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council members hope to renew the program this week,
unchanged, for another six months.

   Colombia Extradites 2
</P>
<P>
   A Colombian accused of running a major heroin ring was sent from
Bogota to the United States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Orlando Lara, who is wanted in New York on federal drug
charges, became the first Colombian extradited to the United States
by his government in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, the Colombian government extradited another
major drug suspect to the United States. The suspect, Fernando Jose
Flores, is a Venezuelan who faces an indictment for shipping
cocaine to Florida on behalf of the Cali cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has hailed Colombia's decision to
resume the extraditions, even though it means more turmoil for the
South American nation. Colombian drug cartels have threatened
terrorist attacks if the extraditions continue.

   Ferry Disaster in China
</P>
<P>
   The ferry boat, with more than 300 passengers and crew on board,
set out from China's northeastern port of Yantai for the journey
north to Dalian. In a blinding snowstorm with high winds and waves,
the ferry somehow caught fire and the extreme conditions prevented
rescue ships from approaching.
</P>
<P>
   When the burning vessel began to sink, lifeboats were swamped
and most of the passengers who donned life jackets and jumped into
the icy waters perished.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 people were confirmed as surviving one of China's worst
ship disasters in decades, and the government immediately opened an
inquiry into the cause.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Economy Steams Ahead
</P>
<P>
   The government's latest snapshot of the nation's $8.9 trillion
economy revealed even more momentum than had been thought.
</P>
<P>
   With employment, incomes, consumer optimism and stock market
indexes all at or near peaks, the Commerce Department raised its
estimate of economic growth in the third quarter to an annual rate
of 5.5 percent, from 4.8. percent.
</P>
<P>
   That pace surpassed nearly all predictions. ``How can you not be
thankful?'' asked James Glassman, chief U.S. economist at Chase
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts warned that unless the growth slows sharply,
the Federal Reserve could feel compelled to raise interest rates
again and threaten the long-running expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic Abuse by Women
</P>
<P>
   Accepted wisdom among sociologists who study domestic abuse
holds that 95 percent of batterers are men. But in certain spots,
from Concord, N.H. to Boulder County, Colo., 25 percent or more of
recent arrests for domestic assault have been of women.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that the arrest rates are an unexpected
consequence of tougher laws and procedures introduced in recent
years mainly to help women by forcing police and courts to crack
down on brutal men.
</P>
<P>
   But the experts disagree on the root cause: many say most of the
women arrested are acting in self-defense. Others say women are
more violent in their homes than usually thought. All concur that
the phenomenon is complex and worth further study.
</P>
<P>
   Bad News for Boxing Group
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old International Boxing Federation, staggered by
the Nov. 4 indictment of its top officials for allegedly extorting
money from fighters for preferred rankings and shots at lucrative
championship bouts, received more bad news. The U.S. attorney for
New Jersey asked a federal judge to appoint a monitor to take over
the organization and its ranking functions.
</P>
<P>
   In making the request under the civil provisions of the
Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, prosecutors
labeled the boxing group a corrupt enterprise in need of immediate
reform.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, with headquarters in East Orange, N.J., is the
only one of the three sanctioning groups for boxing based in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   If the request is granted, the group would become the first
sports organization to come under federal court supervision amid
racketeering allegations.

   Microsoft Faces Flurry Of Class-Action Suits
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's antitrust troubles are attracting a growing number
of class-action lawyers. Three long-time class-action lawyers filed
a suit on behalf of millions of computer users in California,
alleging that the users were overcharged for Microsoft's Windows
operating system. Those lawyers were soon followed by Stanley
Chesley, a longtime opponent of the tobacco industry who filed suit
in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The suits came in the wake of a federal judge's findings of fact
earlier this month in the Justice Department's case against

<P>
   LONDON _ Before I moved to London, I took a deep breath and read
``Clarissa,'' Samuel Richardson's classic 18th-century novel about
the seduction and ruin of a virtuous young girl. From an
anthropological point of view, what is interesting about
``Clarissa'' is not only that it is more than one million words
long and that reading it demands a peculiarly British form of
stoicism, but also that it is an epistolary novel _ that is, it is
written entirely in the form of letters between its characters.
</P>
<P>
   This is a blizzard of letter-writing _ and at first I thought it
had to do with the habits of the British gentry during the
pre-technology era, or simply with a literary conceit that, while
unusual, is not unknown. (Laclos, of course, used it to great
effect in ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' another cautionary tale
about compromised virtue). But what I didn't realize is that, as
far as letter-writing goes, Britons might well still be living in
the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, my husband and I have carried on a
purely epistolary relationship with our neighbors, Sir and Lady
T----. (They really do have titles; he is a former tobacco
executive who was knighted, as far as I can tell, for the good job
he did in getting people to smoke). These are people with whom we
share a wall and a bit of sidewalk and with whom, in all this time,
we have had perhaps three actual conversations. If you count
``Hello,'' answered by ``Hello,'' as an actual conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But who needs to converse? The relationship, like any, has had
its ups and downs. When we moved in, we got a friendly letter
welcoming us to the neighborhood. When they planned to paint the
front of their house, they sent an apologetic letter alerting us.
</P>
<P>
   When we did some work on our house (having notified them, of
course, in writing), they sent an alarmed letter asking about, if I
remember correctly, the common dry wall and the potentially
creeping damp _ issues that apparently haunt the imaginations of
British homeowners. We replied, soothingly, by letter, and then
sent them a copy of the letter our surveyor sent us, and then they
sent us a letter. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps their conversational reserve had to do with latent
anti-Americanism, I thought. But that couldn't be all of it,
because my husband is as English as they come (although, alas,
without a title). The truth, as I found when I began to make
British friends, is that the British love to write letters.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I had lunch with an English friend. It was a
typical lunch in an inexpensive cafe. We discussed our husbands,
our jobs and our hair, as one does, and then split the check and
went happily on our ways.
</P>
<P>
   When the mail came the next day, I was shocked to discover that
she had sent me a note.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was a note thanking me for lunch. What's more, my
friend had apparently gone out and bought an expensive card with a
picture that would mean something specifically to me. She had
mailed it off that very afternoon, at a time of day when all I had
been thinking was: Should I eat this candy bar now, or later?
</P>
<P>
   The letter-writing threatens to get out of hand when it comes to
thank-you notes, as much a part of my life here as feeling
compelled to say, ``Sorry,'' instead of ``Excuse me,'' when someone
knocks into me on the tube. It's hard to keep up. Last year, I
celebrated my birthday with my husband and four other couples. All
the couples brought presents, but the dinner was at our house. So
what to do? Who should thank whom? Inevitably, we all thanked each
other. I sent out four letters, and received four letters. The only
person I didn't send a thank-you note to was my husband, but then
all he did was set the table.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he thought I was rude, anyway. He comes from a family
where, when you have lunch with your parents, your mother writes
you the next day to thank you for coming. Sometimes your father
thanks you in a separate letter. (You write them at the same time,
to thank them for having you). All the important family business is
conveyed by letter _ news of major illness, the first salvo in what
is going to be a drawn-out feud, or even bits of sisterly advice _
and then, in a way I have come to think of as quintessentially
English, it is never discussed face to face.
</P>
<P>
   This has been difficult to get used to. I know I have received
moving letters from my own mother _ most memorably, when the dog
died in 1980 _ but never a thank-you note. My brother and I
sometimes exchange e-mails. But at heart, we're a telephoning kind
of family.
</P>
<P>
   My husband's family is not partial to the telephone,
particularly in the older generation, whose habits are informed by
the shortages and deprivations of World War II. ``Happy Birthday,
darling,'' my mother-in-law once said to my answering machine in
New York, where her son was visiting, speaking as if noxious,
expensive gases were seeping out of the telephone. ``I'm calling
long distance so I have to hang up now.''
</P>
<P>
   Britons can afford to like the mail; they have a first-rate
postal service.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattanites like me are used to a mail service where the
couriers are stayed from the swift completion of their appointed
rounds not by rain or sleet, but by the apparently overwhelming
task of transporting a letter 20 city blocks. Here, 92 percent of
first-class letters _ which are expensive, at 42 cents _ arrive the
day after they are mailed, no matter where in the country they're
going.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does e-mail appear to have yet replaced snail mail. Ten
years ago, the Royal Mail handled 53 million pieces of first- and
second-class mail every day. Today, this has increased to 77
million pieces of mail, with ``social mail'' _ that is, for
non-business purposes _ holding steady at 20 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Mail takes great offense at suggestions that its
service is not exemplary. It was not amused, for instance, at
recent newspaper reports describing how a postcard saying, ``We
have arrived safely and are having a lovely time'' turned up at its
destination some 75 years after it had been sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most irritating things that come up in my
job,'' said Patrick O'Neill, a Royal Mail spokesman, saying that in
most of these cases, the piece of mail in question was never lost,
but had turned up at a yard sale of ancient items and then
re-mailed as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what the postal service would do back home. But
here where the fate of the letter is paramount, the outdated card
was duly delivered. ``We have a legal obligation to deliver any
letter that is put in the mail, even if it doesn't have the right
postage,'' O'Neill said.

 MILWAUKEE: or drugs.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In single-parent families, they are also more likely to be
around unrelated men (like their mothers' boyfriends), increasing
the pool of potential abusers. And they have one fewer parent to
protect them from risks of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   Abused children, in turn, are more likely to have problems that
could lead them to welfare as adults. Sexually abused girls, for
instance, are more likely to become teen-age mothers. Teen-age
mothers are more likely to drop out of school. Dropouts, in turn,
face reduced job prospects.
</P>
<P>
   And once on welfare, those whose abuse has caused other problems
that researchers call common _ like addiction, depression or
relationships with violent men _ have a harder time leaving the
rolls through stable jobs or marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Many, if not most, victims of abuse avoid this downward spiral,
recovering to lead productive and fulfilling lives. But sexually
abused children who are also poor face compounded risks, because
they often have other, unrelated problems and fewer people to help
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child from a deprived background is more likely to
experience a lasting impact,'' said David Finkelhor, a sociologist
at the University of New Hampshire and a leading authority on child
sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, six surveys of welfare recipients have
produced estimates of sexual abuse that are both diverse and
strikingly high. In Paterson, N.J., 24 percent of the recipients
surveyed said they were sexually abused as children. The figure was
25 percent in Michigan, 28 percent in Chicago, 38 percent in
Washington state, 41 percent in Utah and 42 percent in Worcester,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to make a precise comparison with the general
population, because estimates about the extent of the problem there
also vary widely. In 1994, Finkelhor reviewed 19 studies of the
general population. Of them, the median study estimated that 18
percent of female adults had been sexually abused as children.
</P>
<P>
   Finkelhor said most experts now accepted a slightly higher
estimate for the general population, from 20 percent to 25 percent.
By contrast, the median figure in the welfare studies was 33
percent.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the cleanest comparison comes from the University of
Michigan, where researchers in 1997 asked welfare recipients the
same questions used in a national study, the National Co-Morbidity
Survey. In the national survey 12 percent of adult women said they
were sexually abused as children. When the same question was put to
753 welfare recipients, the figure climbed to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While children are famously resilient, the anodyne phrase
``sexual abuse'' does not fully convey the mix of fear and betrayal
an abused girl may feel, especially because the abuser is typically
someone she knows and should be able to trust _ a cousin, an uncle,
her mother's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can think of that so betrays the experience
of safety and care and relationship,'' said Peter Fraenkel, a
clinical psychologist at City College of New York: `` `The very
person who was supposed to protect me, betrayed me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Children whose parents support them heal quickest, he said. But
when the victim's mother sides with the abuser, he said, ``you're
talking about multiple trauma.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Inside the welfare office, few women present symptoms as
striking as that of Ms. Angelou, who became mute after her rape.
Indeed, Bill Curcio spent 20 years as a caseworker in Paterson
without suspecting that abuse was a problem. ``No one revealed it
to me _ ever,'' he said. But when he began teaching an eight-week
course to prepare women for the workplace, the subject arose
constantly. ``I didn't realize how much of it there was _ rape,
sexual abuse, molestation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, at YW Works, a private agency that helps run the
Milwaukee welfare program, clients almost never discuss abuse with
their main caseworker. (Those caseworkers rarely have social work
degrees, and their function is more administrative, enrolling
clients in work programs and checking their participation.) But
Anne Paczesny, who recently left her job as a therapist at YW
Works, said that as many as half the clients referred to her for
other problems had raised the issue of sexual abuse. ``They're
seeking help for alcoholism, or domestic violence or just painfully
low self-esteem,'' she said. ``You'd be surprised how many
implications it has.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Meta House, a drug treatment center in Milwaukee, 85 percent
of the women who are residents say they were sexually abused. ``My
experience with the welfare agencies is they're just getting to
these issues now,'' said Francine Feinberg, the center's director.
``Quite frankly, I don't think they were prepared for this.''
</P>
<P>
   First impressions of Mary Rhoden yield no hint of her difficult
past. Her easy charm led a boyfriend to call her ``the
happy-go-luckiest girl in the world.'' If the Academy of Excellence
awarded grades, she would have graduated Phi Beta Kappa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent student!'' her instructors wrote. ``Very positive
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhoden says that just shows how little the system knows her.
``I'm just as paranoid as I-don't-know-what,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhoden has spent decades rebelling against anyone in
authority _ the relative who molested her, the employers who hired
her and the social workers who have offered to help. She is raising
five children on an ever-shifting mixture of boyfriends, welfare
and jobs. But the underlying pattern persists: conflict, defiance
and flight. ``I don't take no bull off of nobody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother and stepfather were migrant farm workers who settled
in Milwaukee. Between them there were 11 children in the house.
They both liked to drink. Relatives came and went, and about the
time Ms. Rhoden was starting school, one began grabbing her between
her legs and threatening to hurt her if she told. Eventually she
did tell, she said, but her mother shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd say, `He probably didn't mean nothing like that,''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be like, `Whatever _ everybody around here is whacked!'''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Ms. Rhoden and her sisters slept together, huddled
for protection. She fled at 13, and spent months on the street
before entering foster care. At 17, she tried to kill herself with
an overdose of Valium, and she still alternates between troughs of
shame and outbursts of anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You blame yourself,'' she said. ``I felt like I should have
spoken out more.''

 MILWAUKEE: out more.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking out is now a habit, and her defiant streak brings
chronic conflicts on the job. She was fired as a counselor in a
program for teen-agers after quarreling with her supervisor. (``Me
and her got into a confrontation.'') She walked off a job as a
hotel maid because she disliked the boss. (``I told him where to
go.'') She left a clerical job because she resented others making
more than she did. (``I'm like, `Forget you.' It wasn't a good
attitude to have, but that's me for you.'')
</P>
<P>
   A second troubling legacy of the abuse is her relationships with
men. Though Ms. Rhoden began her life fleeing one violent man, she
has been repeatedly drawn to others. Psychologists call this a
common pattern among survivors of abuse, one less contradictory
than it may seem.
</P>
<P>
   Their self-image shattered, some are not subconsciously
convinced that they are worthy of protection. Others, knowing only
violence, miss the danger signs. Still others may be searching for
what Fraenkel, the New York psychologist, calls a ``corrective
emotional experience,'' in which the woman re-creates a similar
relationship, hoping to impose a happier ending.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhoden offers parallel explanations: a need for money and a
desire to feel loved. ``I've been looking for love in all the wrong
places, like the song says,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager she married a man still in prison for armed
robbery. Then broke, bruised and lonely after her marriage failed,
she moved in with another ex-convict. He told her he had done
something he ought to explain, but Ms. Rhoden never asked for
details. ``I trusted him enough to know it was nothing that would
be detrimental to me and my kids,'' she said. Still, hearing him
walk through the house at night she would race to the room where
her four young daughters slept, wanting assurance that they had not
been touched. Court records disclose what he never explained: He
had raped a woman at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of weird,'' Ms. Rhoden said, quietly mulling the
news. ``You think you know somebody and you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The abuse, the depression, the troubled men _ the real issues in
Ms. Rhoden's life remained hidden from the welfare office. From
behind their desks, her caseworkers encountered a puzzle: a
talented yet uncooperative woman, charming then suddenly hostile.
``I think the lady has a lot of potential,'' said Hortensia
Sanchez, her most recent caseworker, ``but to tell you the truth, I
couldn't tell you what her barriers and her issues are. We didn't
get that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhoden certainly did not make things easy. Faced with
Wisconsin's work rules, which require every recipient to join a
work program, she appeared just often enough to continue a trickle
of cash, while her boyfriend paid the bills. ``I'm not going to lie
to you _ I used to play the system,'' she said. Over the last year
alone, her absences cost her $3,700, about half her welfare income.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such penalties are intended to imbue a work ethic. In
Ms. Rhoden's case, they seemed to reinforce a boyfriend ethic,
keeping her tied to a fraying relationship that was erupting in
constant quarrels.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last spring her boyfriend went back to jail for failing to keep
in touch with his probation officer, and Ms. Rhoden has been back
on the run. She got a job that closed her welfare case. She lost
the job and was evicted. She got another job, as a hotel clerk,
though she is once more complaining about the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Needing money, she also got another boyfriend, with another
violent past _ including an arrest for attempted murder and
convictions for beating a girlfriend and selling drugs. (In a
recent interview, he said the attempted-murder charge was dropped
when the victim failed to testify. But he acknowledged stabbing him
during a quarrel, saying, ``I pulled out my knife and went to work
on him.'')
</P>
<P>
   Their house is crowded, uncomfortably so. Hearing footsteps in
the night not long ago, Ms. Rhoden once again raced to her
daughters' room.
</P>
<P>
   All was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real nice guy, don't get me wrong,'' she said. ``I just
don't want my daughters to grow up someday and say, `You put us in
the position for something to happen.' I don't want to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Rhoden answered her abuse by fleeing to the streets,
Tanya Moore took flight in a different direction, hiding behind
walls of hostility and depression that she is just beginning to
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to be so negative all the time,'' Ms. Moore said,
``but I usually am.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface they are utterly different people. Ms. Rhoden
skates by on surface charm; Ms. Moore hunkers down behind glares.
Ms. Rhoden seeks solace in constant companions; Ms. Moore isolates
herself. While Ms. Rhoden left school in the ninth-grade, Ms. Moore
finished nearly three years of college, at the University of
Wisconsin at Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   But if the details differ, the resulting instability has been
the same. Like Ms. Rhoden, Ms. Moore has collided with virtually
all her employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time trusting people, particularly authority
figures,'' she said. And like Ms. Rhoden, she never considered
telling her caseworker the real story behind her journey to
welfare. ``I felt so uncomfortable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhoden disclosed the abuse to a reporter the first day they
met. But Ms. Moore waited many months, raising the issue only after
attending a rally of women victimized by violence. She said the
presence of hundreds of other ``everyday people, like you see in
the streets, made me think, OK, I'm not the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   While she was not raised in poverty, her family had other
problems. Her stepfather drank, and Ms. Moore has been periodically
estranged from both her mother and her father. The incidents of
abuse were episodic, not chronic like Ms. Rhoden's, and Ms. Moore
said they were not the only source of her depression. But inside
her family her struggles are greeted with little sympathy.

 MILWAUKEE: little sympathy.

</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody did something to you, forgive them,'' her mother
said in a recent interview. ``Go and get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough of sorts began in college, with a friend who
recognized familiar signs of isolation and distrust. ``That was my
first thought _ childhood sexual abuse,'' said the friend, Stephany
Johnson, who was in counseling herself for depression that began
when she was raped at age 11. Though Ms. Moore had spent years
fantasizing about cutting her wrists, her friend's matter-of-fact
observation _ ``You're depressed'' _ left her stunned. ``I would
sleep all day, but I didn't know I was depressed,'' she said. She
briefly sought counseling but abandoned it, as she has on
subsequent occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to control her depression with medication or counseling,
Ms. Moore left college three years ago and returned to Milwaukee,
where her life entered a downward spiral. She raced through a
half-dozen low-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   She had a romance with a co-worker and became pregnant. Last
year, she moved into a home for single mothers run by Catholic
nuns, gave birth to a daughter and went on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In statistical terms, like Ms. Rhoden, she would be counted a
welfare success. Refusing to join the work program _ ``working for
a welfare check was just too insulting'' _ she found a part-time
job on her own, as a clerk in a program intended to slow the spread
of AIDS. But she remains poor (she earns $200 a week), depressed
and constantly buffeted by feelings of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, she was applauding the nuns' social
conscience. Then they quarreled, the nuns asked her to leave, and
she now calls them ``money hungry'' and ``racist.'' Just a few
weeks ago, Ms. Moore lauded her job for valuing ``my intelligence
and my ideas.'' Then a manager she admired was dismissed and she
decided, ``I don't have a future there.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former psychology major, she knows she needs help. After
attending the rally, she called her Medicaid health plan and made a
new counseling appointment. ``It's something I've got to deal with,
though I really don't want to,'' she said. ``It's just too
painful.''

   ABOUT THIS SERIES:
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's welfare rolls down 47 percent, President
Clinton, as well as his Republican critics, count the landmark 1996
welfare law as the cornerstone of their respective legacies. That
law replaced a 60-year-old cash safety net with a program of time
limits and work requirements.
</P>
<P>
   No place has come closer than Wisconsin to the goal of ``ending
welfare.'' A decade ago, 100,000 Wisconsin families relied on
public aid. Now 7,600 do.
</P>
<P>
   The changes taking place in the state, particularly in its
largest city, Milwaukee, continue to reverberate in broad and
unpredictable ways. Throughout the year, The New York Times is
returning to Milwaukee to plot the pattern of change.
</P>
<P>
   The articles and related coverage of welfare issues are

   Quiz time: Which of these football infractions carries with it
the biggest penalty: a) a defensive lineman driving his helmet into
a quarterback's chin, resulting in a concussion, b) a special-teams
player blocking low and blowing out an opponent's knee, sidelining
him for the rest of the season, or c) a wide receiver making a
throat-slashing gesture after he scores a touchdown?
</P>
<P>
   Give up? It's a trick question. In the National Football
League's standard of justice, these offenses all merit equal
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the NFL informed its teams that the new vogue in
celebration after scoring _ players have begun drawing a finger
across their throats, ``Sleepy Hollow'' style _ would henceforth be
flagged with a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and the
possibility of a fine. In a memo, George Young, a league vice
president, said the gesture ``appears to depict an unacceptable act
of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue had simmered early in the season, amid whispers that
the gesture was gang related. But it reached critical mass shortly
after the New York Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson did it this
month on Monday Night Football, and a Boston radio station dubbed
it the ``O.J.''
</P>
<P>
   In a league in which actual violence, from concussions to
fractures, is an integral part of the game, the NFL's sensitivity
on this subject strikes some observers as curious. ``I personally
think it's an overreaction on the part of the league,'' says
Michael Lev, senior editor at Pro Football Weekly. ``The NFL should
have greater concerns than how players celebrate a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Discouraging violence with such bans is one thing, but the NFL's
style police have a long history of clamping down on
extracurricular matters. In 1997, pro football's powers-that-be
passed the so-called Emmitt Smith rule, which imposed that same
15-yard penalty for removing a helmet on the field _ effectively
eliminating the face-in-the-camera TD celebration originated by the
Dallas Cowboys' star running back. In seasons past the league
banned ``sack dances'' after the quarterback is tackled, and
``excessive celebration,'' which put the kibosh on choreographed
end-zone rituals like the Ickey Shuffle, named for the Cincinnati
Bengals running back Ickey Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The league's rule book also includes a lengthy section
addressing uniform issues, covering everything from the kind of
towel a quarterback can use, to how a player must wear his socks.
Last season, Minnesota's John Randle was fined a total of $15,000
for wearing too much eye black on two separate occasions, while
last year San Diego cornerback Rodney Harrison was fined $7,500 for
leaving his knees uncovered during a game. (By comparison, Denver's
Bill Romanowski was fined the same amount for spitting on J.J.
Stokes of the 49ers.)
</P>
<P>
   What's the NFL's hidden agenda in keeping its players on such a
tight leash? ome have discerned a racial thread, noting that the
majority of the running backs and receivers who score touchdowns,
and thus are affected by the no-celebration rules, are black.
Others see the issue in economic terms. ``They have a product to
promote and want to market it in an attractive way,'' says Andrew
Zimbalist, an expert on sports economics at Smith College. ``Some
fans think it's obnoxious _ and there might be some racism in that
_ but the NFL doesn't want to turn white fans off.''
</P>
<P>
   In a league in which careers are short, the team salary limit
forces players to move from team to team and only the biggest stars
have guaranteed contracts, the NFL finds it is better for business
to build allegiance to the uniform rather than to individual
players. ``They want players to look the same, to act the same and
be robotic,'' says Lev. Is it any wonder that Tampa Bay's Warren
Sapp calls it the No Fun League?
</P>
<P>
   So as the league's skill position players wonder what they  &UR; can &LR; 
do in the end zone, they might try thinking like an NFL owner.
Perhaps the next time Keyshawn Johnson crosses the goal line he'll
spike the ball, smile through his face mask and trace a dollar sign
on his chest.

addressing uniform issues, covering everything from the kind of
towel a quarterback can use, to how a player must wear his socks.
Last season, Minnesota's John Randle was fined a total of $15,000
for wearing too much eye black on two separate occasions, while
last year San Diego cornerback Rodney Harrison was fined $7,500 for
leaving his knees uncovered during a game. (By comparison, Denver's
Bill Romanowski was fined the same amount for spitting on J.J.
Stokes of the 49ers.)
</P>
<P>
   What's the NFL's hidden agenda in keeping its players on such a
tight leash? ome have discerned a racial thread, noting that the
majority of the running backs and receivers who score touchdowns,
and thus are affected by the no-celebration rules, are black.
Others see the issue in economic terms. ``They have a product to
promote and want to market it in an attractive way,'' says Andrew
Zimbalist, an expert on sports economics at Smith College. ``Some
fans think it's obnoxious _ and there might be some racism in that
_ but the NFL doesn't want to turn white fans off.''
</P>
<P>
   In a league in which careers are short, the team salary limit
forces players to move from team to team and only the biggest stars
have guaranteed contracts, the NFL finds it is better for business
to build allegiance to the uniform rather than to individual
players. ``They want players to look the same, to act the same and
be robotic,'' says Lev. Is it any wonder that Tampa Bay's Warren
Sapp calls it the No Fun League?
</P>
<P>
   So as the league's skill position players wonder what they  &UR; can &LR; 
do in the end zone, they might try thinking like an NFL owner.
Perhaps the next time Keyshawn Johnson crosses the goal line he'll
spike the ball, smile through his face mask and trace a dollar sign
on his chest.

FOR U.S., BRADLEY FAVORS AN INTERNATIONALIST PATH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Iowa)   (jw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his first major campaign event on foreign
policy, former Sen. Bill Bradley will use a meeting with students
this Monday to cast himself as a committed internationalist who
believes that America's vital interests abroad can best be advanced
through the free flow of goods, capital and ideas across national
boundaries, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who is running for the Democratic presidential
nomination, will also argue during an appearance at the Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Boston that the
Pentagon budget should not be increased above current levels and
that military spending should be redirected toward fighting new
threats, including terrorism, biological warfare and nuclear
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   And echoing one of his longstanding criticisms of the Clinton
administration, Bradley will contend that American policies toward
Russia have failed to stem corruption, political instability and
economic decay there. Vice President Al Gore, who is Bradley's lone
Democratic rival, has played a central role in overseeing policy
toward Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley campaign leaders are counting on the Fletcher School
event to showcase what they consider the candidate's command of
complex international issues, gained in part from serving on the
Senate Intelligence Committee during eight of his 18 years in
Congress. To demonstrate his facility with those issues, Bradley
plans to outline his foreign policy views through a
question-and-answer session with students, instead of through a
speech prepared with the help of advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can handle any foreign policy question from anybody at any
point,'' Eric Hauser, Bradley's press secretary, said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley himself has said that he thinks many voters use foreign
policy as a yardstick to measure the depth, stature and
trustworthiness of presidential candidates. ``I believe it is a
very real way that people assess a candidate, because they
ultimately are asking themselves that question: Whom do I trust
with my life?'' he told reporters this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign has already begun trying to paint Bradley
as naive and inexperienced about foreign affairs, saying he lacks a
clear policy vision and is inconsistent about when to use military
force overseas.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Gore campaign has criticized Bradley for
voting in 1984 against sending aid to Nicaraguan rebels fighting
the Sandinista government, and then reversing field and voting for
it in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, one of only 11 Democratic senators to support President
Ronald Reagan's aid package to the rebels, said at the time that he
became convinced the measure was needed to prevent the Nicaraguan
government from trying to undermine democratic states in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   Though his Fletcher School appearance will be his first
prominent foreign policy event of the campaign, Bradley has been
gradually laying out his vision for America's role overseas. At the
core of that vision is the idea that technology and trade can
spread prosperity to even the poorest nations, bring greater
stability to global hot spots and encourage the growth of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before an Iowa nuclear disarmament group in
September, he argued that a central goal of U.S. foreign policy
should be to reduce poverty worldwide. ``If we do these things,
we'll be a nation that has a clearer idea that we're not only
standing up for our ideals domestically, but we're also influencing
the world by knitting the world into a closer whole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Properly used, Bradley has argued, the global marketplace can
provide powerful incentives to governments to resolve ethnic
conflicts and improve human rights. Citing the case of Indonesia,
where pro-Jakarta militias terrorized civilians in East Timor this
year, Bradley has said that the Indonesian government should be
denied financial help from the World Bank or the International
Monetary Fund if it does not prosecute militia leaders who are
accused of mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``A globalized economy begins to exert new pressures to do
things that serve the overall interests of human rights,'' he said
in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bradley has often urged caution about using
American military forces abroad to quell ethnic disputes or calm
regional tensions. In the Senate, he voted against sending troops
to push Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991, saying he wanted to try
economic sanctions against Baghdad first. He also questioned
whether it was in the country's strategic interests to deploy
American forces in Bosnia. And he described American policy in
Kosovo as ``bomb and hope diplomacy'' that could have been avoided
with earlier diplomatic intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the United States has either the resources nor
the will to be the policeman to the world,'' he has said on many
occasions during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bradley says, America needs to increase its reliance on
the United Nations to resolve regional conflicts. He says the
United States should have long ago paid the $1 billion it owed to
the United Nations in back dues, arguing that it lost influence
within the organization.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Russian policy may provide Bradley one of his clearest contrasts
with the vice president. In an op-ed article in The Wall Street
Journal in September, Bradley argued that the administration had
allowed strategic arms negotiations with Russia to stall, erred in
pushing for NATO expansion over Russian objections and done too
little to encourage economic reforms. He also asserted that the
United States needed to do much more to prevent Russian nuclear
weapons and weapons materials from being sold to terrorists or
rogue nations, and that the administration had become an apologist
for President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on Yeltsin, Bradley contends, the United
States should broaden its ties to other Russian political and
civilian leaders, a position also advocated by Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the leading Republican presidential candidate. Bradley
also advocates increasing spending on a program he helped create
while in the Senate that brings high school students from Russia
and other former Soviet republics to study in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He also supports beginning negotiations with Russia on a Start
III treaty that would require each nation to reduce its nuclear
arsenal to 1,000 to 2,000 weapons. And he would push for passage of
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for nuclear weapons that Congress
rejected last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says he will keep the Pentagon budget at current levels,
in contrast to Gore, who has called for increasing spending. With
the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War,
Bradley argues that the United States no longer needs to prepare to
fight wars on two fronts, and so can trim its troop levels and
forgo building expensive new weapons systems like the F-22 fighter.
Gore supports building the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Clinton administration, Bradley supports modifying the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, signed by the United States and the
Soviet Union in 1972, to allow development of a defense system to
protect the United States from ballistic missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has expressed skepticism about a national missile
defense system, calling it a ``difficult and expensive
proposition.'' He has suggested that he would prefer a more limited
system that could protect American forces overseas, in locations
like Japan, or shoot down a few missiles launched at the United
States either accidentally by a superpower or purposely by a nation
like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Also like the Clinton administration, Bradley supported bringing
China into the World Trade Organization. And he supports a
``one-China'' policy to unify Taiwan and China peacefully and
gradually. But until unification, he says he would be willing to
use American military power to protect Taiwan, provided it did not
declare its independence from China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially we are buying time,'' for China-Taiwan relations,
he said in Iowa recently. ``If there is any country that
understands time, it is the Chinese.''

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Caseworkers rarely ask and clients rarely tell, but
growing evidence suggests that disproportionately large numbers of
women on welfare were sexually abused as children, a finding that
offers new insight into many of the so-called hard cases that are
an increasing focus of the national effort to overhaul the welfare
system.
</P>
<P>
   While this trail of trauma has received virtually no attention,
the frequency of childhood violation helps explain the roots of
problems that are commonly recognized as blocking a successful
transition from welfare. Women who were raped or molested as
children are more likely to become addicted to alcohol or drugs, to
suffer disabling battles with anxiety or depression and to become
victims of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Milwaukee, which has cut its welfare rolls more than any
other city, a hidden history of childhood abuse helps explain the
struggles of Mary Rhoden and Tanya Moore, who began the year as two
of the most promising students in a motivation class mandated by
the state welfare program.
</P>
<P>
   Without a recognition of the sexual abuse in their early lives,
it is difficult to understand how either woman arrived on welfare
or the multiple problems that persist as they leave the rolls. Yet
neither even considered raising such an intimate subject with their
caseworkers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 months, Ms. Rhoden, 35, an animated woman who
has spent years on welfare, and Ms. Moore, 25, a former university
student on welfare for the first time, each spoke at length about
the shadows cast by early abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they were molested by a relative during their
grade-school years.
</P>
<P>
   Both said their families refused to believe them, compounding
their isolation and dismay. Both contemplated suicide _ Ms. Rhoden
made an attempt as a teenager _ and both continue to struggle with
storms of depression that interfere with their ability to hold jobs
and form relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the comfort she felt when she read ``I Know Why the
Caged Bird Sings,'' Maya Angelou's autobiographical account of
being raped as a child, Ms. Moore said she decided to discuss her
past so other women would know they were not alone.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Rhoden, the urge to talk seemed more visceral. When her
abuser dies, she said, she plans to stand on his grave and
proclaim, ``You took my soul when I was young, so the Lord's going
to take more than that from you.''
</P>
<P>
   By its nature as the ultimate taboo, childhood sexual abuse is
hard to quantify at any level of society. Different research
techniques produce wildly different estimates. But new evidence
suggests that it is much more prevalent among women on welfare than
previously understood: in some surveys, more than 40 percent say
they were sexually abused as children.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After a decade visiting welfare offices and conducting hundreds
of interviews in more than a dozen states, this reporter finds his
notebooks filled with accounts of childhood rape and molestation.
</P>
<P>
   The problem seems pervasive, and hidden, here in Milwaukee,
where a famously tough welfare-to-work program has drawn waves of
researchers from around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood sexual abuse is not confined to the poor, of course.
Most researchers say it is more common at all income levels than
generally understood. But welfare and sexual abuse are entwined in
at least two ways.
</P>
<P>
   Children who grow up poor, especially those with unmarried
mothers, face an increased risk of being abused, most scholars say.
They are more likely to live in dangerous neighborhoods or with
adults impaired by alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In single-parent families, they are also more likely to be
around unrelated men (like their mothers' boyfriends), increasing
the pool of potential abusers.
</P>
<P>
   Abused children, in turn, are more likely to have problems that
could lead them to welfare as adults.
</P>
<P>
   And once on welfare, those whose abuse has caused other problems
that researchers call common _ like addiction, depression or
relationships with violent men _ have a harder time leaving the
rolls through stable jobs or marriages.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``A child from a deprived background is more likely to
experience a lasting impact,'' said David Finkelhor, a sociologist
at the University of New Hampshire and a leading authority on child
sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, six surveys of welfare recipients have
produced estimates of sexual abuse that are both diverse and
strikingly high. In Paterson, N.J., 24 percent of the recipients
surveyed said they were sexually abused as children. The figure was
25 percent in Michigan, 28 percent in Chicago, 38 percent in
Washington state, 41 percent in Utah and 42 percent in Worcester,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to make a precise comparison with the general
population, because estimates about the extent of the problem there
also vary widely. In 1994, Finkelhor reviewed 19 studies of the
general population. Of them, the median study estimated that 18
percent of female adults had been sexually abused as children.
</P>
<P>
   Finkelhor said most experts now accepted a slightly higher
estimate for the general population, from 20 percent to 25 percent.
By contrast, the median figure in the welfare studies was 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the welfare office, few women present symptoms as
striking as that of Ms. Angelou, who became mute after her rape.
Indeed, Bill Curcio spent 20 years as a caseworker in Paterson
without suspecting that abuse was a problem. ``No one revealed it
to me _ ever,'' he said. But when he began teaching an eight-week
course to prepare women for the workplace, the subject arose
constantly. ``I didn't realize how much of it there was _ rape,
sexual abuse, molestation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First impressions of Mary Rhoden yield no hint of her difficult
past. ``Excellent student!'' her instructors wrote. ``Very positive
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Rhoden has spent decades rebelling against anyone in
authority _ the relative who molested her, the employers who hired
her and the social workers who have offered to help. She is raising
five children on an ever-shifting mixture of boyfriends, welfare
and jobs. An underlying pattern persists: conflict, defiance and
flight. ``I don't take no bull off of nobody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The abuse, the depression, the troubled men _ the real issues in
Ms. Rhoden's life remained hidden from the welfare office. From
behind their desks, her caseworkers encountered a puzzle: a
talented yet uncooperative woman, charming then suddenly hostile.
``I think the lady has a lot of potential,'' said Hortensia
Sanchez, her most recent caseworker, ``but to tell you the truth, I
couldn't tell you what her barriers and her issues are. We didn't
get that far.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Rhoden answered her abuse by fleeing to the streets,
Tanya Moore took flight by hiding behind walls of hostility and
depression that she is just beginning to recognize.
</P>
<P>
   In statistical terms, like Ms. Rhoden, Ms. Moore would be
counted a welfare success. Refusing to join the work program _
``working for a welfare check was just too insulting'' _ she found
a part-time job on her own, as a clerk in a program intended to
slow the spread of AIDS. But she remains poor (she earns $200 a
week), depressed and constantly buffeted by feelings of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface they are utterly different people. Ms. Rhoden
skates by on surface charm; Ms. Moore hunkers down behind glares.
Ms. Rhoden seeks solace in constant companions; Ms. Moore isolates
herself. While Ms. Rhoden left school in the ninth grade, Ms. Moore
finished nearly three years of college.
</P>
<P>
   But if the details differ, the resulting instability has been
the same.

CARROLL HAS ALREADY WON A SEASON PASS FROM KRAFT

   Pete Carroll's safe. For now.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a buzz going around the NFL the past week that if
the Patriots lose Sunday in Buffalo, Carroll would be whacked by
owner Bob Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Why Buffalo, I couldn't even guess. But it's out there because
in the past week, two coaches with other teams called your humble
servant to see if there was any validity to the rumor. The answer
is no. Kraft has told friends, when asked, that nothing would ever
happen during the season. That's not his style, and, as every year,
the entire organization will be evaluated when the year is over.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Russell Robbat, owner of The Palace nightclub in Saugus, Mass.,
on what happened with a group of Patriots Wednesday night:
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Patriot players got into a shouting match. It got loud.
They were trash-talking each other. Before anything could happen,
the other players stepped in. There were no punches thrown. Just a
lot of talk,'' Robbat said. ``I had four of my own security people
on the scene and they asked me what to do. I told them to stay out
of it. I didn't want my guys in the middle of 10 football players.
The two guys who were arguing were buddies again by the end of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for Willie McGinest. He put on a class act for
charity up here, and the big story is two guys arguing rather than
McGinest raising $30,000 for charity.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there were others who claimed to be present who dispute
this account, saying there was a fight over money wagered on a pool
game between Vincent Brisby and Lawyer Milloy; that the players
drank heavily; and that one had to be carried out bodily. There
were reports that Terry Glenn was stopped by Walpole police and
issued a ticket at 4 a.m. and was two hours late for practice
Thursday.

   Little Did He Know Department: Twenty-four years ago Ed Germano
watched as the fans tore up the field at Fenway Park after the
final out of the seventh game of the World Series with Cincinnati.
When Germano, who was working on the grounds crew, reported to work
the next day, boss Joe Mooney told him to dig up home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field was all torn apart with people taking home patches
of grass. They tried to dig up home plate, but couldn't do it,''
said Germano. ``I got it up with pick ax and asked Joe what to do
with it. He said: `Do anything you want with it.' So I kept it. Had
it in my backyard all these years. All of my kids used it to play
ball in my backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Ed's brother, Michael, a Boston attorney, had an idea:
``Last summer, around All-Star Game time, someone paid over
$100,000 for the ball Carlton Fisk hit for the home run to win Game
6,'' said Michael. ``Then I thought about Ed's home plate. It was
from that same World Series so I thought it had to be worth
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germano family will soon find out how much. The home plate
will be auctioned off next week as part of Lelands' national
``Immortals Auction.''
</P>
<P>
   The home plate is item No. 777, and bidding starts at $3,000.
The family will use the money for college tuitions.

   The Celtics' attendance has been off 2,000 fans per game,
compared to last season. At an average price of $50 per ticket,
that's $100,000 per game, which, for 40 home games, would be a $4
million drop in revenue if the trend continues.

   He has to coach wearing a brace on his leg and walking with the
use of a cane. But Mike Westhoff, the Miami Dolphins special teams
coach, is thrilled to be able to coach at all, and says he owes it
all to a Boston doctor, Dr. Henry Mankin of Massachusetts General
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't thank Dr. Mankin enough for what he has done for me,''
said Westhoff. ``This man is a real hero in my book. He has done so
much good, for so many people, it is just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   As Westhoff tells it, 12 years ago he was coaching on Don
Shula's staff, when his trouble started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jogged a lot and my back started to bother me. They thought
it was sciatic nerve,'' he said. ``I had an operation on my back
(in a Florida hospital) and it went bad. I nearly died on the
table. Luckily, I lived. I continued to have problems. I was
diagnosed as having a malignant tumor on my leg. I went to the
Dana-Farber Institute in Boston. I was told the best work was being
done there, and I had two sisters who lived in the Boston area.
They confirmed the bone tumor. I asked the doctor there: `If you
had to pick a doctor to do this operation, who would it be?' He
said Henry Mankin at Mass. General. That's how we got together.''
</P>
<P>
   Mankin saved Westhoff's leg by removing the piece of bone that
housed the tumor, and replaced it with bone from a cadaver. The
surgery required Mankin to screw all of the parts together.
Westhoff returned to coaching, and what he considered a normal
life. Then Feb. 1, not knowing it at the time, more trouble was
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell down a ramp, working on my boat,'' he said. ``(Doctors)
thought later I must have had a hairline fracture of the leg, right
near where some of the screws were. A few weeks later, I was
walking through the Houston airport and my leg just snapped. I was
in terrible pain, worst I ever felt, just laying there on the
floor. They rushed me to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. (Wayne) Huizenga (owner of the Dolphins) rushed his
private plane and they flew me right away to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Mankin weaved his magic. He put the leg back
together, and gave Westhoff great news: no sign of any cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, he's asked me to call others who have had
similar problems. And I've been glad to do it,'' he said. ``When we
play up in the New England area, I have some of these people come
to the game as my guest. I enjoy meeting them. I feel like I'm
giving back because I've been so lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking the sideline in the NFL can be dangerous. A lot of
coaches get taken down on plays out of bounds. ``I stay behind the
bench, until it's my time. Fourth down. Kickoff. Punts. All the
situations for special teams. I tell them what to do, and then make
sure I stay out of the line of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Here's a scouting report on Sunday's Patriots-Bills game in
Buffalo from a coach who has played against both of them in the
last month:
</P>
<P>
   ``The matchup of the game is Buffalo trying to run the ball at
the middle of the Patriots' defense,'' he said. ``When they run the
ball effectively inside, they make (Buffalo quarterback Doug)
Flutie a much better quarterback. When he has to pass 40 times,
they lose. Their big back (Antowain) Smith has been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, the Patriots have to give (quarterback Drew)
Bledsoe some time to throw. If he gets it, he can hurt the Bills'
secondary. Buffalo usually doesn't blitz a lot, but if they do,
after watching how much trouble New England has had picking it up,
the Patriots could be in for a long day.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Hyatt was dutifully following a traditional path for a
future corporate executive. After college, he joined a consulting
firm, where he advised blue-chip companies like AT&AMP;T, General
Motors and IBM. He then applied to a few business schools, gained
admission to Stanford, the most selective of them all, and prepared
to enroll this fall.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, however, he took an eight-week job helping a
friend who worked at a small Internet company in Southern
California, and when it ended, Hyatt, 28, was hooked. So shortly
before he was to sit down to his first finance class, he called
Stanford to say thanks anyway: He wouldn't be showing up in Palo
Alto after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to do this now, before it's too late,'' Hyatt said of
working for an Internet start-up. ``If you wait two years, there's
going to be consolidation in the industry. Right now, you have a
chance to stake out your own claim.''
</P>
<P>
   As many of the United States' most talented young workers rush
to stake that claim, business school has suddenly lost some of its
luster. That has had a significant impact on applications to some
top schools, particularly those that tend to attract the
entrepreneurially minded.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, applications to Stanford, MIT, Dartmouth,
Michigan and the University of California at Berkeley, have dropped
as much as 11 percent. On other elite campuses, like Northwestern
and Carnegie Mellon, applications have leveled off. Some less
prestigious universities have seen steep declines.
</P>
<P>
   More students are also dropping out after the first year of the
two-year MBA program to remain with companies where they worked
over the summer. And driven in part by the generally strong
economy, the number of Americans taking the standardized admissions
test for business school has fallen sharply in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are a significant departure from the attitude toward
the MBA degree earlier in this long economic expansion. For the
past decade, until last spring, applications increased at every
elite school virtually every year, turning the MBA program into one
of the hottest areas of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, many potential students worry that two years is
too long to be studying marketing and operations, and, unlike those
aspiring to be lawyers or doctors, they do not need a degree to
practice their craft.
</P>
<P>
   Much as Bill Gates decided in 1976 that starting a software
company immediately was more important than graduating from Harvard
College, they are eager to get moving. Among the prizes they seek
are the stock options available to the first employees of a
start-up _ even if it means forgoing the six-figure salaries that
MBAs often command.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the eagerness is a broader anxiety shared by many
investors and executives that the current Internet bull market
could be at or very near its peak. That perception is encouraging
companies to go public at a record pace to take advantage of
current valuations, for example, and making stock prices gyrate.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in their 20s and 30s also question whether the ivory
tower is the place to learn about the emerging Internet world.
``There's an urgency that this is happening so fast that you've got
to be in it to really learn it,'' said George Daly, dean of New
York University's Stern School of Business. Applications to NYU
dropped slightly last spring after rising an average of 15 percent
in each of the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
   To attract students and recruiters, schools are overhauling
curriculums to offer more Internet courses and even creating majors
devoted to the subject. Some schools have increased advertising
budgets and stepped up their own recruiting to compete with
companies trying to lure skilled workers in a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time in their histories, schools are seeing
groups of students who leave after their first year, perhaps
abandoning the $25,000 or so investment many had made in a year of
tuition. Twenty-five of the 765 members of the MBA class of 2000 at
the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for example, did
not return this fall, and almost all now work for Internet
start-ups, a spokesman for the school said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, some schools are considering more liberal
leave-of-absence policies, while others, including Pennsylvania and
Northwestern, have dusted off little-used rules to allow students
to take up to five years off.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, said Donald Jacobs, Northwestern's dean for
the past 23 years, ``people are wringing their hands'' about the
departures. Jacobs said he had no problem with students taking time
off and he expected most of them to return eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are no statistics that offer a definitive reason
for the changes, many observers said the Internet was a major
factor. More broadly, a low unemployment rate and an almost
insatiable demand for highly skilled workers in corporate America
has left people who would normally be considering an MBA quite
happy in their current jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators also pointed to demographic factors, noting that
the number of people in their late 20s is shrinking slightly, and
added that the recent MBA boom and the resulting lowered acceptance
rates might be intimidating potential applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the number of Americans taking the standardized
business-school admission test has fallen 17 percent in the last
four years, according to the Graduate Management Admission Council,
which administers the test.
</P>
<P>
   That decline is exaggerated by the fact that the test, in its
new computerized format, is no longer offered on college campuses,
discouraging undergraduates from taking it. Still, top schools
typically consider only applicants with at least two years of work
experience, and the number of test-takers has dropped in almost
every age group since 1995, according to the council.
</P>
<P>
   Not every school has seen interest wane. Fueled by the
six-figure salaries that many graduates fetch and the continued
growth in the number of foreigners who want American business
degrees, applications to some schools are still rising.
</P>
<P>
   Applications to Harvard, for example, rose 5 percent last year,
and at Columbia, where one-third of the student body hails from
other countries, they increased by almost 10 percent. Duke and the
University of Chicago also saw increases.
</P>
<P>
   But at top schools renowned for attracting entrepreneurs and
technology experts _ like Stanford and Berkeley _ the number of
applications fell or was unchanged last spring. Many people who
traditionally apply to those schools now feel an urgent need to
work at an Internet start-up, said Sally Lannin, a former Stanford
administrator and currently the president of MBA Strategies, a
Minnesota-based consulting firm for business-school applicants.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Harvard, Columbia and Chicago _ while turning out
many entrepreneurs as well _ are among the schools that aspiring
investment bankers consider first.

<P>
   Patty Benson, 26, is one of the nonapplicants. Like Hyatt, she
had been following the usual course for ambitious people who want
to work in corporate America. Ms. Benson majored in economics at
Colby College in Maine, landed a plum job at Bain &AMP; Co. as a
consultant, and started to think about business school. Then the
online explosion interrupted her thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these companies are growing very, very fast,'' Ms. Benson
said. ``I wanted to be in on it.''
</P>
<P>
   So she applied to Internet companies rather than business
schools and ended up moving to Seattle two months ago to work as an
assistant product manager in Amazon.com's books division. ``I love
it,'' she said. Just as she imagines a business school to be, she
added, ``It's filled with a lot of very smart, enthusiastic
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on campuses where applications have declined, school
administrators say their schools continue to thrive. The most
prestigious still admit only about one in eight candidates.
Graduates are snapped up by consulting firms and investment banks _
and, increasingly, Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened competition has forced some more traditional
companies to offer new perquisites, like leaves of absence, in
addition to starting salaries that sometimes reach $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market for MBAs is very exciting,'' Jacobs of Northwestern
said. ``As long as we don't become irrelevant to what's happening
in the marketplace, I think we're fine.''
</P>
<P>
   To stay relevant, schools are quickly creating new courses and
changing lesson plans in existing classes to include Internet
business. Earlier this month, Wharton announced that it was adding
an e-commerce major, effective immediately, with 50 faculty members
teaching courses.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Chicago this fall, two staff members had to
stand outside a 9 a.m. Saturday Internet course on the first few
days of class to prevent students not enrolled from sitting in on
the lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a decline in the number of applications can be a serious
matter for graduate schools, particularly in the MBA world, where
schools compete aggressively with one another. Such a drop can
force admissions officers to be less discriminating in selecting a
class. It also has the potential to lower a school's ranking in
U.S. News &AMP; World Report's influential annual survey and can
require a school to spend more money promoting itself.
</P>
<P>
   Some less elite schools, which are often unknown in other
countries, are faring the worst. At Tulane University,
business-school applications fell more than 40 percent over the
last two years, though the assistant dean for admissions, John
Silbernagel, said he thought the pool was still of similar quality.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Iowa's Henry B. Tippie School of
Management, where applications dropped by more than a quarter last
spring, the acceptance rate rose to 37 percent, from 28 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the school has tripled its advertising budget and
continued a recent push to send more unsolicited mail to people who
take the admissions test, said Mary Spreen, the school's director
of MBA admissions and financial aid. ``It has caused some
concern,'' Ms. Spreen said. ``When you have a larger applicant
pool, you're able to attract a higher-quality class.''
</P>
<P>
   But business school can be a tough sell in the current, frenzied
Internet environment. Many potential students hope to be among a
company's early employees, who typically receive a larger batch of
stock options at a lower price than employees who join later.
</P>
<P>
   When Hyatt left his consulting job, at Mercer Management
Consulting, for a summer stint at Winfire, which designs Internet
software, it had 10 employees. It now has 40. Had he attended
Stanford and joined after graduation, the company would have had
150 employees, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of venture capital even allows some Internet
start-ups to offer high salaries, in addition to options, noted
Hyatt, who said he was making over $100,000 as the director of
product management at Winfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I take my admissions hat off,'' said Marie Mookini, the
director of MBA admissions at Stanford, ``I understand why these
24- and 25-year-old people want to jump feet-first into this
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The changing attitude to the MBA is particularly striking in
Silicon Valley, a new center of U.S. business and yet a place where
business school has suddenly become less popular.
</P>
<P>
   Applications to Berkeley's program dropped by 11 percent last
spring. At Stanford _ where school employees came up with the idea
that led to the creation of Cisco Systems and whose graduates
include top Internet executives like Scott McNealy of Sun
Microsystems _ they fell 6 percent. These days, students worry that
their chances of emulating such titans will decrease if they wait
two years to start work.
</P>
<P>
   With the national unemployment rate at just above 4 percent,
many of the start-ups are also making a big push to keep employees
who have been at their jobs for two to seven years, traditionally a
period of high turnover, Jacques Leger, a human resources
consultant with Watson Wyatt in San Francisco, said. ``Now, with
two years of experience, you're considered a prime candidate with
lots of experience,'' Leger said.
</P>
<P>
   Students notice the difference. ``The opportunity cost of going
to school has gone up dramatically,'' said Cheryl Proctor, a
second-year MBA student at Berkeley and the managing editor of the
student newspaper, who watched some of her classmates quit this
summer while many others work part-time jobs during the school year
to maintain contacts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Proctor herself spent last summer at a small Internet
company in San Francisco that asked her to stay when her internship
ended. ``They made it really tempting,'' she said. But business
school, she added, ``seems like a safe bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many school administrators predict that applications will start
rising again everywhere as the Internet industry matures. One
possible sign of resurgent interest in MBA programs is already
being seen: a small rebound in recent months in the number of
Americans taking the admissions test.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a gold-rush mentality'' to the Internet, said Paul
Danos, dean of the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. ``A
lot of potential students will make the wrong decision. Everybody
thinks they're all going to strike it rich, and it's just not going
to happen.''

COURT SILENCES IRAN REFORMIST WITH JAIL TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iran's most powerful religious court Saturday imposed a
five-year jail term and a five-year banishment from political
activity on a Muslim cleric, Abdullah Nouri, who has won wide
popular support with demands for an end to authoritarian rule by
the religious hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The court also ordered the immediate closing of the newspaper
run by the cleric, Khordad, which has been one of the most
effective voices of the country's increasingly impatient democratic
movement, and imposed a fine of 15 million rials, equivalent to
$5,000. The sentence for the 50-year-old cleric included 74 lashes
with a braided leather whip, but under complex sentencing rules,
this was set aside in favor of an alternate punishment of a year in
jail, to be served concurrently with his five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Nouri, who has been compared by Iranian reformers
with Martin Luther, the 16th-century German cleric who was
excommunicated after challenging the hierarchy of the Roman
Catholic Church, was barred from having any role in publishing or
writing for publication for five years. In official terms, this
effectively made a nonperson of a politician who is seen by many
Iranians as the bravest of all standard-bearers for democratic
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri, who had been the leading reform candidate in
parliamentary elections scheduled for February, was led from the
courtroom by armed guards and taken directly to Evin Prison, the
grim mountainside fortress where many of the shah's allies were
imprisoned and executed after the 1979 Islamic revolution. In
recent years, many of its inmates have been former revolutionaries
like Nouri who have fallen afoul of conservatives determined to
uphold a hard-line version of Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   The route to the prison through the northern suburbs of Tehran,
the capital, a distance of about a mile, was lined with police
apparently called out to deter demonstrations in support of Nouri,
residents of the area said by telephone. The cleric's supporters
immediately demanded that President Muhammad Khatami, another
reformist cleric, step in to rescue Nouri.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear that Khatami, a close ally and personal
friend of Nouri, had the power to intervene. Since his election in
a landslide 30 months ago, the president has been largely stymied
by conservative clerics who control most important levers of power.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old president, who won nearly 70 percent of the 30
million votes cast in 1997, has himself been walking a narrow line
politically, seeking incremental reforms, but virtually checkmated
by conservatives allied to the country's supreme religious leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Last week, the country's shadowy
intelligence ministry announced that it had arrested 20 religious
hard-liners on suspicion of plotting to assassinate Khatami and
other leading political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri himself maintained a scornful attitude toward the court
and a seeming indifference to his own fate, which characterized his
defiant speeches at his trial before the Special Court for the
Clergy this month. Last week, he told reporters he would not appeal
the court's sentence and predicted that the trial would only
accelerate demands for sweeping changes in Iran's political system
that would take power from the religious authorities and bestow it,
under a democratic system, on Iran's 70 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might take them a long time to learn this lesson, or it
might take them a short time,'' Nouri said, referring to the ruling
clerics. ``What is clear, and beyond doubt, is that the case we
have put before the court will have an effect, on society and the
state. What we know for certain is that there will be change.''
</P>
<P>
   Nouri had no opportunity to speak to reporters after the
sentencing, which was held behind closed doors, apparently after
the court decided that it had been a mistake to open the two-week
trial to the news media. That decision, made in an attempt to show
that Nouri was being given a fair trial, backfired when Nouri
dominated the hearings, using them to set out a powerful case
against the religious dictatorship that has characterized Iran for
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom became the best platform the reformers have ever
had, producing day after day of banner headlines in the reformist
newspapers that have proliferated across Iran, and making Nouri
even more popular than before. Eventually, two weeks ago, the
clerics sitting in judgment on him _ a judge and a nine-man jury,
all of them senior religious figures _ decided to cut their losses
and bring the trial to an abrupt end.
</P>
<P>
   One of Nouri's closest allies, Ali Hekmati, a cleric who is
editor in chief of Khordad, the newspaper that the court banned,
said that he had spoken briefly to Nouri by mobile telephone after
the sentencing and found him in a resolute mood. ``He told me he
was in good spirits,'' Hekmati said.
</P>
<P>
   In Evin Prison, the scene of frequent firing squads in 1979 and
1980, Nouri will join dozens of other reformers, including the
former mayor of Tehran, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, who was sentenced
on disputed corruption charges to a two-year jail term and a
10-year political ban last year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with another Tehran newspaper published
Saturday, but before the sentencing, Nouri said that the clergy
court, ``if it wishes to act according to standards of fairness and
justice,'' should acquit him and make a formal apology for having
placed him on trial. As for the banning of his newspaper, he said
it would matter little, since his associates would start another
paper under a different name and continue to push for democratic
change.

</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Reuters news agency last week, he
brushed aside concern for his own well-being. ``I do not believe
that I was sacrificed,'' he said. ``I am not unhappy about what
I've said.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I was only thinking about God, and the nation, and
saying out loud what the people have kept in their hearts for so
long. I have done my duty, and I don't care about the decision of
an unlawful clerical court.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, Nouri contended, in effect, that the Islamic
revolution was hijacked by religious hard-liners who broke the
promises of democracy that were made after the overthrow of the
shah and instead instituted a system of rigid clerical rule. He
called for an end to a system known in Iran as ``velayat-e-faqih,''
literally, the guardianship of the religious jurist, which has been
used to justify dictatorial rule by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
who died in 1989, and now by Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   He stunned the court by making what, in the context of the
Islamic revolution, was a heretic's case: that the 1980 Islamic
constitution was not intended to place religious leaders above the
law. Referring to Khamenei, who appoints members of the court and
controls its actions, Nouri said that he was ``in essence equal
with the general population,'' and like any other individual, he
has ``an obligation to obey the law and no powers not specifically
granted to him by the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   When the jury reached its verdict this month, it convicted Nouri
on 15 counts of apostasy. Among other things, he was found guilty
of insulting Islam, of defying its sacred beliefs, of ``spreading
lies'' and of ``sowing confusion'' among the public, offenses for
which he received a three-year jail term. For a conviction of
insulting Ayatollah Khomeini, who has a Godlike status among
Islamic hard-liners, he was sentenced to two more years.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts in the past two weeks to find common ground between
reformist and hard-line clerics had raised hopes that Khamenei
might step in and order a lighter sentence, or quash the verdict
altogether. But the meetings between the two clerical groups in
Tehran and the holy city of Qom appear to have ended without
compromise, setting the stage for what many Iranians expect to be
an explosive campaign for the parliamentary elections on Feb. 18.

ONCE-OBSCURE TRADE TALKS TAKE WORLD STAGE IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last half-century, government officials from around the
world have gathered every few years to talk about trade. Delegates,
who could often fit in a single hotel, debated arcana of tariff
tables and export subsidies and were largely ignored by the world
press.
</P>
<P>
   When trade ministers assemble in Seattle this week to attend the
meeting of the World Trade Organization, the scene will be almost
unrecognizable. Negotiating teams from 134 countries have booked
almost every hotel room in the city. Tariff reductions are still on
the agenda, but they will be fighting for attention with health
care, food safety, clear air, endangered species, child labor and
cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   And that's only inside the closed-door sessions. Outside, tens
of thousands of demonstrators plan to use the Seattle meeting to
campaign against what they see as the trade organization's role in
worsening air pollution, killing animals and undermining national
sovereignty _ in short, letting globalization run amok.
</P>
<P>
   The trade forum hopes that the meeting will start up a new round
of global trade talks _ tentatively named the ``Millennium Round''
_ that would flatten trade barriers to their lowest levels in
modern history and gain service providers _ like telecommunications
companies _ greater access to world markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks will also test support for freer trade in both
rich and poor countries, especially since delegates will face a
giant, 1960s-style protest campaign meant to mobilize worldwide
opposition to new trade efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Trade forum members and observers of the talks say there is a
reasonable chance that the Seattle meeting will result in only
token progress, disappointing agriculture, entertainment and
electronic commerce industries hoping for new liberalization, but
cheering critics who would like to see the group hobbled.
</P>
<P>
   Despite weeks of meetings to work out a formal agenda for the
meeting, negotiators were ultimately unable to agree on what to
talk about. Further complicating the picture, the United States and
the Europeans want the trade group to help resolve global disputes
on labor and the environment that even a few years ago were
considered beyond the purview of its small, specialized
bureaucracy. The push for expanding the Geneva-based trade group's
mandate has divided the developed and less-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real worry that the WTO could become a victim of its
own success,'' says Daniel Tarullo, a former Clinton administration
economics official who is now a professor at Georgetown University.
``It was effective in freeing up trade, but it's straining under
the weight of issues that go well beyond conventional trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is determined to make the best of the
Seattle talks. Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative,
says the United States hopes to make progress on its primary agenda
of reducing tariffs on farm goods and promoting trade in services.
``Failure is not an option,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington has an uphill battle. Japan and the European
Union, determined to protect their heavily subsidized farmers, have
fought broad cuts in tariffs on agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's effort to make labor and
environmental issues a central part of trade negotiations has
prompted a backlash from less-developed countries, and won only
tepid support from other rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   Economic analysts are more optimistic about prospects for
extending the tax-free treatment of electronic commerce around the
world, a high priority for the United States and Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other rounds of trade talks have begun amid heavy politicking
but have ended up producing broad accords that free up trade. Just
four years ago, the trade organization was born of a much weaker
negotiating group, the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. By
many measures it has been a success. Borders are now more open, and
trade is more important to the international economy than at any
time since before the Great Depression. The solid consensus among
the heads of most major economies is that free trade lifts all
boats.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the issues this time are especially tricky, in large part
because the definition of trade keeps getting broader. When the
talks were mostly about tariffs, they involved the way countries
treated imports at their borders. But with tariff levels lower, the
emphasis has shifted to services _ like banking, telecommunications
and even education and culture _ that involve domestic laws. This
has meant that trade issues are cutting deeper into local policy
and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade has become a more intrusive issue in domestic
politics,'' said Peter Watson, a Washington trade expert and former
head of the International Trade Commission, ``and that has,
unfortunately, made it a vehicle for discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly overnight, the once obscure trade group has become the
target of demonstrators opposed to what they consider the excesses
of globalization. The protesters now descending on Seattle
represent groups pushing environmental, labor and Third World
development causes, and they do not speak with once voice. Among
the divisions is whether the trade group should be abolished or
reformed. But common refrains include accusations that the forum
tramples social standards in the name of trade, that it acts as an
attack dog for multinational corporations and that it acts in
secrecy and without democratic oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about democracy _ about letting an unelected
bureaucracy in Geneva undermine our laws,'' said Jerry Mander,
director of the California-based International Forum on
Globalization. ``We need to stop it in its tracks, before it starts
controlling agriculture and bioengineering and many other things.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, which finds itself gearing up for what could well be
one of the largest street protests anywhere in the nation in years,
the celebratory mood that accompanied the city's selection as host
site is clearly tempered by nervousness over potential violence.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters say they expect 50,000 people, possibly many more, to
come to Seattle for demonstrations. Publicly at least, city leaders
insist that the groups are welcome and that the city _ which was
the site of the nation's first general strike in 1919 and has a
strong union presence _ will be a model host for ministers and
dissenters alike.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Some union members plan a Seattle Steel Party, modeled on the
Boston Tea Party, in which they will dump Chinese steel into the
city harbor here. (In deference to the environment, though, the
steel, unlike the tea in Boston, will be retrieved.)
</P>
<P>
   Free trade is not universally unpopular, of course, and Seattle
is also the home of Boeing and Microsoft, two of America's largest
exporters. At least one group, Working Families for Free Trade,
which is being organized by Christian conservative leaders, plans a
pro-free trade rally for Monday in Seattle's Mercer Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group has become such a target of ire in part because
it has proved to be one of the most powerful world bodies of any
kind. Unlike the trade and tariffs group, its predecessor, this
trade organization has the authority to decide disputes on its own
and impose penalties on countries that do not abide by its
conclusions. Three-judge panels _ most of the appointee judges are
trade lawyers _ decide cases in closed chambers without having to
reveal much about the process.
</P>
<P>
   The group has heard almost 200 trade disputes in four years.
Most are garden-variety protectionist issues like whether Japan can
tax domestic saki at different rates from imported whiskey, and
whether Canadian scallops can be called coquilles Saint-James when
sold in France.
</P>
<P>
   But several cases brought before the forum have linked trade to
the environment and health. In one case, for example, a trade group
panel ruled against the United States, which had banned imports of
shrimp from Asian countries that do not use fishing nets designed
to protect endangered turtles. In another case, the United States
was ordered to alter the Clear Air Act to allow imports of certain
kinds of foreign-produced gasoline, despite American claims that
the gasoline might not meet domestic clean-air standards.
</P>
<P>
   The case that got the most attention was brought by the United
States and Canada against the European Union, which banned the
import of hormone-treated beef raised in North America. Two trade
panels _ the first ruling was appealed _decided that the European
Union did not have an adequate scientific basis for excluding such
beef. Critics have argued that the ruling limits the rights of
governments to set basic food-safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the trade forum dismiss the criticism as
hyperbole. The group has not tried to legislate environmental or
food safety standards, they say, but has simply sought to ensure
that a country does not use such standards as a pretext for
discriminating against imported goods in favor of domestic goods.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Clinton administration, a strong proponent of the
group, has called for changes. President Clinton, who will attend
the Seattle talks for two days this week, plans to push for
reforms. Among his proposals: Introduce more transparency into the
way the trade organization reaches its decisions, and allow
observers to attend some sessions, according to White House
officials.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the group has become more prominent _ and
contested _ is that Clinton and leaders of the European Union keep
trying to expand its role. Clinton has been seeking to persuade
trade forum members that the group should be the one to set and
enforce core international labor standards and to outlaw at least
some kinds of child labor. This could give the group sweeping
powers to police the way workers are treated around the world. The
proposal seems designed to satisfy domestic political pressure from
unions, many of which argue that recent free-trade agreements have
prompted a hemorrhaging of American jobs to countries with lower
wages and less rigorous labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries have strenuously opposed the Clinton
initiative on labor, seeing it as protectionism in disguise. The
European Union has offered only tepid support, and experts do not
expect major progress on the issue at this meeting.
</P>
<P>
   There is stronger Western backing for another Clinton
initiative: giving environmentalists more power to review trade
agreements. Ms. Barshefsky, the trade representative, has called
for the forum to monitor trade issues ``proactively'' to weigh
environmental impact. Having had several environmental laws
challenged before the forum by developing countries, the Clinton
administration wants the trade forum to respect its right to
exclude imports that do not meet U.S. environmental standards.
Developing countries are, again, steadfastly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Third World countries think environment and labor are a
Trojan horse for turning the WTO into a forum that enforces Western
rights,'' said Watson, the Washington analyst. ``To the extent that
the WTO is not about trade _ and reducing trade barriers _ it is on
shaky ground.''

OPPOSITION GROWS TO POLICE AGENCIES' PRACTICE OF SELLING OLD
FIREARMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A growing number of police agencies are abandoning the
practice of selling old and confiscated guns to finance new
firearms after a gun used in a high-profile shooting last summer
was traced to a police department sale.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Gov. Bill Owens has recently ordered state troopers to
stop the practice, Illinois Gov. George Ryan is looking for a way
out of a pending weapons trade with a Georgia gun manufacturer, and
police departments around the country are being scrutinized for
their gun deals.
</P>
<P>
   Selling old weapons has long been a common, if little known,
practice for many police departments, particularly those in cities
operating under tight budgets. Departments are frequently able to
reduce the purchase price of large weapon orders by several hundred
thousand dollars through such trade-ins of officers' aging weapons
as well as guns seized from criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans Police Department came under criticism last
February when it was revealed that the first city to file a product
liability lawsuit against gun manufacturers also had a contract
pending with gun manufacturer Glock Inc. to trade in 10,000 old
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But an August shooting at a Los Angeles Jewish community center,
where two adults and three children were wounded and a postal
worker was killed, brought such deals under closer scrutiny. A 9 mm
pistol used by confessed shooter Buford Furrow was traced to the
police department in Cosmopolis, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon had been sold to a local gun shop and was not part of
a larger weapons trade, but the incident raised similar questions
among critics. The pistol changed hands several times before it
eventually was sold on consignment at a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Owens began questioning the gun resale practices of
Colorado troopers after the Los Angeles shooting, and he banned
state police gun sales in September.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said the shootings in Los Angeles and at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., had raised questions about the
accessibility of weapons, including old police guns. He said he
decided that the state of Colorado should not participate in the
weapons ``aftermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Illinois Gov. Ryan is looking for a way to purchase
2,500 guns from Glock Inc. without the trade-in of old guns agreed
to by contract in April. The gun sale would cost the Illinois State
Police slightly less than $300,000 with trade-ins but as much as
$800,000 at full price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hugely sensitive to this whole issue,'' said state
police spokesman Lt. Dave Sanders. There were questions raised
about the trade-in provision at the time the contract was
negotiated, he said, but added, ``It didn't become a huge national
concern until the shooting in Los Angeles in August.''
</P>
<P>
   Glock Vice President Paul Jannuzzo said his company does not
care whether Illinois trades weapons or not, as long as they make
up the full price of the deal in cash. ``If we continue to sell to
(police) departments, it will be more profitable to simply do a
straight deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand what it is they're saying,'' Jannuzzo said. ``I
just can't agree with the logic of it. If a criminal wants a
firearm, whether a police department has sold theirs or not is not
going to make that firearm any more available or any less available
to the criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the real number of firearms that have been obtained by
criminals in this manner is miniscule,'' Jannuzzo said. ``But they
certainly get more press.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Police Department requires officers to purchase
their own weapons and therefore does not negotiate the kind of
large gun purchases where trade-ins might be used, HPD spokesman
Fred King said. By policy, confiscated handguns are melted down
except for a handful used in training.
</P>
<P>
   The city of St. Louis was recently negotiating a large weapons
purchase with a trade-in component when the president of the board
of police commissioners stopped the deal. An old police weapon
traced to a Washington, D.C., homicide influenced his decision,
police spokeswoman Adella Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course (the trade-ins are) attractive, anything that can cut
your costs,'' Jones said. ``But it (would be) far more costly to
have one of your (old) weapons used in the commission of a crime.
So we just have to use some other way. It's a balancing act.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Police Chief Charles Ramsey vowed earlier this month
to end his department's practice of selling old weapons after The
Washington Post linked police weapons sold over the past decade to
the commission of 107 crimes, including eight homicides.
</P>
<P>
   The International Association of Chiefs of Police adopted a
nonbinding resolution a year ago calling for the mandatory
destruction of police departments' obsolete and confiscated
weapons. A spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence said
his organization is interested in pursuing federal legislation to
prevent police agencies from selling or trading obsolete or
confiscated weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., has introduced a
bill that would give state and local police agencies access to a
$15 million grant program for police weapons purchases as long as
they agree not to sell their cache of old weapons. The bill is not
expected to be considered until some time next year.

GETTING USED TO LOSING  
 A BETTER SHOOT-AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BKN-NOTEBOOK-KINGS) 
(jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Either the Houston Rockets have incredible perspective or
they're truly in denial. After dropping to 3-11 on Friday night
after an overtime loss to Portland, their locker room at the Rose
Garden bordered on jovial.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley, having missed 8 of 11 shots in his first
meeting with Scottie Pippen (whom Barkley engaged in a verbal
barrage during the off-season) joked with coach Rudy Tomjanovich
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley playfully inquired why Matt Bullard, and not he, took a
potential game-tying 3-pointer in overtime. ``Coach, let me tell
you something, I need that last 3,'' Barkley said. ``Bull? Bull
can't shoot like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the corner of a Rose Garden locker room was Hakeem
Olajuwon, who had pulled his groin early in the game and was
expected to miss the remaining three games of the team's road trip.
He bristled at the notion that his once-proud team had learned to
accept losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you get used to that?'' he said. ``We can't get used
to that. It's not lack of effort. This team goes out every night.
We play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich, who has resurrected teams from the grave before,
said: ``I'm not used to something like this. We've been known for
our quick starts. November has been our month. I guess I'm getting
paid back for all that success we've had in the past. You've got to
be humble when you're doing well and you can't get yourself down
too low when things aren't going well. That's life.''
</P>
<P>
   A Better Shoot-Around
</P>
<P>
   Shoot-around practices the morning of a game are one of those
monotonous, required routines players look forward to about as much
as income tax returns and lower back pain. But Blazers coach Mike
Dunleavy seems to have found a cure.
</P>
<P>
   During last season's truncated 50-game campaign, Portland began
holding its walk-through one-hour practice three hours before the
game. Dunleavy found that it not only gave players most of the day
to take care of personal business, but it also gave his team a
little edge heading into that evening's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes sense,'' said Brian Grant. ``When you wake up in
the morning, drive to the arena, come home and then go back, it
just seems like your whole day is gone. The concentration level
before a game is much higher, I think. It's little things like that
that make you appreciate playing for this franchise.''  &QL;

A CONFESSION 3 YEARS AFTER A LIFE IS TAKEN IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARVEY RICE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONROE, Texas _ Henry Ella Nylander had prayed fervently since
her son was shot to death outside her residence three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been praying for all those years, those three years that
passed, that whoever did it would come over and just say, `I did
it,' and I would not be angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Her prayer was answered with an early morning confession. On
Friday, an acquaintance of her son's was in jail charged with
murder.
</P>
<P>
   And Henry Ella Nylander is not angry.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Alexander Moore, 25, a son by a previous marriage, was
found dead outside her Conroe residence Dec. 23, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Conroe, a city of 40,000, is about 35 miles north of downtown
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A single bullet in his chest claimed his life a month before he
was to return to classes at Texas Southern University in an attempt
to pull his life together. He was, his mother said, finding
direction after a failed marriage and a stint in the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my son was killed, it was something that hurt a lot, but
at the same time, I was not angry,'' said Nylander.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that she wished no harm to come to her son's
killer, ``because the Lord said vengeance was his and he would
repay.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the 51-year-old beautician longed to know who killed
her son and why.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came about 6 a.m. one morning last week when her
doorbell rang.
</P>
<P>
   Wondering who it could be at such an early hour, she said she
felt some force pushing her toward the door. ``It seemed like it
was just for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Regis Stewart, 24, stood outside. Nylander and her husband,
Baldwin, 53, a utility operator, had known Stewart for 10 years. He
had been a childhood friend of the youngest of her four surviving
sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Paul, Mrs. Nylander,'' he said through the door. ``I've
got to tell you something.''
</P>
<P>
   As was her custom, Nylander asked him to come around to the
kitchen window because the front door was difficult to open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I killed your son Mike,'' Stewart told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you say?'' she remembers asking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I killed your son.'''
</P>
<P>
   She let Stewart in and led him into the den, then roused her
husband, who joined them.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart fell down on his knees and clasped Nylander's feet with
his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just began to cry and cry, and it was like he was bowing
down before us and having so much pain over what had happened,''
Nylander recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just saying, `I'm sorry, I'm sorry,' over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Would you please forgive me?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I forgave you after it happened and I didn't know who
it was.'''
</P>
<P>
   She turned to her husband and asked him to forgive Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Yeah, I forgive him,' and that was hard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin Nylander said his question, after the shock, was, ``Did
you kill before?
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't answer me. I said, `Well, I forgive you,' and he
started crying and my wife started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's forgiveness, however, doesn't mean Stewart won't
face justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked, `What do you want to do?' And he said, `I'll do
anything you want me to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nylander told Stewart to surrender to the police and clear
others who were suspects, and he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was then, she said, that he told them why he had killed their
son.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart told them that about two weeks before the slaying, he
and Moore had quarreled at a party because Moore had disparaged
Stewart in front of his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   When someone burglarized Stewart's residence shortly thereafter,
Stewart blamed Moore.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Nylanders that one night, by chance, he saw their
son enter a convenience store next to the Nylanders' residence on
South First Street in Conroe.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, according to the Nylanders, told them he hid in the
Nylanders' yard, then stepped out and shot Moore as he returned
from the store. The bullet struck him in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Friends who had been visiting heard the shot and rushed outside
to find the body.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three years later, Stewart told the Nylanders that he had
to seek their forgiveness. He talked of seeing visions of their son
on every street corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what he said, it was just eating away at him,'' the
victim's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   After his confession, the Nylanders sat and drank coffee for
about two hours with Stewart. Then he left, promising to surrender
to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Nylander said, she saw a dazed-looking Stewart
crossing the street in front of her home about 10 a.m. She sent a
friend to fetch him and phoned the police.
</P>
<P>
   She said a man who identified himself as Stewart's grandfather
arrived at the Nylanders' home shortly after the police arrived.
The grandfather, whose name Nylander did not know, was searching
for Stewart because he had been acting strangely, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His grandfather said, `Paul, what have you done?' and he said,
`I killed Mike.'''
</P>
<P>
   Conroe police read Stewart his rights and arrested him. He was
in the Montgomery County Jail on Friday awaiting arraignment on a
murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   Nylander said that although Stewart seemed to know what he was
doing the first time he came to her house, he was different at his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   He was incoherent, babbling about UFOs and about being the
subject of discussion on television programs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said he struggled when police tried to handcuff him, but was
subdued. Police officials familiar with the arrest could not be
reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nylander said she hopes that Stewart will be rehabilitated and
get a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my way, he would get psychological help and not just
be pinned in,'' she said. ``There has to be a reason for people to
turn to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not believe families of victims should seek vengeance.
``Sometimes you can be caught up and be so angry until you miss out
on the blessing from God of peace. And you miss out on helping
these kids.''

WEBBER FINDS NICHE IN KINGS' STARRING ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BKN-NOTEBOOK) 
(jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Funderburke remembers a conversation between him and
Chris Webber in May 1998, days after Webber was dealt to Sacramento
from Washington. Funderburke, one of only several players still on
the Kings' roster from two seasons ago, recalled trying to assuage
Webber's worst fears about playing for a perennial lottery team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of blew me off,'' Funderburke said of their talk.
``And we were really good friends. So I'm like, `Chris, come on.' I
knew he was upset by the trade. I just didn't know how long he
would take to get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Webber plays on a team with the best record in the NBA.
He is laughing as he takes those big, loping strides up the court,
shaking his head as teammates affectionately rub his clean-shaven
pate.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night against the Nets at Arco Arena, he became the
first player this season to record double figures in points,
rebounds and assists. This was not your grandfather's
triple-double. Webber dunked maliciously five times, scored 26
points, hauled down 22 rebounds and distributed 10 assists; three
were breathtaking, behind-the-back passes in traffic, passes that
materialized in the hands of cutting teammates for layups and
dunks.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, as Webber gathered his belongings in the locker room
and the Kings had surpassed the 1952-53 Rochester Royals for the
best start in franchise history, Funderburke saw the difference in
a team and a onetime disgruntled teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Sacramento being a blip on the map, a cow town
where no one wanted to play,'' he said. ``Now Chris loves it. He
wants to be here. If you would have asked him that before he came,
he would have said: `Impossible. I don't want to have anything to
do with this place.'
</P>
<P>
   If the transformation of the Kings has been stunning, so too has
the transformation of Webber. The former malcontent who claimed he
would not remain in Sacramento has already intimated that he plans
to sign a contract extension with the club after the millennium. It
has been a long wait, but Webber has found the camaraderie and
contentment he has longed for since his Fab Five days at Michigan
and his formative days at Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the Warriors host the 2000 All-Star Game in
February. Asked if a first-ever selection would bring his career
full circle, he said: ``No, because I should have been on the
All-Star team two other years. So no, I don't think by far I'm
playing much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have to redeem any season of me playing. If
anything, people want me to redeem something off the court or
something they heard about. But, play? That's something I'll never
have to redeem or will redeem. Because I give it my all every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber was traded from Golden State before the 1994-95 season
after feuding with coach Don Nelson. He played on a promising
Washington team that self-destructed in 1998. Soon, Webber received
more attention for problems off the court.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Webber was fined $500 for carrying a small
amount of marijuana that was detected by dogs at an airport in San
Juan, P.R. Last December, he was acquitted by a Prince George's
County jury in Maryland on charges of possession of marijuana,
driving under the influence of the drug, resisting arrest and
second-degree assault. He was found guilty of two traffic
violations and a misdemeanor charge during a traffic stop that
could have led to a jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Like another Warrior traded to the East Coast, he was vilified
in the Bay Area after the deal. But unlike Latrell Sprewell, Webber
harbors no resentment toward his first team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a love-hate relationship anymore with me and Golden
State,'' Webber said. ``The coach is not there anymore. There's not
one player there from the era when I was there. They've even
reconstructed the whole gym. It seems like I get love there. I'm
going to get my boos, but I get love there.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber added: ``Don't get me wrong. I would love to be an
All-Star. But I know that sometimes you can play that way and not
be one. So my concentration is on playing and making us win. It's
the first time I've been in a winning position like this.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning or losing, most players on NBA teams develop bonds
over time. Yet Webber's relationships with his teammates in
Sacramento have been noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to attend the Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield rematch
with Jason Williams and a few other teammates earlier this month.
Vlade Divac was in charge of transportation, Webber procured the
tickets and, just like that, the Kings were hanging out in Las
Vegas amid the glitter and gaudiness. During a preseason game in
Detroit, the entire team went out for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it is,'' Webber said. ``If there were more children
on this team, some guys would be baby-sitting them and watching
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago against Houston, Webber was having a miserable
game. But the Kings' bench caught fire and essentially won the
game. Near the end, the starters stood and waved towels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when I play bad, I don't say anything,'' Webber said.
``I'm in my head, fighting myself. This team, it was like our bench
was doing so well and we just went with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Funderburke said: ``I look at San Antonio; all the guys on the
team liked each other. From the standpoint of being selfish,
bickering and complaining, there was none of that. We had great
camaraderie last year.''
</P>
<P>
   There were times when you wondered if Webber would ever get it,
understand his potential as a player and realize he could be part
of the solution to his team's problems. Those days appear to be
gone, disappearing faster than Sacramento's lottery picks.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Used to Losing
</P>
<P>
   Either the Houston Rockets have incredible perspective or
they're truly in denial. After dropping to 3-11 on Friday night
after an overtime loss to Portland, their locker room at the Rose
Garden bordered on jovial.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley, having missed 8 of 11 shots in his first
meeting with Scottie Pippen (whom Barkley engaged in a verbal
barrage during the off-season) joked with coach Rudy Tomjanovich
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley playfully inquired why Matt Bullard, and not he, took a
potential game-tying 3-pointer in overtime. ``Coach, let me tell
you something, I need that last 3,'' Barkley said. ``Bull? Bull
can't shoot like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the corner of a Rose Garden locker room was Hakeem
Olajuwon, who had pulled his groin early in the game and was
expected to miss the remaining three games of the team's road trip.
He bristled at the notion that his once-proud team had learned to
accept losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you get used to that?'' he said. ``We can't get used
to that. It's not lack of effort. This team goes out every night.
We play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich, who has resurrected teams from the grave before,
said: ``I'm not used to something like this. We've been known for
our quick starts. November has been our month. I guess I'm getting
paid back for all that success we've had in the past. You've got to
be humble when you're doing well and you can't get yourself down
too low when things aren't going well. That's life.''
</P>
<P>
   A Better Shoot-Around
</P>
<P>
   Shoot-around practices the morning of a game are one of those
monotonous, required routines players look forward to about as much
as income tax returns and lower back pain. But Blazers coach Mike
Dunleavy seems to have found a cure.
</P>
<P>
   During last season's truncated 50-game campaign, Portland began
holding its walk-through one-hour practice three hours before the
game. Dunleavy found that it not only gave players most of the day
to take care of personal business, but it also gave his team a
little edge heading into that evening's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes sense,'' said Brian Grant. ``When you wake up in
the morning, drive to the arena, come home and then go back, it
just seems like your whole day is gone. The concentration level
before a game is much higher, I think. It's little things like that
that make you appreciate playing for this franchise.''  &QL;

DOHERTY DELIVERS AN EMOTIONAL RESCUE TO NOTRE DAME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., N.C., Md. ,  Ariz., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the official blew his whistle for a decision against Notre
Dame, Matt Doherty sprang up in front of the bench and became
airborne with impressive hang time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the highest I've gotten up since my freshman year in
college,'' said Doherty, who played at North Carolina in the 1980s
and is the first-year head coach of the Fighting Irish.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Doherty's shoes landed loudly on the wooden floor at
Madison Square Garden, he seemed to regret his reaction.
Demonstrations such as these, even from veteran coaches, often draw
technical fouls. When Doherty touched down, he immediately turned
away from the referee, who stared at him and walked toward him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quick, emotional outburst; I got carried away,''
Doherty said. ``So I turned my back. I didn't want him to think I
was being a jerk. I'm not trying to show up the referee.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sensing Doherty's state of mind, the official calmly
lectured him as Doherty took his chair, nodding and bowing his head
without speaking. There was no behavioral harm, so no technical
foul. It didn't matter immediately, as Notre Dame lost 72-67 to
Maryland in the consolation game of the preseason National
Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before, in the semifinals, the Irish lost 76-60 to
Arizona, which defeated Kentucky, 63-51, in the championship game
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Doherty's demonstration illustrated the temperament of the
young coach, who is trying to restore the program to NCAA
tournament status after a nine-year absence. Even Dick Vitale,
ESPN's hyper host of hoop hyperbole, said last week that Doherty
was a rather intense fellow.
</P>
<P>
   And Doherty's style may be working. In both defeats in New York,
the Irish played with spirit and a refusal to concede. Their record
is 3-2, compared with 1-4 after five games last season under John
MacLeod. The best player on the team, the sophomore forward Troy
Murphy, is playing impressively and voicing strong opinions about
the program's new direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't give up,'' Murphy said. ``Coach Doherty has
really instilled a lot of toughness that wasn't there. We just
keeping going and we play hard. He really gets us fired up. We
compete. Last year we were losing to smaller teams and now we're
competing with some of the top teams in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As Murphy spoke, his coach joined him at the news conference
table and hugged Murphy's shoulder. Doherty did the same thing
after the previous game. Perhaps these gestures suggested his inner
emotions during a difficult week for his first major road trip.
Minutes before the team left the South Bend, Ind., airport, the
coach's 2-year-old son, Tucker, broke a bone in his leg when he
fell near the departure gate.
</P>
<P>
   The accident kept Doherty at home an extra night and forced his
players to reschedule a Tuesday afternoon practice for Tuesday
night, on the eve of the semifinal. Doherty apologized Friday night
for overworking them and tiring them before facing Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   As for his son, Doherty said: ``He's doing OK &UR; . &LR;  He's in a full
body cast. A kid doesn't understand why he's confined. He can't sit
up. He can't crawl. He can't walk. He can't do anything. The first
time I called, he screamed. The second time I called, he said `Hi,
Daddy.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, 37, is a native of East Meadow on Long Island, and he
played in high school at Holy Trinity in Hicksville before playing
with Michael Jordan at North Carolina under Dean Smith. Before
beginning his coaching career as an assistant, first at Davidson
and then at Kansas, Doherty worked for more than three years as a
bond salesman for Kidder Peabody &AMP; Co. in New York during the
``Bonfire of the Vanities'' era.
</P>
<P>
   In his biography in the school's media guide, Doherty recalled
sleeping with a basketball as a child and getting his first jock
strap before going to his first basketball camp at St. Anthony's
High School in Smithtown. He recalled what it was like to grow up
Irish Catholic in the New York area and how he enjoyed the Knicks
in their championship era.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a Long Islander, he attended Nets games, before they
moved from Nassau County to New Jersey, and he cheered for Julius
Erving, before he moved from Uniondale to Philadelphia. Doherty's
favorite player was Rick Barry, a Long Islander known for a
successful but strident style, a perfectionist mentality and a
penetrating voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to shoot like Dr. J and act like Rick Barry,'' Doherty
said.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday night's game, when another whistle stopped play,
Doherty clenched his fist and shook it and shouted to one of his
players: ``What defense were we in?'' When he got an answer,
Doherty shouted his response. ``No!''
</P>
<P>
   He has wiry silver hair, thick dark eyebrows and the lanky look
of so many college coaches. He said repeatedly last week that he
wanted his players to ``hurt'' when they lost. And he said his team
belonged among the elite of college basketball and expected to get
there soon and that he loved the kids on his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the kind of kids you want to date your daughter,''
Doherty said. ``But, on the court, I want them to be jerks. I want
them to be cocky, arrogant, confident, tough suckers who are going
to battle on the court. Off the court, we can wear our shirts and
ties and be nice kids and go to church.''

ULSTER UNIONISTS OPEN WAY FOR RULING WITH SINN FEIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Opening the way for a new
power-sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Unionist
Party on Saturday approved its leaders entering government with its
sworn rivals from Sinn Fein, the political ally of the Irish
Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark vote sets off a series of steps by the British and
Irish governments to transfer power from London to Belfast within
days, and marked the successful crowning of months of patient
mediation by George Mitchell to salvage the April 1998 peace
settlement for the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clears the stalemate,'' David Trimble, the party leader,
said after the vote, referring to the deadlock over IRA disarmament
that had halted all progress on the peace settlement, and had
deepened concern over Ulster's capacity to rise above its violent
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done our bit,'' he said, adding that the next move was
up to Gerry Adams, president of the overwhelmingly Catholic Sinn
Fein party. ``Now Mr. Adams, it's over to you. We've jumped. You
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact voted on Saturday, the IRA must appoint a
representative on Thursday to the independent commission on
disarmament headed by the retired Canadian general John de
Chastelain, and the actual destruction of weapons must begin by
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said the vote also endorsed a decision to reconvene the
party council in February to ensure that the promised steps had
been taken.
</P>
<P>
   The clear implication was that if there had been no dismantling
of the IRA arsenal by then, the Ulster Unionists, the province's
largest Protestant party, would use the power it has to dismantle
the new government.
</P>
<P>
   It was another defining moment for the Northern Ireland peace
settlement, a complex effort to wring a lasting peace out of the
polarized political climate of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, this effort _ designed to end 30 years
of sectarian strife by parceling out authority between the
province's Protestant majority and its Roman Catholic minority _
has had to survive a cliff-hanging series of referendums,
legislative elections and 11th-hour deals.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize winner who had staked his
leadership of the party on Saturday's balloting, emerged with the
backing of 58 percent of delegates _ 480 in favor to 349 against _
enough to ensure the establishment of home rule government in
Belfast next week but not enough to avoid leaving his party deeply
divided. He had hoped for at least 60 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   The steps that bring home rule government to Belfast begin
Monday with the naming of the members of the assembly executive,
which effectively becomes Northern Ireland's cabinet. Under the
power-sharing formula, Trimble will be first minister and Seamus
Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, the largest
Catholic group, will be his deputy. The 10 other cabinet seats are
apportioned with three to the Ulster Unionists, three to the Social
Democratic Labor Party and two each to Sinn Fein and the Democratic
Unionists of the Rev. Ian Paisley.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the House of Commons in London takes up the bill to
transfer power to Belfast, and, by prearrangement, passes it on
Wednesday. On Thursday, the assembly is to hold its first session
as a fully empowered legislature with the Sinn Fein members Martin
McGuiness and Bairbre de Brun as ministers in the new Northern
Ireland government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   For the Ulster Unionists, the most powerful voice of Protestant
politics in Northern Ireland, Saturday's vote was a significant
step away from a history of stubborn refusal to participate in
arrangements designed to share power with Catholics. Unionists have
often been caricatured as a clan of obdurate naysayers, and Paul
Bew, professor of politics at Queen's University, said he hoped
their willingness to risk cooperating with their republican
opponents would now ``destroy the crude stereotyping of an entire
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Unionists wish to see Ulster remain part of Britain while
republicans, most of whom are Catholic, want the province to move
toward eventual incorporation into the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three decades, paramilitary groups have risen up
on both sides of the argument, installing in this corner of
Northern Europe a brutish culture of vengeance that has cost the
lives of more than 3,300 people.
</P>
<P>
   Unionism is a political movement with zealous followers that
dates from the days of Protestant domination of power in the North
but has had to adapt to the rise in Catholic influence and the
change in republican tactics from organized violence to political
maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   This shift was shown by the fact that the two men most
responsible for the party's swing toward an approval vote in the
past 10 days of intense lobbying _ Trimble and his deputy, John
Taylor _ were both key players in the wrecking by Protestant forces
of the last attempt at power-sharing government, a short-lived
Stormont administration 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble faced strong opposition to going forward with
participation in the power-sharing government because the decision
represented the abandoning of principle by a party that takes its
principles with almost religious seriousness. Followers objected to
his having dropped the pledge _ known in constantly repeated party
shorthand as ``no guns, no government'' _ that there would have to
be a start to IRA disarmament before members of Sinn Fein could
take up their government seats.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate put a complete brake on progress in July, when the
Ulster Unionists boycotted the session of the assembly at which the
nominations to the executive cabinet were to be made.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments asked Mitchell, the former
U.S. senator who was chairman of the original talks, to return on a
rescue mission. That 11-week effort resulted in a deal, announced
10 days ago, that was put to the Ulster Unionists on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was eagerly anticipated. ``After so many years of
deadlock, the speed with which events are unfolding is
breathtaking,'' The Belfast Telegraph commented in an editorial. It
said that a vote supporting Trimble, which it favored, was ``in our
terms the equivalent of the fall of the Berlin Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Trimble's rival parties wished him success. Reflecting a
new political language of mutual accommodation that was an
achievement of the Mitchell review, Adams told a meeting of his
party in Dublin last week, ``I do not underestimate the
difficulties that have to be overcome in the time ahead, especially
for the Ulster Unionist Party and its leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble argued that in exchange for relaxing their demand for
immediate IRA weapons turnover, the unionists were gaining
self-rule, the right to keep Ulster British as long as its
residents wished it, the end to the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement that
gave Dublin joint authority with Britain in some of the North's
affairs, and the withdrawal of the clauses in the constitution of
the Irish Republic that make a territorial claim on Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that by making their move first, the Ulster
Unionists, weary of being blamed for intransigence, were
transferring responsibility for the continuation of the new
government to the republican movement.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to shore up support for a yes vote was a tough one.
Campaigners reported the unsettling and poignant experience of
finding that individuals they were asking to take a chance on Sinn
Fein's word had had friends and family members killed in IRA
attacks in recent years. The paramilitary cease-fires began only
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble was opposed by major figures in the party, including six
of the 10 Ulster Unionists in the British Parliament, who accused
him of ``letting terrorists into government.'' In a comment typical
of the strong feelings of opponents, the Young Ulstermen of the
Upper Bann said the approval vote was ``akin to turkeys voting for
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Paisley, the chief opponent of the peace settlement, told a
meeting of his hard-line Democratic Unionist Party in a Belfast
suburb that Trimble would face a dogged opposition in the new
assembly from his party members and disaffected Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice trembling with fury, he said, ``It is an opposition,
Mr. Trimble, that you have betrayed with your lying and deceit.''

FOR VIRGINIA TECH, 11-0 COMPUTES TO SUGAR BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ Frank Beamer is a muddy tennis shoes kind of
guy. His coaching cap is of the truck driver variety _ billed, with
logo, pulled down over his eyes. But the Virginia Tech coach didn't
waste much time on Friday trading in his school's hat for the 1999
Big East champion's crown.
</P>
<P>
   His Hokies had just walloped Boston College, 38-14, and he had
something to say. It was a quiet pronouncement, tossed off as
casually as he tugged the bill of the newly minted championship hat
down to the bridge of his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't mind if I put my hat on, do you?'' he asked,
searching a classroom in the team's field house as if it were the
coffee lounge off the John Deere showroom. ``I'll tell you what. If
I had a Sugar Bowl hat, I'd put that on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was spoken with the assurance of a man who has survived a
2-9, a 3-8 and a 2-8-1 season. Those stone-cold numbers illustrate
the depths of the experience Beamer lived through during the first
six years of trying to put his alma mater on the college football
map. That sort of data would have choked the Bowl Championship
Series computers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven years, however, Beamer's won-lost-tied ledger
looks as if it was reflected through a fun house mirror. Beamer is
64-19 in that span, now the architect of an 11-0 regular season and
the sideline stalking embodiment of The Serenity Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer can accept the things he cannot change _ even if it means
eight computer services might somehow conspire to leave the Hokies
out of the Sugar Bowl, this year's title match with top-ranked
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done our talking on the field,'' Beamer said. ``It's
the only thing that has been in our power.''
</P>
<P>
   He has demonstrated the courage to change what the Hokies can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got it rolling now,'' Beamer said. ``This isn't the last
time this is going to happen. We're going to do this again.''
</P>
<P>
   He has obtained the wisdom to know the difference. Or at least
his players act as if they have. ``The best two teams are going to
play at the end of the year,'' linebacker Cory Bird said. ``We're
one of them. If not, we're going to represent the Big East in the
Orange Bowl, where there is still a chance to win a split national
title.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been the Hokies' mantra for the last six weeks and, it
has been backed up by fact as well as faith. Virginia Tech has the
nation's top scoring offense (41.7 points a game), the second-best
scoring defense (10.2 point average) and has outscored its ranked
opponents by 174-31.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer and Virginia Tech's belief can still be proved a heresy,
but it might take some otherworldly circumstances. In the latest
BCS ranking, six computer services have the Hokies ranked ahead of
the 10-1 Nebraska Cornhuskers. At least three, and probably as many
as five, have to flip-flop that assessment for Nebraska to overtake
Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely when one stacks up Friday's games, Virginia
Tech's 24-point victory over the 8-3 Eagles against the
Cornhuskers' 33-30 overtime victory over Colorado. Virginia Tech
presumably charmed, finally, the computers that reward margin of
victory while Nebraska took a deduction for struggling against the
Buffaloes (6-5).
</P>
<P>
   Beamer, 53, is rightly proud of how far he and his team have
come. In those lean years, Hokies boosters gave him credit for
being a Tech-man, but not much as a coach. In 1990, for example, he
refused a pay raise in a show of solidarity with other Virginia
Tech faculty members and staff whose salaries at the time were
frozen by the state. Since then, he and his wife, Cheryl, have
twice donated $50,000 to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Beamer will take his seventh consecutive Hokies team to
a bowl game, he has finally been noticed outside the state.
Officials at Georgia, South Carolina and Clemson approached him in
recent years about vacancies in their programs. His name already
had been mentioned for the Louisiana State job when Gerry DiNardo
was fired in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   If Nebraska thrashes Texas in next week's Big XXII Championship
Game and somehow bumps Virginia Tech from the national title game,
the Hokies remain in position to show up college football's
complicated mathematical formula. If they beat the winner of the
Southeastern Conference championship game _ either Florida or
Alabama _ in the Orange Bowl and Nebraska beats Florida State in
the Sugar, there is a possibility for a split championship. The
Cornhuskers and the Seminoles each would have one loss while the
Hokies would be 12-0.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches' poll has agreed to award its national championship
to the winner of the BCS title game, but voters from the news media
in the AP poll are likely to name the undefeated Hokies as the best
team in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Complicated? Not for the coach in the cap and the tennis shoes.
Before he sent his players off to study for final exams and to wait
another week for the final BCS poll numbers, Beamer pulled on the
bill of his Big East championship cap one more time. He asked the
simple question, ``Does anyone in this room think we don't deserve
to be in the Sugar Bowl?''
</P>
<P>
   When no one disagreed, he continued, ``There's something
terribly wrong if we don't get in.''
</P>
<P>
   But then a brighter thought overtook him. ``Like I said,'' he
promised of his burgeoning program. ``I don't think it's the last
time you'll see us in that situation.''

 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Mikhail Margelov has had his share of challenging
assignments: assisting the KGB, working for the government news
agency Tass, and then, in 1996, helping to produce the ads for
President Boris Yeltsin's come-from-behind campaign. His new job
tops them all: selling Russia's war in Chechnya to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a leaf out of NATO's book during its bombing of
Yugoslavia, which was highly unpopular in Russia, and a lesson from
the Chechen rebels during Chechnya's last war in 1994-96, the
Russian government has established a center to organize news
coverage of the Chechen conflict. As director of this operation,
Margelov, 34, is trying to bring Western public relations
techniques to a military that once scorned public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Working with military, intelligence and press ministry
officials, he presides over twice-daily briefings, while his staff
organizes guided press trips to view the Russian troops in
Chechnya. His center, the Russian Informational Center, or
Rosinformcenter, has even set up a Web site (www.infocentre.ru.),
that coaches Russian officials and journalists on the politically
acceptable way to report the war.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on Russian casualties, his center advises, should always
be described as ``minimal,'' ``inconsiderable'' or ``unavoidable.''
Russia's adversaries should never be portrayed as Chechen fighters
or field commanders, but ``bandits'' or ``international
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a step toward political correctness,'' Margelov said in
an interview. ``We don't punish the journalists if they don't use
these terms, but we are trying to explain how we see the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Government attempts to influence the press in wartime are
nothing new. The Pentagon controlled the media's access to American
troops during the Persian Gulf war of 1991. And it was NATO
spokesmen who described the accidental killing of civilians in the
bombing over Yugoslavia last spring as ``collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Western-style press operation offered by Rosinformcenter
is something of a novelty here. Even as Russia deplored NATO's war
with Yugoslavia, it seems to have copied some of its public
relations techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it seems like they are trying to outdo Jamie Shea,''
said Aleksandr Goltz, a military reporter for Itogi, a news
magazine, referring to NATO's spokesman during the Kosovo conflict.
``It looks like the Russian military has learned a few lessons from
the press services of the Western armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The center has its share of critics among the Russian media who
say that it is simply a giant fog machine trying to shroud an
increasingly bloody conflict and this week's bombardment of Grozny
_ the heaviest of the two-month war _ in a cloud of self-serving
briefings, carefully supervised tours of Chechnya, a meager flow of
photographs from the front and outright propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, Rosinformcenter has been turned into some sort of
propaganda department and mouthpiece for the power center,'' said
Valery Yakov, a military correspondent with Novoye Izvestiya.
</P>
<P>
   Margelov, however, said the aim is simply to apply the lessons
from the last Chechen war, when Russia lost the battle for public
opinion to the beleaguered Chechen rebels, who also tended to be
more friendly to the media than Russian forces molded by decades of
Soviet censorship and secrecy. Russia's losses were huge, and
widely reported in Russian media, turning public opinion against
the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has learned several lessons from the previous conflict
in Chechnya,'' Margelov said. ``The previous conflict was not
supported by the public. One of the major reasons was that the
Russian mass media covered that conflict in a very negative
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosinformcenter was established in early October on the order of
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who like Margelov has a background
in the intelligence services. Putin has staked his presidential
hopes on the success of Russia's military campaign in the Caucasus
and has seen his poll ratings rise as Russian troops have continued
their thrust into Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the public relations job is easier this time. It
is not clear who bombed apartment buildings in Moscow and elsewhere
in Russia in September, killing almost 300 people, but the Russian
public broadly accepts that it was the work of Islamic militants in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   And Russian military casualties _ 305 Russian soldiers and
Interior Ministry troops have died in the war, according to
Rosinformcenter _ are just a fraction of the thousands who perished
last time.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens have also lost some of their sympathizers in the
media. Kidnappings were so pervasive in Chechnya before the war
that very few Russian or foreign reporters have recently ventured
there. Even now, reporters are wary of entering Chechen-controlled
territory to hear the Chechen side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Russian bombardment and near-encirclement of the Chechen
capital, Grozny, have also made access extremely difficult, and
dangerous. Still, Russia has been assailed in the West for using
blunderbuss tactics that unnecessarily risk the lives of civilians.
In recent weeks, some Russian journalists have become more
critical, too. And the Chechens have their own Web site
(www.kavkaz.org.) that dispenses their version of the war, laced
with a heavy dose of politics. On Friday, for example, the Web site
reported that Yeltsin had died.
</P>
<P>
   Margelov is fluent in English, lived for eight years in the
Middle East and taught Arabic at the KGB's academy. He briefly
worked for Tass, the government news agency, and for several
Western management consulting firms. He was then a top executive at
Video International, one of Russia's most profitable advertising
agencies, which prepared the ads for Yeltsin's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Margelov works closely with Aleksandr Mikhailov, a former
spokesman for the KGB and Interior Ministry, who left military
service with the rank of lieutenant general. Mikhailov said that
his job is to take the mixture of conflicting data from Russia's
military, Interior Ministry, border troops and intelligence
services and fashion it into a single message that Margelov and
other briefers can present to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The center's work has not always gone smoothly. When Russian
rockets rained down on a marketplace in Grozny last month, Margelov
was with Putin, who was meeting European officials in Helsinki,
Finland. Bereft of information from the battlefield, Putin and
other Russian officials initially denied any Russian involvement.
The Russian military only belatedly acknowledged that it was
responsible for the attack. The episode was a powerful blow to the
Russian government's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good example of why we need cooperation in the sphere
of information,'' Mikhailov said. ``We did not get any answers to
our questions. I think it was the initiative of local commanders
who did not think about the political consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Rosinformcenter provide as many specifics as
journalists would like. It has not, for instance, revealed the
number of Russian forces in Chechnya or listed the units involved.
</P>
<P>
   It is also still setting up a system to accredit journalists and
supervise their battlefield visits. More than 70 Russian
journalists have been accredited; they do not live with the troops,
but visit Russian forces in Chechnya escorted by Russian officials.
Some correspondents chafe at the supervision, asserting that their
access is limited and that the escorts discourage the soldiers from
speaking honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no formal censorship, but there is kind of a code of
political correctness,'' Margelov replied, noting that reporters
are encouraged to withhold details about the number and location of
Russian units.
</P>
<P>
   Rosinformcenter has also arranged two brief trips for the
foreign press to Chechnya. During a one-day trip to Chechnya last
week, the correspondents were free to wander off unattended and
talk directly to Russian soldiers and to Chechen civilians, who
were eager to criticize their new Russian masters.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the center's overall mission, however, is
to shape the way the media presents the conflict. Its press
guidelines caution against using the term ``humanitarian
catastrophe'' to describe the plight of civilians in Chechnya. It
warned that refugees should be called ``temporarily displaced''
persons. And it cautioned that it is improper to speak of Chechen
field commanders since ``terrorists do not have brigadier
generals.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still one bit of public relations that the Russian
military lacks: a patriotic name for its military operation like
Desert Storm, the Pentagon name for the Gulf war, or Just Cause,
the name of the American invasion of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unfortunate,'' said Margelov. ``I would love to have
one.''

TURKEY FACES A QUANDARY ON REBELLIONS BY ITS FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also RUSSIA-CHECHNYA) 
(jw) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ The war raging in Chechnya has exposed one of
Turkey's most delicate diplomatic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all Turks seem to support the uprising in Chechnya and
deplore Russian actions there, yet the government can protest only
gently. If it gives any support to ethnic rebellions abroad, it
might give the outside world a basis to criticize Turkey's policy
toward its Kurdish minority.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months this problem has become especially painful,
because two groups of Muslims with whom Turks feel deep ethnic and
cultural kinship, Kosovars and Chechens, have rebelled against
their governments. Most Muslims in Chechnya are ethnic Turks, and
those in Kosovo are the descendants of people who adopted Islam
during the centuries when they were part of the Turkish-dominated
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Turks overwhelmingly support the desire of people in Kosovo and
Chechnya to establish their political independence. But if their
government were to express that view, it would certainly face a
difficult question: If people in Kosovo or Chechnya deserve
autonomy or independence, why not Kurds in Turkey?
</P>
<P>
   Fighters from the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the PKK,
have been waging war against the Turkish state for 15 years. The
rebels say they are now ready for peace, but the government has
spurned their overtures and demanded that they surrender
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
   Successive Turkish governments have refused to grant any form of
self-rule to the Kurdish region. They have said they cannot accept
the establishment of Kurdish-language universities or television
stations because doing so will threaten national unity. This
position makes it difficult for officials here to support demands
for self-rule in Kosovo or Chechnya, at least in public.
</P>
<P>
   The awkwardness of this situation was evident during this
month's Istanbul summit meeting of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. Many countries with far less emotional
connection to Chechnya strongly protested Russian actions.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France called Russian policy ``a
tragic error for the whole region,'' and Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder of Germany condemned Russia for waging ``a war against a
whole people.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, however, was all but silent. Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
said on the eve of the meeting that Turkey was ``confident that the
problem can be solved peacefully in line with the territorial
integrity of the Russian Federation.''
</P>
<P>
   The same reluctance was evident when Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit visited Moscow before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some opposition figures urged Ecevit to cancel his trip in
protest over Russian actions in Chechnya. He refused to do so, and
before leaving called Chechnya ``Russia's internal problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We give as much importance to the unity of other countries,
including Russia, as we give to our own unity,'' Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
   Comments like these have upset many people in Turkey, where
there is widespread sympathy for Muslims in nearby countries. The
human rights committee in Parliament has taken the unusual step of
preparing its own statement denouncing Russian actions in Chechnya.
It is to be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``On his way to Russia, Ecevit said that Chechnya is Russia's
internal affair,'' a columnist, Ismet Berkan, wrote in a news
commentary. ``But in today's world, there can be no such thing.
Human rights have become globalized, and no state can justify
violating those rights by saying, `This is our internal concern.'''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Turkish policy toward the Kurds, however, say there
is no connection between Kurdish nationalism, which they say is
propelled by terror, and Chechen nationalism, which they describe
as a drive for liberation from a cruel colonial power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who point to such similarities,'' said Dogan Gures, a
retired general who is now a member of Parliament, ``are either
quite ignorant or harboring bad intentions.''

 &HT;    Less `cheese,' more flash
 &HT;    By Jeff Adams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You know the routine. It's Christmas Eve and Aunt
Maude gets all the family in front of the Christmas tree for the
annual ``Christmas photo.'' It's a familiar photo because it's been
taken each year since you were 4, everyone scrubbed within an inch
of their life, every hair in place, dressed in their best clothes.
Everything has to be just right. If you could manage to forget the
ceremony, you need only go as far as the family album in the
section called ``Christmas.'' There they are, all the Christmas
photos from years past. The same picture with the same people and
the same forced smiles. The only thing that changes is the height
of the kids and the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   If the ``Christmas photo'' in front of the tree is fine, then
read no more. If you long for better seasonal photos, then here are
some tips.
</P>
<P>
   _ Candid moments: Taking all of your holiday photos with each
subject staring into the camera makes for some boring images. Take
the group shot for Aunt Maude, but then try to capture the flavor
of the event through candid moments.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of cousin Billy surprised at his new fire truck is a far
better image than Billy staring into the camera with the truck
under his arm. Try to anticipate what will happen so you can be
ready with the camera to take an image. (No fair setting up the
moment again if you didn't get it on film when ithappened.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Slices of life: Zeroing in on elements of an event can be
rewarding. Rather than a photo of the entire living room when
everyone is opening presents, zero in on one person. A tight shot
of each family member is more telling than a overall photo of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   If your camera is equipped with a zoom lens, it's a good time to
use it. It doesn't have to be a long telephoto lens. An 85mm or
105mm lens is great at getting closer and eliminating distracting
background. _ Watch your lighting: Even wonder why the photo of
Maude in front of the living room window always comes out dark? The
problem is called backlighting. The problem with such photos is
that without a flash most cameras with auto exposure will read the
window as very bright and will adjust the exposure accordingly. The
camera doesn't know that you want a photo of Maude and not the
window. There is more light from the window than there is on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   To eliminate the problem, be careful when shooting photos where
a bright light source (window, lamp, etc.) is in the frame. If the
light source can't be avoided, using a flash can help add more
light to the subject and balance the strong backlight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Background, background, background: To paraphrase an old real
estate saying, ``There are only three things important in
photography: background, background and background.'' What will
separate so-so photos from good or great holiday photos is the
background. Because photographs are two-dimensional representations
of a three-dimensional world, most photographers see only the
subject when taking pictures. A telephone pole five feet behind
aunt Maude seems like it is coming out of her head in the
photograph.
</P>
<P>
   _ Picking the right film: Most amateur photographers think that
the faster the film (the higher the ISO) the better. But film
should be matched to the type of photos that are taken. The higher
the ISO, the more expensive the film and the more sensitive it is
to light.
</P>
<P>
   But as the ISO goes up, the quality of the image goes down. A
photo of the front of your house will have better color with 100
ISO film than 400 ISO. Most of the time, image quality and film
speed isn't an issue, because most everyone selects the standard
3-by-5-inch photos that comes with developing film. When a frame is
enlarged to an 8-by-10-inch print or larger, quality becomes more
of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   If most of the images you take are outside in direct or indirect
sunlight, consider using a slower film, such as 100 ISO, because
you have all the light you need. If most of the photos you take are
with a flash, you might try 100 ISO as well because your camera is
providing the necessary lighting. If you are shooting in available
light (without a flash) and some of the time it is dim, you'll need
to use a faster film, such as 400 ISO or higher. The past decade
has seen a dramatic improvement in image quality of high-speed
films. If you want to stop action in dim available light, explore
800 ISO or higher.
</P>
<P>
   _ Above all, have fun taking photos of the last holiday season
of the century.

 &HT;    Rappers' latest project
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Ronald ``Slim'' and Bryan ``Baby'' Williams grew
up in the inner city, and they say their hearts will always be in
the 'hood.
</P>
<P>
   Their homes are another story.
</P>
<P>
   As the CEOs of Cash Money Records, a rap label that signed a $30
million distribution deal with Universal last year and features
stars Juvenile and B.G., the Williams brothers could afford to live
wherever they wanted. They chose the heart of suburban America: a
high-security, gated golf community called English Turn across the
river from downtown New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Living away from the inner city in an exclusive community has
become a rap status symbol as important as gold teeth, diamond
necklaces, Cadillac SUVs and stretch ``Hummers.'' And status
symbols are a Cash Money trademark. Many of their songs _ including
B.G.'s hit, ``Bling! Bling!'' _ are chiefly a list of what their
newfound wealth can buy: cars, jewelry, helicopters, women, drugs
and booze. Baby recently gave Slim a $350,000 Bentley convertible
for his birthday, and Slim doesn't even drive.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was formed in 1991, Cash Money has produced 30 albums,
many chart toppers earning big bucks for the Williams brothers.
</P>
<P>
   What Slim's status required were rooms with a view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my real estate agent I wanted water and windows,'' said
Slim, who is almost 7 feet tall with a build to suit his name. ``I
was looking for somewhere to get away from the business.''
</P>
<P>
   He got it. His creamy stucco house is tucked far into the quiet
community and sits on a lagoon at the edge of an immaculate Jack
Nicklaus-designed golf course. His brother's house, across a
perfectly manicured cul-de-sac, is beige brick and sits on another
lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   In English Turn, houses range from $300,000 to $3 million and
belong mostly to doctors, lawyers and business owners. The most
famous resident besides the Cash Money executives is New Orleans
Saints football coach Mike Ditka. Baby, who is 28, and Slim, 31,
are not only unusual because of their business; they're also
probably two of the youngest homeowners in the community.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not the first rap moguls to storm the gates of white
privilege. Last year, Master P and the rappers of No Limit Records,
including C-Murder, Mystikal and Snoop Dogg, moved to the Country
Club of the South in Baton Rouge. Their neighbors include former
Gov. Edwin Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   There has been more speculation than actual problems associated
with the culture clash of up-from-the-ghetto rappers mingling with
the country club set. People said Master P, who earned more than
$56 million last year, bought extra houses just so he could get
more parking passes for his friends. And a rumor went around that
Snoop Dogg wanted to build a dog bone-shaped pool. The only real
stir was when Master P and his colleagues in Baton Rouge were
denied memberships at their community's golf club. Their lawyer
accused the club of racism but later backed down from the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of English Turn are automatically members of the golf
club, but none of the Cash Money crew plays golf anyway, Slim said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of both communities call the rappers good neighbors
who are rarely home. The Williams brothers said the only person
they know in the community is the security guard. They spend more
time in the housing projects of uptown New Orleans than in English
Turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't affect my life,'' said Tripp Friedler, a
businessman who lives a few streets down from the Williamses. ``If
I grew up in the projects, I'd live in English Turn. They're good
neighbors. Their houses look better than some of my neighbors'.
I've got some who don't cut the grass and don't keep the house
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedler added English Turn is not exclusively white. He
estimates about 10 percent of the homeowners are black.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses say they want to live in a gated community for
the same reasons as most people: They want a nice place to raise a
family, they want peace and quiet, and they don't want to be
bothered.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another reason. Like B.G.'s hit song says, it's
about ``Bling! Bling!'' Li'l Wayne calls it ``braggin' rights.'' A
teen-ager whose gold teeth say ``CASH MONEY,'' Wayne says he lives
with Baby in English Turn just so he can say he does.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile, 23, Cash Money's most famous rapper, won't say where
he lives, but it's definitely outside the city, on a lake, and far
from the C.J. Peete housing project, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just say I'm where the rich people live,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl James, publisher and editor in chief of Rap Sheet, said
rap stars don't move to these communities to thumb their noses at
rich white people. They're simply nice places to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have urban youth who grew up very hard and very
impoverished, and their dream if they make it is to live in the
very best portion of the city,'' he said. ``And that often happens
to be where whites are and where few blacks live.''
</P>
<P>
   But the irony is not lost on James.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gated communities are often for people who want to keep
society out and don't want people coming in,'' he said. Rappers who
make money speaking in profanities, glorifying drug use, casual sex
and violence would seem to be just the sort of ``society'' a gated
community is designed to keep out.
</P>
<P>
   But even if English Turn is their address, Baby and Slim have
not exactly made the community their home. Baby feigns utter
nonchalance about his move to English Turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my house, but it don't mean nothin' to me,'' he said.
``I ain't used to living like that. This is how I'm used to
livin'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This'' is the middle of the C.J. Peete public housing project,
a run-down collection of squat brick buildings where many windows
are broken and most walls are covered in graffiti. The smell of
marijuana and stale beer hangs in the air. Young men walk around in
tough-looking packs.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams brothers and their entire stable of rap artists
were here recently filming a made-for-video movie called ``Baller
Blockin','' due out early next year. It was hard for Elston Howard,
the producer, to tear them away from their old friends long enough
to film scenes.
</P>
<P>
   And while they don't live here, the Cash Money crew gives back
to the community. Slim organized a Thanksgiving dinner for the
needy. Juvenile's next goal is to help out his friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to set them all straight,'' he said, leaning against
his canary yellow Trans Am, one of six cars he owns. ``I don't want
them to have no more financial problems.''

COLLINS IS HOPING TO REWRITE HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoons growing up in the hardscrabble railroad
town of Lebanon, Pa., the pro football Kerry Collins watched on
television was almost always hearty and brawny football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked all the traditional teams _ Redskins, Giants, Bears,
Eagles,'' Collins said Friday at his Giants Stadium locker. ``Lots
of history, I just ate it up.''
</P>
<P>
   When he came out of Penn State in 1995 as the nation's top-rated
college quarterback, Collins would often tell reporters in the
weeks before the draft that he longed to be selected by one of the
NFL's older, established franchises.
</P>
<P>
   He instead became the first player in the history of the
expansion Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I was ever comfortable being the guy trying
to make a tradition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, more than four years later, Collins will start his first
game at Giants Stadium against the Arizona Cardinals. He admits
this leaves him with a certain sense of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting on a Giants helmet and running out of the Giants
Stadium tunnel is not just putting on another helmet and running
out of another football stadium tunnel,'' Collins said. ``It's an
honor. And with everything I've gone through lately, sometimes this
week I've found myself going: `Can you believe this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, like all reserve quarterbacks getting their first
chance to play before the home fans, will likely receive a generous
ovation when he takes the field Sunday. The honeymoon, of course,
will not last past one series if Collins stumbles and the offense
sputters.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment is nice, and it's great that Collins appreciates the
Giants' tradition in this, their 75th season in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But can he fix the Giants' broken offense?
</P>
<P>
   Because if you want to talk about Giants tradition, how about
six consecutive years of dreary, depressing offensive football?
</P>
<P>
   Can the fourth quarterback in the Jim Fassel era make Giants
fans enjoy watching the team when it has the football?
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Collins smiled at just such a question and then asked _
and answered _ one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't promise anything but this,'' he said. ``We will play
fast and quick. Giants fans might know a lot about me, but they
don't know me as a quarterback. And what would I tell them to
expect?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterback that runs out on the field won't be the same
one who has run out there any other time in his career,'' Collins
said. ``This is the best prepared I've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a whirlwind week around the Giants, with the urgency a
two-game losing streak brings, the changing of the quarterbacks,
the holiday and the death of Fassel's mother Wednesday night.
Through it all, it's been a week for the whole team to watch
Collins practice.
</P>
<P>
   And it's been action-packed. Not that all of it has been good.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, the wide receivers and running backs kept dropping
passes because Collins delivered the ball with such pace, using a
quick, snapping motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, Kerry isn't even looking at you,'' said running
back Tiki Barber. ``And all of a sudden, the ball is coming right
at your head. You have to always be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, the Giants' ends and backs were catching up to the
football, which is almost always a perfect spiral. Collins, in
football parlance, throws a nice ball _ arching when it needs to
be, usually accurate, sometimes with touch.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest thing Collins has brought is a vitality and
confidence. Excitable and talkative, he is nonetheless commanding
in a football huddle.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is just 26 years old, this is someone who was a
6-foot-5-inch, 15-year-old starting quarterback in high school,
where he played before crowds of 7,000 and more. He was an
all-America quarterback, and days after his 24th birthday he played
in a NFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he makes his 51st NFL start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has special talents,'' Fassel said of Collins. ``I hope
that people see the dramatic improvement he's made because he's
doing everything better.''
</P>
<P>
   His receivers with the Giants are certain the Giants' offense
will look different Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every quarterback has his different favorite throws or
favorite areas of the field where he looks first,'' Giants wide
receiver Amani Toomer said. ``So some of the same plays will look
different. Kerry likes putting it up there, I know that. And I like
running under it. And catching it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Patten, a Collins favorite who will replace Joe Jurevicius
Sunday as the team's new third receiver, said: ``He's a gambler. We
ran a two-minute drill in practice today and he hit me for a
touchdown on a post route. Next play, we're back at the 20-yard
line, so you figure something short, right? He threw another
touchdown to Amani on a deep sideline route. That's Kerry.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins likes to throw deep sideline routes, likes to throw
square-outs and likes to throw to tight end Pete Mitchell and wide
receiver Ike Hilliard in shorter, seam routes over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he has also thrown 67 interceptions in his career and
just 51 touchdowns. In parts of three games for the Giants this
season, he has four fumbles. He is fearless, but he has been
reckless, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry has a high-end ability you can't find in many guys,''
Fassel said. ``But he does have a low end. He isn't going to get
better going up and down like that. But if you can raise the low
end, then the median performance would be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants' running game still more of a decoy than a
weapon, it's likely Collins will be airing it out frequently
Sunday. That will take adequate pass protection, something Collins
did not have in his one previous start last month for the Giants.
But his speedy passing motion should help.
</P>
<P>
   And that's one thing Collins has no plans to do: wait around for
something to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for this, maybe for my whole life,'' he said
Friday. ``And I'm going to let it fly.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ What do call girls, hit-men and fictitious yeshiva
students have in common with soccer goalies, newspaper publishers
and former political leaders?
</P>
<P>
   That is what Israel wanted to know last week.
</P>
<P>
   A transfer of West Bank land to the Palestinians may be overdue.
Israeli-Vatican relations may be at a low point, and unemployment
may be at a record high.
</P>
<P>
   But it was scandal, and lots of it, that truly occupied the
country's attention.
</P>
<P>
   There was scandal of lust, scandal of greed, scandal of
corruption. There was scandal involving the national soccer team
for losing a key match following alleged pregame visits to a house
of ill repute. There was scandal involving former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sarah, accused of accepting bribes
and stealing valuable state gifts. And there was yeshiva scandal
aplenty.
</P>
<P>
   So much muck was being raked that the newspaper Yediot Ahronot
even ran a full-page scandal guide on Friday, with boxes for every
major affair, its suspects, its allegations and the status of its
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal of the week? It's hard to choose. It did create
quite a stir when the police took Ofer Nimrodi, publisher of the
newspaper Maariv, into custody on suspicions of plotting to murder
the state witness in his wiretapping trial.
</P>
<P>
   Nimrodi, 43 and a stylish Harvard Business School-educated
member of Israel's wealthy elite, was released from prison this
year after serving several months for illegally tapping the phones
of a panoply of media celebrities, businessmen and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in black, he clasped his manacled hands and looked
woefully at the cameras, through stylish wire-rim glasses, as he
was hustled into magistrate court. He remains in police custody but
charges have apparently not been filed. Nimrodi maintains that he
is being framed by a private detective who used to be in his hire
and is now serving a four-year sentence for his own complicity in
the wiretapping affair.
</P>
<P>
   But, in addition to conspiracy to commit murder, in which he is
suspected of making a down payment to a hit-man, Nimrodi is also
suspected of obstructing justice _ with the assistance of police
officers and lawyers. And on this charge, in particular, there is
one damning image that the Israeli public cannot erase from its
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television broadcast it several weeks ago, when word of
the police investigation first leaked. Israeli television showed a
video clip of Nimrodi alone in a police interrogation room with a
pile of documents. As the camera watched, he tore a piece of paper
from one, put it in his pocket, reconsidered and then stuffed it in
his mouth, chewed it and washed it down with a glass of water.
</P>
<P>
   The Nimrodi affair was Wednesday. On Thursday, five senior
Jerusalem city employees and four architects and building
contractors were arrested in what police believe may be a classic
municipal corruption case. Police suspect that the city workers and
their union chief accepted bribes, including cash and sexual
services, in exchange for awarding building contracts and
disregarding illegal construction.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, though, and in stiff competition for scandal du
jour was a suspected yeshiva money-laundering affair connected to
the corruption case of Aryeh Deri, the former Shas party leader.
Deri was convicted last spring and is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, police questioned a prominent businessman and his
lawyer partner. They are suspected of having laundered more than $2
million through the Itri yeshiva as supposed donations that were
meant to help finance Deri's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases include: the Rabbi Yaakov Chemed affair, in which
the former director of Shas' educational network is under
investigation for financial irregularities in the state-financed
school system; and the Fictitious Yeshivas affair, in which several
employees of the Religious Affairs Ministry are under investigation
for funneling millions of shekels to yeshivas that do not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Netanyahu and his wife, who have been repeatedly
questioned by the police, drags on like a persistent hum in the
background of a noisy society. Netanyahu claims that he is being
harassed by political opponents, and several political officials,
including those who are not in his camp, have criticized the police
for carrying out the investigation so publicly as to humiliate the
former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The case began when a building contractor, Avner Amedi, who has
since turned state's witness, submitted to the prime minister's
office a bill for $100,000 for services performed for the
Netanyahus during his term in office. That provoked an
investigation into suspicions of bribery, suspicions that the
contractor had provided the services free with the expectation of
getting favors in return.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the investigation, the police searched the
Netanyahus' apartment, storage rooms and offices and impounded
boxes they believed to contain valuable gifts to Israel that
belonged to the state, not the former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Did the soccer team scandal provide comic relief?
</P>
<P>
   Some were taking it quite seriously. The national soccer
association hired a private company to investigate the claims that
some key team members spent the night before a humiliating 5-0
defeat to Denmark in the company of call girls. Five players on the
team started their own Internet site to battle the ``witch hunt''
against them.
</P>
<P>
   But the British tabloids were calling it ``Whoregate,'' and an
Italian television satire show featured the new Israeli team
uniform: boxer shorts with site-specific holes. And some
tongue-in-cheek Israeli newspaper stories were citing new
scientific research questioning the premise that athletes should
avoid pregame sex to conserve their energy.

IN INDONESIA, REBEL LEADER GAINS FORUM FOR HIS CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIGLI, Indonesia, _ Abdullah Syafie is waging a guerrilla war
against Indonesia. But who has time to fight when the foreign news
media keep dropping by?
</P>
<P>
   Holstering his pistol and pulling out a tape recorder, Syafie
sat here recently for the latest in a long day of interviews. ``We
are fighting Indonesian colonialism,'' he said in the practiced
cadence of a candidate on the stump. ``We want to restore Aceh to
its status as a kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Syafie is the commander of the Free Aceh Movement, a rebel force
that is fighting for the independence of this devoutly Islamic
province on the far western edge of the Indonesian archipelago. The
guerrillas are one of several groups pushing the Indonesian
government to grant Aceh independence. As the separatist tensions
mount, Aceh is quickly becoming a grave threat to Indonesian unity.
</P>
<P>
   For Syafie, however, the emergence of Aceh as Indonesia's new
flash point merely means that he is no longer fighting in
obscurity. The 47-year-old guerrilla still holes up in a jungle
hide-out 10 miles off the main road to elude Indonesian soldiers.
But with journalists and camera crews pulling up to his thatched
hut all day long, he does not seem well hidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in danger,'' said the commander. ``If we were in
danger, you wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   With roughly 800 armed members, the Free Aceh Movement is hardly
a military machine. But because its troops live in remote villages,
it wields a disproportionate influence on the largely rural
population. For many of Aceh's 4.5 million people, these guerrillas
are the face of the separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
   And that face is a brutal one, the Indonesian military says. The
deputy commander of military operations here, Lt. Col. Iro Suparmo,
said the guerrillas were forcing non-Acehnese people to flee the
province. ``They are using the villagers as weapons in their
struggle,'' he said, ``and it is very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's generals have seized on the Free Aceh Movement as a
justification for Indonesia to impose martial law in the province.
Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, has so far resisted,
setting up a potential showdown between the army and the civilian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For Syafie the president's restraint means little. The rebel
leader said Wahid was untrustworthy and represented a government
with no legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have anything to do with Gus Dur,'' said Syafie,
using Wahid's nickname. ``If he were to come up here as a Javanese
person, maybe we could negotiate with him. But as long as he is
president of Indonesia, there is no way we will talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Free Aceh Movement, however, does not entirely speak and act
as one. Political analysts said the movement was split into a
militant faction that spurns compromise with the Indonesian
government, and a political wing that is open to negotiation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The group's roots extend to the 1950s, when Aceh began resisting
the newly established Indonesian republic. In the 1970s, a local
businessman, Hasan di Tiro, organized the group as a military
force. Now 77 and living in Sweden, di Tiro, who rejects
compromise, still exerts influence over group members.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrullah Dahlawy, a spokesman for the political wing of the
movement, said: ``We want to have a dialogue with Gus Dur on one
condition _ it has to be about independence, not autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Syafie said the movement had no need to placate the
government. With separatist tensions flaring up in several parts of
the country, he said, Indonesia was rapidly losing its sense of
nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for us to find evidence that Indonesia exists,''
Syafie said. ``People who call themselves Indonesians are having an
identity crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Syafie began his interview, he stood up and strode
to another corner of the hut, in front of the Free Aceh flag _
flanked by guerrillas with automatic weapons. The interview
resumed. The television cameras whirred. Abdullah Syafie was ready
for his close-up.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sunday, Nov. 28, have moved:
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   TRADE-REVIEW (Washington) _ They are pouring into Seattle this
weekend in vans and on buses, by air and on foot _ the college
students and the church groups, the environmental activists, the
Teamsters, Ralph Nader, Chinese dissidents and the man who became a
hero in France for defacing a McDonalds. All of them say they are
outraged at the growing power of a group few even heard about five
years ago, the World Trade Organization. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-REVIEW (Washington) _ Fair or unfair, the portrayals of
presidential candidates by the news media, the pundits and the
late-night comics are often exaggerated. But perhaps because these
images are often founded on some truth, they can be impossible for
politicians to overcome. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AIR-TRAVEL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Here are some of the things that
airline flight attendants have watched passengers lug on board:
Mariachi hats, potted palms, boogie boards, shopping bags brimming
with canned hams, a live duck in a cage, cases of wine,
covered-dish casseroles, multi-tiered wedding cakes, a
three-foot-tall religious statue for lawn display, an automobile
transmission and a freshly severed buck's head with its antlers
poking out of a trash bag. And they're carting a lot more stuff
aboard than ever before. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-RACE-REVIEW (Washington) _ At first, the survey results
seemed depressingly familiar: Nearly two-thirds of those who
responded in a poll said they had had a racially-offensive
encounter with a colleague during the 12 previous months. What is
startling about the latest manifestation of divergent racial
perceptions is the setting in which they occurred. This was the
military, an institution that has been held up as the paragon of
racial integration, tolerance and equal opportunity. By Steven A.
Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   LAWYERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Soon after EgyptAir Flight 990
plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, the personal-injury lawyers at R.
Jack Clapp and Associates marshaled their resources and mobilized
their forces. Faster than you can say class-action lawsuit, the
Washington, D.C., firm, which specializes in aviation disasters,
launched EgyptAir990.com _ a Web site that at first blush appears
primarily concerned with helping the bereaved deal with loss, but
on closer examination is all about financial gain. Such on-line
opportunism hardly burnishes the flagging reputation of lawyers. By
David Wallas.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ Once, Internet search sites served
as helpful road maps. With advances in artificial intelligence, one
day they might be brilliant secretaries. But today, they are in a
state of transition, slouching toward the human, growing more
philosophical. Mixing mechanical and personal elements, they have
turned into accidental wisefolk, spiritual advisers and drive-by
psychoanalysts. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST-FAMILIES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The White House has often
seemed confining to the wives of the men who lived there. Hillary
Rodham Clinton, seeking power that she did not have to exercise
through her husband, announced last week that she was moving to
Chappaqua, N.Y. Mrs. Clinton is not the first president's wife to
find the White House stifling and to leave a husband rattling
around in the whitewashed old pile on Pennsylvania Avenue. Several
presidential wives sought refuge from the burdens of first
ladyship. By John N. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Timlje, Kosovo) _ The former Kosovo Liberation
Army, which has supposedly transformed itself into a civilian force
with no military or police responsibilities, is not the only
challenge to the authority of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, known as
Unmik; the mission is also undermined by the international civilian
agencies that are supposed to serve it, and by the sheer size and
resources of the NATO-led force here _ 42,000 troops _ whose role
tends to be defined only as peacekeeping. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-COMRADE-REVIEW (Undated) _ It was perhaps no surprise that
the latest edition of China's dictionary of record, Cihai (The Sea
of Words), narrowed the definition of the word comrade _ or tongzhi
_ out of everyday life, concluding that it could no longer be
regarded as the greeting among China's citizens. By Elisabeth
Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-REVIEW (Washington) _ A new question has entered the
calculations of those who plan for peace or war in the Middle East:
Would democracies or dictatorships make the best neighbors and
partners in the emerging peace with Israel? By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-LETTERS-REVIEW (London) _ There remains a place where
letter-writing lives _ England. By Sarah Lyall.

</P>
<P>
   DEBATES _ WASHINGTON _ With a quote borrowed from an old movie _
``I paid for this microphone, Mr. Green!'' _ Ronald Reagan stole
the stage from his Republican opponents at a 1980 New Hampshire
debate. The tide began flowing against front-runner George Bush,
and didn't stop until it had swept Reagan into the White House. As
he prepares for his first confrontation with his GOP opponents Dec.
2, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas must face the fact that debates
have the power to dramatically shift a campaign's momentum.

   BUSHBRAIN _ WASHINGTON _ Is Texas Gov. George W. Bush smart and
does it matter? His Yale grades weren't great and he flunked the
pop quiz, but he's got a platoon of advisors and his supporters say
that's good enough. A look at a would-be president's intellect _
and at how he stacks up against the competition _ as a prelude to
the Dec. 2 debate. (Heath, Cox News Service).

<P>
   ANESTHESIA-WAR _ WASHINGTON _ Who will put you to sleep? The
controversy over the use of specially-trained nurses to administer
anesthesia at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.,
is part of a larger struggle between physician-anesthesiologists
and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). The nurses
argue that they were administering anesthesia before the medical
speciality of anesthesiology even existed and say they are fully
trained to give patients the pain-blocking and sleep-inducing
drugs. Anesthesiologists say the science is much more complex than
it was 100 years ago and the danger of sudden complications
requires the presence of a physician specialist. Not only military
medicine but Medicare and Medicaid payments are at stake. (Nesmith,
Cox News Service). 30.

   EDs: MOVED Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   BIOTECH _ WASHINGTON _ When European and U.S. trade negotiators
square off next week over the issue of genetically modified crops,
much will be riding on the outcome for a third group with very
little influence _ poor countries. Consumers in Europe and the
United States are up in arms over the fact that U.S.-produced food
items often contain undisclosed ingredients that come from
genetically-manipulated crops, and U.S. corporate interests argue
that there is no difference in these products and traditional
foods. But in places like Sierra Leone and India, the hope of more
productive crops from genetically altered plants could spell the
difference between hunger and famine. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

<P>
   KOSOVO-DIVIDE _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ In the spring, the Serbs
sought to drive ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. Since NATO troops
rolled into the province, the Albanians have been returning the
favor, killing hundreds of Serbs and burning their houses and
driving them out. Now the Serbs as well as Gypsies are a vulnerable
population who live in fear of constant reprisals. Aid workers
worry that the international community made a fatal error by
treating the end of the war as a triumph of the Albanians over the
Serbs, thus creating an environment that emboldened revenge seeking
Albanians. They also worry that the outside world - particularly
the donor community - will lose sympathy for the Albanians..

   RUSSIA-POLITICS _ ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Murder, arson and
jail time. These are not the sort of credentials that make for a
successful political career. But this is Russia and, more
specifically St. Petersburg, where the politics is not just
bare-knuckled, it is deadly. Yuri Shutov, a member of the local
city council, wants to be elected to the national parliament, the
Duma, in the Dec. 19 elections. He's running for office from a grim
prison cell. A political maverick, Shutov was been arrested for
murder and arson last February. He claims that he has been framed
by political enemies. Until he is formally charged and a trial date
has been set, he's free to hold his local office and run for a seat
in Moscow. A look at the rough world of Russia's democracy in
action. (Holmes, Cox News Service). 30.

SUSPICION FOLLOWS REV. MOON TO SOUTH AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., D.C.)   (jw) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JARDIM, Brazil _ As far as the eye can see, there is almost
nothing here but pasture, with the distant line of the horizon
broken only by tall anthills and an occasional tree. But the Rev.
Sun Myung Moon envisions this remote and sparsely populated corner
of Brazil as what he calls ``a kingdom of heaven on earth, a new
Garden of Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon, the 78-year-old founder of the Unification Church, who has
been rebuffed in the United States and is facing financial trouble
in his native South Korea, is seeking to reinvent himself here in
the South American heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Through a venture he calls New Hope East Garden, Moon has bought
thousands of acres of pasture land and spent some $30 million,
according to the project's manager, in hope of building a spiritual
and business empire here that is to include investments in
agriculture, industry and tourism, as well as a university.
</P>
<P>
   Such investment was at first welcomed in the neediest part of
Mato Grosso do Sul, a state whose own governor describes it as a
land of ``2 million people and 22 million cows.'' But increasingly,
Moon's visible presence here is generating the same sort of
opposition and suspicion that has followed him elsewhere around the
world during a long career as the self-proclaimed ``true father''
and successor to Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what he's up to out there, what are the
objectives of his investments or the origins of his money,'' the
governor, Jose Orcirio Miranda dos Santos, said in an interview.
``This has become an issue of national security, and I think an
investigation is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon's initial warm reception has quickly chilled, with charges
in the news media and from local church officials that the sect is
involved in improper activities. In October, local Roman Catholic
and Protestant churches jointly issued an open letter accusing Moon
of 10 forms of heresy, urging ``the people of God to keep their
distance from the Unification sect,'' and calling on local
officials to ``have the courage to remove this danger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than a sect, this is a business that hides behind the
facade of religion in order to make money,'' said Monsignor Vitorio
Pavanello, the Roman Catholic bishop of Campo Grande, the state
capital. ``He is trying to build an empire by buying everything in
sight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moon's associates offer a different explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our goal and desire to do something great for this
region,'' said Cesar Zaduski, a former president of the Unification
Church in Brazil and the general manager of the New Hope project.
``Rev. Moon has a lot of companies around the world, more than 300,
and his intention is to bring some of them here so that this region
can get the benefit of development and first world know-how and
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaduski said Moon was prepared to commit much more money to make
the New Hope venture viable. The objective, he said, is to produce
fish, exotic meats, fruit and wood for commercial markets here and
abroad, and to turn this area into a leading eco-tourism center
within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's representatives here said that their leader first visited
the region five years ago on a fishing trip and was impressed by
its wide-open spaces and enormous variety of wildlife. Since then,
his movement has bought 220 square miles of farmland in Mato Grosso
do Sul and a 310-square-mile parcel near Fuerte Olimpo on the
Paraguayan side of the nearby border, as well as hotels and other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's big push in this largely undeveloped corner of Brazil
comes as the business conglomerate he controls in South Korea has
nearly collapsed. Because of the economic crisis that swept across
East Asia beginning in 1996, the debt of his Tong Il Group soared
to more than $1.2 billion. Five of its 17 companies were forced
into receivership last year, and an automobile manufacturing
project in China has also failed.
</P>
<P>
   His diverse enterprises in the United States appear to be in
better shape. Those include a newspaper, The Washington Times, as
well as Bridgeport University in Connecticut, a recording studio
and travel agency in New York, and a cable network, the Nostalgia
Channel. But Moon has indicated recently that he is disenchanted
with the country that has been his main base of operations since
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``America doesn't have anywhere to go now,'' he said in a speech
in New York last year. ``The country that represents Satan's
harvest is America, the kingdom of extreme individuality, of free
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon's critics say that his view is growing harsher because of
the decline of his influence in the United States, where he was
imprisoned for a year after being convicted of tax evasion in 1982,
and where he has been the subject of embarrassing books and news
reports that his son and heir was addicted to cocaine and abused
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   While he was once believed to have about 30,000 followers in the
United States, the current number of church members is believed to
be about one-tenth that number.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Zaduski said Moon's interest in South America resulted from
a desire to focus on the Roman Catholic world, after emerging from
a Confucian and Buddhist environment and spending a long time in a
predominantly Protestant atmosphere. No place, he added, has a
larger concentration of Roman Catholics than South America, in
particular in the region of the customs union called Mercosur,
which consists of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia and
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``What unites South America is Mercosur, and what is the heart
of Mercosur?'' he asked. ``This region here, where you can build a
project that goes beyond borders. If we can build something here
that works, it can be an example to many other parts of South
America.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Moon has been active in Uruguay, Brazil's
southern neighbor _ so much so that the capital, Montevideo, is now
derisively called Moontevideo by some. There, the sect has acquired
the luxury Victoria Plaza Hotel, operates the newspaper Tiempos del
Mundo and retains an interest in a bank, Banco de Credito, in which
the government intervened last year after complaints of
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Moon built up good will early on by donating ambulances to
mayors, sponsoring barbecues for residents and making donations to
political campaigns. He also opened a school on his New Hope
property, invited local children to enroll and even offered to
provide transportation from their homes. But relations are now
openly hostile.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first began acquiring property here, we expected
that they would promote and contribute to the prosperity of our
region by generating jobs and taxes,'' said Marcio Campos Monteiro,
the mayor of Jardim, a town of 21,000 people. ``But all they seem
to be doing is stockpiling land, without producing anything or
hiring from the local labor force.''
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro contends that Moon's presence here has actually hurt
the local economy. The sect now owns 10 percent of the county, he
said, and government revenues have dropped because he has withdrawn
so much land from production and the tax rolls, claiming a
religious exemption.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hope site includes at least 20 buildings, but has less
than 200 permanent residents and many of those who work there are
Korean, Japanese, American and European volunteers who rarely leave
the compound and come for 40-day courses of instruction, paying
their own way as well as making donations.
</P>
<P>
   Civic and church groups have also begun to complain loudly, and
have even charged that local youths are being recruited and sent
off for indoctrination in Sao Paulo, where the sect has its
Brazilian headquarters. Though local police declined to discuss the
matter, there are also complaints that converts are being held
against their will at New Hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently had two young people who had run away from New Hope
come in here seeking help in getting back home to Pernambuco,''
1,500 miles away, said Bruno Padron, the Roman Catholic bishop
here. ``They focus on the poor and the needy, and once they have
them in their family, they refuse to let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports in the Brazilian news media have also suggested
that the sect may be involved in drug trafficking and other forms
of contraband smuggling across the notoriously porous border with
Paraguay in order to generate revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda dos Santos would say only that ``the federal government
is looking into those questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaduski dismissed such accusations as ``crazy stories'' and
illogical. ``Rev. Moon comes here quite often, so if his people

he said. ``That would be stupid, because he is a big target.''

   Despite the increasingly tense atmosphere here, Moon apparently
plans to plunge ahead. In September, the government extended Moon's
visa for two more years.

   ``He is really amazed by the way nature here is so pristine,''
Zaduski said. ``He wants the entire world to understand that the

that is why he is putting so much of his own time and guidance into
this.''

CROATIA LOOKS TO EUROPE AS LEADER NEARS DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ The imminent death of Croatia's founder and
president, Franjo Tudjman, no matter who succeeds him, will take
much of the personal animosity and heat out of the country's
strained relationships with Washington and the European Union,
turning at least a part of the Balkans more firmly westward, senior
Croatian officials and Western diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   The medical status of Tudjman, 77, whose myth is being burnished
by his shaken political party even as he lies incommunicado, was
relegated Saturday by doctors to ``very grave.''
</P>
<P>
   With parliamentary elections now scheduled for Jan. 3 _
elections that a center-left opposition coalition is expected to
win _ Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union, known here as
HDZ, is trying ``to exploit his disease and death to appeal to the
sentiments of voters,'' said Slaven Letica, a former Tudjman
adviser and political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But Tudjman's death ``will bring good news to Croatia in
political terms,'' Letica said. ``In general, the Croatian people
are tired of authoritarian leaders in this century _ we've already
buried four of them,'' including Josip Broz Tito, the Croat-born
founder of Yugoslavia, whom Tudjman has tried to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   His death is likely also to greatly improve relations with a
Western world that wearied of Tudjman's historical obsessions and
xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman is revered here for his crucial role in creating modern
Croatia in 1991, out of the collapse of the communist federation
founded by Tito. But as a historian and nationalist, Tudjman also
articulated and thus fed the country's paranoia about Western
conspiracies to undermine and destroy the state.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's obsessions included his unorthodox view that few Jews
and Serbs were killed by the Croatian fascist regime, the Ustasha,
during World War II and his conviction that the West wanted to
control Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   His constant lectures to Western diplomats and statesmen about
their injustice to Croatia and their dark designs against it were a
more passionate mirror of similar lectures from the Serbian leader,
Slobodan Milosevic, according to those who have heard both.
</P>
<P>
   Under Tudjman, Croatia has been ostracized much as Milosevic's
Yugoslavia has been. Although Croatia has so far escaped the
economic sanctions imposed on Milosevic, the autocratic, corrupt
and sometimes comedic nature of Tudjman's state, combined with his
repression of independent media and his unwillingness either to
make Bosnia work or to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in
The Hague have deepened his country's isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia, despite its fervent desire to join Europe, has been
kept from two of the main waiting rooms for integration: NATO's
Partnership for Peace, which even Albania and Kazakhstan have been
allowed to join, and the European Union's program known as Phare,
the French word for beacon, which provides financial and technical
assistance to nearly every other postcommunist country in Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever else Tudjman's death brings, Croatia has a chance now
to join the main currents of European history,'' said a senior
Foreign Ministry official. ``A democratic Croatia, if it gets help
from the West, can be pivotal to bringing peace, democracy and
stability to the region, including Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   That is also the fervent hope in Washington and Brussels,
Belgium, where officials would love to see a new, more outgoing
president, like the current foreign minister, Mate Granic, who is a
moderate member of the ruling party, and a new Parliament and
government dominated by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real possibility for Croatia to turn from being a
major part of the problem in this part of the world into a success
story and a big part of the solution,'' a senior Western diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   Croatian reality is likely to be more complicated than that.
Tudjman's party, a broad congregation that may fragment after his
death, has not yet picked a possible successor and appears afraid
to be seen to do so while the patriarchal president still breathes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been living in a form of prepolitics,'' said Marinko
Culic of the weekly Feral Tribune who has written a new book,
``Tudjman: The Anatomy of Unenlightened Absolutism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had enough of men of vision,'' he said. ``But I'm not
convinced the opposition will win. It won't be clear-cut, and I'm
not sure the opposition will hold together.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Tudjman's nationalist obsessions ``have been transferred
to the opposition, too,'' Culic said. ``Croatia won't be liberated
so easily from the issues Mr. Tudjman pushed,'' like the
paternalistic and constitutional ties to Bosnia's Croats. ``In part
this will remain a small, closed, xenophobic state, but Croatia
will still find its place in the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Drazen Budisa, the leader of the opposition Social Liberal
party, admitted in an interview that the opposition must protect
its ``nationalist'' front in the election. In May, Budisa refused
to go to Washington to meet officials _ the only one of the six
opposition leaders to stay home _ because of government criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's death ``will define the character of the political
campaign and it will be to the detriment of the opposition,''
Budisa said, especially after a huge state funeral with the
participation of the church. The opposition coalition _ actually
two allied coalitions of six parties in total _ will hang together
nonetheless, he predicted, even though it has also not agreed on a
single presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tudjman's death will improve relations with Washington and the
European Union, too,'' Budisa said. ``But political support for us
from abroad does not give us votes in Croatia. We need to have a
balanced policy. So support us more after we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivica Racan, leader of the Social Democrats, admitted that both
he and Budisa could end up running for the presidency. ``I'm sure
we will hold together,'' he said, although he admitted that there
would be severe competition for limited posts even if the
opposition wins control of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition's eventual rule might be short-lived given the
severe economic problems it would inherit, including a bloated
state sector, recession, $10 billion in foreign debt, a $2-billion
budget deficit for next year and high unemployment.

</P>
<P>
   A responsible government would have to increase the public's
pain to begin to restructure the economy, and it is questionable
whether the West, preoccupied with Serbia and Kosovo, would provide
sufficient assistance to ease the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Western officials and diplomats say that Tudjman's
tirades were tedious and deeply annoying. On the issues that
Washington pressed hardest _ democratization, compliance with the
Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war in 1995, and the return
of ethnic Serbs to Croatian territory from which they were expelled
that same year _ ``Tudjman was fundamentally opposed to each of
them, and his leadership made progress difficult if not impossible
on all of them,'' a senior Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, he said, in a version confirmed by others, Tudjman
had four constant themes. First, that ``they'' in the West were
opposed to the creation of Croatia, so ``they are punishing us for
our independence and holding us to an unfairly high standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, that ``it's all a plot'' to keep Croatia down, whether
the issue is compliance with the war crimes tribunal, membership in
Partnership for Peace, World Bank reluctance to ignore economic
corruption and mismanagement, or highly critical reports on the
state of human rights by Washington or the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Third, ``They want to keep us in the Balkans and create a new
Yugoslavia and stick us back where we don't belong.''
</P>
<P>
   And fourth, that the country is rife with ``foreign enemies'' _
spies and journalists and aid workers _ who ``are in the pay and in
collaboration with foreigners'' and who ``buy the loyalty of
Croatian trash'' who work with them.
</P>
<P>
   Jagoda Vukusic of the newspaper Novi List said that Tudjman's
death will change the whole tone of Croatian political life. ``I
can imagine the HDZ winning, but still it won't be the same
party,'' she said. ``They have to grow up quickly too and are
trying to become a real party and more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death of Tudjman will be a kind of release for them,
too,'' she said. ``It gives us the possibility of becoming a more
normal, boring country. Ah, to be boring,'' she said. ``I'm waiting
for that.''

COMMUTE-GRIDLOCK (Los Angeles) _ When it opened, the 405 Freeway
was envisioned as a fast path into the burgeoning suburbs of the
West Valley. Now, rush-hour traffic on it averages a
school-zone-esque 25 mph. And the problem will only get worse with
the planned expansion of Los Angeles International Airport. Recent
studies have shown that L.A. traffic is the worst in the nation,
and the interchanges on the 405 Freeway with the 10 and the 101 are
ground-zero for gridlock. New figures show commute times through
those interchanges steadily rising. Are there solutions on the
horizon? By Steve Carney (Will run on the ``n'' California news

MORE SENIORS ARE USING WEB FOR COMMUNICATION

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Older Americans who use the Internet are finding a
new way to reconnect with society and may even be benefiting from
regular doses of mental stimulation, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web these days, one can find anything from true love to a
used car. Many go online to shop, invest or just for entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But senior citizens also get the added benefit of increased
community participation, a godsend especially for those unable to
get around easily, said Dr. Gary Small, director of the University
of California, Los Angeles' Center on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's generation is a cyber generation,'' he said. ``The
Internet allows seniors to cross generation lines and get in touch
with younger family members.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many older people are ``cyber phobic'' of fast-paced
computer technology, but going online is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act of learning something new and communicating with
others is definitely beneficial to one's health,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Small cited a study funded by the MacArthur Foundation last year
that showed that keeping the mind active on a daily basis is likely
to lead to more healthy aging. For example, he said, it could help
prevent development of ailments often associated with old age, such
as Alzheimer's disease, a progressive, irreversible disease
characterized by degeneration of the brain cells and often leading
to severe dementia.
</P>
<P>
   SeniorNet, a national nonprofit group based in San Francisco,
focuses on bringing the Internet to people ages 50 and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who aren't on the Internet feel left out of
conversations, even within their own families, because they don't
understand all the lingo,'' said SeniorNet spokeswoman Stacy
Dieter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning how to use this resource is like finding an opening
to the world,'' she said. ``For the disabled, this is a way of
staying in touch with the rest of society without even leaving
their bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization has more than 160 learning centers around the
country, including in Los Angeles, offering low-cost Internet
classes to seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Dieter said seniors enjoy theme-based discussion groups in which
one can contact others on given topics, such as finding other
veterans around the world with World War II experiences.
</P>
<P>
   A report released last year by America Online showed that only
22 percent of Internet subscribers were 50 years of age or older.
But a SeniorNet study showed that number to be increasing, with 70
percent of seniors who own a personal computer going online in
1998, compared to only 17 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Elisa Driz of Northridge took a free Internet class at her local
library to go online and communicate with close relatives in
Argentina and Israel without running up huge phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, I waited this long to learn because I was scared
to death and confused,'' said Driz, 66. ``But we just got a
computer, and last week my daughter in Mendoza, Argentina, sent me
photos of my grandchild. It was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was interested mostly in e-mail, but also in
services such as shopping, travel planning and reading
international newspapers online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably many things that I can do that I don't even
know about yet because I have to learn more,'' she said. ``This is
revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Stanton, 69, is a retired mechanical engineer who volunteers
as a teacher of Internet classes at the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is really going to change the world,'' he said.
``It's like when the printing press was invented. All of a sudden,
more people everywhere are getting more access to information they
couldn't get before.''
</P>
<P>
   And the effects of increased Internet use may go even further.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service is projecting a decrease in first-class
mail by 2004 as more Internet users choose to pay bills online.
</P>
<P>
   Postage on bill payments represented about a third of the total
$101 billion first-class revenue last year, said Postal Service
spokesman Greg Frey.
</P>
<P>
   If revenues are seriously reduced, the agency might be forced to
raise prices to break even, he said.

SPANISH-LANGUAGE NETWORK PRAYS THAT PRIEST BRINGS HIGH RATINGS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Standing before an audience of some 100 people in a
half-moon-shaped television studio here, the Rev. Alberto Cutie
bowed his head and asked God ``to illuminate us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask you to help us so we can send a positive message to our
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer is standard before every taping of ``Padre Alberto,'' a
talk show on the Telemundo Spanish-language network that delves
into domestic violence, incest, sex addiction and other issues
common to daytime programming, but that unlike other shows has a
Roman Catholic priest as its host.
</P>
<P>
   Being a cleric was mainly why Cutie, the 30-year-old
Cuban-American parish vicar of St. Patrick Church in Miami Beach,
was chosen from among 500 candidates to head Telemundo's new fall
lineup in September. Another reason, said Nely Galan, the network's
former president of entertainment and the show's producer, was that
he fit the bill for charisma, progressive views and good looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a combination of being young, boyish and fun, and at
the same time he's an old man _ very soulful,'' said Ms. Galan, who
runs her own production company, Galan Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the show came to Ms. Galan after a spiritual
retreat in Mexico, but she said it was long overdue. Hispanic
people, she said, are more apt to confide in their priest than in a
therapist, and ``talk shows are really like confessionals.''
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for priests as broadcasting stars, most
notably Bishop Fulton Sheen, whose inspirational talks from New
York City beat Milton Berle's comedy hour in ratings on Tuesday
nights in the early years of television. At 4 p.m. on weekdays,
Cutie is up against the popular ``El Show de Cristina'' on rival
Univision, whose host, Cristina Saralegui, has been the reigning
queen of Spanish-language talk shows for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Saralegui, Cutie says no subject is taboo. The show's
advertising slogan is: ``Father Alberto. Open your soul.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know you can say anything before a priest,
and he's not going to get all bent out of shape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his competitor, who mixes up the lofty and
educational with the banal and plain tacky, Cutie said in an
interview that he saw the show as an extension of his ministry, and
his mission as inspiring viewers ``to look for the best in
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah has been doing that in the English-language market, but
no one has done it in the Spanish-language market,'' he said in a
not-so-subtle zinger at Ms. Saralegui, who is also Cuban-American.
``We speak about the human experience. We're not going to exploit
the problems. I want to deal with them in a very dignified manner.
I don't want anybody to see my show and be offended.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's underlying tone, indeed, is serious, if only because
most guests start out their sentences with a respectful ``Father.''
The content can sometimes also be dull because of Cutie's fondness
for asking questions like ``How does it feel?'' and advising
professional help for most problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Father Alberto, who is known in his church for starting
every sermon with a joke, is also prone to interjecting humorous
asides and fanning lively repartee in the ``Open Dialogue'' segment
of the show, where four guests, always including a celebrity,
discuss the subject at hand in the style of the ABC program
``Politically Incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the dialogue can get racy enough to make the host
blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behave, Maria Conchita, there's a Father here,'' he told the
Venezuelan actress Maria Conchita Alonso with nervous laughter
during a show about infidelity that veered into talk about oral
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen,'' she said, contrite.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the show is secular, Cutie offers snippets of Roman
Catholic teachings to dispel any misconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Cutie on domestic violence: ``The church doesn't say you have to
stay with an abusive husband. If there is no respect there is no
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   On homosexuality: ``The church does not reject anyone. Being
homosexual is not a sin because it's something that you don't
choose.'' But he added, ``The practice is another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cutie not only represents a church that is topical and
``present,'' said Mary Ross Agosta, spokeswoman for the Archdiocese
of Miami, but he also comes across as a priest who ``is very
handsome and appears to be very happy'' and may encourage the
vocation in the young. (Telemundo's promotions show him working out
at the gym, playing the guitar, talking to teen-agers on the
beach.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful asset for us,'' Ms. Ross Agosta said of the
show, which archdiocesan officials approved after getting
assurances from Telemundo that neither content nor format would
embarrass the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is that now we have a priest on prime-time
afternoon television that can speak about the teachings of the
church,'' she said. ``In a way he's evangelizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Telemundo, meanwhile, prays for high ratings.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Telemundo, owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment and Liberty
Media, badly lags in viewership behind Univision, which controls 90
percent of the Spanish-language television market in the nation.
Ratings for ``Padre Alberto'' are up 18 percent from the first show
in September, network officials said. But its share of households
is still a fraction of that of ``El Show de Cristina.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Puerto Rico and reared in Miami since the age of 7,
Cutie said he had no significant television experience except for
narrating and translating the pope's visit to Cuba last year for a
family cable channel. But he was the host of a dance music program
on public radio during his senior year in high school and was what
he calls ``a street D.J.'' from the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
   When he was younger, Cutie had envisioned a life as ``a yuppie,
with a wife and 10 children,'' but he got his calling while in high
school. He was ordained a priest four years ago at 26, and was
assistant pastor at St. Clement Church in Fort Lauderdale before
landing at St. Patrick Church last year, where he juggles Masses
and baptisms with twice-a-week tapings of his show.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   (A middle child, he has an older sister who works as a dental
hygienist and a younger sister who is a special education teacher
in Miami-Dade County. His father died in 1992, but his mother is a
regular audience member at the shows, he said.)
</P>
<P>
   As a diocesan priest who took the vows of obedience and celibacy
but not of poverty, Father Alberto is paid a salary by the church
and now by Telemundo, but he declined to say how much he gets for
the show except that ``it's not what they pay a typical talk show
host.'' He has signed a two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Busloads of parishioners from area churches now descend upon
Telemundo every week for ``Padre Alberto'' tapings, many of them
members of St. Patrick Church who praise the show as instructive
and say fame has not changed their priest. Typically at the end of
each show, Father Alberto signs autographs and blesses crucifixes
for a long line of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He is still jovial, humble, always close to the people,'' said
Miriam Garcia, 60, who has attended St. Patrick for the last four
years and has Cutie as her confessor. ``He's very sure of himself,
and he is very firm in his vocation.''
</P>
<P>
   But one noticeable change has been Father Alberto's hairstyle.
While the network did not pressure him to spice up the show in any
way, he said, Ms. Galan insisted that he abandon his ``Fred
Flintstone look'' _ hair parted in a straight line and brushed to
one side. The more hip alternative involves very short hair brushed
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supposed to be the George Clooney look, but I'm not sure
I like it,'' he said. ``I offer it for the souls in purgatory. I'm
just hoping it goes out of style real fast.''

storm developing off the Northwest coast will cause a bulge to form
in the jet stream over the Rockies early this week. The result will
be a stronger flow from the northwest across much of the East
leading to more widespread chill, but readings will at their worst
be a few degrees below seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure stretching from North Dakota to Alabama will
circulate progressively colder air into the Northeast. A stiff wind
will enhance the chill in the higher terrain of New England as snow
showers develop from the Tug Hill plateau of western New York to
the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The coast will be bright and
cooler with gusty winds during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant weather is expected in the Southeast with low humidity
and mainly clear skies. Florida will be noticeably drier. Patches
of clouds from the western Dakotas to the Tennessee Valley will
mark the boundary between advancing polar air and a very mild air
mass over the southern Plains and lower Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture associated with a series of jet stream disturbances
will flow into the West Coast states. While mainly high clouds will
be seen in California, Nevada and Utah, lower clouds and some
scattered showers are expected in Washington, northern Idaho and
western Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Green November
</P>
<P>
   No snowflakes were seen in Milwaukee on Saturday, tying the
latest date on record without a trace of snow there. If there are
no flurries in Madison, Wis., on Sunday, the capital city will tie
its record. Farther north, in Green Bay, where there has never been
a November without a flurry, the wait also continues for the first
snowflakes. It has been 35 years since Green Bay has had only a
trace of snow during the 11th month. While it will be cold enough
for snow through Tuesday, odds are against any precipitation in
Wisconsin, delaying winter's arrival until December.

   LOS ANGELES _ Consider the chili cheese dog, the trademark
indulgence at Pink's hot dog stand in Hollywood. Dripping with
sweet, smooth chili, wrapped in a slice of American cheese and a
soft bun, of considerable heft and not a little messy, it seems an
unlikely culinary obsession in a city thought preoccupied about
healthy eating.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pink's has been putting the lie to the city's ahi-tuna and
wheat-grass-juice stereotype as the hot dog stand celebrated its
60th anniversary with a 60-cent hot dog special for an hour each
day over the last two weeks, ending on Friday. The wait for a chili
dog, which normally costs $2.40, stretched for up to four hours
near the corner of Melrose and La Brea avenues. Pink's has been
saluted by Mayor Richard Riordan and actors Erik Estrada and Ruth
Buzzi. Regular customers testify to its place in the firmament of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like them too much,'' said Aaron Spelling, the
producer of television shows including ``Melrose Place'' and
``Beverly Hills 90210,'' as he signed autographs there earlier this
week. ``We only order them three times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   As Spelling spoke, a hopeful screenwriter handed him a script
about ``Desert Storm and Hollywood'' and a head shot. ``We'll read
it and get to you right away,'' he told the man.
</P>
<P>
   So how does an unrepentant symbol of gluttony find firm footing
amid the supposedly cautious Angeleno diners? By offering itself as
an alternative, and by trading on its status as one of the few
dining institutions in a city where so many others _ the Brown
Derby and Chasen's, to name two _ have closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to splurge, you're going to splurge at a place
that really tastes good,'' said Richard Pink, who runs the family
business with his wife, Gloria, and his sister, Beverly. ``There's
got to be a place to balance out the tendency to chase low fat, low
carb. You've got to splurge where the calories count.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a newspaper ad, Pink's parents, Betty and Paul
Pink, bought a portable hot dog cart in 1939 with $50 in borrowed
money, running it on an extension cord to a hardware store one
block away. The stand was expanded in 1946 to a building, which
remains unchanged today. The menu, however, has grown to offer 21
kinds of hot dogs, and now Pink's sells up to 2,000 of them a day _
hot dogs with bacon, hot dogs with guacamole, hot dogs with sour
cream, tomatoes, mustard relish and onions, hot dogs stuffed with
Jalapeno peppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great hot dogs,'' said Ruth Reichl, a former food
critic for The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times, who is now
editor of Gourmet magazine. Ms. Reichl said she once dug through
Pink's trash receptacle to find out what kind of chili the
restaurant used; the owners say it is a family recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as you value healthy eating, people still like to eat
the occasionally sinful thing,'' Ms. Reichl said.
</P>
<P>
   Pink's proximity to the entertainment studios _ Paramount
Pictures and CBS Television City are in the neighborhood _ has made
it a Hollywood institution and a part of the city's fabric.
Autographed glossies of celebrities cover a wall where aspiring
unknowns once hung head shots and phone numbers in the hopes of
being noticed. Pink's hot dogs are standard fare for movie wrap
parties and talk show audiences, and the owners say the actor Orson
Welles holds the record for eating the most dogs in one sitting,
18.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even in Hollywood, a hot dog stand cannot survive on
celebrity business alone. Scott Dinsdale, 35, a financial analyst,
brought three friends for lunch from downtown Los Angeles, a trip
of at least 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife's a dietitian,'' Dinsdale said over his lunch tray.
``We're just not going to tell her. There'll definitely be a salad
in my future.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Miller, a 55-year-old dock worker, said he had been
coming for years because he liked the distinctive snap of the
Pink's hot dog casing, combined with the taste of the chili. He
estimates that eating one such dog requires at least 10 napkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is junk food right here,'' Miller said. ``You don't eat
these every day. But it's good junk food.''

<P>
   KIPTOPEKE, Va. _ It was almost as if the golden eagle knew that
the humans clustered far below were bird-watchers. The graceful
raptor flew in closer from the horizon fringe where it had first
been spotted, and teased the gathering near the beachfront by
pausing directly overhead, like a dancer on the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how the back part of his wings curve into his body _
that's classic,'' one bird-watcher said amid the group of seven who
stared up as the bird slowly soared above the hawk-watching
platform in Kiptopeke State Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It figures _ we were due for one,'' said another watcher,
while all eyes tracked the imperious visitor as it passed the
rampartlike platform, one of the newest and most prized
bird-watching perches along the Chesapeake coastal migration route.
</P>
<P>
   The eagle glided with the panache of one of creation's truly
self-possessed individuals, all glare and glory highlighted by the
late afternoon sunshine. The birders savored the encounter as a
reward for their long hours of watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time that would have been considered a unique
sighting,'' one of them said, elated at his birder's scope even as
he underlined a paradox of modern bird-watching: So many more
people are becoming involved in birding, and with such a plethora
of high-tech optics and wide-ranging leisure options, that once
rare sightings are becoming ever less rare.
</P>
<P>
   In the extreme, ``listers'' bearing woodland beepers and cell
phones are spotted increasingly in birding circles alerting one
another to the latest flying collectibles. Traditionalists consider
these listers fast-traveling fanatics who superficially amass the
longest possible lists of sighted birds as if they were baseball
cards, never truly appreciating the creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brits call them `twitchers' _ they twitch things off on
their list,'' said Tom Cameron, a lawyer and more studious birder
from Boston. ``The virulent lister isn't interested in looking at a
bird if he's already seen it. `Hey,' you tell him, `there's an
Andean condor on that telephone pole!' And the lister says, `Don't
need it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Patient watchers count more substantive rewards, most notably a
black-browed albatross photographed last February about 60 miles
east of Virginia Beach, an extraordinary sighting a hemisphere away
from home. Then there is the arrival and heartening proliferation
of brown pelicans, first spotted this far north a decade ago and
now nesting in the hundreds in the Chesapeake region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are as many different kinds of bird-watchers as there
are birds,'' said Henry Armistead, a librarian from Philadelphia
who has been birding for 50 of his 59 years, celebrating humans as
much as birds. ``Some people come and don't even raise their
binoculars. Whoever shows up can feel like family.''
</P>
<P>
   The humans were excited on this day at the sighting of a
pink-sided junco, far more rare here than a golden eagle. Far east
of its normal haunts in the Northern Rockies, it was spotted by
Susan Hopkins, a research scientist for the Coastal Virginia
Wildlife Observatory who has been working since Sept. 1 at the
platform.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of an avid community of avocational bird-watchers
who come and go, Ms. Hopkins has been tracking the main birds of
prey on their annual fly-by. Merlins, or pigeon hawks, pass in
great numbers, as do American kestrels, or sparrow hawks, and a
dozen other raptors, like peregrines, sharp-shinned hawks, ospreys
and turkey vultures.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively remote hawk platform and other perches in the
Cape Charles region are increasingly rated as a prime place for
autumnal bird-watching on the East Coast. The birds funnel
southward above the land's edge. Birders call Cape Charles the new
Cape May, comparing it to the New Jersey coastal region that is one
of the United States' focal points for bird-watching.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the Kiptopeke watch is a place of serious
business, as Ms. Hopkins and other scientists run careful seasonal
tallies on the state of the species. They trap, measure and band
some birds while sending data back to central population studies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the watch is a shared joy for the many
nonprofessional birders who stop by, the sharpest of them with
decades of valued experience. ``It's a big sky, and nobody can spot
everything that goes over,'' said Armistead, who writes widely of
his travels in birding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Accipiters are pouring through,'' Armistead exulted in his
journal one early morning last month. ``The hand clickers are
smoking,'' he said of the count by the platform watchers. Across
the years, he chronicles the passing creatures, from marbled
godwits to short-billed dowitchers. He notes birders' seasonal
melancholy, citing how Thomas Hardy's darkling thrush dared ``to
fling his soul upon the growing gloom.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more than birds to Armistead's watch. In his
wanderings, he has been stopped by an armed backwoodsman suspicious
that bird banding was a way to send messages to the communists. The
police stopped him one night in Wilmington, Del., when, intent on a
listening watch for urban nighthawks, he stood alert with his
binoculars heedless of a nearby center of night life. ``It was the
Spirit of '76 Massage Parlor,'' he noted for the record.
</P>
<P>
   Down from the hawk platform, Jamie Cameron, a 27-year-old field
biologist, has been trapping and banding assorted raptors 10 hours
a day, a task that continues from September until December. He
manipulates tethered pigeons and starlings to suddenly move on the
ground and so entices a laserlike swoop from a passing predator.
The strikes are cut short by his concealed net trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goshawks, the epitome of all that is aggressive,'' he said of
his most impressive captive. ``They're the alpha,'' he said, as his
father, Tom, knelt by the wood line, studying the far more exotic
pink-sided junco.
</P>
<P>
   ``A spectacular little bird; I'd watch it for hours,'' said the
senior Cameron. ``And this bird being a race and not a species, the
twitchers aren't interested,'' beamed the birder, ever watchful for
that rampant lister.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR RIVERS, A PREDICTION RINGS TRUE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (rk) 
 By   HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dialogue came at a delicate time of a player's career, near
its conclusion, which, Doc Rivers believes, explains the revulsion
he had for the job he now loves.
</P>
<P>
   He had just aired out his differences with Pat Riley over his
status with the Knicks when the power coach, out of breath and
finally sensing he couldn't bully the veteran, said: ``You're like
me, stubborn. You'll coach in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, Riles,'' Rivers answered. ``I'm a family guy.
Look at you, all wound up in this. Working 24 hours. You have no
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   What particularly alarmed Rivers was that Riley didn't argue
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Half a decade later, Saturday afternoon, Riley's vision returned
to Madison Square Garden, where, in 2 and a half years as a Knick,
Rivers cultivated a decade's worth of popularity. Orlando's gain
was New York's and New Jersey's loss. In Miami, Riley must have
felt like the world's best-dressed prophet when Rivers was hired as
the Doc to treat the Magic's post-Shaq-and-Penny syndrome last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I had that conversation with Riley, I was reaching
the point where I just wanted to get away from the locker room,''
Rivers said.
</P>
<P>
   He went to San Antonio for a season and a half, where one
playoff run was sabotaged when Dennis Rodman sat on the bench in
his socks. When Rivers' wife became pregnant with their fourth
child, he said ``enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a job as a television analyst. The next year, someone
set fire to the Rivers' home near a San Antonio golf course. The
family was away. R.C. Buford, a Spurs assistant coach and close
friend, happened to be on the course when the house went up. He
raced to the front door, found a way in and asked himself a
question most of us have: What should he save?
</P>
<P>
   ``He got the family photo albums and the videotapes of the
kids,'' Rivers said. ``He went in twice and was going to go in
again when the police said they'd arrest him if he did.''
</P>
<P>
   With friends like that, Rivers reminded himself he didn't need a
coaching job to not have time for them. He had a merry, stress-free
broadcasting life, watching the game continue to devolve into
Riley's ultimate vision of basketball, as a hockey score.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, it made him crazy watching guards walk the ball
up the court, the shot clock ticking, the fans yawning. By last
season, his third in headphones, Rivers found himself, at
courtside, conjuring up alternative game plans. Found himself
coaching along with the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I still had something left on the bench,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected a chance to be Milwaukee's general manager. The
Garden's Dave Checketts had a preliminary chat with him about the
Knicks' GM job, before the friendly bounce of Allan Houston's
runner that saved Jeff Van Gundy's job. The Nets, wasting time
dressed up as Phil Jackson's leverage, could not have done better
than Rivers. But then, Rivers was in a rare position for a black
former player who wasn't a big box-office draw. He had some
leverage himself and was too smart to start at the bottom of the
ladder, set up to fail.
</P>
<P>
   So he signed with Orlando, which promptly jettisoned most of its
disgruntled veteran talent.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Doc, people said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor nothing,'' he said. ``We're not going to be rebuilding
very long, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magic has a bundle of bad teams' first-round draft picks
over the next three years, and salary cap room to kill for. These
are not amenities one should necessarily count on, but, as Rivers
said, Orlando's weather is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league is about recruiting now,'' he said. ``The money's
the same everywhere. And this is where Tiger Woods lives. Ken
Griffey Jr. Wesley Snipes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Snipes? Oh, right. ``White Men Can't Jump.'' And the
Magic, as presently assembled, can't win, except Rivers' team has
managed to hold its own.
</P>
<P>
   His players get to run and he tries not to hustle them. He
admits it is easier to tell the truth to what is, with the
exception of Darrell Armstrong, a bunch of role players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them my opinion and it doesn't have to be their opinion
and they don't have to like it but, so far, they do,'' Rivers said.
``If I had five superstars, I might not be able to coach the same
way.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had Latrell Sprewell, he said he would have had to say
that Sprewell didn't handle his return to Golden State too well. He
would have told Sprewell that his values were twisted, that shaking
P.J. Carlesimo's hand would not have been ``selling out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers added, ``But that's none of my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Van Gundy has copped out with the same attitude,
which is what happens when dissent becomes house rule. On a
healthier plane, some people believe Rivers has a chance to lure
Tim Duncan to Orlando next season, based on their relationship when
Rivers was broadcasting Spurs games. This may be a remote
possibility, at best, and the coach, of course, can't comment.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't on television anymore, free to share every who, what,
why and whimsy. He is a coach, his bio listed this season on Page
319 of the NBA register. On the opposite page, you guessed it,
Florida's other main man on the bench. Once again, Rivers is
face-to-face with Riley, who told him this is exactly where he
would end up.

BRICK ATTACK VICTIM RECOVERING, BUT MUM ON ASSAULT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By WINNIE HU

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twelve days after she was struck in the head by a
brick, Nicole Barrett is talking more with her family and friends
but has never mentioned the attack by a stranger on a Midtown
street, her brother said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The brother, Scott Barrett, said he did not think that his
sister remembered what happened to her, although he had not asked
her about the attack.
</P>
<P>
   She still slurs her words, and mixes them up in conversation,
but she recognizes her family and seems more alert, he said. Ms.
Barrett underwent surgery to relieve swelling in her brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people would say this was a disaster, a tragedy, and
in a way, it was,'' he said in an interview in a waiting area at
Bellevue Hospital Center. ``But if it had to happen, we're moving
in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett had improved enough to be moved to a private room in
the neurology ward on Friday from the intensive care unit, said
John Clark, a spokesman for Bellevue Hospital Center. He said that
she remained in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said that his parents were discussing options for his
sister's rehabilitation from any impairments caused by her
injuries, including taking her back to Texas, but they had not yet
made any decision. ``It would be easier for us back home,'' said
Barrett, who is staying in a hotel with his parents. ``But we have
to wait for what the doctors say.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, 27, an office worker who moved here last year from
the small town of Athens, Texas, was hit with a six-pound paving
stone while walking near 42nd Street and Madison Avenue on Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Saturday that they still had no suspects in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Rafael Andalia added that while officials had spoken with
Ms. Barrett's doctors and relatives, they had not interviewed her.
``Right now, we're concerned with her health more than anything
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said his family had a particularly tough time last week
because his father, Arlen, started suffering pain from a previously
treated tumor on his lower spine. The older Barrett will undergo
surgery Monday to remove the tumor and replace a vertebra.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett added that his sister had been told about the operation,
but did not seem to be upset by it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett has received boxes full of cards from well-wishers,
and hand-made cut-out cards from elementary school students,
Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ms. Barrett's former drill team instructors at
Trinity Valley Community College in Athens visited her at Bellevue.
The school band and its Cardettes drill team dancers wore purple
ribbons in Ms. Barrett's honor during their performance in the
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, who danced in the parade in 1991, watched the
Trinity students on television. ``She smiled when the Cardettes
were dancing, but she didn't talk about it afterward,'' her brother
said.

SUFIA KAMAL, BANGLADESHI WRITER AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS ADVOCATE, DIES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sufia Kamal, a Bangladeshi poet, political activist and
feminist, died at age 88 on Nov. 20 and was buried four days later
with full state honors, the first woman to receive that recognition
from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   As the national flag was lowered and buglers saluted, about
10,000 people paid their respects to Ms. Kamal at her funeral on
Wednesday in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
   Born into wealth, she had devoted her life to fighting for the
rights of women and the poor and against the forces of religious
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This poet was the beacon for our great language movement and
liberation war, and inspiration for all democratic movements of the
nation,'' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh said at the
ceremony. ``This poet was a vast source of inspiration for building
up womenfolk as self-reliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Sufia Kamal was born in 1911 in Barisal, the southern district
of what is now Bangladesh, the only daughter of an eminent lawyer.
As a woman, she did not have an opportunity to pursue an education,
but she educated herself in her uncle's library with her mother's
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   She was first married at the age of 11 to her cousin Syed Nehal
Hossain, then a law student. They had a daughter, Amena Kahnar, and
Hossain died in 1932. Five years later, Ms. Kamal married
Kamaluddin Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her first daughter, Ms. Kamal is survived by two
other daughters, Sultana Kamal and Saida Kamal; two sons, Shahed
Kamal and Sazid Kamal; three grandsons, and three
great-granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
   She published her first story at 14, and her prose and poems
drew favorable notice. Some works were aimed at children. Some were
translated into English and Russian. Increasingly, she wrote
against religious communalism, fundamentalism and superstitions.
She promoted democracy and women's emancipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture was to keep the women at home, train them in
household chores and make them perfect women: docile, ready to
please everyone in the family,'' she said in an interview this
year. ``There was a strong anti-British movement, and my family
also believed that women should stay out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had an indomitable nature and I crossed my limits to get
a taste of all there was. I was allowed to learn Arabic and a
little Persian, but not Bengali. I made it a point to learn Bengali
from people working in the house.'' That became the language she
used for her writing.
</P>
<P>
   Though she called herself a romantic poet, her work more and
more reflected the struggles to preserve the Bengali language and
culture and to fight Pakistani rulers. During Bangladesh's struggle
for independence from Pakistan in the early 1970s &UR;  &LR; she worked to
help women hurt by the war. She also worked with an organization to
try to bring to justice those Pakistani officials whom the
Bangladeshis considered war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In later life, she made women's rights her top priority and
headed Bangladesh's largest women's organization for many years.
She did not see the oppression of women as mainly a class issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own experience as a woman made me sensitive toward the
condition of women of all classes,'' she said. ``Be poor or
middle-class or upper-class, the violence against women in family,
society and in public life was always there. Women were exploited
and deprived of opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, an Islamic fundamentalist group called for her
execution as punishment for her denunciation of the
fundamentalists' treatment of women. Her response was quiet
resistance rather than the stronger advocacy of an earlier
Bangladeshi poet, Taslima Nareen, who fled the country for fear of
reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kamal's strongest and most thoughtful sentiments may have
appeared in her poems rather than her prose.
</P>
<P>
   One poem, ``Our Language: The Language of Bengal,'' ends with
the following lines:
</P>
<P>
   For our language many have died,
</P>
<P>
   drawn from the arms of our mother
</P>
<P>
   but down the road, smeared with their blood
</P>
<P>
   I hope freedom will come to this land:
</P>
<P>
   the simple language of a simple people
</P>
<P>
   Will meet the demands of this our land.
</P>
<P>
   Before her death Ms. Kamal specified that she preferred to be
buried in a simple private cemetery rather than in the national
cemetery, where her nation's leaders had suggested she be buried.
Her views on the country's leaders, expressed in the interview
earlier this year, suggest why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are courageous; our leaders are not,'' she said.
``Today they recourse to bombastic rhetoric but never take bold
decisions because they may be unpleasant. Why? Because they lack
courage.''

JETS SEE BALL CONTROL AS KEY TO BEATING COLTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The last time the New York Jets faced the
Indianapolis Colts, their season seemed all but ended as the final
seconds ticked away.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lucas, the last hope at quarterback, was sprawled on the
ground with a sprained ankle, the scoreboard showed a Colts victory
and the standing showed the Jets with a 1-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas had some responsibility for that low point. In his first
career start, with the Jets on the Colts' 3-yard line, he threw a
bad pass that was intercepted and turned into the Colts' winning
field goal in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets no longer are comatose. They have a three-game
winning streak that has pushed their record to 4-6, and they have
worked efficiently within a revised offensive scheme. Now, all they
have to figure out is how to get some more yardage and control the
ball, thus keeping it out of the hands of the dangerous Peyton
Manning and his offensive cast.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells admits he has several ``dilemmas'' as the Jets
prepare to face the Colts again on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One dilemma:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not overly efficient in the passing game,''
Parcells said, ``the worst thing you can have is a second-and-15.''
</P>
<P>
   Another dilemma:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you tell Ray, `Open it up,' you're looking for trouble,''
Parcells added.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Jets need more offense, they have to keep the
running game going and they need the occasional deep ball from
Lucas. After all, Indianapolis is the highest-scoring team in the
conference with an average of 29.4 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to control the clock,'' Parcells said. ``That's the
best way we can play right now.'' And they need to do it with left
tackle Jumbo Elliott having back pains and with right tackle a
problem since the rookie Ryan Young is attempting to play after
spraining a knee last week.
</P>
<P>
   This is life without Vinny Testaverde. The Jets were disastrous
offensively until recently. And even during the three-game winning
string, they have not bulldozed defenses; not once all season have
the Jets even scored as many points in one game as the Colts have
been averaging.
</P>
<P>
   But Curtis Martin, who began a four-game stretch of 100-yard
rushing performances with the last Indianapolis game, remains a key
to keeping Lucas from having to open it up. Eventually, though,
Parcells knows that Martin's ability to run will also be dependent
on Lucas' keeping the defense honest _ and that means the threat of
a long ball.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason why Lucas worked overtime on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made him go over the red-zone stuff,'' said Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder. In the red zone the Jets are the worst in the
American Football Conference, scoring touchdowns only 36.7 percent
of the time on 30 possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that includes Lucas' misfire at the 3-yard line in
the Jets' and Colts' first meeting. That miscue overshadowed the
remarkable job the defense had done against Manning. It held the
second-year quarterback to his lowest yardage total of the season
(210).
</P>
<P>
   While Manning routinely drills the ball downfield, Lucas'
longest completion has been only 26 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's missed a couple,'' Parcells said. ``We're working on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this is another of those dilemmas. If you want Lucas to
avoid second-and-long, then he has to complete a first-down pass of
seven or eight yards. But his overall average of yards per attempt
is barely five yards. Still, that number is higher this week
because against the Bills last Sunday he was finally able to
average seven yards a throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I've been talking to Ray about _ coming up with
second-and-two and second-and-three,'' Parcells said. ``That makes
it easier for Curtis.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has been running smoothly the last month and had a big
game out of the backfield with seven catches against the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Ray adds to the running game is he's a threat,'' Martin
said. ``They don't know if he'll run when he gets back in the
pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jets have not had great success running the ball in
short-yardage situations. They convert barely a third of their
third downs, ranking 21st in the league. The reason Parcells made
that controversial decision to ask Lucas to pass the ball from the
3 against the Colts was simple: The team had been unable to produce
in short-yardage situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been about 20 different guys messing up,'' Parcells said.
``We're spending more time on it every week, and our short yardage
hasn't improved since the bye week.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Lucas is approaching the rematch with a positive
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a decent feel for the game the first time we played
them,'' he said. ``I know that we definitely have to control the
ball. That comes with experience. We've got to keep the ball out of
Peyton's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he doesn't expect Lucas to be mistake-free. ``As
long as he doesn't make it on the 3-yard line.''

CHECHEN REBELS COUNTERATTACK EAST OF BESIEGED CAPITAL
</HEADLINE>
   (See also RUSSIA-CHECHNYA, TURKEY-RUSSIA) 
(jw) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russian artillery continued a savage pounding of
Chechnya's capital, largely reducing the remainder of a city of
250,000 to rubble, Chechen militants said they had staged their
first major counterattack and retaken most of a town in a hilly
region 20 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Lecha Dudayev of Grozny, the capital, quoted survivors of
the bombardment as saying at least 260 civilians _ and possibly as
many as 500 _ had died in shelling that began on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were impossible to verify, as the town's streets
were deserted, and people were huddled in basements, waiting out
the attack. More civilians left Grozny on Saturday for Ingushetia,
Chechnya's neighbor to the west, fleeing in vehicles with white
flags during lulls in the bombing. Ingushetia's interior minister,
Khamzat Gutseriyev, said 1,950 Chechen refugees had entered his
region since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 230,000 Chechen refugees are encamped or housed in
Ingushetia. The Russian news service Interfax said a 6-mile-long
line of cars was waiting to cross the Chechen border Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials denied that civilians had suffered
large losses, telling the Tass news service that their attacks had
been aimed strictly at the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said cannon and aircraft had bombed 35 towns
in the north Caucasus region around Grozny, Chechnya's largest city
until Russian attacks began in September. Government troops have
steadily tightened a ring of armor around the city and claimed
Saturday to have taken hills north of the town that gave them a
bead on some remaining rebel strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic militants who have controlled much of the province
began a counterattack early Saturday on the small town of
Novogroznensky, about 25 miles east of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the western part of the town was reported in flames as a
result of the fighting, in which rebels rained Russian-made Grad
rockets on parts of the town. By midday Saturday, The Associated
Press reported, rebels claimed to have retaken all but the eastern
outskirts of the town.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel soldiers have taken a punishing since the Russian
offensive against Chechnya began in September, in part because the
Russians have relied mostly on air power and artillery to batter
towns into submission rather than subjecting their troops to
guerrilla combat.
</P>
<P>
   The militant leaders have claimed, however, that the battle
would turn their way once Russian troops were forced to move into
towns or to go after rebels in their mountain hideouts _ a new
phase of the war that Russian officials said on Friday that they
were prepared to begin.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, who has been recuperating from a viral
infection at his country home north of Moscow, was briefed on the
operation by telephone Saturday by Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev,
Russian news services reported.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Russian officials reported that they had
secured confessions from five Russian soldiers who fired on a shop
stall on Friday in an Ingushetia town near the Chechen border,
killing a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   According to official accounts, the five had driven to the shop
in an armored personnel carrier seeking to buy vodka, and began
firing after they were unable to buy any. The soldiers were
reported to be drunk at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The military's announcement was the first in the nine-week-long
conflict singling out Russian soldiers for punishment for their
treatment of civilians.

ORCHESTRA STRIKE LEAVES SOME BALLET FANS COOL TO `NUTCRACKER'  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Austria, Ind., Holland, N.J.)  (rk) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What could be more New York than the soaring strains
of Tchaikovsky's ``The Nutcracker,'' danced at Lincoln Center by
the glittering New York City Ballet?
</P>
<P>
   But as the ballet's 70-member orchestra entered the fifth day of
its strike, and dancers prepared to pirouette to taped music,
balletgoers were split over whether the delicate fable would spring
to life without the musicians. Some lined up at the box office
Saturday to return their tickets, while others insisted they would
see the Sugar Plum Fairy and Mouse King no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Box office officials said that about 20 people asked for refunds
for the matinee, which had been sold out before the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a village and when we come to a famous place like
this, I want to see it the way it's supposed to be,'' said Karl
Herfert from Austria, who with his wife, Eva, decided not to attend
the ballet after seeing posted notices about the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stephens, a New Yorker buying tickets for his wife, said,
``I think it's fine to have taped music.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that musicians have walked out of ``The
Nutcracker,'' which the City Ballet has performed annually since
1954.
</P>
<P>
   A negotiating session between ballet company and musician
representatives, which went late into Friday night, failed to
produce an agreement. The musicians, represented by Local 802 of
the American Federation of Musicians, are seeking higher wages and
benefits. Their principal concern, however, is to continue a
tradition of elective attendance, where they can skip a rehearsal
or performance and forfeit their pay, if a substitute is available.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet company has argued that orchestra members abuse the
privilege, compromising the continuity of rehearsals and
performances.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bill Dennison, a union spokesman, said that the union
had agreed to a final proposal that the musicians play through the
holiday season as negotiations continued, but balked when the
ballet company added the proviso that if negotiations were not
concluded in time, the musicians would play through the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The average salary of current orchestra members is $66,000 for
23 weeks of work, according to the ballet company, with additional
money for seniority and other factors. The union has disputed that
figure, saying the basic pay is $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fader, a spokesman for the orchestra members, said that
the situation had escalated from a strike to a lockout. ``We said
yes, no strings attached,'' for going back to work, he said. ``They
said no, because we would not guarantee them the spring season.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Ramsey, a spokesman for the City Ballet, said, ``We
just can't be held hostage by threats of strike when we are trying
to negotiate in good faith at the table.'' He added, ``We are
hopeful to get them back to the bargaining table.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, conflict and walkouts are quintessentially New York.
But Saturday, Nutcracker fans debated whether they would get a
better taste of the city's holiday season at, perhaps, Radio City
Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all voted to turn in our tickets and do something that is
more New York,'' said Melissa Vickers from Terre Haute, Ind., who
was at the New York State Theater's box office Saturday, with her
mother and her aunts. ``I've seen one with recorded music,'' she
added, and the experience was not inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Reichel, on vacation from Amsterdam, Holland, said that
despite the strike, ``I think we have to buy tickets. It's really
famous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lois Deane from New Jersey decided to return her tickets for
artistic and political reasons. ``I wouldn't cross the picket line,
and I really wouldn't want to watch the ballet without the
orchestra,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband Bob said that he sympathized with the musicians and
did not think they were asking for too much. ``Everyone works for
somebody,'' he said, adding, ``We might go to the museum.''

<P>
   POLLEPEL ISLAND, N.Y. _ The portcullis and drawbridge have
vanished. The pith helmets and cannonballs are gone. But the
crumbling Scottish castle remains, cryptically adorned by the
chiseled words ``Bannerman's Island Arsenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since it was abandoned in the 1950s, this island, one of
the Hudson River's most incongruous and inaccessible ruins, has
fascinated history buffs. Once the private warehouse of Frank
Bannerman VI, an eccentric Scottish immigrant in the military
supplies business, the castle has deteriorated so badly that the
island has been declared hazardous and off limits by its current
owner, New York state.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Pollepel Island is becoming more than just a place of
mystery and memory.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a fledgling nonprofit group, the Bannerman
Castle Trust, has worked diligently to improve the island. This
year, for the first time, the state parks department allocated some
money to help restore the island. And last summer, the group
organized its premier fund-raising tour of the 6.5-acre island,
which is often called Bannerman's Island.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the momentum has been so encouraging that the
island could be opened to the public within the next year or so.
</P>
<P>
   The usual caveats about financing, timing and luck still apply,
of course, cautioned Neil Caplan, president of the Bannerman Castle
Trust. But the likelihood of unlocking a castle in the Hudson has
stoked many imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a surprise to think that you could find something
undiscovered in your back yard,'' said Nancy Arena, communications
manager for the Dutchess County Tourism Promotion Agency, which
regularly fields inquiries about the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``You spin tales in your mind about what happened over there. It
gives you permission to daydream,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Situated only 50 miles north of the George Washington Bridge in
the town of Fishkill, Pollepel Island had a colorful history even
before the Bannermans arrived at the turn of the century. American
Indians believed that the island was haunted. Dutch sailors feared
goblins who, legend had it, whipped up squalls, dooming many a
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   And the name itself is said to have two possible sources: One is
a Dutch word meaning ``potladle,'' referring to the drunken or
boisterous sailors who were deposited on the island while their
vessels cruised the Hudson, then picked up after they sobered up.
The second is a girl named Polly Pell, the object of two gentlemen
callers, and subject of a dramatic tale of love, honor and rescue _
on the island.
</P>
<P>
   In the Revolutionary War, American colonists installed
chevaux-de-frise _ a kind of underwater fence of sharpened logs _
between the island and Plum Point, on the western shore. The idea
was to sink British vessels. But the British weren't fooled: no
ships were sunk.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 19th century, the uninhabited island, owned
first by the Van Wycks, then by the Tafts, was used sparingly as a
picnic ground and fishing spot. Then came Frank Bannerman, whose
Manhattan business traded surplus military goods _ including, at
one point, 90 percent of the equipment from the Spanish-American
War, Caplan said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that New York City officials prohibited the
storage of such combustibles. So Bannerman bought this island in
1900 to build his own warehouse-cum-billboard, visible from the
trains humming along the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Bannerman designed seven buildings for the island _ three
warehouses, two workers' houses, a family residence and the
signature six-story tower _ as a homage to his Scottish roots,
complete with turrets, crenelated towers, a drawbridge and a moat.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bannerman even invented a family coat of arms, said his grandson
Frank Bannerman VIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't delegate authority,'' said Bannerman, 84, who lives
in Hartsdale. ``He did it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The island was not immune to accidents. In 1920, a powder house
explosion injured three people and catapulted a 25-foot-long piece
of stone wall onto the eastern shore of the Hudson, where it landed
on the railroad tracks. And once, a cannon mistakenly shot a shell
over a mountain and through a barn. No animals or humans were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the island, equipped with amenities like telephone
service and indoor plumbing, often possessed a comforting,
members-only kind of rhythm, as the Bannermans used the island
primarily on weekends and a small group of employees lived there
full time.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors would gather at a spot on the eastern shore directly
across from the island, and ring a brass bell that would echo
across the 1,000-foot distance. Then, the island's employees would
board rowboats to pick up the visitors _ who often carried jugs of
drinking water, since the river's water was not potable.

</P>
<P>
   After Frank Bannerman VI died in 1918, two of his sons, Frank
VII and David, took over the business, which also published a
well-regarded military supplies catalog. In 1959, the family moved
the business from Manhattan to Long Island, and emptied the island
of its remaining supplies. In 1967, the family sold the island to
New York state, and by 1969, when a suspicious fire gutted many of
the buildings, Bannerman's island had fallen into desuetude.
</P>
<P>
   The castle is visible from West Point, about four miles to the
south. But to many drivers, train passengers and boaters, the
castle may resemble something mistakenly plucked from Robert the
Bruce's Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchess County Tourism Promotion Agency fields more phone
calls about Bannerman's Island than about any other place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's sort of unexpected,'' Ms. Arena said, ``people
ask, `What is that?' `Did I really see it?' `Was it a movie set?'
`Are there romantic or tragic stories behind it?''' (According to
Caplan, the castle did appear in ``North by Northwest.'')
</P>
<P>
   On a recent tour of the island, Jim Logan and Thom Johnson, two
members of the Bannerman Castle Trust, noted how Bannerman had used
recycled bedsprings, bamboo spears and bayonets as building
materials. The tower, they explained, was actually designed to
create an optical illusion, with top floors wider than the lower
ones to make the building look imposing. And none of the buildings
contained right angles.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, vandals have sullied the place in recent years,
security cameras and No Trespassing signs notwithstanding. There is
fresh graffiti, done in tribute to teen-age romance and rock bands
such as Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock. Nature has asserted itself, too,
as evidenced by the spread of poison ivy and sumac.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, more has been done to nurse the island in the last few
years than was done during the preceding 40, thanks largely to the
Bannerman Castle Trust, which was established six years ago, and
the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Caplan, whose interest was piqued by a book mentioning
the island, the Bannerman Castle Trust has removed garbage from the
island and cleared most of the trails. The group has published
newsletters and pamphlets, including a new collection of Bannerman
family recipes and first-person tales. And it has sold paintings of
the island done by artists like Jane Bannerman, widow of Charles
Bannerman, a cousin of Frank the VIII.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the group has raised about $80,000. And the state parks
department provided a $200,000 grant this year. (But more is still
needed, beseeched Caplan, who is the artistic director of the
Cunneen-Hackett Cultural Center in Poughkeepsie.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a diamond in the rough, and it should be the
jewel of the Hudson,'' said Caplan, whose house in Beacon resembles
a Bannerman museum-in-waiting, crammed with canteens, pith helmets
and ephemera. ``It's a rare piece of history.''
</P>
<P>
   The top priorities are ensuring safe access to the island,
stabilizing the buildings and rebuilding the small, three-bedroom
family residence. Next year, Caplan hopes to organize more
fund-raising tours, while Johnson, an art and photography teacher,
would like to lead some student field trips. And perhaps by the end
of next year, there will be some regular, limited-access tours for
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a project that we're going to plug away at, and we're
excited about it,'' said Bernadette Castro, the state parks
commissioner. ``This is truly possibly one of the greatest
destinations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The changes have astonished Frank Bannerman VIII, a lifelong
bachelor who owns the last Roman numeral in the family tree. He
served in World War II; became a salesman at the Wood Shed, a
furniture store in Hartsdale; and thought less and less about the
castle.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bannerman visited the island for the first time
since 1937. ``I knew that there had been fires, and it was a
shambles, but I had no idea it would be as bad as it was,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, he has been impressed by the progress, and looks
forward to the day when the public can enjoy what used to be the
most private and magical of worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When anyone in the family said `the island,' they weren't
talking about Long Island,'' Bannerman recalled fondly. ``You kind
of felt you had something that no one else had. You respected it
for being unusual.''

OUTDOORS: NEOPHYTES LEAVE THEIR GUIDE JEALOUS IN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RECESS, Ireland _ A book by the fire at the Lough Inagh Lodge
looked ever more enticing than sitting in a boat on a chilly day as
the mist outside turned a darker gray. But who among us could
resist those fly rods standing so nobly in the back hallway of this
County Galway fishing lodge?
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever fly-fished before?'' asked Ronan Creane, the
lodge's guide. ``Yes,'' we replied in unison, as couples do. ``But
not a lot.'' My husband, Dick Baker, had once cast in the river
waters of Oregon and Wyoming, and I had dropped lines from the deep
Alpine grasses of northwest Montana. But this was a mountain lake
on the west coast of Ireland, and we soon found ourselves getting
in a boat.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 19-foot skiff, a narrow wooden hull that looked like
the Rangely guide boats of woodland Maine. One pull of the
six-horsepower Yamaha, and we were heading against a freshening
breeze along the four-mile lake. Our cache of wet flies _ a bibio,
a black pennell and a few daddy longlegs _ filled an arsenal meant
to lure sea trout, brown trout and Atlantic salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Regional Fisheries Board for the Connemara region
has reported a decline in sea trout here the last few years. But it
is still a popular fishing destination. The Irish Tourist Board
estimates that more than 6,000 North Americans fished Ireland's
coastal waters for sea trout last year. During our late September
day of fishing on Lough Inagh, we were the only boat out.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide, a disarmingly self-assured 21-year-old, left no doubt
that we would catch something. Creane had just beaten his father,
Joe, an international competitor, in a local fishing derby the day
before. How he did it was a tale of perseverance that fired up our
determination.
</P>
<P>
   Creane, you see, had selected a secluded spot along a nearby
lake and waited for the contest to begin. The rules prohibited
fishing from a boat as we were allowed to do on Lough Inagh. From
the shore instead, our young guide had mounted a daylong fishing
vigil. But in the excitement of competition, he had forgotten his
rain gear.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than go back to shore for his jacket, Creane kept
casting. As his clothes got wetter, he got colder. So he began
disrobing; doesn't everyone? He removed his clothing piece by
piece. Then he spread his sodden shirt, pants and underclothing on
adjacent bushes, hoping they would dry as the rain began to abate.
</P>
<P>
   No one else was around, which was part of his game plan. He was
sure he had picked the choicest fishing hole, and was not about to
leave it. Not even when it meant fishing in the buff.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Creane, fully clothed once again,
delivered almost nine pounds of fish, a sizeable catch that put him
in second place in the competition. The winner's total weighed only
three ounces more than Creane's. Better yet, our young guide had
beaten his father, who finished in third place.
</P>
<P>
   We latched onto the story eagerly as we began our day of
fishing. Creane had turned off the boat's engine, and we were
drifting down the lake with an oar put out to the side as a rudder.
But in less than an hour, dozens of thwarted casts revealed our
rookie inadequacies against the fitful breeze. Try as we might, our
lines got tangled like used kite string. We hooked everything on
the boat but each other, and that was going to be next.
</P>
<P>
   Creane, undoubtedly fearful of being hooked himself, suggested a
change of pace. We would troll down the lake with the engine
running. Had we been self-respecting fly-fishers, we would have
nixed the idea. But we were desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, I had the first strike. It was a salmon, albeit
a tiny salmon that looked more despondent than I had been. The next
catch proved to be a heartier sea trout. Measuring about one pound,
it came into the boat with a little kick, not unlike the cutthroat
trout I remembered landing several years ago in Montana. We threw
my Irish fish back as part of the lake's catch-and-release policy.
</P>
<P>
   It was a whole lot harder to throw back the next one _ a
two-and-a-quarter-pound brown trout that Creane said was easily the
third-largest brown caught on the lake all season. Since we were
there in late September, and the fishing year had started in
February, I felt a bit smug. But I was not alone. Creane was beside
himself with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lovely fish,'' he said excitedly. ``To catch a brown
that size, the chances are very slim. The biggest fish here this
season was 3.2 pounds. Will you send me the photo?''
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, Dick landed a brown that was quite nearly the
same size. I could swear it was the same fish. Either way, they
were big fish for Lough Inagh, and beautiful. On the way back to
shore, I thought I noticed a wistful look on Creane's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very jealous that I didn't catch one of those fish,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I was touched. ``I'll send you the pictures,'' I promised.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR RIVERS, A PREDICTION RINGS TRUE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  ( Eds:  Adds result of Saturday's game to 5th graf . ) 
(rk) 
 By   HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dialogue came at a delicate time of a player's career, near
its conclusion, which, Doc Rivers believes, explains the revulsion
he had for the job he now loves.
</P>
<P>
   He had just aired out his differences with Pat Riley over his
status with the Knicks when the power coach, out of breath and
finally sensing he couldn't bully the veteran, said: ``You're like
me, stubborn. You'll coach in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, Riles,'' Rivers answered. ``I'm a family guy.
Look at you, all wound up in this. Working 24 hours. You have no
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   What particularly alarmed Rivers was that Riley didn't argue
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Half a decade later, Saturday afternoon, Riley's vision returned
to Madison Square Garden, where, in 2 and a half years as a Knick,
Rivers cultivated a decade's worth of popularity. The Magic lost to
the Knicks, 99-96, but overall, Orlando's gain has been New York's
and New Jersey's loss. In Miami, Riley must have felt like the
world's best-dressed prophet when Rivers was hired as the Doc to
treat the Magic's post-Shaq-and-Penny syndrome last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I had that conversation with Riley, I was reaching
the point where I just wanted to get away from the locker room,''
Rivers said.
</P>
<P>
   He went to San Antonio for a season and a half, where one
playoff run was sabotaged when Dennis Rodman sat on the bench in
his socks. When Rivers' wife became pregnant with their fourth
child, he said ``enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a job as a television analyst. The next year, someone
set fire to the Rivers' home near a San Antonio golf course. The
family was away. R.C. Buford, a Spurs assistant coach and close
friend, happened to be on the course when the house went up. He
raced to the front door, found a way in and asked himself a
question most of us have: What should he save?
</P>
<P>
   ``He got the family photo albums and the videotapes of the
kids,'' Rivers said. ``He went in twice and was going to go in
again when the police said they'd arrest him if he did.''
</P>
<P>
   With friends like that, Rivers reminded himself he didn't need a
coaching job to not have time for them. He had a merry, stress-free
broadcasting life, watching the game continue to devolve into
Riley's ultimate vision of basketball, as a hockey score.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, it made him crazy watching guards walk the ball
up the court, the shot clock ticking, the fans yawning. By last
season, his third in headphones, Rivers found himself, at
courtside, conjuring up alternative game plans. Found himself
coaching along with the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I still had something left on the bench,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected a chance to be Milwaukee's general manager. The
Garden's Dave Checketts had a preliminary chat with him about the
Knicks' GM job, before the friendly bounce of Allan Houston's
runner that saved Jeff Van Gundy's job. The Nets, wasting time
dressed up as Phil Jackson's leverage, could not have done better
than Rivers. But then, Rivers was in a rare position for a black
former player who wasn't a big box-office draw. He had some
leverage himself and was too smart to start at the bottom of the
ladder, set up to fail.
</P>
<P>
   So he signed with Orlando, which promptly jettisoned most of its
disgruntled veteran talent.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Doc, people said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor nothing,'' he said. ``We're not going to be rebuilding
very long, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magic has a bundle of bad teams' first-round draft picks
over the next three years, and salary cap room to kill for. These
are not amenities one should necessarily count on, but, as Rivers
said, Orlando's weather is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league is about recruiting now,'' he said. ``The money's
the same everywhere. And this is where Tiger Woods lives. Ken
Griffey Jr. Wesley Snipes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Snipes? Oh, right. ``White Men Can't Jump.'' And the
Magic, as presently assembled, can't win, except Rivers' team has
managed to hold its own.
</P>
<P>
   His players get to run and he tries not to hustle them. He
admits it is easier to tell the truth to what is, with the
exception of Darrell Armstrong, a bunch of role players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them my opinion and it doesn't have to be their opinion
and they don't have to like it but, so far, they do,'' Rivers said.
``If I had five superstars, I might not be able to coach the same
way.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had Latrell Sprewell, he said he would have had to say
that Sprewell didn't handle his return to Golden State too well. He
would have told Sprewell that his values were twisted, that shaking
P.J. Carlesimo's hand would not have been ``selling out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers added, ``But that's none of my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Van Gundy has copped out with the same attitude,
which is what happens when dissent becomes house rule. On a
healthier plane, some people believe Rivers has a chance to lure
Tim Duncan to Orlando next season, based on their relationship when
Rivers was broadcasting Spurs games. This may be a remote
possibility, at best, and the coach, of course, can't comment.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't on television anymore, free to share every who, what,
why and whimsy. He is a coach, his bio listed this season on Page
319 of the NBA register. On the opposite page, you guessed it,
Florida's other main man on the bench. Once again, Rivers is
face-to-face with Riley, who told him this is exactly where he
would end up.

IDEA IN CHICAGO IS ALL WORK WITH SOME PLAY
</HEADLINE>
   (With FBN-NOTEBOOK) 
(rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an experiment of sorts taking place in Chicago, and if
it is successful it could be a blueprint for how NFL head coaches
approach the game in the future. Bears coach Dick Jauron is the one
playing chemist, and so far he has been able to accomplish
something few NFL head coaches ever have: working hard while
simultaneously allowing himself, his staff members and his players
time for their personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   What a concept _ being able to succeed in the NFL, and also
spend time with significant others. During the intense NFL season,
in which coaches often work 16- to 18-hour days, it is the family
that often suffers. In a twisted sort of way, the more time a coach
spends in the office, the more he is seen by his peers as a
warrior, no matter what the consequences to a coach's health or his
family life.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil used to work 20-hour days as coach of the
Philadelphia Eagles, and the stress became so unbearable that he
quit football. Vermeil has since lightened up with the St. Louis
Rams, but he still routinely works extremely long days. Kansas City
coach Gunther Cunningham said this year that when he dies, he wants
it to be on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Jauron seems to have drawn a line _ it is a thin one, but a line
nevertheless _ between the maniacal demands of the profession and
the necessity of leading a relatively normal life. Jauron still
works hard, and expects his players and staff to do the same. But
he allows both groups to have a life outside of football. Jauron
figures that if that happens, then everyone involved will be
happier, and thus more productive.
</P>
<P>
   Jauron is speaking from experience. He was a longtime assistant
coach, most notably as the defensive coordinator with the
Jacksonville Jaguars, before getting the Bears job. He also played
eight seasons as a safety in the NFL, five with Detroit and three
with Cincinnati. When doing both jobs, Jauron always noticed how
much better he played or coached when he was allowed time away from
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jauron to me is an all-around person,'' Bears wide receiver
Curtis Conway said. ``I like his style. He knows there's more to
life than just football. I think he's one of those coaches that
knows we have families and knows that sometimes you just want to
get way and relax, because he played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jauron's staff still works those insane football hours on
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, getting to the office at 5 a.m. or 6
a.m. and not leaving until 10 that night. But unlike most NFL head
coaches, Jauron encourages his assistants to leave early on
Thursday so that they can spend time with their families. The same
goes on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jauron also asks his players to think about life outside of
football. Once a week during meetings when the team is discussing
its next game, he will stop and ask that they look at the big
picture, both in terms of the football season and their own state
of mind.
</P>
<P>
   If Jauron's positive approach sounds too much like a yoga class,
well, it has not made the team soft. The Bears are still a rough,
hard-working team that has yet to quit a game this season. And
Jauron is still a realist.
</P>
<P>
   While no one has studied the subject, there is a strong belief
among many people in the league that coaches have an extremely high
rate of divorce. One of the most talked-about subjects among
coaching buddies is how this friend or that one is separating from
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, part of Jauron's approach comes from the fact that he does
not want to see his own staff in turmoil. And the Bears' coaches
are extremely family oriented. Jauron and his wife, Gail, have two
daughters, Kay, 14, and Amy, 12. His defensive coordinator has six
children; the offensive coordinator and the linebackers coach each
has five children; the defensive line coach and the running backs
coaches each has four; the wide receivers coach has three; the
tight ends coach has two; and the offensive line coach and special
teams coach have one apiece.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to say exactly, but the Bears' coaching staff
probably has one of the largest collective families in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's real good for the staff to be able to get away,''
Jauron said. ``The fact is in our business it's difficult. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday the staff will be working anywhere from 14 to 16
hours. On Thursday I really do like to get them out of here by 6:30
or 7 o'clock. Friday should be an early day so they have time to
spend with other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jauron, so far, has been as tactically minded on the field as he
is compassionate off it. After 12 games his team is 5-7, when in
terms of talent, it is a three-victory group at most. The previous
coach, Dave Wannstedt, went 4-12 each of the last two seasons.
Jauron is 3-3 in the NFC Central, and Wannstedt never finished
above .500 in the division in five years as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   If Jauron can keep building the Bears, he might become one of
the first coaches in a while to win without wearing out his players
and staff. Maybe it is still a long shot. Maybe NFL coaching is
destined to always be a pressure-cooker job.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe at some point in the next millennium, Jauron's way of
thinking will be the one most coaches follow.

 SHARPTON CONDEMNS CRACKDOWN ON HOMELESS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton Saturday denounced Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's recent crackdown on homeless people and called on New
Yorkers to monitor and report police efforts to sweep the homeless
off the streets. Sharpton said he planned to hold an all-night
``tent city'' vigil for the homeless at City Hall Park on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a packed room at a rally at the National Action
Network, his headquarters in Harlem, Sharpton called the arrests a
politically motivated attempt to curry favor with voters after a
brutal attack on a woman in Midtown two weeks ago. He was
surrounded by civil libertarians, clergy, advocates for the
homeless and Cornel West, the Harvard professor who is a leading
scholar of African-American studies and a best-selling author of
books about race in America.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said he would hold the vigil, where participants would
sleep on the grass and sidewalks of City Hall Park, with or without
a permit. He called the mayor's crackdown ``unfair, class-based and
in many ways, race-based,'' adding that New Yorkers had a
responsibility for ``protecting the rights of those who are the new
targets of this mayor, who has gone out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 19, Giuliani said that the homeless had no right to
sleep on the streets, and his police commissioner added that they
could be arrested if they refused shelter. That announcement came
three days after a young woman, Nicole Barrett, was seriously
injured when she was struck from behind with a brick. Investigators
have said they believe the man who attacked her could be homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crackdown was announced, police have arrested more
than 100 homeless people. ``Don't think that this is not an issue
that the mayor is using as a political tool in the Senate race,''
Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also has a policy that forces people out of
shelters if they refuse to work inthe city's workfare program.
</P>
<P>
   West criticized that policy, but he cautioned that the problem
was broader than Giuliani. ``He's just a symptom of something else
going on in this city,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   West said that, increasingly, even as the economy boomed, ``poor
people are being segregated by powerful people like Mayor
Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has defended his efforts to force people in shelters to
work and he has called the removal of homeless people from the
street a compassionate act. He has said his critics feel guilty
about what little they have done about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers said Saturday that if Giuliani really wanted to
help the homeless, he would divert the resources from law
enforcement toward job training and low-income housing.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani supporters argue that he has done more for the homeless
than his most recent predecessors. The budget for homeless
services, now at $420 million, has been increased $30 million in
the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Those supporters also argue that the Giuliani administration has
put more money into mental health, substance abuse, employment
services and shelter security.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the planned City Hall Park rally do not yet have a
permit and will not be allowed to hold the event without one.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration has been criticized for its
reluctance to issue permits to groups the mayor disagrees with, but
the battle over this rally could become particularly sticky given
that city officials have restricted access to the steps and the
plaza in front of City Hall since August 1998, after the bombings
of American embassies in East Africa.

 MANAGED CARE'S FUTURE  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Nov. 28:
</P>
<P>
   The recent decision by UnitedHealth Group, a big managed care
company, to let doctors treat patients without interference might
mark the death of one reviled tactic of managed care. No longer
will United have to approve, in advance, procedures that doctors
have recommended to their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors resented the need for such clearance as an intolerable
interference by unqualified outsiders, and patients resented any
denials as cost-saving by the insurance company at the expense of
their health. To United's surprise, the advance approvals were not
even saving any money, so it ended the practice.
</P>
<P>
   But if the managed care companies abandon the requirement for
approval in advance, they will have to come up with effective
alternatives. Two less incendiary options are already available.
Someone needs to put a lid on physician charges. That someone, the
market appears to be saying, should be the physicians themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the first option, doctors operate independent practices,
decide what treatments patients need and submit the bill to
insurance carriers, which pay them at a negotiated rate. United
offers its enrollees a popular version of such coverage, a
``preferred provider organization'' that charges patients a small
fee to visit doctors on a list of participating physicians and a
higher fee to visit non-participating physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of approving doctors' recommendations in advance, United
will now collect data on each doctor's practice patterns over the
year. The data will be used to help doctors adopt their
profession's best practices. But those who habitually resort to
needlessly expensive or inappropriate care will be called to task,
perhaps even dropped from the preferred list. Patients can continue
to use these doctors, but only if they pay higher fees for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether preferred provider organizations can hold
down costs with retrospective review. If they cannot, their
premiums will soar.
</P>
<P>
   In the second option, physicians join a large medical group like
the Cleveland Clinic or one of the Kaiser Permanente medical groups
across the country. Such medical groups collect a fixed fee from
insurance carriers for each patient they enroll no matter how much
care is eventually required. Once the fee is paid, the insurance
company bows out because no more of its money is at risk. The
physicians take collective responsibility for treating patients
within their fixed budget.
</P>
<P>
   Medical groups typically pay their physicians a base salary plus
a small bonus tied to the overall financial health of the medical
group. But because the groups are large, ranging from a few hundred
to a few thousand physicians, the decisions of any one doctor
barely affect overall financial performance. No physician, then,
has an incentive to skimp on care. The problem for medical groups
has been learning to manage these complicated financial
arrangements. Many have gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   So where will these options leave patients? They can pick
preferred provider organizations with a wide selection of
physicians. But if retrospective review proves ineffective, this
option will become expensive. Or patients can choose a group
practice, where the choice of physicians will be more limited,
although some medical groups permit patients to see physicians
outside the group for extra fees. The lure of group practice will
be low premiums if, as is likely, doctors are better equipped to
discipline themselves than are insurance companies. Another lure is
that doctors working in teams should provide better care than
doctors operating outside the view of their peers.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to know whether managed care companies other than
United will also stop screening doctors' decisions in advance. But
if United has bet right, patients everywhere will have managed care
options that free doctors of day-to-day scrutiny by faraway
insurance companies. The market is driving insurance companies to
the sidelines because that is where patients insist they belong.

ANDES ADVENTURE RACE NOT FOR FAINT OF HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALICIA AULT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the rest of us lazily reached for the remote this weekend,
200 supertoned athletes from 31 nations continued preparations to
paddle, ride horseback, climb, rappel, schlep, scratch and claw
their way through the Andes.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, these just-do-it enthusiasts will depart from the
northern Patagonia town of Bariloche, Argentina, in a 12-day quest
to claim at most $50,000, plus the 1999 Eco-Challenge title and
bragging rights for having completed one of the toughest contests
in adventure racing.
</P>
<P>
   With five disciplines _ riding, canoeing, kayaking, fixed ropes
and orienteering _ the Eco-Challenge is akin to a modern-day
heptathlon. The race's founder, Mark Burnett, says it's an
expedition. In a nutshell, the Challenge, now in its sixth year,
matches teams of four against some of the most demanding terrain on
earth. This year it's 300 miles of rugged Patagonian highlands.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stanley and Livingstone, Lewis and Clark or Thelma and
Louise, Eco-Challenge racers must rely mostly on their wits and
resourcefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about chemistry and character,'' said Burnett, adding
that ``all the great expeditions of our time'' have depended more
upon human dynamics than money or endurance. He has tried to
replicate that spirit. Eco-Challenge racers are not given the
course layout or segment order until four days before the start.
</P>
<P>
   Racers have spent a year in training: scouting terrain and gear,
hitting the weights, learning to rappel off frozen waterfalls. But
the key to finishing, and to winning, will be how they respond to
the teammate downed by dysentery or the snowstorm that socks them
into a glacial cave for a day, or a horse that, despite carrots and
sharp heels in the flank, will not enter a darkened bamboo forest
after an afternoon on the dry, flat pampas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your preparation is really flexibility _ being able to wing it
on the fly,'' said Rebecca Rusch, whose Team Rubicon was undone in
the 1998 Eco-Challenge by bickering over a teammate's inability to
overcome fear and altitude sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Success depends on bonding, teamwork and maturity, Rusch said,
and ``being able to go slow, ask directions and communicate with
your teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Rusch is piloting the Atlas Snowshoes/Rubicon team,
which is made up mostly of women. She is joined by Cathy Sassin and
Robyn Benincasa, two of the best-known female adventure racers. The
fourth member of their team is Ian Adamson, a corporate trainer who
has had first- and second-place finishes in previous Eco-Challenges
and the Raid Gauloises and Hi-Tec adventure races.
</P>
<P>
   Top adventure racers tend to be in their mid-30s to mid-40s. One
American team of 20-somethings dropped out a month before this
year's race, fazed by logistics and the fear factor.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998s race in Morocco, 32 of 55 teams finished, but
Burnett expects only 20 percent to conquer the expedition this
year. ``Patagonia is known for having some of the worst weather on
earth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Patagonian peninsula acts like a big wind tunnel. Prevailing
winds run west to east, dumping thousands of millimeters of
precipitation on the mountaintops as they rush down to blister the
pampas.
</P>
<P>
   Being wet is a constant for competitors. Competitors will kayak
across 200-square-mile Lake Nahuel Huapi, canoe down a raging river
fed by melt from a record winter snowfall, and trudge across
glaciers as the race meanders through the Lakes District along the
Andean spine of Argentina and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cold, wet and wind of the world drains the spirit far more
than steamy jungles or dry, hot deserts,'' Burnett said cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are heart-gripping ascents and descents, in which
racers must negotiate an elevation equal to Everest, with much of
the upward trip over rock and glacier at 30- to 80-degree vertical
inclines. Fixed ropes will help climbers teeter over crevasses and
crampon their way up ice falls.
</P>
<P>
   With no ``dark zones'' during the race, competitors can go all
night; 16 hours of daylight will encourage the workaholics.
</P>
<P>
   Although Eco-Challenge has never lost a racer, the danger is
palpable. ``Weather can close in and prevent helicopter access,''
said Adrian Cohen, the race's medical director, ``so it's back to
ground-based rescues over snow and ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hardships, Rusch said, racers always return.
``People forget how bad it was,'' she said, likening the race to
childbirth, ``and then they go back for more.''

   A look at the playoff picture shows that a number of the
divisions are still very tight, and that a few aren't.
</P>
<P>
   _ NFC East: Washington remains the favorite, but Arizona at 4-6
has won two straight games and could create a four-team race.
</P>
<P>
   _ NFC Central: Only 2{ games separate last-place Chicago (5-7)
and first-place Detroit (7-4).
</P>
<P>
   _ NFC West: St. Louis will likely go 8-0 in the division and win
home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ AFC East: Indianapolis has edged in front of Miami and New
England is fading.
</P>
<P>
   _ AFC Central: The race could come down to the
Jacksonville-Tennessee game on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   _ AFC West: Oakland (5-5) and Kansas City (5-5) need miracles to
catch Seattle (8-2).
</P>
<P>
   Drug Policy Is Revisited
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials met with investigators from the office of Sen.
Charles Grassley last week in Washington and told them that players
who failed drug tests in 1995 did not go undisciplined, a league
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, R-Iowa, is chairman of the Senate's Caucus on
International Narcotics Control. He began an inquiry into the
league's drug program following an Aug. 30 article in The New York
Times about the annual meeting of the NFL Players Association in
1995, the year a new drug policy was adopted. In videotapes of the
meeting, a union official says that 16 players who had failed drug
tests under the former policy and should have been suspended were
not suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigation began, NFL and union officials have said
that there were no improprieties in the drug program, and that the
16 players were disciplined by being monitored under the new drug
policy. On the videotape, however, the union's assistant executive
director, Doug Allen, says that the former policy had a double
standard, many times allowing star players to go unpunished while
other players were disciplined for identical infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old policy was unfair,'' Allen says on the tapes. ``It
treated players differently if they had the same situation. And it
often depended on how the club felt about you and what kind of
player they thought you were.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Kozeny, a spokeswoman for Grassley, said the investigation
was continuing. The Senate investigators may also speak with union
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Not Quite a Full Slash
</P>
<P>
   When wide receiver Johnnie Morton of the Lions caught a
fourth-quarter pass that clinched Detroit's Thanksgiving Day
victory over the Bears, he raised his hand to his throat and
prepared to make a slashing motion.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the thoughtful intervention of a teammate _ tackle
Barrett Brooks _ Morton quickly lowered his hand.
</P>
<P>
   If he had completed the motion, he could have been penalized 15
yards for unsportsmanlike conduct and fined $2,500 for violating
the NFL's recent edict against the slash gesture.

<P>
   RIDGEFIELD, N.J. _ Has James Chavez, an earnest Jehovah's
Witness, lost his way?
</P>
<P>
   He's wandering the truck lot at the Vince Lombardi rest area on
the New Jersey Turnpike, a Bible in his hand and diesel fumes in
his nose. Shouldn't he be knocking on doors, rousting people from
Barcaloungers and dinner tables to encourage Bible study? After
all, it's a fact of life that if you have a doorbell, sooner or
later it will be rung by a Jehovah's Witness.
</P>
<P>
   But as a barometer of how busy and frenetic life has become,
Jehovah's Witnesses no longer count on finding people at home. They
have new strategies, seeking out people as they shop, go to work
and carry on their daily routines.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez often visits the truck stop on the northern edge of the
turnpike, urging the mud-flap crowd to shift to a higher gear.
Jehovah's Witnesses now try to get the ears of commuters at bus
stops, or joggers on the George Washington Bridge. Sometimes they
do ``toll witnessing,'' a kind of midair spiritual refueling of a
toll taker. ``As soon as we pay a toll, we hand them a tract,''
Chavez explained.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Lux, Chavez's partner the other day, said, ``Sometimes
they have 15 or 30 seconds with no one moving through.''
</P>
<P>
   Jehovah's Witnesses once carried their message almost
exclusively door to door. ``Nowadays,'' Lux said, ``if all you're
doing is knocking on doors, you're not talking to people.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true for sellers of vinyl siding and PTA candy, too, but
imagine if your product is spirituality. If you can't reach people
at home, try getting them to look at their relationship with God
while they're standing on the corner looking for the next New
Jersey Transit bus to the Port Authority terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Pity Chavez trying to spiritually engage a trucker from
California while engines roar around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Sikh,'' the driver told Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sick?'' Chavez yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Sikh,'' the man said again.
</P>
<P>
   They laughed when they got it straightened out. The driver
showed Chavez a religious icon from his dashboard and Chavez found
a tract written in Punjabi.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was welcomed by a woman sitting high in an idling
Peterbilt rig, smoking a cigarette, with a dog on her lap. He gave
her a pamphlet titled ``When Someone You Love Dies,'' and she
thanked him, saying her father had died recently.
</P>
<P>
   Jehovah's Witnesses like their reputation for eventually finding
everyone. Adhering to a literal reading of the Bible, they believe
they are divinely guided to spread the ``good news'' of the coming
kingdom of God. Lux, 39, who began going door-to-door as a boy in
South Dakota, says he fears that spirituality is being squeezed
from busy lives, making it more important for Jehovah's Witnesses
to find new ways to reach more people.
</P>
<P>
   They are running up against a human mutation of the late 20th
century: an internal caller-ID system that instantaneously sizes up
and disconnects unsolicited pitches, whether they're for fatter
wallets or thinner thighs.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 23, a waiter at an Olive Garden when he's not
``witnessing,'' understands. He said that when first approached by
a Jehovah's Witness while growing up in New York: ``I blew them
off. She told me something about the end of the world. I was messed
up. I was smoking drugs. I didn't want to know about the end of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   He took the second encounter seriously. And the other day, on
Anderson Avenue in Cliffside Park, he stopped a woman rushing by to
offer her a pamphlet titled ``Should You Fear the Apocalypse?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' she said. ``I need a job. Will it give me a
job?''
</P>
<P>
   Jehovah's Witnesses promise nothing, except that they will seek
you out _ even at home. One of the few people to answer Lux's knock
that day was a woman who rushed to the door with a poodle underfoot
and a child in the background. Lux politely said he wanted to
discuss the Bible. Given how harried she was, he might as well have
asked if she wanted to learn to tango. Her weary smile said,
``Maybe sometime, but maybe not with you.''
</P>
<P>
   But her stated excuse was just what Lux expected: ``I just don't
have the time right now.''

 LABORERS WANTED, BUT NOT LIVING NEXT DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGVILLE, N.Y. _ Down a slate path, behind a row of hedges
and white vinyl-sided walls, Roberto Tobar Galvez, 24, shares a
small ranch house here with more than a dozen other day laborers
from the state of Hidalgo in central Mexico. Each morning they
gather on street corners in the hopes of being hired for
construction and gardening jobs that can pay $80 to $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   But if a proposed law takes effect, he might not be here much
longer.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Neighborhood Preservation Act would outlaw dozens
of houses like Galvez's by limiting the number of people who can
legally occupy rentals. And it would give the town of Brookhaven,
which governs the area, the authority to enter homes _ in some
cases without a warrant _ to enforce the code.
</P>
<P>
   The law has touched off an emotional, racially charged conflict
in this eastern Long Island town, where day laborers have become an
increasingly conspicuous fact of life _ newcomers from impoverished
villages in Mexico and Central America in a mostly white hamlet of
15,000. And it has highlighted in stark relief a situation being
repeated across the New York suburbs as Hispanic laborers _ drawn
to boom-era jobs that no one else is taking _ find themselves
valued as workers but not as neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is happening in many places,'' said Stefan H. Krieger,
the director of the Housing Rights Clinic at Hofstra Law School.
``And behind it all is the lack of affordable housing.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has taken on a through-the-looking-glass quality:
groups that have long spoken out harshly against immigrants are
suddenly professing concern for their safety in crowded dwellings.
Landlords are rallying to the support of their day-laborer tenants
with impassioned speeches against discrimination. And immigrants'
rights groups and housing advocates alike find themselves opposing
a bill that seeks to improve living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the locals and the new arrivals, who began
coming here about five years ago as construction picked up on
eastern Long Island, have run high from the start. Some homeowners
accuse the newcomers of everything from littering to selling drugs
to molesting women to driving down property values. The immigrants
complain of beatings, harassment and constant taunts. A proposal
that would have banned open-air hiring halls here failed earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now Farmingville is riven by the proposed housing law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's backers call it a safety measure that would protect
renters from landlords who crowd them into unsafe houses. They
point to a series of fires in such houses across Long Island that
have killed several immigrants in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the day laborers and advocacy groups fiercely oppose the
proposal, calling it just another attempt to drive out immigrants.
They say the safety argument is a sham, since the bill places no
limits on the number of people homeowners can crowd into their own
homes and excludes rentals on Fire Island, where time-sharers from
Manhattan pack into beach houses like sardines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the proposed law, each dwelling would have to have at
least 150 square feet of space per occupant, not including kitchens
or bathrooms, and no more than four people could share a bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow the town to inspect rental apartments with
search warrants, by getting the permission of the tenant, ``or at
such other time as may be necessary in an emergency, without
consent of the owner, agent and / or tenant.'' To pay for the new
inspectors, landlords would be required to pay a fee every two
years ranging from $150 for a one-bedroom rental to $550 for one
with five bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Similar laws have been passed in Patchogue and Freeport on Long
Island and Mount Kisco in Westchester County, where building
inspectors and the police join to go on midnight raids. Krieger, of
the housing rights clinic, said that many towns in California had
imposed similar measures. On Long Island, the trend has led
landlords to create their own group, the Coalition of Landlords,
Homeowners and Merchants, to fight what they say are excessive
fines and an infringement upon their rights to use their property
as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Brookhaven proposal, violations would be punishable by
fines and jail time, but there is some confusion as to who would be
held liable. John Jay LaValle, a member of the Brookhaven Town
Council, said at a public hearing this month that it was aimed at
landlords. But advocates for the day laborers say the bill's
language is ambiguous and could be construed to be aimed at not
only landlords but also at renters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would punish people who are already forced to live in bad
conditions,'' said Nadia Marin-Molina, the executive director of
the Workplace Project.
</P>
<P>
   Among the rental bill's staunchest supporters are members of a
civic group called the Sachem Quality of Life Organization.
Margaret Bianculli, the president of the group, which was formerly
known as Farmingville Citizens for Immigration Reform, said that
she began pressuring local officials to crack down on day laborers
in the area after a man made lewd comments to her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rights of foreign nationals are taking precedence over the
rights of citizens,'' she said. ``We came to understand that we
were actually the underdogs; we were actually the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bianculli said that she resented the charges that the
members of her group are racist or xenophobic, adding that she
would have mobilized against the workers on the streets whether
they were Swedes, Germans or Americans.

PATAKI SEEKS TRADE-OFF WITH DEMOCRATS TO CUT MEDICAID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In secret negotiations, Gov. George Pataki is
pushing his Democratic rivals in the Legislature to cut Medicaid
spending steeply as part of a deal to preserve a program that pays
hospitals billions of dollars to treat uninsured patients and train
doctors, according to people involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.7 billion state program is set to expire at the end of
the year, and Pataki has not said exactly what he plans to do about
it. But Democrats and representatives of the health care workers'
unions privately say that the governor is using the program's
looming expiration to try to force reductions in Medicaid _
across-the-board cuts that he has sought nearly every year in
office, usually without success.
</P>
<P>
   The administration concedes that the two programs have been
linked in private talks in recent weeks, but insists that it has
not made renewal of the subsidies contingent on cutting Medicaid.
The administration also notes that it would not be bothering to
pursue the current negotiations if the other side had not signaled
a willingness to consider the governor's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the parties have indicated that they want to negotiate in
good faith,'' said one official close to the governor. ``We believe
that all the parties have an open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The state program of hospital subsidies, the Health Care Reform
Act, is financed through surcharges added to all hospital bills,
inflating medical expenses. Pataki's powerful business allies have
urged him to reduce the charges, contending that employers end up
paying most of them through higher insurance premiums for their
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous: New York's hospitals operate on thin
margins, and would quickly be unable to meet their bills without
the enormous subsidy created by the surcharges. The program also
pays to insure children in tens of thousands of low-income families
who would lose that health coverage if the program is not renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, each side appears prepared to force a standoff
with the Dec. 31 deadline fast approaching. The powerful hospital
workers' unions and their Democratic allies vow to wage political
war against the governor if he makes any move to scale back the
program or greatly reduce state financing for hospitals. But
officials close to Pataki privately say they doubt that he would
suffer any serious political consequences, given his popularity and
the fact that he is not up for re-election until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Reform Act was adopted three years ago as part
of a far-reaching effort to deregulate New York's health care
industry and open it to market forces. For decades, New York had
been one of a handful of states that set the rates that hospitals
could charge for all medical procedures, from an appendectomy to
open-heart surgery. The hospitals had no say in what what to
charge, and insurers had no say in what to pay.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, at Pataki's urging, the state stopped setting
rates. That change introduced an era of fierce competition in which
hospitals were forced to negotiate with powerful insurers over the
price of procedures that now total $16 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   But one element of the old system was retained in an effort to
shield New York's hospitals, many of them economically distressed,
from the full brunt of market forces. The state continued to add
charges to all hospital bills, although the charges are one-third
less than they were under the old system, to provide subsidies to
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The largest part of that money, about $780 million a year, goes
toward reimbursing hospitals for payments they cannot collect from
patients who are usually poor and uninsured. The second-largest
piece, about $540 million annually, goes to teaching hospitals to
train doctors who are just out of medical school. A third piece,
worth about $210 million, was created to provide health coverage
for low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   According to people involved in the negotiations, the governor
is seeking to wring some savings for the state by restraining its
fast-growing Medicaid program. The program, which pays for medical
care for the poor and the elderly, represents the largest part of
the state budget, totaling about $28 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the cuts that Pataki wants is not clear. But
according to people involved in the negotiations, he is at the very
least seeking an extension of a series of Medicaid cuts that are
due to expire on April 1. Those cuts total $1 billion a year in
federal, state and local financing for the program, and the
governor would like to renew them for at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who control the state Assembly have not completely
ruled out Pataki's proposal. But in the end, Democratic leaders are
likely to take their cue from labor groups, most notably the
leaders of 1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees
Union, who say they oppose any reduction in state support for
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has also indicated that he wants to cut the money
used to pay hospitals to train young doctors, though he has not
indicated how much of a cut he wants, according to those involved
in the talks. That proposal is likely to meet with stiff resistance
from Democrats and union leaders, who regard the money as crucial
to the survival of teaching hospitals. Their resolve is most likely
to be strengthened now that Congress has made deep Medicare cuts
for New York's teaching hospitals in the budget it has sent to
President Clinton.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some Republicans have suggested replacing the current funding
source for doctors' training with cash that the state is expected
to receive from last year's settlement of a national lawsuit
against the tobacco industry. But it is not clear whether Pataki
will do that.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has offered some inducements, according to those involved
in the talks. Privately, he has said that he is willing to expand
health care coverage for the poor and the uninsured _ something
that Democrats and union leaders strongly support, though they
would like to use tobacco money for such an initiative. It is not
clear how Pataki intends to do that, though he is said to be
looking into using tax cuts as an incentive for small-business
owners to provide health benefits to their employees.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest uncertainties the governor faces is the
response of the Republican majority in the state Senate. Its
members are closely allied with Pataki and believe there is a need
to cut health care costs. But they also want to avoid a battle with
the health care workers' unions, since they are up for re-election
next year, and given that they also want to protect hospitals,
which are among the biggest employers in most Senate districts.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Republicans in the Senate have stuck by the
governor, allowing him to try to negotiate a deal with Democrats
and the union leaders. But at the same time, some officials have
indicated that the Republican majority is prepared to step in if
the negotiations stall, possibly with a proposal to renew the
existing system of surcharges before they expire. It is not clear,
though, whether such a move would satisfy union leaders who are
calling for some changes to the current system.

PLAYING IT SAFE WITH CO-OP INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Homeowners are often admonished to make sure that the
hazard and liability insurance on their homes is up to date and
that it provides all the needed coverage. Co-op shareholders are
likewise advised _ usually by boards of directors or the building's
lawyers _ to obtain insurance for the furniture and fixtures within
their apartments, because the coverage provided by the building's
hazard policy essentially stops at a tenant-shareholder's door.
</P>
<P>
   But co-op boards also need to be diligent when determining the
insurance needs of the building itself and carefully scrutinize the
fine print in their policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casualty insurance is a very technical, but very important
tool for protecting shareholders from the loss of their investments
in the event of a fire or other catastrophe,'' said James Samson, a
Manhattan co-op lawyer. ``But unfortunately, in the search for the
lowest possible insurance premiums, many boards of directors end up
settling for restrictions in their policy that could later come
back to haunt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Samson said that while boards are often aware of the basic
perils and hazards that are covered by their building's insurance
policy, they are often surprised to learn of some of the things
that some policies do not cover.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Samson said, a policy that provides ``fire and
extended coverage'' actually provides coverage for only a limited
number of additional perils, including lightning, explosion,
windstorm, hailstorm, smoke damage and a few less likely
occurrences like sinkhole collapse and volcanic activity.
</P>
<P>
   What is not covered by such a policy, he said, are damages
caused by things like defective or malfunctioning boilers or
machinery, floods and water seepage, and losses or additional
expenses that may arise as the result of interruption of utility
services, government action or new municipal laws or ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these exclusions can be particularly troublesome,''
Samson said, explaining that in the event of a catastrophic fire,
for example, the building's insurance policy will often fail to
provide coverage for the cost of complying with more restrictive
building or fire codes when the building is repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could result in the co-op corporation or condominium
association paying the cost of complying with the new laws,'' he
said. ``And that cost could be catastrophic for many buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, insurance experts say, even policies that are referred
to as ``all-risk'' policies generally do not provide coverage for
such costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most common exclusions listed under the standard
all-risk policy basically eliminates coverage for costs associated
with changes in municipal rules and regulations,'' said Andrew
Schutzman, president of AMS Risk Management &AMP; Consulting, in
Rockville Centre, N.Y. In fact, he said, because the term
``all-risk'' implies broader coverage than it actually provides,
such ``all-risk'' policies are increasingly described as those that
provide coverage for ``special causes of loss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That means the insurance company is saying: `We're going to
cover you for everything except for what's specifically excluded,''
Schutzman said. In addition to excluding coverage for changes in
local laws, he said, other types of coverage that are typically
excluded in such policies are coverages for flood, earthquake and
employee dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the term `flood' doesn't just refer to what happens when a
river ends up in your basement,'' Schutzman said, noting that most
policies also exclude from coverage losses associated with backups
of sewers and drains, and seepage caused by heavy rains or
water-main breaks.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, he said, co-ops and condominiums can obtain
coverage for things like sewer backups, seepage, floods,
earthquakes, employee dishonesty and changes in municipal rules and
regulations. But to do so, Schutzman said, they must purchase
separate policy endorsements covering such perils.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One item of special interest to older buildings that is being
excluded from general liability insurance policies with increasing
frequency, Schutzman said, is coverage for claims resulting from
exposure to lead-based paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of policies out there today that now have
lead-paint exclusions written into them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schutzman noted that since insurance carriers must file notice
of such exclusions with the state of New York, it is unlikely that
a carrier who has done so would then agree to remove the exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you're better off having coverage for lead-based
paint claims,'' Schutzman said. ``But that means you may have to
obtain your coverage from another carrier to get a policy without
the exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Samson, the co-op lawyer, said that another area of concern
about insurance relates to the issue of how much coverage should be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, he said, most co-ops and condominiums carry
what is known as ``replacement cost'' coverage. That means that the
amount of insurance purchased is theoretically sufficient to
completely rebuild the structure if it is totally destroyed. In
many cases, however, the actual amount of coverage purchased is
somewhat less than what it would cost to totally rebuild the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some co-op corporations and condominium associations are
tempted to underinsure their buildings,'' Samson said. ``The theory
is that rarely does a casualty occur that totally destroys the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, if the amount of coverage carried is not at
least 80 percent of the replacement value of the building, there is
a possibility that the carrier would only be required by law to pay
a pro-rata share of claims that are filed. That pro-rata share _
calculated by dividing the amount of insurance purchased by the
amount required _ would be applicable to all claims filed under the
policy against the carrier.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, if a property owner with a $1 million building
is required to have $800,000 worth of replacement-cost insurance,
but only purchases $600,000 worth of coverage, the carrier would
only be required to pay a 75 percent share of any claims filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that even in the event of a small fire, the co-op
or condominium receives only a portion of the cost of the
casualty,'' Samson said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mackoul, president of Mackoul &AMP; Associates, an insurance
broker in Lynbrook, N.Y., said that co-ops and condominiums can
almost always avoid problems like the one described by Samson by
making sure that the insurance carrier provides what is known as an
``agreed amount'' endorsement. With such an endorsement, he said,
the carrier acknowledges that while the insurance being purchased
is less than what it would cost to rebuild the insured property,
the carrier nevertheless agrees to waive its right to pay claims
only on a ``pro-rata'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   Mackoul pointed out that another endorsement that co-ops and
condominiums should attempt to obtain from their insurance carrier
is what is known as a ``waiver of subrogation.'' He explained that
without such a waiver, the insurance company would have the right
to sue a third party who may have caused a problem that resulted in
a claim being paid by the company _ even if that third party was a
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smartest thing a co-op or condominium board can do to
avoid these kinds of problems is to get their property and casualty
insurance from a company and broker that specializes in dealing
with those kinds of buildings,'' Mackoul said. ``That's probably
the best way to avoid getting burned.''

IN HOME SALES, A WORD WITH MANY MEANINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the language of real estate, in which phrases such
as ``needs TLC'' can be subject to any number of interpretations,
perhaps no other term can have as many meanings, or be as much a
misnomer, as the word ``exclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   In communities where most listings are automatically shared with
other brokerage agencies through a multiple-listing service, the
term ``exclusive broker'' has come to be synonymous with ``listing
broker.'' The same is largely true in markets without a
multiple-listing service, notably Manhattan, although in rare cases
an exclusive listing may mean that potential buyers can come only
through the agency that has the listing.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``exclusive right to sell'' listings, as well as
``exclusive agency'' listings. In the Hamptons, the terms
``co-exclusive'' and even ``tri-exclusive'' are in use.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is an exclusive, and how does it differ from the
free-for-all of what is called an open listing? And what does it
mean in terms of how a home is marketed and sold?
</P>
<P>
   At its most basic level, real estate agents say, an exclusive
listing refers to a written agreement between a seller of a
property and a brokerage concern that binds the seller for a
specified period of time, commonly three to six months, to use that
concern as the primary agency for both marketing and selling the
property.
</P>
<P>
   While an exclusive agreement never guarantees that a home will
be sold, it generally obligates the brokerage concern to not only
use its best efforts to reach that goal, but to also carry out a
multitude of tasks en route. In exchange, exclusive brokers are
guaranteed that they will receive a chunk of the commission even if
someone else ultimately brings the buyer to the home.
</P>
<P>
   One alternative to an exclusive listing is an open listing. In
an open listing, which is usually oral instead of written, no
single broker assumes responsibility for marketing a home. Instead,
the sellers can use whatever number of brokers they want, with the
stipulation that only the broker that produces a buyer will receive
a commission.
</P>
<P>
   With open listings, however, sellers are usually left with the
tasks of fielding inquiries and arranging for brokers to show their
property. And for some sellers, that can be an exhausting
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an open listing, brokers know that other firms may be
representing the property, so they don't have any sense of having a
particular commitment,'' said Deborah Beck, executive vice
president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which, among other
functions, represents 3,000 residential and commercial brokers,
mostly in Manhattan. ``With an exclusive, a broker will do
everything in their power to make sure that the property is sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Exclusive listings have been gaining popularity in most real
estate markets for the last two decades, mostly because sellers
have discovered the benefits of working with just one firm.
</P>
<P>
   And the red-hot real estate market not only has made it more
difficult for property sellers to price their homes correctly, but
has meant that in many cases sellers are having to field multiple
bids on their homes, a process that an experienced broker can help
to manage effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the past 10 years,'' said Kay Brover, executive vice
president at Douglas Elliman, ``we've gone from a system where it
used to be only the owners of a seven-room apartment on Park Avenue
that got an exclusive to studios now getting exclusives.'' Ms.
Brover estimates that 95 percent of the apartments that are
currently for sale in Manhattan are exclusive listings.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of apartment tends not to be an exclusive? ``Usually
it's not the kind of apartment, but the kind of seller,'' said Ms.
Brover. ``Believe it or not, there are sellers who have nothing to
do but sit at home and be entertained by troops of people coming
through the house.''
</P>
<P>
   In most real estate markets open listings tend to be the
exception rather than the rule. And while some consumers prefer to
sell their homes directly, without a broker (the acronym FSBO _
pronounced FIZ-bo _ means For Sale By Owner), most list their
homes, via a written contract, with a broker.
</P>
<P>
   So is an exclusive broker different from a listing broker? For
all practical purposes, the answer is no, said Gilbert Mercurio,
executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of
Realtors. The term, he said, generally refers to a listing broker
who ``has an exclusive relationship'' with the seller.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what many consumers assume, an exclusive listing
does not _ in most circumstances _ give a broker license to hog a
property entirely for himself or herself. Indeed, brokers say the
opposite is almost always true.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that because state laws mandate that brokers have
a fiduciary responsibility to the seller of a property to obtain
the best price possible, brokers who have an exclusive listing
almost always co-broke the property with their peers in an effort
to generate the widest net of potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most of the multiple-listing services that operate in
almost all parts of the country _ with the notable exception of
Manhattan, as well as a few other small geographic areas _ will
only take exclusive listings, said Mercurio.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio said that multiple-listing services generally want to
ensure that a single broker is responsible for the property, so
that it has both an advocate as well as someone to help resolve
potential conflicts or claims.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mercurio said, most multiple-listing services will not
let a member brokerage concern keep an exclusive in-house _ that
is, circulate the listing only to other salespeople within its own
company _ unless it specifically has the written permission of the
home seller.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the misconception persists that exclusive agents almost
always work solo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the word `exclusive' should be used at all. It's
misleading to the public,'' said Sona Davidian, the owner of C.S.
McClellan Real Estate in Pelham. Her concern, she said, is that
real estate brokers use the word so pointedly, in an effort to grab
buyers, that people shopping for homes often do not realize that
they can generally see the house through a firm that they may
already be working with rather than the agency that bills itself as
the exclusive broker.

</P>
<P>
   At one time, exclusives that were held in house were the rule,
rather than the exception. According to Ms. Brover of Douglas
Elliman, such arrangements in New York City, for example, initially
involved the owners of large, prestigious apartments, who for
reasons of safety _ and sometimes snobbery _ tended to give their
business to just one company, often the firm that managed the
building as well.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent years, however, co-broking took on a new appeal.
For one thing, more real estate properties came onto the market _
spurred by factors such as the large numbers of co-op conversions
in the mid-1980s _ and more real estate companies sprouted up to
serve that market. ``Little by little, real estate agents realized
that the only way they could rationalize the market was to control
a listing through an exclusive,'' said Ms. Brover.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers often have a significant amount of time and money at
stake in a listing.
</P>
<P>
   The letter that Fox Residential Group sends to prospective
apartment sellers in New York City promises that as an exclusive
agent for the property, the firm will, among other things, help set
a market value as well as asking price for the apartment; tailor an
advertising program; hold weekly open houses to introduce the
apartment to other brokers; keep a computerized list of customers
who see the apartment, as well as their comments; regularly speak
with the seller to review the marketing program and help in the
negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
   Once a deal is struck, the Fox letter says, the firm will
immediately furnish the buyer with the co-op board's requirements
and a co-op financial statement. Additional services include
meeting with the apartment buyer to review the preparation of board
documents, as well as coordinating schedules and meeting with the
buyer to rehearse interview questions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at closing time, Fox Residential promises it will visit
the apartment one last time for a final inspection, and attend the
closing in case a last-minute problem arises.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is free, of course. In exchange for assuming
numerous responsibilities, exclusive agents are assured they will
receive a commission even if another broker finally brings a buyer
for the property. In such situations, the exclusive broker gets
half of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Different kinds of exclusives carry different sorts of
commission arrangements. Exclusive-right-to-sell listings, for
example, promise real estate brokers that they will earn a
commission if the property is sold during its listing term,
regardless of who procures the buyer. But with an exclusive-agency
listing, the broker may lose part or all of the commission if it is
the seller of the property who finds a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions might be written into the exclusive-right-to-sell
contract between the homeowner and the brokerage concern reducing
or eliminating a commission if the property is sold to a specific
individual _ for example, a named relative or neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   In most parts of New York City, as well as the surrounding
suburbs, exclusive-right-to-sell listings tend to predominate, say
real estate brokers. But in certain parts of Brooklyn where there
is generally a dearth of homes for sale, sellers of homes tend to
have more leverage, so exclusive-agency listings have become the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   In certain markets, including the Hamptons, brokers say they are
increasingly seeing co-exclusive and tri-exclusive arrangements.
With such arrangements, either two or three brokers will sign a
single contract with the seller.
</P>
<P>
   Co- and tri-exclusive arrangements are still relatively rare,
said Judi Desiderio, a partner at Cook Pony Farm, a real estate
firm that has its head office in Bridgehampton. Nevertheless, she
has seen the listings become more common over the last three to
five years from sellers who feel that their properties will receive
maximum attention with such arrangements, especially since eastern
Long Island lacks the multiple-listing service that is common
virtually everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have developed here is a modified multiple-listing
service,'' said Ms. Desiderio. ``It's a home-grown phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   In brownstone Brooklyn, the area that is made up of communities
like Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope, co-exclusives are also
popping up more frequently. According to Christopher Thomas,
director of the Brooklyn offices for William B. May Co., co-broking
arrangements in his area usually come up when two brokers have
dramatically different marketing plans, either one of which may
benefit the seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sellers can often benefit from co-exclusives because the
commission set-ups encourage competition,'' he said. ``These kinds
of listings are different from those on multiple-listing services,
where agents may feel as though they have less at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   As for commissions, while they may sometimes be split among the
listing firms, they are usually all-or-nothing arrangements, he
said, with the entire commission going to just one of the brokers.
However, if a co-broker representing a seller rather than the buyer
ends up selling the property, it is entitled to a slice of the
bounty as well.
</P>
<P>
   Some real estate brokers caution that exclusives can bring out
the worst, as well as the best, in their industry. That is because
there is a natural temptation for an agency to keep its new
exclusive listings a secret until the firm has had a chance to
bring in its own buyers _ a temptation that multiple-listing
service rules requiring prompt dissemination are designed to
control.
</P>
<P>
   If the home is sold by the firm that lists it, the entire
commission goes to that firm, rather than being split _ usually
50-50 _ with another brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   According to some brokers, like Barbara Fox, the president of
Fox Residential Group, too many firms and their agents are now
delaying the co-broking process.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox, for one, thinks the sharing should take place
immediately after a broker receives a signed listing agreement. The
letter that her firm sends out to attract listings promises that
Fox will disseminate a co-brokerage agreement with a detailed
description within 24 hours of signing an exclusive to the
company's list of more than 150 cooperating firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing a lot of greediness,'' Ms. Fox said. ``It has to do
with the shortage of properties, as well as the fact that there are
lots of buyers around.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Peters, the president of Ashforth Warburg Associates,
a Manhattan-based firm, said that he was aware of a few rare
situations in which brokers who had exclusive listings held on to
those properties right until they were sold.
</P>
<P>
   More commonly, however, he said, firms such as his may hold on
to a property for a week or so before co-broking it, in order to
give its brokers a small marketing head start. ``We always ask the
sellers before we do this,'' he said. And, he added, ``we never do
it so that it is to the seller's disadvantage.''

 &HT;    McCain baring medical records to combat fitness rumors
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Seeking to put to rest questions about his temperament
and fitness for the presidency, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said
last week that he will release his voluminous medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found 350 pages, and we're looking for more,'' McCain
said during a pre-Thanksgiving Day swing through his sun-drenched
home state.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the records would not contain any psychiatric
evaluations because he did not undergo any after his release in
1973 from 5 1/2 years in captivity in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to gather records of his many hospitalizations had
begun before published reports of a whisper campaign about McCain's
mental stability, he said. The gist of the alleged campaign is that
McCain ``took too many elbows to the head in prison,'' as the
senator himself has joked.
</P>
<P>
   Some journalists, some McCain supporters and even some of his
Republican opponents have pointed at the campaign of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush as the source of the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has closed the gap with Bush in New Hampshire, site of
the first primary Feb. 1, and is gaining on him elsewhere.
Nationally, Bush maintains a big lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot disagreements on policy with Senator McCain,
but I think this whisper campaign is outrageous. I want to call on
Governor Bush to put a stop to this. It's not only an insult to
Senator McCain, but it's an insult to all Vietnam era veterans,''
said candidate Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign aides and several senators who back the Texan have
denied raising questions about McCain's fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), a McCain backer, said he spoke
personally to Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) and Sen. Bob Bennett
(R-Utah) and that both denied any involvement. A report had
identified both men as being part of the orchestrated effort
against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES, BAUER PITCH EFFORTS TO THE RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Bauer and magazine publisher Steve Forbes continued their battle
last week for the hearts of conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes brought together a number of prominent conservatives who
support him, including Lyn Nofziger, a former adviser to Ronald
Reagan; conservative activists Morton Blackwell, Brent Bozell,
Richard Viguerie, Armstrong Williams and Paul Weyrich; and former
U.S. Senate candidate Bruce Herschensohn of California.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer launched the first abortion ad of the campaign, telling
Iowans he would expand ``the circle of human rights and dignity''
to unborn children.
</P>
<P>
   ``From freedom of religion to the emancipation of slaves, from
civil rights to equal opportunities for women,'' Bauer says, ``I
won't stop until every one of God's children is welcomed into the
world and protected by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa holds its presidential caucuses Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY SLAMS GORE ON FUNDING REFORMS
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley leveled his sharpest attack yet on Vice President
Al Gore last week, abandoning at least for the moment his plan to
avoid the negative campaigning that Bradley says has turned off
America.
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, N.H., Bradley lit into Gore on the topic of
paying for political campaigns, a sensitive topic for the vice
president given the Clinton-Gore campaign's abuses in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attended a fund-raising reception at a Buddhist temple, one
of the memorable images of the 1996 campaign. He also ran into
trouble for the fund-raising calls he made from his White House
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, there were questions about where politics ended
and government began in the Clinton-Gore fund-raising efforts. Now
we hear that Cabinet officers are structuring their schedules and
their announcements so that the vice president can finance his
political campaign when his funds run short,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning Tuesday in Iowa, chided Bradley for making a
``personal'' attack and pointed out his support for campaign
finance reform, including public financing of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC LULL BOOSTS N.H.'S VOICE
</P>
<P>
   USA Today's Walter Shapiro was the first to point out a
potentially significant scheduling issue for the Democratic
presidential candidates. Bradley and Gore are battling over
caucusgoers in Iowa (Jan. 24) and voters in New Hampshire (Feb. 1).
But after those two contests, five weeks will pass before another
Democrat votes. Twelve states, including California, New York and
Georgia, hold primaries March 7.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, the Republican candidates will slog through
South Carolina, Arizona, Michigan, Virginia and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   How did the Democrats end up with such a lull? Party leaders
refused to let Democrats in some of those states move their
primaries to coincide with the GOP primaries. South Carolina's Dick
Harpootlian, the outspoken party chairman, practically begged
national Democrats for an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
   Then New Hampshire moved up its primary to Feb. 1, to avoid
getting scooped by some other publicity-hungry state.
</P>
<P>
   So the Democratic winner in New Hampshire will have five solid
weeks to savor victory and sap momentum from his opponent. New
Hampshire, already an important voice in presidential politics,
speaks loudly next year.

 NEW YORK: seller's disadvantage.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Katy Anastasio, the founder of Anastasio Associates Inc. Realtor
in Huntington, says she has noticed that most brokers in her area
will hold a listing for about a week _ or perhaps 10 days _ and if
they can't sell a home, will then put it up as a multiple listing.
``If all the brokers in my area would just cooperate and put their
listings into our multiple-listing service, then we wouldn't have
as much of an inventory problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hamptons, said Ms. Desiderio, ``I'm seeing brokers
holding on to properties in-house, and I think their hands should
be slapped.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of what is happening, Ms. Desiderio pointed to a
firm in her area that is currently the exclusive broker on a
multimillion dollar property in Southampton. ``They've had it for
six months and they still haven't co-broked it, even though every
firm has asked them to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Elliott, a senior vice president at the firm in question,
the Southampton office of Sotheby's International Realty, said that
his section of Long Island does not have a multiple-listing service
that requires exclusives to be co-broked. Moreover, he said, his
firm would be happy to co-broke the property if another broker were
to produce a buyer that his firm had not already been in touch
with.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Association of Realtors, which mostly
represents brokers who are part of multiple-listing services,
addresses the subject of exclusives in its code of ethics, not all
multiple-listing services handle exclusives in the same manner.
Indeed, according to Mercurio of the Westchester Board of Realtors,
every multiple-listing service has its own rules regarding
exclusives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, some multiple-listing services, such as
the one in Westchester, require that their members report exclusive
listings within 24 hours, while others allow 48 hours. ``There are
lots of variations in the handling of such data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, which has no multiple-listing service, exclusive
listings are governed under the code of ethics and resolutions
issued by the Real Estate Board of New York. And the board
specifies that its members, among other things, cannot use the term
exclusive if an exclusive listing is a verbal agreement only.
Instead, it specifies that a broker has to use the term ``ours
alone'' while it is both advertising and co-broking the property.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the relative dearth of homes for sale in the New York
area appears to have given consumers more clout when it comes to
signing an exclusive contract. Peters of Ashforth Warburg says that
he is seeing more sellers look for some sort of commission
reduction when a deal is made in-house, especially when the listing
broker and the selling broker are the same person. In cases such as
these, he added, the commission is often 5 percent rather than the
usual 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of inventory is having other effects. Roger Novatt,
a managing director at Sumitomo Real Estate, said that his agency
used to opt for a six-month listing when it signed up an exclusive.
But lately the firm has been willing to take on an exclusive for
three months only, as a result of both the general lack of
inventory and the seasonal drop in numbers of listings in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate brokers say consumers need to do their homework when
choosing the firm that will best represent an exclusive listing.
</P>
<P>
   James Ferrari, the president of Benjamin James Associates of
Manhattan, says that brokers will ``often pitch a high-falutin'
number just to get the exclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters urges consumers not to focus on the amount of advertising
or similar promotion that a firm may be willing to put forth.
``While most sellers are looking for promotion when they sell a
home, more often than not, promotion is not the cause for selling a
home,'' Peters said. ``When choosing an exclusive broker, you need
to consider three things: their ability to network with a
community, their pricing skills and their bid management skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in today's torrid real estate market, some brokers think
the last two skills are especially important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine percent of the time when I'm approached by a
seller, they need help pricing an apartment,'' said Ms. Fox, adding
that she has noticed that most sellers tend to have a ``very
difficult'' time when handling multiple bids as well.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas advises sellers to consult a a lawyer before signing an
exclusive-right-to-sell contract in order to understand exactly
what the contract entails. For example, with such an exclusive, he
said, ``you are essentially giving away the right to sell your home
to your sister or some other close relative.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anastasio, meanwhile, urges consumers to stay alert in
general. She has noticed that a trick some brokers play is to mail
information into their local multiple-listing service through
regular mail, rather than through electronic mail. ``That means it
can take three days for an exclusive listing to get into the
system,'' she said. ``Consumers need to be savvy and insist that
their broker put it into their multiple-listing service
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The complexities of the business of selling homes and the
amounts of money at stake have led to a predictable outcome. ``This
is an area that has a tremendous amount of litigation,'' said David
Clurman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   One cause, he said, is that consumers often don't understand the
wording in exclusive agreements; for example, the difference
between an exclusive right to sell, which means that the broker is
owed a commission no matter who buys the property, and an
exclusive-agency agreement, which gives the owner the right to sell
the property directly without paying a commission.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements themselves can be open to interpretation, he
said, citing ``when an exclusive begins and when it ends'' as an
area in which disputes can arise. ``The contracts,'' he said, ``may
have tentacles that the consumer is not aware of.''

CHILDS HEATS UP AND KNICKS SQUEAK PAST MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chris Childs had become the prototype player for a
New York Knicks team bloated by last season's success and sluggish
in their defense of the Eastern Conference title this year. Like a
lot of Knicks, he had stopped staying late in the gym and kept
wondering where his passion for the game had gone.
</P>
<P>
   So he spent some extra time in the gym on Friday and found joy
in the work ethic. It paid off in the way he provided the support
system the Knicks had been lacking this year.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting miserably this season, Childs hit a pivotal
3-pointer with 48.6 seconds left to help the Knicks fend off an
Orlando Magic team high on energy and low on stars, 99-96, at
Madison Square Garden Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks (7-7) made up for their injury-riddled front line by
turning to Allan Houston (30 points) and Latrell Sprewell (30
points) for the bulk of the game. They had to have more, and that
is where Childs came in. Childs, who had 15 points off the bench,
came on to give the Knicks the extra kick they needed. His big
3-pointer gave the Knicks a 93-92 lead and just enough edge to hold
up against the intense Magic (6-7).
</P>
<P>
   The Magic was not fazed by a third-quarter flurry by the Knicks
and popped out on a 6-0 run to open the fourth quarter and take a
79-78 lead on a hook shot by Chris Gatling over John Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   After Sprewell's acrobatic catch of a low alley-oop pass from
Childs, which he deftly turned it into a layup in midair, the
Knicks began a back-and-forth exchange with the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy was searching his team for a life form, for
some sign that the sluggishness his players had displayed on their
nearly monthlong road trip was just a product of the schedule and
not a factor of complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're sluggish, they'll beat us,'' Van Gundy said.
``Orlando is a hustle team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magic has been stripped off all egos _ with the departure of
Anfernee Hardaway and company _ and filled up with paycheck-starved
players either fresh out of the Continental Basketball Association
or discovered on the lonely end of other teams' benches.
</P>
<P>
   The contract-fat Knicks, loaded with eight players collecting $5
million or more this season, had to find some motivation. Or else
watch the Magic slip away. And that is almost what happened at the
start. Without three injured stars on the front line _ Marcus
Camby, Larry Johnson and Patrick Ewing _ the Knicks needed the kind
of support the Magic had.
</P>
<P>
   For most of three quarters, the Knicks leaned on their two
guards. Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell combined to score 31 of
the Knicks' 49 first-half points. But the more diverse Magic,
getting hustle plays out of Bo Outlaw and picking up points from 11
different players, held a 50-49 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Knicks were not getting offense from anywhere
but Houston and Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they're being ignored on the floor,'' Van Gundy said
of his bevy of role players. ``We have to make teams pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs started applying that logic late in the third quarter. He
scored eight points in a three-minute stretch to awaken the Knicks
and help provide them with a 78-73 lead entering the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic took a 54-49 lead to start the third quarter, leaving
an exasperated Van Gundy to take a quick time out. It didn't help.
The Knicks were still getting outworked by the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer launched by Abdul-Wahad bounced high and long, near
the free-throw line. As Ward looked at Houston and Houston looked
at Ward, the sprite-sized Armstrong sneaked in for the rebound when
it hit the ground and shot a jumper to put the Magic up, 54-51,
with 10 minutes left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a chorus of boos echoed through the Garden and
perked up the Knicks. After that forgettable play, the Knicks
picked up their intensity and found the help they needed. Childs,
who has been shooting 32 percent, hit back-to-back long-range
jumpers to help give the Knicks a 73-67 lead with two minutes left
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Childs came right back and nailed a 3-pointer a minute later to
put the Knicks ahead, 76-67, with one minute left. Finally, there
was a lift from the bench. Finally, there was a life.

NEW ZEALAND WARY OF ITS EASY PATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearing the midway point of an uncertain and feisty America's
Cup competition that has already seen its share of raised tempers
and fallen expectations, only one particular is etched in stone.
When the 30th cup match begins in February, one of the two
contending teams will be sailing a sleek, black yacht flying the
banner of the cup's current defender, Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time in many decades that the cup holder will
advance directly to the main event without undergoing preliminary
trials. But for Team New Zealand, this coast to the finals _ the
equivalent of last season's football-champion Denver Broncos
receiving a pass through this year's regular season and playoffs,
with a guaranteed berth in the Super Bowl _ is a double-edged
sword.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, TNZ is assured of a shot to keep sailing's greatest prize.
But, without having had to hoist a single sail in meaningful
competition, will it be ready for the tested winner of the
four-month-long Louis Vuitton challenger series, the third round of
which starts Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known from Day 1 that the lack of preliminaries could be
our Achilles' heel,'' the New Zealand syndicate chief, Peter Blake,
said by telephone from Auckland. ``We don't know how fast the
challengers are going and they don't know about us. And we won't
find out, for real, until we front up on the 18th of February.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Zealand, Blake is an exception to the rule that says
sportsmen should not be placed on pedestals. He is an unabashed
hero in his sailing-crazed nation, with the knighthood to prove it.
A Whitbread race winner, and the former record-holder for the
fastest voyage around the world, Blake was the captain in 1995 when
New Zealand clinically dissected the San Diego Yacht Club, 5-0, in
the cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   And, even though he is not on board this time, he is the
undisputed leader of the first Kiwi defense. So when Blake
announced it was in the country's best interest to put its money
and talent behind a single defender, as opposed to opening the
doors for multiple efforts that would fragment the resources, there
were some low grumbles but no true opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two new boats and we're out sailing them six days a
week,'' Blake said. ``I think we're probably getting better racing
among ourselves than some of the challenger matches. When a good
team, like the Italians, comes up against a poor one, like the
Swiss, it doesn't do them any good. It just wears out sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake points to other advantages. ``Our racing is very
controllable,'' he said. ``If you make a change to the boat, you
can come back and analyze it and know precisely why one is faster
than the other. The challengers can't do that, because they don't
know what changes their opposition is making. So I think things are
probably fairly level.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a gauge to measure exactly where Team New Zealand
stands, Blake would like nothing better than to coax a challenger
into some unofficial racing. At least one observer, the broadcaster
and former cup-winning tactician Gary Jobson, believes the entire
regatta may hinge on whether Blake gets his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for the challengers to win is to make sure New Zealand
stays in the dark,'' Jobson said in a telephone interview. ``If the
Kiwis get an opportunity to sail against a challenger for any
period of time, they'll have an understanding of how they match up
against that boat and, by extension, the rest of the fleet. So if
one of the top six or seven challengers gets eliminated and spends
a week sailing against New Zealand, they'll keep the cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, in accordance to a pact made before the series, the
challengers have ignored Blake's overtures. Whether they will
remain united after the third round, when the fleet will be pared
from 11 teams to 6, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on several occasions, the New Zealand yachts could
not resist the temptation to briefly trespass on the challenger's
course, and a boatload of TNZ officials, armed with laser
range-finders and other speed-probing instruments, are regular
spectators at the top challenger races.
</P>
<P>
   If Blake thinks he sees a weakness in his rivals, he is not
talking about it. And, while he knows that his 80-odd-person team
is made up of some of the world's top competitive sailors,
sailmakers, designers and meteorologists, he retains the humble
stance that is so indicative of his countrymen's collective nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to it, it's going to be a very close
series,'' Blake said. ``The instant that we start thinking we're
good, that's when we'll lose the America's Cup.''  &QL;

AGASSI AND SAMPRAS EARN ATP SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN MAIMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, Germany _ Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras won their
semifinal matches at the ATP World Championship to set up a Sunday
final pitting the year's best player against the undisputed player
of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The final of the $3.6 million tournament is the culmination of a
six-day festival in which the eight top-ranked players in the world
played in a round-robin format to determine Saturday's
semifinalists.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, ranked No. 1 in the world, earned his place in the final
by disposing of No. 2 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) on
Saturday. Sampras made the dream final complete when he beat the
hometown favorite, Nicolas Kiefer, 6-3, 6-3, in the second
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Against Kafelnikov, Agassi continued the streak that propelled
him through the round-robin stage without dropping a set. He broke
Kafelnikov's serve to open the match and never looked back, easily
holding his own serve throughout the first set while keeping the
lanky Russian running from baseline to baseline.
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, the 25-year-old Kafelnikov opened a 5-2 lead,
tormenting Agassi with well-placed backhanded shots down the line,
a cornerstone of his game absent in the first set. The 29-year-old
Agassi stormed back, however, capitalizing on Kafelnikov's lapses
in concentration that culminated in the flubbing of a crucial drop
shot at the end of the second-set tie breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, 28, took the court in the day's second semifinal where
he overwhelmed the 22-year-old Kiefer, the first German to appear
in the ATP Championship since Boris Becker in 1996. Kiefer, a
native of Hanover, was cheered on by a raucous capacity crowd of
13,000, but was never able to catch up with Sampras' serve. On
serve in the second set, Sampras broke Kiefer in the seventh game
and the German never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Merely qualifying for his sixth ATP Championship final is an
accomplishment for Sampras. Sidelined since the U.S. Open by a back
injury, he entered the ATP Championship having played only one
match in three months. During his absence, Sampras slipped to No. 5
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   After a 6-2 6-2 thrashing at the hands of Agassi in the
round-robin preliminary on Wednesday, Sampras found his form as the
tournament progressed. Nevertheless, he has concerns about his
physical readiness for the final, especially against Agassi in a
finale that has a best-of-5 format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here, I wasn't sure how I would get through these
matches,'' Sampras said. ``A five-set match will be a real
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, Agassi is guaranteed to maintain his No. 1 ranking
for the year. A victory, however, would fittingly complete his
two-year resurgence from also-ran to undisputed champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm inspired by what I accomplished this year,'' Agassi said
Saturday. ``And I always look forward to playing Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is not sure he will play as well as he did when he beat
Agassi at Wimbledon this year, but he is looking forward to the
match against the man he says is playing the best possible tennis
anyone can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be two heavyweights going at it,'' Sampras
said. ``This is a fitting way to end the decade.''

RABBIS MADE THEIR MARK ON TEXAS HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In Texas, Yom Kippur may not be a school
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Gefilte fish may not be as common as barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers may considerably outnumber rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Jews have not been insignificant forces in the
history and culture of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite, says author and former Star-Telegram reporter
Hollace Ava Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the relatively small Jewish congregations in tiny
towns and big cities throughout the state, rabbis have played a
prominent role in Texas history, taking on civic and spiritual
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rabbis have become visible,'' said Weiner, a Fort Worth
resident. ``They are called upon for lots of things. ... They are
educated outside the region. They bring something a little exotic
or erudite here that others don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jewish Stars in Texas: Rabbis and Their Work'' (Texas A&AMP;M
Press, $24.95), Weiner tells the stories of 11 Texas rabbis who
made an impact on Texas from the 1870s until the 1980s. But in
telling those 11 stories, she is also writing about the history of
Texas, Weiner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the rabbis told us something about Texas,'' she said.
``I didn't want it just to be a Jewish book. It's a slice of
Texana.''
</P>
<P>
   The book adds to the often-neglected scholarship on Jews in the
South and Southwest, said Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, president of
Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati and former rabbi at Temple
Emanu-El in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Jewish community has not done a great job of
presenting the story of Jews in rural and smaller town around the
country,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner's book is part of a growing interest in the history of
Jews in America, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although that history stretches back to before the founding of
the country, Jews began to arrive in large numbers in the United
States at the end of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging scholarship represents a maturing of the American
Jewish community and a coming of age, Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``New communities don't look at their history,'' he said. ``They
are too busy becoming Americans. It is only when a community has a
greater sense of security, becomes part of the fabric of a
community, that it takes stock of its history.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner begins her profiles with Heinrich Schwarz of Hempstead,
Texas' first ordained rabbi. The last rabbi profiled is Levi Olan
of Dallas, who took the pulpit of Temple Emanu-El eight hours after
President John F. Kennedy was fatally shot and preached about the
``shame of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In between, Weiner writes about rabbis such as one in Lubbock
who presented art lectures or one in Galveston who fought the Ku
Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbis Weiner profiles share some characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Many, especially in the early days, were not exactly the cream
of the crop, Weiner said. The top-notch students and teachers were
often given positions in New York or other cities with larger and
more prestigious Jewish congregations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But those who came to Texas were often rebels of sorts, she
said. They were willing to bend some of the rules to survive in a
new part of the country, she said. Some understood that it would be
difficult to keep a kosher household in Texas, for example.
Although shellfish are forbidden in a kosher diet, Sam Perl, a lay
rabbi from Brownsville, was the chaplain to the shrimp producers
association because ``what was good for the region was good for the
Jewish people who were merchants in the area,'' Weiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas rabbis excelled at reaching out to the community
beyond the Jewish congregation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Weiner recently heard a story from a man whose
brother was killed in World War II. The family, Christians, was
informed the day before Easter. Christian preachers were too busy
on Easter Sunday to console the family, so the town's rabbi came
and sat with the family for the entire day.
</P>
<P>
   Although the complete story of Jews in the state may not be
fully told, Weiner said she expects interest from Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of curiosity about Jews,'' Weiner said. ``I
find very little prejudice and anti-Semitism, but a lot of
curiosity. Many people have never met a Jew. They'll say, `Oh, you
are a Hebrew. Tell me about your church.' They may get the
terminology wrong, but they are interested.''

CONDO CONVERSIONS GAINING IN CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JILL SCHACHNER CHANEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Almost seven years after he moved into a two-bedroom
rental on the top floor of a downtown high-rise here, Kenneth Green
finally got what he was hoping for _ a conversion notice.
</P>
<P>
   Green, 36, had moved into his apartment on the city's Near North
Side hoping that it would be converted to a condominium. As soon as
he received the conversion notice, he signed a contract to buy his
apartment and the adjacent two-bedroom unit, which together provide
panoramic views of the city. He paid a total of $540,000 and plans
to combine the two units into one apartment this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen other popular apartment buildings go condo and
decided to stick it out because of the location, the view and the
balcony,'' said Green, a senior account manager at Merrill Corp., a
financial printer here.
</P>
<P>
   Green's story is being played out in several downtown buildings
as landlords seeking to sell rentals find once again that condo
converters are their best market. The rise in market value
``becomes enticing to people that have been in the rental apartment
building business for five or 10 years,'' said Bruce Weschler, a
principal in Wexenthaller Realty, a Chicago development and
property management firm that sold a 303-unit rental apartment
building to a condo converter in February. ``Selling to a converter
is not an unusual exit strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weschler said his company had decided to sell the 10-year-old
rental apartment building on the city's Gold Coast to American
Invsco, a national condo converter and developer, because ``you can
make 15 to 20 percent on your money now, which you could not do on
a rental building.''
</P>
<P>
   Two sellers of these rental buildings are institutional lenders,
who foreclosed on the buildings. One of them, Household
International, based in Prospect Heights, a Chicago suburb, sold
the Gold Coast Galleria building, where Green lives, to a condo
converter because the converter offered the highest price,
according to a company spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   The number of condo conversions here in recent years is still
far from the peaks that were reached in the early to mid-1980s,
when tens of thousands of rental apartments were converted.
According to Tracy Cross of Tracy Cross &AMP; Associates, real estate
consultants in Schaumburg, another Chicago suburb, since 1996 more
than 2,750 rental apartments have been converted to condos and
sold. But this year nearly 2,000 rental apartments are expected to
be converted and sold as condos, Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   The converters themselves say that Chicago's booming residential
market and skyrocketing rents downtown have combined to create a
market for these new conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conversions are popular because they allow people to buy in
locations that are otherwise unavailable because the areas are
otherwise built out,'' said Herbert Emmerman, president of Equity
Marketing Services, a Chicago company that has converted 40 rental
buildings into condos over the last 25 years. ``Also they are more
affordable,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rents in downtown high-rises are now $2 per square foot a month,
pushing many renters to buy when they learn of the tax benefits of
home ownership. Moreover, because only one new high-rise rental
apartment building has been built downtown in the last 10 years,
renters are finding their options diminishing, said Gene Stunnard
of Appraisal Research Counselors in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Venverloh, 29, a lawyer with the Chicago law firm of
Katten, Muchin &AMP; Zavis, was displaced by the conversion of her
rental building to condominiums. Her one-bedroom at 401 E. Ontario
St., which she had been renting for two years, had been offered for
sale at about $150,000, but she didn't want to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   When she began looking for a new apartment, Ms. Venverloh said,
she was surprised at how tight the rental market had become since
she had last looked. ``I was surprised at how much rents had gone
up,'' she said. Eventually, she said, she found a larger apartment
for a cheaper rent, but it did not have her preferred location or
amenities such as a dishwasher and doormen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Emmerman, the 401 E. Ontario St. building was ripe
for conversion. The eight-year-old building is just four blocks
from the Michigan Avenue shopping district and is within walking
district of the Loop. Moreover, it had also been significantly
improved before Emmerman's company purchased it in a joint venture
with Draper &AMP; Kramer, a Chicago real estate development and
management firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was virtually nothing to do except for repainting and
recarpeting,'' he said. The apartments, which range in price from
$165,000 for a 700-square-foot junior one-bedroom to $492,900 for
an 1,800-square foot three-bedroom, are not otherwise being
renovated unless buyers purchase a separate renovation package. So
far, 324 of the 394 apartments have been sold since sales started a
year ago, Emmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Following conversion, 17.5 percent of the rental tenants decided
to buy in the building. Among those who remained is Thomas Nodine,
a 38-year-old management consultant who, with his wife, Elizabeth,
a doctor, purchased a three-bedroom apartment on the building's
46th floor. When the conversion began, prior to his marriage,
Nodine had been renting one of the building's junior one-bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   After researching the condo market, he and his new wife decided
the building offered everything they were seeking for a good price.
``We wanted a low-maintenance building that was beautiful and
convenient,'' he said. ``That spelled high-rise to us. Also we
wanted to be near the lake to go running or to go to the beach. And
we like the neighborhood. It just fit in nicely with our
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Campbell, a real estate agent with Rubloff Residential
Realty here, said buyers like the Nodines were getting apartments
at cheaper per-square-foot prices than in new buildings. She said
she believed that Green could not have bought comparable space in a
new building for less than $800,000. Also, she said, there is an
added value to living in an established neighborhood such as the
Gold Coast, where most of these new conversions are occurring.
</P>
<P>
   American Invsco believed the market for condo conversions to be
so strong in Chicago that it purchased for conversion two high-rise
rental residences across the street from each other, said Nicholas
V. Gouletas, its president of sales and director of field
operations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gold Coast Galleria, 260 of the 332 apartments have sold
in the last year. The mixed-use building, which sits on the
southwest corner of Maple and Clark Streets , has junior
one-bedrooms and one- and two-bedrooms. Prices range from $100,000
to $144,900 for a junior one-bedroom, $150,100 to $175,000 for a
one-bedroom apartment and $242,000 to $316,000 for a two-bedroom
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The other building, the Elm at Clark Private Residences, has had
a similarly high sales rate.
</P>
<P>
   Gouletas said more than half of the building's 303 units had
sold since March when sales began. Prices for the building's junior
one-bedrooms range from $92,000 to $144,500, from $155,000 to
$191,750 for one bedrooms and $265,500 to $312,000 for two-bedroom
apartments with balconies..
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that we wanted to own both corners rather than have
someone else buy that building while we were marketing the Gold
Coast Galleria as condominiums,'' said Gouletas. ``We felt that we
would have the same kind of purchaser for both buildings and wanted
to keep them from going someplace else.''

EDITORIAL: A TURBULENT TRADE MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Nov. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the 135 member countries of the World Trade
Organization will meet in Seattle starting Tuesday, not to solve
the world's trade disputes but merely to set an agenda for the next
round of negotiations. Even that will not be easy. Rich countries
are squabbling with poor countries. Thousands of street
demonstrators are expected to denounce the organization for
trampling on the rights of third-world workers, the sovereignty of
individual countries and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In such a turbulent setting, a productive agenda will almost
certainly elude the assembled ministers unless they focus tightly
on a few achievable measures aimed at expanding trade. The most
important of these will benefit the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Third-world farmers want access to closed agriculture markets in
Europe and Japan. This demand deserves to be met. Developing
countries also want the United States to limit the use of
``anti-dumping'' laws. The rules governing the use of these laws
deserve tightening. Unfortunately, the United States almost surely
will not go along. Another proposal from Third World countries is
to rewrite rules that force them to pay prohibitively high prices
for pharmaceutical drugs. Here the patent rights of Western drug
manufacturers must yield to common sense and decency.
</P>
<P>
   Trickier than any of these issues is a proposal by the developed
countries that they be allowed to impose tariffs on imports from
countries that exploit unskilled workers. Poor countries believe
this proposal masks a protectionist purpose. It is true that
working conditions in Third World countries can be horrific, but
the tariffs could eliminate the jobs of millions of workers in
these countries. Rich and poor countries are nowhere near a
consensus on fair labor practices, and the Clinton administration
wants to set up a working group to study the issue. That makes
sense.
</P>
<P>
   The advanced countries also want to incorporate _ over the
objections of developing countries _ environmental concerns into
trade agreements. Environmental groups point with alarm to rulings
by WTO judicial panels that, they say, tampered with the United
States' right to enforce high environmental standards. But these
criticisms distort the record. WTO panels did, for example, rule
against specific sanctions that the United States imposed on
foreign fishermen for practices that threatened dolphins and other
endangered species. But the panels did not dispute America's right
to set its own standards. They only insisted that U.S. laws not
discriminate against foreign suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has offered some proposals that
environmentalists can like. For example, it proposes to cut
subsidies that governments provide for farmers and fishermen.
Cutting subsidies not only improves trade patterns, but it also
reduces incentives to overuse fragile land and fisheries.
Environmental advocates object to an administration proposal to
reduce tariffs on wood products. That, they say, would increase the
demand for wood and, thereby, logging in Indonesia, Malaysia,
Finland and the United States. This criticism deserves careful
consideration, but on balance, the administration's general
strategy _ to tackle key environmental issues case by case _
appears sound.
</P>
<P>
   Lost among the disputes is the fact that open trade promotes
prosperity. Economists are hard pressed to identify a single
economy that prospers without a vigorous export-oriented policy.
And for every exporter there needs to be a willing importer. The
goal of trade talks is to guarantee that countries that want to
export can find countries willing to import _ a goal that can start
to be met if the trade ministers drop proposals that cannot yet be
resolved by consensus and focus on the few that can.

   GLF-BECK _ He has lived in golf's version of hell for the past
two years. Chip Beck, a former Georgia golfer, isn't sure why his
golf game left him. Could have been personal problems that led to
the negative swing thoughts; could have been the very nature of the
game _ here one minute, gone the next. As the sport headed into its
final month, there was light. Beck, once one of the best golfers on

 &HT;    PGA Tour card out of reach for Beck
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With three rounds remaining at the PGA qualifying school
Friday, Nov. 19, Chip Beck was tied for 126th. That forecast was
gloomy even for Beck, golf's perpetual optimism machine.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, he knew he was too far behind. Only 35 or so of the
160 golfers will earn tour privileges for the 2000 season, and
Beck, who has won more than $6 million during an outstanding
career, knew he was out of it. Even if he didn't want to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, as Jack Nicklaus noted while watching his son, Gary,
at the Doral Resort this week, ``Chip Beck could be falling off a
4,000-foot cliff, and on his way down he'd be saying, `There must
be some place soft to land on down here somewhere.'''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no soft landing for Beck, a former University of
Georgia player, at the annual 108-hole torture test, held this year
on Doral's Gold and Silver Courses. Even Beck has finally folded
his mental tent. At 4-over-par and tied for 120th, he went out for
Monday, Nov. 22's final round with no chance and nowhere to play
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Weary from playing nearly every week for three months at the end
of the season, Beck has even buried himself in the Tour School's
other race, where the next 50 players receive exempt status on the
Buy.com (formerly Nike) Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it the best shot I had,'' Beck said after a 66 that
came too late. ``That's what I feel happy about. I've got a better
chance of having a good year next year.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, provided there's a decent playing opportunity for Beck,
one of golf's most affable personalities. Without a tour card for
the first time since 1979, Beck must write letters to tournament
directors for sponsor exemptions. Beyond the four events sponsored
by his corporate connection, Buick, Beck must count on a few
rewards for all the goodwill he's spread on the PGA Tour for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they'll think I'm a good addition to their
fields,'' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   But does all this depress a man who went through a period of 47
missed cuts in a row _ ``cancer of the golf swing,'' he once called
his situation _ and had to sell the family's multimillion dollar
home in suburban Chicago? Not really. This is a guy who saw the
positive side of all those lost weekends without a paycheck,
appreciating the extra time to spend with his four young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have golf a long time in my life,'' Beck said in the
lobby of his Doral hotel lodge, ``but at that point in their lives,
I think it was very important to their development. ... You know,
things definitely work for the best. I wouldn't trade that for the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck always has been the master of placing things in proper
perspective. He has been forced to do it during the past three
years just to maintain any semblance of sanity. Real tragedy, he
said, isn't failing to shoot a low enough score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built a house at about the same as two other friends of
ours,'' Beck said. ``One of them lost a child in a bathtub and one
lost her husband from a heart attack. ... So my wife and I feel
fortunate. Oh, we gave our house up, but c'mon, we have healthy
children and we're healthy and just have so much to be thankful
for. ... For me, I just didn't want to have the burden of worrying
about all that, worrying about mortgages.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been approached by people out of the golf business,
including an Atlanta mortgage corporation, but he still figures it
makes more sense to spend time on his golf game rather than
learning a new trade. At least this year provided hope, if not
employment security. Laboring since Jan. 1 with Dr. Jim Suttie in
Chicago, who helped Beck stop flattening his swing plane, he earned
nearly $86,000 during the first three weeks of September. In
1997-98, he made $21,000 in 61 events.
</P>
<P>
   Beck says half-seriously that he might just play the four Buick
events next year and take the rest of the time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in my life, I don't want to just survive and
just kind of struggle along,'' he said. ``That's just not much
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Beck finished 178th on the final money list ($137,423),
more than $300,000 was needed this year to make the top 125 and
earn 2000 privileges. Clearly, the year took a physical toll on the
PGA Tour's No. 40 career money-leader (more than $6.1million).
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should be out there practicing right now,'' Beck
said, ``but, you know, my body can't go through it now. I couldn't
finish the tournament if I was out there beating balls every day. I
played three months straight almost. It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Change has been constant for Beck. He and brother Albert agreed
to end their caddie/player relationship. After a three-year famine,
Chip said, ``It was just hard on both of us trying to pull out of
the doldrums.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck's house in Lake Forest, Ill., has been sold, leaving he and
his wife, Karen, and the children renting. Beck said the house,
once listed at $5 million, carried a mortgage less than the $30,000
that had been widely reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, I'm financially secure and
independent, and I don't have to worry about what other people
think or do as far as my finances,'' Beck said. ``I can play golf
or quit tomorrow and I'll feel like I had a nice career in a lot of
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not as satisfying as I would have liked to have
been, but if somebody can go through this lifestyle without having
some ups and downs, then my hat's off to them, because they must be
tremendously gifted.''
</P>
<P>
   A black visor pushed back on head, Beck glanced back and said,
``I'll prevail. Don't worry.''

REAL ESTATE: ENERGY-EFFICIENT, ECOLOGY-SENSITIVE HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RACHELLE GARBARINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 128-apartment development in Newark, N.J. _ involving both
the conversion of a 19th-century factory into 62 units and the
construction of a 66-unit apartment building on the nearby site of
a factory that is to be demolished _ appears to be much like other
low- and moderate-income rental housing projects in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But the two buildings are being designed to be environmentally
sensitive, energy-efficient and more affordable for residents to
maintain, thanks to a $17 million state pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   The two-building project is one of eight that New Jersey's
Department of Community Affairs is financing under its Sustainable
Development/Affordable Housing Program, which was initiated last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others are projects involving the construction and
restoration of one- and two-family houses in a historic area of
Trenton and the development of 100 rentals on a patch of farmland
in Eastampton, in Burlington County. The eight projects will
produce 424 new and renovated rental and for-sale units for people
earning 50 to 80 percent of their area's median income.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, which state officials say is the first of its
kind in the nation, $12 million in low-interest loans of up to
$55,500 a unit is available to developers to offset the cost of
designing housing with higher energy efficiency and lower impact on
the environment. In addition, $5 million in below-market-rate
mortgages will be offered to income-qualified buyers by the New
Jersey Housing Mortgage Finance Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to encourage developers to build housing ``that will
be low-cost to people and low-cost to the environment,'' said Jane
Kenny, commissioner of the Department of the Department of
Community Affairs, which oversees housing issues. It is, she said,
``a radical approach and the first step in what will raise the bar
for and be a trend in affordable housing production.''
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of developing so-called ``green'' buildings, is
not new, combining it with low- and moderate-cost housing, known as
affordable housing, has been slow to take hold. A key reason,
industry professionals say, is the cost to incorporate
energy-efficient and environmentally sensitive features into
housing that relies heavily on public financing.
</P>
<P>
   Another difficulty is that ``developers are entrenched in doing
business as usual and often need an incentive to try something
different, which is what New Jersey's program provides,'' said
Joseph Lstibureck, a principal of Building Science Corp., an
engineering and architectural firm in Westford, Mass. His company
works with developers to change their construction techniques to
reduce costs and warranty claims.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program will show developers that ``while they may
spend more on the shell of the house, they will save on its
mechanical system, making their investment a wash,'' Lstibureck
said. The new technologies will initially cost more, but as they
become more widely used, costs will drop, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Kenny said that affordable homes built with
energy-saving features, such as added insulation or extra-efficient
equipment, will cost less for residents to maintain. The homes
built under the program are expected to reduce a residential
utility bill by at least $378 a year for a typical three-bedroom
home, she said.
</P>
<P>
   To participate in the program, a developer's homes must meet or
exceed standards established by Public Service Gas &AMP; Electric, the
state's largest utility, which also reflect federal standards. The
standards call for them to be at least 30 percent more energy
efficient than a typical house constructed or renovated in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The utility, which is a partner in the program, will also pay
the developer $1,500, plus 42 cents per square foot for each home
that meets its standards. For example, for a 2,200-square-foot
house a developer would get $2,424.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state's Board of Public Utilities will provide
additional financial incentives to developers who use solar heating
techniques, such as solar panels and photovoltaic cells to convert
sunlight into electricity, in their projects. Commissioner Kenny
said there was a pool of $200,000 available to developers to design
and implement such features.
</P>
<P>
   The program encourages developers to try to limit a project's
impact on the environment by, among other things, using building
materials that contain recycled contents, are durable, have reduced
toxicity and help improve indoor air quality. They are also
encouraged to preserve trees and to develop the housing near
shopping and mass transit links.
</P>
<P>
   Developers say they got involved in the program to stay abreast
of new technologies and ahead of the competition. They add that
they probably would not have incorporated the technologies into
their projects without the state subsidies
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Kenny said the program ``will enable us to identify
which strategies work and can be replicated.'' To ensure that the
production of such housing continues, she said, her department will
begin as early as this spring to require developers to incorporate
the successful strategies into their projects as part of the
competition for state funding.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million two-building development under way in Newark is
being developed by RPM Development Corp. of Montclair, using mostly
public funds, including $900,000 it received under the new state
program.
</P>
<P>
   That money is being used to incorporate into both buildings _
the renovated factory on North 13th Street, between Park and Sixth
avenues and the new structure on Park Avenue at North 11th Street,
a couple of blocks away _ such features as energy-efficient
fluorescent lighting and fiberglass, instead of vinyl, window
frames, which are considered better for the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the buildings will have cellulose insulation, which
is made from recycled newspapers and blown into walls, filling air
cavities more tightly and conserving energy more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Bricks salvaged from the factory that is to be demolished will
also be recycled and used for walkways as well as to repoint the
facade of the building being renovated. And at each building, storm
water will be collected and used to irrigate lawns and plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting the energy efficiency standards will make for better
buildings, and in the long term will probably save us from going
back to fix things 10 to 15 years from now,'' said Edward
Martoglio, a principal at RPM. Martoglio said the program also
``encourages more thoughtful ways to fit projects into the
neighborhood.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 128 units will have one to three bedrooms, with 650 to 1,100
square feet. Rents will range from $480 for a one-bedroom unit to
$630 for a three-bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   In Trenton, $1 million from the pilot program will be combined
with $3 million in other, mostly public subsidies to develop
Clinton Park Townhouses, comprising 23 new and renovated one- and
two-family for-sale houses, with a rental apartment in each of the
two-family houses They will rise along Ewing and Southard streets
in the city's Ewing-Carroll historic district. Construction is to
start this spring, with completion to follow a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program forces you to use products and designs you would
not normally use because affordable housing projects are built on
such tight budgets you don't want to stray too far from what is
known to work,'' said Christiana Foglio, a principal of Home
Properties of New Brunswick, the developer.
</P>
<P>
   The homes will have such features as energy-efficient mechanical
systems, additional insulation, and air handling systems that
increase indoor air quality. The front and rear yards also will be
landscaped with plantings that absorb storm water runoff and the
homes will laid out to have a southern exposure to the sun,
maximizing passive solar energy, Ms. Foglio said.
</P>
<P>
   The one-family homes will have 1,011 square feet of space; the
two-family homes will have an owner's unit, with 969 to 1,051
square feet plus a rental apartment with 562 to 637 square feet.
The sale price is expected to be $85,000 and the apartments are to
rent for $500 to $550 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In Eastampton, Pennrose Properties of Philadelphia will use $1.3
million from the program to build a 100-unit low-rise rental
development. It will be built on 25 acres of a 300-acre site just
off the intersection of Woodlane and Monmouth roads. The remaining
275 acres, which contain wetlands, will be left undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   The project will have a road system that encourages walking and
the units will be grouped in clusters of four instead of eight as
originally planned, providing additional open space. They also will
be arranged on the site to take advantage of sun and shade, and
will be built with better insulated foundations and stack framing,
which requires less lumber, said Charles Lewis, a vice president at
Pennrose.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the two- and three-bedroom rentals will be
town-house-style apartments with 990 to 1,150 square feet; some
will be condominium flats with 910 to 1090 square feet. Rents are
expected to be $517 to $596 a month. Construction of the $13
million project is scheduled to begin in the spring and take a year
to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Pennrose is also involved with a project in Camden, where it
will receive $800,000 to rehabilitate an apartment building and an
adjacent three-building garden-style rental complex, both abandoned
historic landmarks, into 51 apartments for low-income elderly
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about affordable, it is not only what it costs
to build but what it costs residents to maintain, which could make
an affordable house unaffordable,'' Lewis said. ``If nothing else,
the state program forces you to think about these issues.''

 By RON DICKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Hofstra overcame a 10-point deficit and its
self-destructive ways Saturday to earn its first playoff victory in
Division I-AA, a 27-15 triumph over Lehigh before a crowd of 6,770
at Hofstra Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Giovanni Carmazzi completed 22 of 30 passes for 228
yards and two touchdowns. He also rushed for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra (11-1) could run. Jimmy Jones carried 23 times for 124
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh (10-2) could not. The Mountain Hawks' star running back,
Ronald Jean, managed 52 yards on 16 carries, forcing quarterback
Phil Stambaugh into a throwing marathon. Stambaugh completed 30 of
44 passes for 323 yards and had three costly interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The last one was snagged by Hofstra's Doug Shanahan in the end
zone with 4 minutes 20 seconds remaining, and the Flying Dutchmen
holding a 27-13 lead. On Hofstra's previous possession, receiver
Steve Jackson caught the last of his 11 receptions for a 6-yard
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra closed out the scoring by taking a safety.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra will be home again, against Illinois State, in a
quarterfinal next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Four key defensive plays maintained Hofstra's lead throughout
the third quarter and into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Damon Sinicropi intercepted Stambaugh's pass as
the Lehigh quarterback was being driven to the ground early in the
final period. Hofstra took over at its 30 and eventually got a
27-yard field goal by Chad Johnson to increase its lead to 20-13.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third quarter, Hofstra's Casey Mahoney stopped Jean
on third-and-goal from the 1, and broke up a pass intended for
tight end Bruce Peltzer on fourth down. Earlier in the quarter,
cornerback Lynde Washington wrestled away an apparent touchdown
pass to Lehigh's Avon Mack for the interception.
</P>
<P>
   With Hofstra trailing, 10-0, Carmazzi directed the Flying
Dutchmen on a confidence-building 87-yard drive. It ended with
Johnson's 21-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh parlayed Stambaugh's 38-yard completion to Kody Fedorcha
into a 20-yard field goal by Jaron Taaffe on its next possession,
but showed an inability to run that would plague them all
afternoon. Jean managed only 33 yards on 11 carries in the first
half, and Stambaugh, except for the long completion to Fedorcha,
did not make any big dents, completing 11 of 17 passes for 115
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Carmazzi, meanwhile, showed the smarts and skills that have him
projected as one of the top five quarterbacks in next year's NFL
draft. Mixing in a few rushes by Jones (10 carries for 55 yards in
the first half), Carmazzi connected on 15 of 19 passes for 175
first-half yards, 104 of those coming on Jackson's eight
receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson drew an interference call on Abdul Byron in the middle
of the second quarter to give Hofstra a first-and-10 at the Lehigh
7. Two plays later, Carmazzi shuffled his feet a yard into the end
zone to draw the Dutchmen to within 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays and a punt followed for Lehigh. Carmazzi hooked up
with Jackson three times on the next drive. The last completion was
an 11-yard dart to Jackson to pull Hofstra ahead, 17-13, late in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra put itself in a hole at the beginning. Jones fumbled on
the Flying Dutchmen's first play from scrimmage, giving Lehigh the
ball at the Hofstra 33. Despite a penalty on third down that
prolonged Lehigh's drive, Hofstra kept Lehigh out of the end zone.
The Mountain Hawks settled for a 22-yard field goal by Taaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra's next possession gave Lehigh excellent field position
again. Dan Zorger's snap sailed over the head of punter James
McClary. McClary ran back to retrieve the ball and passed it to
Robert Levites, who was stopped at the Hofstra 35. This time,
Lehigh fully capitalized. Jean eventually plowed in for a 1-yard
touchdown to make the score 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Flying Dutchmen could have crumbled, but Carmazzi and their
defense would not let them.  &QL;

   (NYT13) FARMINGVILLE, N.Y. -- Nov. 27, 1999 --

Farmingville who gather on street corners in the hopes of being
hired for construction and gardening jobs have opposed a plan to
limit the number of renters who share a home. The proposed
Neighborhood Preservation Act would outlaw dozens of houses by
limiting the number of people who can legally occupy rentals. And
it would give the town of Brookhaven, which governs the area, the
authority to enter homes, in some cases without a warrant, to
enforce the code. (Angel Franco/New York Times Photo)

In Kosovo's ethnically mixed areas, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees runs local transportation. The office of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is in charge of the return
of some 850,000 refugees, their temporary housing and their food.
It coordinates the many aid agencies that work around Stimlje.

11-27 -- Both male and female officers with a variety of racial
backgrounds salute the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National
Cemetery. Nearly two-thirds of military personnel who responded to
a recent survey said they had had a racially offensive encounter
with a colleague during the 12 previous months, and there is a wide
disparity in how blacks and whites see the state of race relations.

ABANDONED-CASTLE-3, 11-27 -- Bannerman Castle on Pollelpel Island
has fallen into a state of disrepair over the years, and the waters
of the Hudson have encroached on one of its turrets. In addition to
natural erosion, a number of incidents have led to its increasing
state of decrepitude. One such incident occurred in 1920 when a
powder house explosion injured three people and catapulted a
25-foot-long piece of stone wall onto the eastern shore of the
Hudson. (James Estrin/New York Times Photo)

is being restored by a fledging non-profit group, the Bannerman

the Kiptopeke watch is a place of serious business as Cameron and
other scientists run careful seasonal tallies on the state of the

the Century City Shopping Center, valet parking service is free
with a $25 purchase of groceries at Gelson's, an upscale
supermarket. Residents of Los Angeles have come to expect valet
parking just about everywhere. Valet parking is so common in
Southern California that drivers of $70,000 luxury cars who would
not entrust them to their own teen-agers routinely hand them over
to complete strangers and sometimes assume that restaurants offer
the service, even if they do not. (Monica Almeida/New York Times

everything, that is, except park them, Jeanette Karnes of Valettes
valet parking gives a driver a customary rose at a party in Los

   (NYT3) MILWAUKEE -- Nov. 27, 1999 -- WELFARE-WOMEN-3, 11-27 --
Tanya Moore, 25, a former university student on welfare for the
first time, pictured with her daughter, decided to discuss her past
with other victims of domestic violence, ``so they would know that
they are not alone.'' ``I have a hard time trusting people,
particularly authority figures,'' says Ms. Moore. Ms. Morre,
molested by a relative during their grade-school years, continues
to struggle with storms of depression that interfere with her
ability to hold jobs and form relationships. (Nicole Bengiveno/New

   (NYT2) MILWAUKEE -- Nov. 27, 1999 -- WELFARE-WOMEN-2, 11-27 --
At a ``Take Back the Night'' rally in Milwaukee, women protest
violence against women. One participant, Tanya Moore, said the
presence of ``everyday people, like you see in the streets, makes
me think, O.K., I'm not the only one.'' Without recognition of the
sexual abuse in the early lives of many women on welfare, it is
difficult for caseworkers to understand how such women arrive on
welfare or the multiple problems that persist as they leave the
rolls. Many never even consider raising such an intimate subject
with their caseworkers. (Nicole Bengiveno/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT1) MILWAUKEE -- Nov. 27, 1999 -- WELFARE-WOMEN-1, 11-27 -- A
hidden history of childhood abuse helps explain the struggles of
Mary Rhoden, 35, who began the year as a promising student in a
motivation class mandated by Wisconsin's welfare program. Ms.
Rhoden never told caseworkers she had been molested as a child.
``Oh, like they care if I'm a happy person,'' she says. Ms. Rhoden
even went as far as to lie on a questionnaire meant to detect
depression, which has plagued her for decades. ``I just told them
what they wanted to hear.'' (Nicole Bengiveno/New York Times Photo)

   DEBATES _ WASHINGTON _ With a quote borrowed from an old movie _
``I paid for this microphone, Mr. Green!'' _ Ronald Reagan stole
the stage from his Republican opponents at a 1980 New Hampshire
debate. The tide began flowing against front-runner George Bush,
and didn't stop until it had swept Reagan into the White House. As
he prepares for his first confrontation with his GOP opponents Dec.
2, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas must face the fact that debates
have the power to dramatically shift a campaign's momentum.

   ANESTHESIA-WAR _ WASHINGTON _ Who will put you to sleep? The
controversy over the use of specially-trained nurses to administer
anesthesia at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.,
is part of a larger struggle between physician-anesthesiologists
and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). The nurses
argue that they were administering anesthesia before the medical
speciality of anesthesiology even existed and say they are fully
trained to give patients the pain-blocking and sleep-inducing
drugs. Anesthesiologists say the science is much more complex than
it was 100 years ago and the danger of sudden complications
requires the presence of a physician specialist. Not only military
medicine but Medicare and Medicaid payments are at stake. (Nesmith,

items often contain undisclosed ingredients that come from
genetically-manipulated crops, and U.S. corporate interests argue
that there is no difference in these products and traditional
foods. But in places like Sierra Leone and India, the hope of more
productive crops from genetically altered plants could spell the
difference between hunger and famine. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

worry that the international community made a fatal error by
treating the end of the war as a triumph of the Albanians over the
Serbs, thus creating an environment that emboldened revenge seeking
Albanians. They also worry that the outside world - particularly
the donor community - will lose sympathy for the Albanians.

ULSTER UNIONISTS RATIFY POWER-SHARING PLAN, WITH A CAVEAT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Ending a century during which they were seen as
Europe's most steadfast rejectionists, Ulster Unionists Saturday
approved a compromise that will usher in a new era of power sharing
with Irish nationalists and could end the political stalemate in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprise move, the Ulster Unionist Party Council and
its leader David Trimble added a condition to the endorsement:
Unless the party has evidence that its adversary, the Irish
Republican Army, is turning in its arms by sometime in February,
Trimble and three Unionist members will resign from the new
coalition local government, collapsing it.
</P>
<P>
   By adding the last-minute amendment, Trimble defers until
February the party's final decision on whether to stay in the
power-sharing government, which is expected to be formed next week
with the IRA's political ally, Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 829 delegates who voted Saturday, 480, or 58 percent,
endorsed the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's supporters said the amendment was needed to reassure
delegates who were reluctant to drop the party's policy of refusing
to form a power-sharing government until the IRA had begun to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
   If the compromise was supposed to be an example of trust
developing between the Ulster Unionists, who represent most
Protestants in Northern Ireland, and Irish republicans, who
supported the IRA's violent campaign to end British control of
Northern Ireland, the condition on disarmament underscored the
remaining gulf between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said the February
deadline amounted to a precondition that is not part of the Good
Friday Agreement of 1998, which calls for the decommissioning of
paramilitary weapons by May but does not dictate when the
decommissioning should start. Nor was the deadline a subject of
negotiations led by George Mitchell, the former US senator from
Maine who brokered the original agreement, then spent most of the
last three months fashioning a compromise to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   Adams told the BBC the deadline ``will fuel the uncertainty, and
it will also keep alive the hope of the rejectionists.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Sinn Fein officials said Satgurday night the deadline will
appear to the IRA as a unilateral demand from unionists, which the
IRA would reject.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also miffed by the terse challenge Trimble
aimed at Adams after Saturday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clears the stalemate we've had in terms of process,''
Trimble said. ``We've done our bit. And Mr. Adams, it's over to
you. We've jumped. You follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over IRA weapons has stalled the implementation of
the Good Friday Agreement, and the peace process in general, for
more than a year. Under the compromise, Trimble agreed to drop his
party's demand for IRA weapons before forming the power-sharing
government in exchange for the IRA's commitment to have one of its
members begin meeting with retired Canadian General John de
Chastelain, who is in charge of an international body overseeing
the disarming of paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member Cabinet that will run that government, including
two from Sinn Fein, is expected to be nominated on Monday. On
Tuesday, the British Parliament will begin the process of
devolution, or returning power to the Belfast assembly, which was
created last year under the Good Friday Agreement but suspended in
July because of the weapons dispute. By Thursday, the process is
expected to be complete and local government would be returned to
Northern Ireland for the first time since 1972, when direct rule
from London was imposed at the height of the battles between the
minority Catholics and ruling Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who had been hoping for at least 60 percent of
Saturday's vote, called the 58 percent ``a clear endorsement.'' He
got the backing he needed after three hours of debate, some of it
emotional, inside the Waterfront Hall, a riverside auditorium that
is a symbol of a new, prosperous, and relatively peaceful Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a heckler suggested Trimble had disgraced the
memory of Robert Bradford, an Ulster Unionist member of Parliament
who was murdered by the IRA in 1981. In a dramatic response,
Trimble quoted from a letter he said Bradford's widow had written
him, encouraging him to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a surreal moment when a delegate opposed to the
compromise, Jean Coulter, rose and said she wanted to refer to
``the greatest family of resistance in the world _ the Von
Trapps.'' She then quoted from the song ``Edelweiss,'' from the
film ``The Sound of Music,'' which includes the line, ``Bless my
homeland forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's deputy leader, John Taylor, reversed himself and
backed Trimble after being assured the February deadline would be
added. Party insiders say Taylor's conversion clinched the deal.
</P>
<P>
   One delegate, Tom Walton, 79, said the Ulster Unionists had
succeeded by dispelling claims they were inflexible and by
pressuring the republican movement to prove it was sincere in
wanting to transform the debate over Northern Ireland's status to
one that is exclusively political.
</P>
<P>
   Walton, who served in the British Army, said he believed Adams
was sincere in wanting to use only politics to advance the cause of
a united Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the IRA can prove whether they're sincere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinn Fein officials privately said the new deadline
undermines all the diplomacy that has sought to defuse the dispute
over unionist demands for weapons and to make the relinquishing of
weapons voluntary. Many in the IRA equate turning in guns with
surrender, something they insist they did not do when they called a
cease-fire to help the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trimble's taken down one hurdle and put up another,'' one
senior Sinn Fein official complained, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, whose high-pressure efforts to secure a compromise in
July failed, welcomed the Ulster Unionist endorsement, but steered
clear of the controversy surrounding the February deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who spent nearly three months getting Trimble and
Adams to talk to each other in private and fashion a compromise,
said Saturday's vote was encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction is the correct one,'' Mitchell said, using
language meant to praise Trimble without directly challenging
Adams's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA and Sinn Fein will be under intense pressure, including
from the White House, to make at least a token gesture on weapons.
President Clinton had urged Trimble to break the impasse and form
the power-sharing government, saying Trimble could ``walk away'' if
the IRA reneges on commitments to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   As he ducked into a car amid both cheers and jeers outside the
Waterfront Hall, Trimble had survived a near revolt in his party,
but he might have only put off the day of reckoning.

a Greek from a ``Grecian,'' was a C-average college student, can't
remember what, if anything, he liked to read as a boy and admits
that, even today, he doesn't care to read weighty books on public
policy, a subject that would seem a natural for the governor of the
second most-populous state.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, educated at Yale and Harvard, doesn't
purport to be ``any great genius, but I'm plenty smart,'' as he
told Time magazine this month. On the campaign trail and in
interviews, Bush is self-assured, often cocky, bent on showing that
he's a decisive man of action, not an egghead.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Bush travels to New Hampshire, site of the first
primary on Feb. 1, to debate his GOP rivals for the first time. He
enters as the front-runner, but with his foreign policy gaffes,
publication of his Yale grades in The New Yorker magazine and a
spate of news stories probing his intelligence, some political
pundits say Bush needs to prove that he has the depth to lead the
world's most powerful nation.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't show he's got that, they say, he should stay calm
and exude a sense of confidence instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to do a treatise on the State of the Union or
address the hot spots of the world,'' said New York pollster John
Zogby. ``He merely has to in some way show that he's up to the job,
and that can be like Jack Kennedy, who was better when he didn't
know the answer than when he did. What Kennedy was able to do was
in some way poke fun at the questioner and with a wink of his eye
suggest, `Look, I may not be able to answer your question right
now, but everything's under control.'''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Bush became testy when a Boston television reporter
asked him to name the leaders of Chechnya, Taiwan, Pakistan and
India. Late-night television hosts ran with jokes and some news
stories followed asking how smart Bush is.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nonpartisan firm Zogby International's clients is the
Boston television station that popped the pop quiz. Zogby said he
plans to survey voters after the debate to determine just how much
they care about what he calls a presidential candidate's
``knowledgeability.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Republican pollster Witt Ayers said he believes
the pop quiz didn't change the way voters perceive Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only effect the pop quiz had was the same effect the
cocaine question had, and that is to damage the reputation of the
American press rather than Governor Bush,'' Ayers said.
</P>
<P>
   Should he win the nomination, Bush could face Harvard graduate
Al Gore, a vice president with well-known wonkish tendencies, or
former Sen. Bill Bradley, a Princeton graduate and Rhodes Scholar
often compared with Adlai Stevenson, the intellectuals' political
poster-child from the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   DO VOTERS CARE?
</P>
<P>
   Is Bush smart enough to handle the job he so ardently seeks?
What does it mean for a president to be smart? Do voters care about
smarts at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not particularly,'' Zogby said. ``Harding was not smart.
Questions were raised about Jerry Ford, who was not elected, but he
was president. No one is going to argue that Ronald Reagan was a
rocket scientist. In fact, he beat a rocket scientist. The issue
isn't so much knowledgeability as it is being up to the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign handlers describe him as a quick study, an
active participant in briefings whose get-to-the-point questions
help them shape his stances into policies. Bush has rolled out
policy proposals on education and defense in speeches heavily
promoted by his campaign. He delivered the latest, on foreign
affairs, in California on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've dealt with some people who are afraid to say they don't
know,'' said Josh Bolten, who coordinates Bush's policy teams,
prepares briefings and sits in on sessions with the candidate and
his advisers. ``I've never seen him try to fake it. He will
interrupt the conversation any time that he doesn't know a
particular fact. He knows a lot and he is very comfortable with
what he doesn't know. This guy raises his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Armitage, a member of Bush's foreign policy team and an
assistant defense secretary under former President Reagan, said
that he occasionally recommends reading for the governor, but that
Bush prefers the give-and-take of meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all made suggestions on what he might want to look
at,'' Armitage said. ``But generally it comes in the talking about
these matters. . . . On Japan, he's got a very strong view that
Japan is our strategic partner in Asia. . . . What he wouldn't have
known and didn't know was the history of how we got to where we
are. We fill in the blanks that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Bush's eight-person defense team also advised
Presidents Reagan and Bush. The team is headed by former Stanford
University provost Condoleezza Rice. On education, Bush is getting
help from Diane Ravitch, who served as assistant education
secretary in President Bush's administration, and former Education
Secretary Bill Bennett, among others. Bush has an economics team,
too.
</P>
<P>
   AVOIDING MANIPULATION
</P>
<P>
   Critics call Bush's willingness to seek advice laudable, but
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with experts is that if the president himself is
not smart and well-informed, even a president with the best
intentions can be misled,'' said Paul Begala, a former aide to
President Clinton who said he thinks Bush is smart but
``uncurious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to vest that much power in advisers,'' said
Begala, a former Austin, Texas, resident. ``I know very well the
influence briefers may have in what they do and do not tell the
president. . . . If you want to have your finger on the
thermonuclear button, if you want to write budgets of $1.5 trillion
a year of our money, then you want to bone up a bit. It helps to be
curious.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist, says
Bush has, ``ample intellectual candle power to be president.'' He
agrees with Begala that an unprepared president runs the risk of
being manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know enough to prevent that,'' Buchanan said.
``But that's not the same as being a policy wonk or a deep student
of any particular policy area. . . . It is a job that requires a
lot of study and he's in the midst of that study right now. Other
presidents or potential presidents have had to go to school. Ronald
Reagan was going to school on foreign policy after his
inauguration, literally taking seminars on foreign policy in the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of New Hampshire voters who turned out Monday to meet
Bush during a day of campaigning said they weren't swayed by Bush's
pop quiz performance. They think he's smart enough to be president,
though they aren't quite sure how they know it.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Ellis, 75, struck out Bush's father when the two were on
rival high school baseball teams in 1942. A veteran, he said he
considered supporting Arizona Sen. John McCain, a POW in North
Vietnam who has pulled even with Bush in polls in New Hampshire and
Iowa, crucial early caucus states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because of the son and father thing,'' Ellis said,
explaining his decision to go with Bush. ``We need someone to be
honest and great for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Guimont said Bush must be smart to have made it so far in
life. She hopes people will give him a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, although the president has the final say, he really
goes with the strength of his advisers is the way I look at it,''
she said. ``I don't think one man is totally in charge of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, still trying to decide whom to back, also will be
watching. Richard Goodman, a retired University of New Hampshire
professor, said he's leaning toward Bradley. But he came to meet
Bush at a campaign stop in Seabrook, N.H., because he's curious
about the education reforms the governor has been touting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't just be glib,'' Goodman said. ``He's really got to
show that he's got what it takes to lead us into the next
century.''

GREENWOOD LAKE FOLLOWS HIS OWN ROUTE TO WIN REMSEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Greenwood Lake continued his unusual advance on the
Kentucky Derby Saturday when he won the 86th Remsen Stakes at
Aqueduct by a head after a furious rush down the muddy homestretch.
He has become one of the early favorites for the Derby without
taking the traditional route through the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old son of Meadowlake turned out to be the star of
New York's final day of major racing this year. Greenwood Lake was
flanked in the spotlight by the filly Jostle, who won the
Demoiselle by a head, and by late starter Affirmed Success, who won
the Cigar Mile by five lengths.
</P>
<P>
   For the hero of the cast, Greenwood Lake, it was a calculated
risk not to race against the country's best juveniles in the
Breeders' Cup three weeks ago. It was won by the 30-1 long shot
Anees, who buried some highly favored young runners. Nick Zito, the
trainer of Greenwood Lake, said he would rather not push his colt
through a race that has not produced a Derby winner in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Greenwood Lake wasted no time staking a claim for the
juvenile championship, which has not produced a Derby winner in 20
years. Meanwhile, the Remsen has produced five Derby winners,
including Zito's Go for Gin six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tons of class,'' Zito said Saturday in the winner's
circle. ``I think he was equally impressive as Anees was in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile. I think my horse warrants championship
consideration. No matter how you look at it, it's going to be close
for the 2-year-old championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood Lake ran for the first time in 7 1-2 weeks and closed
a remarkably successful year, winning three of five starts with a
major score in the Champagne Stakes and a close second in the
Belmont Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   He ran the mile and an eighth Saturday under Jean-Luc Samyn in
1:50 3/5, paid $4.10 for a $2 bet to win and earned $120,000 of the
$200,000 purse. He raced at the back of the pack for most of the
route, then circled six wide into the stretch and caught Un Fino
Vino by a head in the final stride, with Polish Mine third by a
neck in a three-horse photo finish.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmed Success scored after running in the Breeders' Cup _ but
he did not run much there, finishing 12th under Jerry Bailey in the
Sprint. Yet, he came back Saturday and ran away with the $350,000
Cigar Mile, a race he entered after the favored Artax was withdrawn
on Thursday with a leg injury that forced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmed Success took the lead after three-quarters of a mile
and widened it to five lengths over Adonis, the stablemate of
Artax, who had nearly a length on Honorifico. The winner ran the
mile in 1:34 under Jorge Chavez, returned $7.90 and banked
$210,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Breeders' Cup Sprint was a complete throw-out,'' said
Richie Schosberg, who trains Affirmed Success for Albert Fried Jr.
``He vindicated himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the $200,000 Demoiselle, which was run for the 78th time,
Jostle came out of Delaware and Maryland tracks to win her fourth
straight and won this one after a free-for-all down the
homestretch. At the finish, Jostle had her head in front of March
Magic, who led Shawnee Country by a length and three-quarters.
Ogden Phipps' Finder's Fee, who missed the Breeders' Cup with a
high white-cell blood count, finished fourth about one length in
front of the favorite, Regally Appealing, who vacated the
speed-favoring rail position before tiring.
</P>
<P>
   Jostle ran the mile and one-eighth in 1:51 2/5 under Stewart
Elliott, paid $18 for a $2 bet and earned $120,000 for her fourth
success in five career starts.

WOMAN PROMOTES TEACHING OF CREATIONISM IN KANSAS PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By KATE BEEM Knight Ridder Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Someone created every thing in the universe,
Celtie Johnson believes.
</P>
<P>
   Someone made the pen she writes with. Someone made the keyboard
she types on. All complex systems are designed by someone, so it
follows that life, the most complex system of all, has a designer,
too, said Johnson, of Prairie Village, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's saying who that intelligent designer is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To Johnson, evolution simply makes no sense. She rejects the
evidence most scientists say supports the theory that all living
things share common ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   She firmly believes in the biblical account of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year she mounted a campaign to turn the Kansas
science community on its ear. Judging from the agitation in the
state over evolution, there is evidence she has succeeded:
</P>
<P>
   - In the beginning, the Kansas Board of Education and the state
education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science
teachers and professors to write new science standards for public
schools. The committee's version described the theory of evolution
as a ``unifying concept'' for all science disciplines. It drew
objections from those who do not believe in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Late last winter, Johnson pulled together a loosely knit group
of creationists from Kansas and Missouri who drafted an alternate
version of the standards. The alternate draft, presented to the
state board, defined both evolution and creation in its glossary.
It also defined the battle that would occupy the state board for
months.
</P>
<P>
   - Johnson visited the Kansas board again and again, urging
members to reject the committee's science standards in favor of her
group's standards.
</P>
<P>
   - She also formed the National Committee for Excellence in
Science Education, which helps people in other states who want to
question evolution. The group intends to offer the alternate
science standards written by Johnson and others to people in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Abrams, a conservative Kansas Board of Education member
from Arkansas City, Kan., presented the alternate standards Johnson
helped write.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very dedicated and wants to see good science in
Kansas,'' said Abrams, a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Val DeFever, a moderate board member from Independence, Kan.,
said Johnson was determined to sway board members to her point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just explained to her we weren't on the same wavelength,''
said DeFever, who supported the standards written by the science
teachers. ``We were both committed to our viewpoints, and it really
would be a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says she wanted scientists to explain why, as she sees
it, evolution is immune from question and why other explanations
for the origins of life cannot be considered in science classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire her dedication,'' said Ken Ham, executive director of
the creationist organization Answers in Genesis, based in Kentucky.
``I admire her trying to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's critics say that, under the guise of science, she is
trying to inject into the public schools her religious belief that
God created the universe.
</P>
<P>
   John van Keppel of Leawood, Kan., an evolution supporter, says
Johnson does not understand science well enough to dispute the
facts of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against evolution that Johnson and other
creationists say is being censored by mainstream science is a
cut-and-paste job, said Charlotte McDonald, the Blue Valley School
District's science coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not presenting the whole scientific information,''
McDonald said. ``If you're going to take things out of context, you
can refute anything you want to refute.''
Fliers at malls
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a 43-year-old mother of four, shares her beliefs with
most people she meets. She begins many conversations with creation
naysayers by asking, ``What do you know about evolution to be
true?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 she and her brother asked the Shawnee Mission School
District to use Of Pandas and People, a science textbook that puts
forth intelligent design _ the idea that an intelligent being
created Earth and everything in it. District officials said they
considered the text but rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and her husband began visiting shopping malls on
weekends to place homemade creationist fliers on cars. The fliers
contained passages such as this: ``The theory of evolution is just
a theory, yet our public school's texts do not mention the
significant amount of scientific evidence against it. Why the
censorship?''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson and her husband, Eric, 37, the truth about how the
universe came to be is readily available and has been for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe the Bible is true,'' said Eric Johnson, a
stockbroker. ``If it's not true, it's just a paperweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtie Johnson said she was not completely against evolution
being taught. She said she just wanted teachers to feel comfortable
presenting the pros and cons of Charles Darwin's theory. Many feel
pressured to teach evolution as a fact, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has been told, subtly and not, to sit down and shut up. She
has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident that most humans have common sense, that they
can critically think,'' Johnson said. ``I don't want them to be
plagued with believing evolution, because it's not true.''
 &LR; brk:Macro vs. micro
</P>
<P>
   Some on the 10-member Kansas Board of Education agreed with
Johnson, and in August the board approved science standards that
contained references to microevolution, or adaptation, but no
mention of macroevolution, or change from one species to another.
The revised version no longer lists evolution as one of science's
unifying concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The revised standards also omit many references to the age of
Earth. There is no longer any mention of the big-bang theory _ the
idea that the universe was born in an explosion of matter and
radiation between 12 billion and 20 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those deletions are significant to ``young Earth creationists''
such as Johnson who believe that the Earth was created in six
24-hour days sometime in the last 7,000 years. Creationists say
they have evidence that supports this belief:
</P>
<P>
   - It takes about 300 to 1,000 years to form an inch of topsoil,
but the worldwide average depth is about 7 to 8 inches, which means
the Earth is only a few thousand years old, creationists say.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists respond that that argument does not take erosion
into account.
</P>
<P>
   - The eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 produced 25 feet of
finely layered sediment and gouged canyons in one afternoon, which
shows that millions of years are not required to form rock layers.
This lends credence to the global flood and other catastrophic
events in the Bible, creationists say.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists say erosion happens at variable rates all over the
world. Catastrophes explain some geologic formations but not all.
</P>
<P>
   - Earth's magnetic field has been decaying rapidly, which
creationists say points to an age younger than 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists counter that the decay is not steady and that much
evidence exists for several reversals of the decay rate.
</P>
<P>
   Most creationists say that scientific theories must be
observable. Although it is true that monkey blood and human blood
are similar, that is not evidence the two species are related, said
Glen Kailer of Perry, Kan., a researcher with the Creation Science
Association for Mid-America. Creationists view that similarity as
more proof of design, Kailer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Chevy and a Ford are not descended from a common ancestor,''
Kailer said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither evolution nor creation can be tested or has been
observed, but creationists say their theory has a witness: the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists, on the other hand, believe that some science
works in the comparative mode, said Ed Wiley, a University of
Kansas evolutionary biologist. Something that is true for one life
form will be true for another.
</P>
<P>
   One particular point of contention is transitional life forms.
</P>
<P>
   Creationists say that scientists have not found any fossils of
transitional animals and that no transitional animals exist today.
They do not believe that animals such as the archaeopteryx, a bird
with reptile characteristics that some scientists think links birds
and dinosaurs, are transitional.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the archaeopteryx is not a true intermediate form
between birds and reptiles, Wiley said. But it had transitional
characteristics between the two species, such as wings and
reptilian attributes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley said creationists would not ever accept the archaeopteryx
as a transitional animal, because it was too dangerous to their
faith in a God so powerful he could create everything just as it is
today.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, believing that Earth is older than described
in the first chapter of Genesis threatens some creationists'
understanding of the basis of their faith, said Keith Miller, an
evangelical Christian and a geologist at Kansas State University.
</P>
<P>
   Most Christians, Miller said, find no conflict with believing
that God could have used evolution to create the universe. Biblical
literalists cannot accept that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the days in Genesis actually were millions or billions of
years, dinosaurs would have lived and died long before humans. That
would mean death and dying came long before Adam and Eve were cast
out of the Garden of Eden in what Christians know as the Fall of
Man, Miller said. That is in direct conflict with a literal reading
of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They view their interpretation of Scripture as being
primary,'' Miller said. ``They don't accept the validity of
nonbiblical sources of truth. Everything comes through a scriptural
lens.''
</P>
<P>
   For Miller and Wiley, evolution is a fact of nature with many
theories of how it works.
</P>
<P>
   But for people such as Johnson and Ham, evolution is a
philosophical belief system just like creation. Ham said both
groups agreed on observable facts such as natural selection and
mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Those things are ``what we observe in the present,'' Ham said.
``In trying to connect to the past, you have to use faith.''
 &LR; brk:`Days in shock'
</P>
<P>
   Celtie and Eric Johnson think many scientists overlook
evolution's missing details, such as transitional fossils, and
teach the scientific theory as proven fact to unsuspecting science
students.
</P>
<P>
   Celtie Johnson said she spent decades believing that humans
evolved from lower forms and that species could change into other
species over millions of years. A former premedicine major, she
faults a belief in evolution for leading her to make bad decisions
as she struggled through more than one divorce and a life she saw
as purposeless and random.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dog eat dog,'' Johnson said. ``That's what I was living.
It was survival of the fittest.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day about five years ago she was talking to her
brother, a mechanical engineer, and he brought up intelligent
design. Johnson said she did not have a clue as to what he was
talking about. She knew only about evolution. But her brother told
her there was overwhelming evidence against evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Something clicked. Johnson began to research creation. Soon Eric
Johnson joined in. They began to feel more and more duped by their
science classes, Celtie Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent days in shock,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the shock wore off, Johnson said, she decided she had to
spread the word. She joined the Creation Science Association,
seeking more information.
</P>
<P>
   It was Johnson's insistence that the Kansas science standards
were flawed that drew together the band of writers who drafted the
alternate standards, said Kailer, one of the writers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's motivation was good science, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celtie is not at all alone,'' he said. ``Celtie is one of the
thousands who recognize the absurdity of evolution as science.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is one of the few willing to speak out, said Linda
Highland of Olathe, who first met Johnson at a legislative forum
some years back. Highland said the state board made the right
decision in August, and she credited Johnson for helping board
members find the strength to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that maybe she builds courage in others by showing
that she isn't afraid to take this issue on,'' Highland said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said she was motivated by the search for truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is. Maybe some people have the ability to
see the proof,'' she said. ``I think the majority of people believe
in evolution because they don't have the facts.''

L.A.'S THE PLACE IN NOVEMBER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite what seems to be a harmonic convergence, L.A. remains a
few warped factors short of earning the nomination for hub of the
NBA universe.
</P>
<P>
   But as the season's first month grinds into oblivion, we have to
admit that its stars are boldly going where they haven't gone in
light years.
</P>
<P>
   The MVP for November? Shaquille ``We Need More Orange Paint''
O'Neal. Our Rookie of the Month is Lamar ``Extend Your Elbow On
That Jumper'' Odom. Taking the coaching bow is former USC star Paul
Westphal (Seattle), who receives the nod over Phil ``Rent-A-Karma''
Jackson, because Phil coaches the MVP, remember? If you're partial
to the far Eastern Conference, cases could be made for former
Lakers sharpie Pat Riley (Miami) and Paul Silas (Charlotte), who
used to call time outs for the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The most-improved-player race was won by ex-Laker Ruben
Patterson (Seattle) over mighty Clipper Brian Skinner, with A.C.
Green checking in second behind Cleveland's Bob ``Yes!'' Sura as
Comeback Player of the Month.
</P>
<P>
   Former Long Beach State hotshot Bryan Russell (Utah) almost gets
our top-sixth-man salute, losing to Seattle's Vernon Maxwell in a
competition that rates a photo finish thanks to Mad Max's
field-goal percentage (41).
</P>
<P>
   Shaq has been a fiend on the non-dunking end of the court, but
our top defender for November is Minnesota's Kevin Garnett, who's
nasty enough to prevent Brad Pitt from scoring at cheerleader camp.
</P>
<P>
   With our compulsories in the bag, we now deliver the NBA awards
that require a higher degree of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Please Come Back Player of the Month:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan generated a lot of unrequited hoo-ha in Chicago
by dropping in on a Bulls practice, the equivalent of Moses
stopping by to edit Letterman's top 10 list.
</P>
<P>
   Best Film Premise:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Curse of Sprewell.'' In a return that might even embarrass
Al Davis, Latrell encourages Oakland fans to bleep it real.
</P>
<P>
   Best CBA Rescue:
</P>
<P>
   This one goes to the Boston Celtics, who plucked Adrian Griffin
from the Connecticut Pride (yeah, we thought it was a micro-brew,
too).
</P>
<P>
   Suit Yourself Award:
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson, who thinks Giorgio Armani is a pizza joint,
injures his hand in the act of thumbing his nose at Larry Brown's
dress code. The closest event the Sixers had to a fashion play came
courtesy of Stanley Roberts, who was bounced from the league after
testing positive for a designer drug.
</P>
<P>
   Best Corn Rows:
</P>
<P>
   With the silver and bronze going to Iverson and Sprewell,
respectively, our gold is reserved for Utah coach Jerry Sloan, who
decided to pout over a lousy Jazz effort by spending an off day at
his farm in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   sub Rumor of the weak
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks usually win this one in a rout, but they deserve some
time off.
</P>
<P>
   We now aim our noses at Washington, D.C. where the latest gossip
has forward Juwan Howard packing his $15 million contract and
dragging it to Laker Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Wizards and Lakers both are miles beyond the salary
cap, Howard's alleged new team would be required to ship back
enough salary to come within 10 percent of that 15. A Glen Rice,
Robert Horry and Travis Knight package would do it, but remember
this:
</P>
<P>
   Including this season, Howard will be paid $70 million over the
next four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Smells like a deal-killer to us.
</P>
<P>
   sub Picking on the Clips
</P>
<P>
   If ya can't re-sign 'em, draft 'em.
</P>
<P>
   That could be the war cry of the Clippers, who - thanks to the
dumping of $42 million man Lorenzen Wright on Atlanta in exchange
for two selections - may have three first-round picks next June.
</P>
<P>
   With, um, only 70 games left to play, the Clips had the NBA's
ninth-worst record. The lottery has that ``come-hither'' look.
Wright's Hawks, who keep their No. 1 if it falls within the top
nine selections, were eighth. Unless J.R. Rider goes completely
cuckoo (that one's off the board), Atlanta should be able to play
itself right out of the pick.
</P>
<P>
   The second Clipper pick from the Wright deal can be traced to
Toronto and is ``lottery protected,'' a minor concern because the
Raptors should have enough juice to qualify for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So what?
</P>
<P>
   So when your owner balks at paying market value for his own
free-agents, first-round picks are a fine alternative. They're
relatively cheap and - thanks to the new collective bargaining
agreement's team-option clause -- can produce long-term employees
of the franchises that select them.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it would be swell to buy a few experienced, free-agent
role players, but owner Donald T. Sterling is a bit, well, thrifty.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves his personnel crew to be creative on draft night.
Here's an optimistic reminder: Skinner was the 21st pick in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   (sub) Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who remains true to his school (LSU), eventually will be
joined in the NBA by Bayou Bengal sophomore Stromile Swift. Swift,
a 6-foot-9 forward at LSU, was a star attraction during
high-profile pickup games last summer at a camp conducted in Las
Vegas by Portland assistant coach Tim Grgurich. ``I've heard the
name,'' O'Neal said. ``Great basketball name ... Stro-mile Swift.
Like Shaquille O'Neal. When I was little, I knew I'd grow up to be
me.'' Swift did some growing as a freshman by blocking 11 shots in
a game vs. Alabama. ... The Washington Wizards rank 28th in free
throws attempted, suggesting the MCI Center presents a new version
of call-waiting. During last Saturday's game at MCI, Wizards
employees fired T-shirts into the home crowd, but the team's play
inspired most of the fans to throw them back. ... Detroit's Jerome
Williams, who was the suspect named in that rumored trade involving
Clipper Maurice Taylor, averages one rebound every 2.6 minutes.
Garnett gets one every 2.8 minutes, Shaq comes in at 2.7. But
Williams can't match Charles Barkley (2.5), who never lets defense
get in the way of grabbing a defensive rebound. ... Through
Friday's schedule, the Chicago Bulls had yet to score 100 points
(in one game); this may be proof that a shape even more important
than the three-pointed triangle is the five-pointed star. ... Laker
Kobe Bryant, still on the mend after breaking his right hand,
worked on that 3-point stroke before Wednesday's game with Utah at
Staples Center. Kobe made 8 of his first 15 attempts ...
left-handed.

POTENTIAL OWNER OF ROYALS HAS BUSINESS SAVVY AND IS A BIG BASEBALL
FAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE ROCK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By STEVE ROCK Knight-Ridder Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   BENTONVILLE, Ark. _ It is the Friday after Thanksgiving, perhaps
the busiest shopping day of the year for Wal-Mart stores across
America.
</P>
<P>
   But David Glass, the company's president and CEO, is sitting in
his rural office talking not about retail but about the Kansas City
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Over his shoulder, peering at him from the back wall, is a
baseball-clad boy in a Norman Rockwell painting. Another wall,
decorated with framed photographs and baseball cards, pays homage
to legendary players such as Honus Wagner and Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all,'' Glass says, drawing out the words with a tinge
of a southern drawl, ``I'm a baseball fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for that statement is everywhere in this office, the
place where Glass oversees one of American business's greatest
success stories. It is a story Glass played a big part in writing,
according to the autobiography of late Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anybody else, he's responsible for building the
sophisticated and efficient system we use today,'' Walton wrote in
Made in America: My Story. ``David Glass has to get the lion's
share of the credit for where we are today in distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass, 64, clearly has impeccable business savvy _ and a minimum
net worth of $323 million to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of high-ranking baseball officials identifying
Glass as ``the key'' to solving Kansas City's ownership crisis, and
Glass' subsequent decision to re-enter the ownership auction,
Kansas Citians wonder whether he has just as much baseball savvy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a logical question: What kind of owner would David Glass
be?
</P>
<P>
   Glass' name is familiar in Kansas City, where he is chairman of
the Royals board of directors. But he is still something of a
mystery to Kansas Citians who yearn for the days when the Royals
were winning division titles, league pennants and a world
championship under the direction of late owner Ewing M. Kauffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what David Glass is all about,'' said Herk Robinson,
general manager of the Royals. ``I hope the people of Kansas City
get the opportunity to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this whole thing ends up with David Glass owning the club,
it would be like never having lost Mr. Kauffman.''
</P>
<P>
   An exaggeration, perhaps. But one thing is certain: Glass, like
Kauffman, is a man who commands respect among baseball's owners. To
them he's a familiar face and a proven commodity, a guy who would
doggedly fight for small-market rights and push for change in
baseball's inequitable economic system.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Giles, for one, would ``definitely'' support Glass as the
next owner of the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very, very well-respected,'' said Giles, chairman of the
Philadelphia Phillies. ``When we talk about the global issues in
baseball, his judgment is very well-received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the small-market people in baseball, he's probably the
most respected. People listen when he speaks.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling what will happen to small-market clubs like
the Royals when, after the 2001 season, owners and players
renegotiate their collective-bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anyone who can get us through those unchartered
waters, it's David Glass,'' Robinson said. ``I don't think there's
a better person on the face of the earth to guide us through
this.'' Respectful leader
</P>
<P>
   People in Bentonville describe Glass in glowing terms.
</P>
<P>
   They say he is in the office by 6:30 every morning, sometimes
earlier. They say he is a ``soft-shell'' leader, not at all the
screaming type but one who commands work ethic from others by
demonstrating it himself.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, they say, neither seeks nor needs much credit. He is
quiet, unassuming, patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very biased,'' said Lee Scott, the vice chairman and chief
operating officer at Wal-Mart. ``David hired me 20 years ago. Not
once in those 20 years has there ever been a suggestion that I
should do something that would undermine my personal values. He
cares a lot about his people.''
</P>
<P>
   Over at Kauffman Stadium, they say much the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Glass was elected chairman of the Royals board of directors in
September 1993. Since that time, he has not once stepped foot in
the Royals clubhouse without first getting permission from his
front office staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very respectful of his people,'' said Robinson, who
answers directly to Glass. ``And he doesn't tell us how to do our
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   That may surprise some people who, once upon a time, labeled
Glass as the bad guy. They thought of him as a clandestine
conspirator, a guy with visions of buying the club on the cheap and
turning it into the Little Rock Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Glass scoffs at the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took the job that I have with the Royals, my commitment
was that whatever we did, we were going to make doggone sure that
the Royals were in Kansas City for the foreseeable future,'' Glass
said. ``Can I guarantee that the Royals are going to be there
forever? No. But the fans can.
</P>
<P>
   ``My commitment is to have major-league baseball in Kansas City.
I wouldn't ever consider anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass, mind you, would not be based in Kansas City himself.
After all, he already has a job in Arkansas and people in Kansas
City whom he trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Levy, the Royals' vice president for marketing and
communications, said that Glass had been known to point the club's
marketing staff into particular target-market directions. But, as
far as hands-on interaction, that is about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, he did ask me about the business,'' Levy said. ``And
I thought, `Oh, my goodness. The CEO of Wal-Mart is asking me about
merchandising.' But for the most part we don't talk about marketing
and merchandising. We talk about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a baseball fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a fan, in fact, that in a celebratory gala in the days
following George Brett's Hall of Fame induction, Glass was tracking
every last pitch as the Royals played at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Levy remembers thinking, ``is someone who has baseball
on his mind.'' Money matters
</P>
<P>
   The most recent report from Wal-Mart Stores Inc., where Glass
has worked for more than two decades, puts Glass' holding at more
than 5.2 million shares. That's $304 million worth of stock based
on Wal-Mart's closing price Friday of 58 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Glass also holds options to buy more Wal-Mart shares at prices
lower than the stock market price. The company's last estimate
showed Glass' options worth at least $19 million, when Wal-Mart
shares were trading at $43.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Wal-Mart shares have increased in value by a third.
</P>
<P>
   Glass has a hefty paycheck from Wal-Mart, too. In the last seven
years he has earned $12.5 million in salary, bonuses and other
compensation. And $4 million of that came just last year.
</P>
<P>
   All of which spells out a net worth of $323 million minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The real figure is hard to measure but likely much higher. The
minimum figure, for example, does not account for Glass
Enterprises, his company that owns commercial property and
investments, because it does not report financial information
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assets that my family has would certainly be substantial
enough to own a baseball team,'' Glass told The Star as many as six
years ago. ``That's not a question.''
</P>
<P>
   And Glass' fortunes seemingly have improved significantly since
then, with his stake in Wal-Mart alone growing by five times in
those six years.
</P>
<P>
   Glass did not make the most recent list of the Forbes 400
richest Americans, which meant having a net worth of at least $625
million. Nor did Glass show up on the magazine's ``near-miss'' list
of Americans worth $620 million.
</P>
<P>
   Glass chose not to elaborate on his net worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will meet baseball's standards,'' Glass said, chuckling.
``Beyond that, I'd rather not comment.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment was vintage Glass, coming from a man who drives a
1993 Lexus only because his wife had his old Ford station wagon
``hauled off and buried.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives no indication of the level of success he has achieved
in his business or personal life,'' said Scott, whose desk is a
fastball away from Glass' in Arkansas. ``He doesn't seem to have
the real need for people to recognize him.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which, perhaps, inspired Fortune magazine to once name
Glass its most-admired CEO.
</P>
<P>
   As for that Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans, few
major-league baseball owners were on it. Those left off include New
York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and Baltimore Orioles owner
Peter Angelos, both of whose teams had 1999 payrolls of more than
$75 million, the price Miles Prentice and his group were set to pay
for the entire Royals franchise before baseball rejected their
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect a similar payroll from Glass, who would have no
problem meeting the Royals' $100 million net-worth requirement but
probably would exercise conservatism in running his baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, quite simply, probably would not spend $20 million for a
player who only brought in $10 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the kind of guy who would do that,'' Glass said.
``Fiscal responsibility on the part of all the owners is one of the
first prerequisites for baseball to regain some of its competitive
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be the kind of owner who would fund major losses.
There are teams today that are losing $20 million, $30 million, $40
million. I think that's irresponsible. I don't think anyone should
look at a Major League Baseball franchise in Kansas City and
anticipate making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the franchise should be to break even.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, does not translate into a $40 million or $50
million payroll in Kansas City. The Royals made money in 1999, for
the first time this decade, with a payroll of less than $22
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made progress this past year,'' Glass said. ``We increased
our revenue some. If we can continue to increase revenues, we can
spend more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year you could see this team with a $25 million payroll.
I think you can grow your revenues, and grow your payroll, beyond
that. But not at a very rapid rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Joe McGuff, a member of the Royals board of directors:
``He would be good for Kansas City. But if people think he would
have a $50 million payroll, I think they would be mistaken. He
would run a good operation, but no one is going to come in and lose
$25 million or $30 million a year. The last two years, Ewing was
tired of losing money and complained a lot about that. He said he
was not going to continue to have those kind of losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, though, that Glass would not have to run his club on
the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very competitive and despise losing,'' Glass said. ``I
would work very, very hard to make sure we have a team in Kansas
City that is competitive, that is fun to watch. The fun goes out of
it if you lose all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In major-league baseball, your chances to win don't come
around too often. So when it does come around, do whatever it takes
to try and take advantage of it.''
</P>

LIBRARIANS COULD WRITE A BOOK ABOUT ODD ITEMS LEFT BETWEEN PAGES

</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Pssst! Is your name Pete? Did you lose a name
tag recently? The one you wore for work?
</P>
<P>
   Check the Plaza branch of the Kansas City Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   Honest. You left it in a book. Even though the name tag was
thick enough to give the book a bulge, you left it there.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, that's nothing compared with what some other folks
have left in library books. Important things, such as driver's
licenses, credit cards, uncashed paychecks, money, unsent mail and
airline tickets. Weird stuff, such as a Barbie hat, guitar strings
and drink coasters.
</P>
<P>
   And food. Lots of food.
</P>
<P>
   One chicken bone, stripped clean. A french fry. An unused
package of cinnamon spice dieter's cleansing tea. A strip of cooked
bacon, oozing grease. A slice of American cheese, still wrapped,
still supple the day it arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Today that cheese is as rigid as a ruler and as warped as a
walnut. It is displayed at the Plaza library checkout counter along
with dozens of other items discovered in books. A sign below the
display says, ``When is a bookmark not a bookmark?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been fun if we had kept track of what books we
found them in,'' said Nan Jehle, the library's circulation chief.
``I don't think we necessarily found airline tickets in travel
books.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers also have left postcards, napkins, refrigerator magnets,
Monopoly money, automobile air fresheners, photographs, clothing
tags, gum wrappers, doctor's appointment notices, a proportional
scale for sizing photographs _ even a Lawrence Taylor NFL trading
card.
</P>
<P>
   Some items are understandable. They are flat, like typical
bookmarks, and thin enough to be forgotten in a book.
</P>
<P>
   But hotel room keys? A cigarette? A Gummi Bear stuck on the end
of a wooden skewer?
</P>
<P>
   Jehle returns valuables to owners when possible, and once in a
while an item disappears from the display, apparently reclaimed by
its owner.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of replacements, however.
</P>
<P>
   Recently a set of homemade flashcards showed up. So did that
``Pete'' name tag, a house key and a plastic star slightly larger
than a drink coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Have you lost anything lately?
</P>
<P>
   Check the library.

 SCANDAL, RECESSION IN 1970s BEGET CYNICISM THAT ENDURES TODAY

   NOTES-Here is the eighth installment of The Star's 10-part
series looking at the stamp of change that each decade of the
century left on Americans. Today: The 1970s _ ``Distrust and
Declining Expectations.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The 1970s _ what a downer decade.
</P>
<P>
   The United States endured humiliation at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The decade's marquee milestone was Richard Nixon's Watergate
scandal and the first resignation of a president. Its legacy _ a
wholesale cynicism about politicians _ corrodes public discourse to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Kansas City Star poll, almost one in five
respondents said they trusted the federal government ``not at
all.'' No wonder voter turnout is so low.
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, Arab nations hit the United States with an oil embargo
in 1973, the country fled from Vietnam in a frenzied retreat in
1975, and America was rendered almost powerless by the Iran hostage
crisis in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, our collective confidence was shattered. The
cynicism settled on all things big: big media; big business; big
labor; big government.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? It appeared the big shots just did not know what to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to economic wisdom, inflation and unemployment rose at
the same time in the 1970s. Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns,
asked to explain the economy, said, ``The rules are not working the
way they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Big business just did not seem to get it. Auto companies
continued to make fuel guzzlers even as the price of gasoline
skyrocketed and lines of drivers stretched from service stations.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler Corp. eventually had to be bailed out _ by big
government.
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island made us wonder
whether the safe harnessing of nuclear energy _ as an alternative
to foreign oil _ was beyond the reach of American engineers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the media, some reporters, such as Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein, got famous. But many in the public began to resent the
larger media establishment, thinking it was too liberal, too
negative, too smug and way too isolated from rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout lingers. Fifteen percent in The Star poll said they
trusted American corporations ``not at all,'' and 24 percent said
they trusted the news media ``not at all.'' Disillusionment grows
</P>
<P>
   Add it up, and today the 1970s endure as a mutt decade, an
interval of declining expectations in contrast to the oh-so-serious
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   College students in the 1970s did not demonstrate, they
streaked.
</P>
<P>
   Today the decade is played for laughs. There's the Have a Nice
Day Cafe. There's disco. The fashion legacy of the '70s _ just say
the words ``leisure suit'' out loud _ has not aged well.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disillusionment with institutions, especially big and powerful
institutions, had been growing unchecked since the middle 1960s,''
said Todd Gitlin, New York University professor and author of The
Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage.
</P>
<P>
   But if the 1960s sparked skepticism in the Love Generation and
even violence among the extreme left, the 1970s bestowed cynicism
on a much larger demographic.
</P>
<P>
   And since then, much of the distrust and even violence has come
from the extreme right.
</P>
<P>
   Some especially disillusioned people formed their own militias
in response to a government they perceived to be malignant or _ in
the case of the destruction of the Branch Davidian complex in Waco,
Texas, in 1993 by federal officers _ even murderous.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors who convicted Timothy McVeigh for first-degree
murder in the bombing of the federal office building in Oklahoma
City in 1995 _ which killed 168 persons _ said the attack was
planned in retribution for Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Cozad, a Kansas City lawyer and a former chairman of the
Missouri Republican Party, points out that extreme distrust of
government goes back to the beginning of the country. Take the
Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the fever swamps don't just distrust
government,'' Cozad said, ``they have a fundamental psychological
problem with the concept of authority.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also true that the right can feed off distrust of
government, Cozad said. George Wallace received more than 9 million
votes in the 1968 presidential election and was a significant
candidate in 1972 before being shot and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Also, distrust of Washington should not be assumed to be
unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distrust of government was a profoundly rational response to
the data,'' Cozad said. ``People began to come to the perfectly
sensible conclusion that this huge government operated in ways that
it was unwilling to describe to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyndon Johnson was a thorough-going liar and then was followed
by Richard Nixon, who was a thorough-going liar.''
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent Watergate scandal was only the biggest downer in
a decade of full downers. The new stagflation
</P>
<P>
   Economically, times were terrible.
</P>
<P>
   The 1973-74 oil embargo ushered in a recession, the worst
economic crisis in America since Franklin D. Roosevelt was
president. Oil prices almost quadrupled between 1972 and 1974.
</P>
<P>
   By spring 1974, service station attendants _ the people who
pumped your gasoline while you sat in your car _ started carrying
guns for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices fed inflation. And while inflation rose, so did
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Economists, groping for a word, came up with ``stagflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans heard a lot about that. After 1971, when NBC News
installed the first full-time economics correspondent, Americans
became more conversant in the dismal science than ever before. The
dour Irving R. Levine became almost as familiar as Howard Cosell
and _ because of the relentlessly bad tidings he bore _ perhaps
just as beloved.
</P>
<P>
   It was no fun looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   Walk the streets for half a year, trying to find a new career,
the group Tavares sang in the 1975 disco hit, ``It Only Takes a
Minute.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gerald Ford became president in August 1974, the
unemployment rate was 5.3 percent. It reached 9.2 percent in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate personal issues such as finding a job sometimes served
to contain the spirit of the 1960s, said Ruth Shechter of Fairway,
Kan., who helped campaign for public accommodations and fair
housing measures in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Shechter co-founded the Housing Information Center in
Kansas City, which offered housing counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was unemployment, housing discrimination, sexual
discrimination and many other issues,'' Shechter said. ``People
were looking at each of these issues rather than just one single
point. So the energies were diffused, and there wasn't a single
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, politicians in power at the wrong time suffered.
</P>
<P>
   At first Democrats gained: 49 seats in the House and four in the
Senate in the 1974 off-year elections. Two years later Democrats
wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give the Republicans the defeat they so richly deserve,'' said
Rep. Mo Udall of Arizona at the 1976 Democratic Convention in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Voters did, electing outsider Jimmy Carter as president. But
economic conditions remained stubbornly poor. In July 1979, Carter
startled the country when he canceled a planned energy address and
convened a national summit, calling a cross-section of American
leaders to Camp David for 10 days of soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   Carter then descended to announce that the nation was suffering
a ``crisis of confidence.'' The economic program he proposed _
repeated the next day in a Kansas City speech _ included a call for
personal energy conservation and a pledge to reduce oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Iranian demonstrators took U.S. Embassy
workers in Tehran hostage, beginning their 444 days in captivity.
American voters would boot Carter out about a year later.
Environmental concern
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s was not wall-to-wall torment.
</P>
<P>
   The first Earth Day in 1970 served as a symbolic birth for the
budding environmental movement. The apparent scarcity of resources
in the 1970s has resulted in an American citizenry more sensitive
to recycling.
</P>
<P>
   The concept had become so familiar in Kansas City that in 1992,
when local environmental activists attempted to construct a giant
trash turtle, they ran short of old newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, meanwhile _ along with the larger media
establishment _ began to re-invent themselves. Many of the larger
daily papers installed ombudsmen, or reader representatives, to
establish better accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television, which began its penetration of the American
home largely in the 1970s, led to a proliferation of viewing
choices. Although some wondered whether this only served to
fragment the American public into many more ever-smaller interest
groups, others celebrated the new diversity of programming.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of big media to re-establish its grip, meanwhile,
dovetailed with the arrival of the Apple II computer.
</P>
<P>
   As the first mass-produced computer, introduced in 1977, the
Apple II helped spark an information revolution. The widespread
commercial application of microprocessor technology allowed for a
vast amount and diversity of information, entertainment and
electronic commerce in homes, schools and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Media critics throughout the 1990s have occupied themselves by
imagining the ultimate look of the coming ``convergence'' of news,
entertainment and computer technology born in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy skepticism
</P>
<P>
   Despite the litany of plagues from the 1970s, the decade's
ultimate endowment may be positive.
</P>
<P>
   Mild distrust is not so bad if it fosters a reasonable
skepticism about large institutions and their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have taken away naivete, you are much wiser about
people and what people actually do,'' said Frank Smist Jr.,
chairman of the political science department at Rockhurst
University.
</P>
<P>
   But true danger may wait at the place where distrust calcifies
into hardened cynicism, where voters can assume a sinister agenda
behind each act of public policy and simply disengage. Call it
``The truth is out there'' way of looking at the world
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake, Gitlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people think that the lesson of Watergate or Vietnam is
that they shouldn't take politicians seriously, they are gravely
misguided,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior only allows politicians to operate largely free
from any accountability to those that they are supposed to
represent, Gitlin added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distrust by itself is an abdication of responsibility.''

THANKSGIVING BRINGS SMALL TOWN, FOREIGN STUDENTS TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   BURNS, Kan. _ To this town on the western edge of the Flint
Hills on Thanksgiving came Abdullah Al-Shamrani, Karen Chan, Shahid
Hussain, Wael Qassim, and Ahmed Abu Ali.
</P>
<P>
   They were from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan and Hong Kong,
they were students from the University of Kansas, and they stayed
through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For 45 years, turkey and fixings day has meant strangers here,
so much so that a catch phrase is used to describe Burns,
population 285: ``The smallest U.S. community with the biggest
foreign diplomatic service in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, about 500 foreign students from the University
of Kansas have spent their autumn holiday here.
</P>
<P>
   For the students, among two dozen who were scattered around the
state this weekend, the respite from their studies was low-key.
They ate a big dinner on Thursday, got lots of sleep, watched the
ebb and flow of a small town, wondered at the immensity of the
surrounding land, maybe went to a church supper and visited with
their host families. It was informal, relaxed and unscripted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just treat them like they were our own kids,'' said Esta
Hall, who along with her husband, Calvin, has had one or more
foreign students for Thanksgiving dinner and a weekend stay since
1965. ``It's just as if they were home.''
</P>
<P>
   That open-handed Kansas hospitality has been indelibly stamped
in the memories of some of the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burns was the only place in the U.S.,'' wrote a woman who
became an physician in India, ``where I never felt like an animal
in a zoo,'' referring to her colorful sari, unusual looks, and the
expectation in larger venues that her well-meaning hosts would want
some kind of performance, such as a speech.
</P>
<P>
   In Burns, the woman wrote, she could relax, take part in the
town's everyday life, be herself, see part of an America so
different from the big cities or movie screen images, and make
friends with people who, at their core, were pretty much like
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Another student wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good to know you are there instead of in a big city
where life is changing so terribly fast. It is a great
accomplishment what you have done.... You gave of part of you, by
sharing your everyday life with us.''
</P>
<P>
   And another:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come back to Italy I will speak about America. I always
think (sic) Burns, and I'm sure my friends will like Burns. For us
intolerant European and Asiatic people, (Burns) was the best lesson
of tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Burns, just west of U.S. 77, about midway between El
Dorado and Florence has a made a world reputation by just being
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Mention this town and somewhere, somebody will say, ``Ah,
Burns,'' and smile, said Ed Grimwood, a retired hardware store
owner and implement dealer who has traveled to Europe and Latin
America and visited the students who have been here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we meet again it's like we're just one big family,''
Grimwood said. ``Burns, to them, is special.''
</P>
<P>
   That uniqueness started in 1954 when Betty Grimwood, Ed's wife,
read a magazine article about foreign students while waiting in a
doctor's office in El Dorado. When the physician was ready for her,
Grimwood, then 29, laid the magazine aside.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't forget.
</P>
<P>
   Even in rural Kansas, 1954 was a year of uneasiness. Dien Bien
Phu in Indochina had fallen, the Cold War was headed for the deep
freeze and riots outside U.S. embassies were in the newspapers
almost every week. America, to some, had come to be seen as
heavy-handed, insensitive, even bullying.
</P>
<P>
   Grimwood talked to her friend Bonnie Lohrentz. Together the two
women broached an idea to the Women's Society of Christian Service
at the Burns Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   What if, Grimwood and Lohrentz proposed, foreign people could
see that we're all pretty much the same? If they could come here,
we could get to know them and they could get to know us? Wouldn't
that help? At least a little?
</P>
<P>
   Members of the society agreed. But where on earth would the
students come from? U.S. 77 wasn't exactly a magnet for
international traffic. Even the Santa Fe branch line had been gone
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Grimwood, by all accounts a no-nonsense woman, figured if anyone
would know where to find foreign students, it would be the people
up at KU. So she got on the phone and explained the plan. Her
husband recalled that it wasn't quite ``Send me some kids!'' but
her thrust was essentially the same.
</P>
<P>
   KU signed on and recruited the first batch, and Thanksgiving
1954 saw the first arrivals. Others from all over the world _
Africa, Asia, South America, the Pacific Rim _ have followed,
bringing with them a multitude of cultures, languages, skin colors
and religions.
</P>
<P>
   But mainly they bring themselves _ human beings _ which sort of
evens things out, said Ed Grimwood. People are people, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go up and get them in the car,'' Grimwood said. ``Then we
drive back, and we almost always stop at the Matfield Green cattle
pens on the (Kansas) turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Lawrence is kind of eastern, lots of trees, things
close together. But when those kids get out of the car at the pens
you can tell they're looking at more land than most have ever seen
before. And that's kind of our introduction to them of Burns.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first, the goal was to treat the students just like
anybody else. They'd help out with the dinner, maybe pitch in on
the dishes, do what college kids are supposed to do. If they wanted
to milk a cow or ride on a combine, well, that could be arranged.
The whole idea was to get to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   And since 1954, that's been pretty much the way it's worked.
It's not flashy. There's been publicity, but even that has been
muted.
</P>
<P>
   Esta Hall said there have been years when a lot of students have
come and some years when just a few showed up. Bonnie Lohrentz
moved away, and others took her place. The event, known as the
Thanksgiving Homestay Program, expanded to other Kansas
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty was so proud of it,'' Hall said. ``She was our spark
plug. She got it going and stayed with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this year. Betty Grimwood died of cancer in May. To mark
her passing, the event from this year hence will be known as the
Betty Grimwood Thanksgiving Homestay Program, no matter where KU
foreign students spend the holiday, be it Jetmore or Eureka, Derby
or Burns, or any of a half-dozen other towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's meant just as much to us here as it has to the
students,'' said Ed Grimwood, who along with his sons, their wives,
and his grandchildren was host for a foreign student this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just became a part of our lives.''

THERE'S PLENTY IN STORR FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last Tuesday, goalie Jamie Storr was in pain and
the Los Angeles Kings were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches spoke in hushed tones about the right groin he reinjured
in the first period of the team's 5-2 victory over Colorado.
Stephane Fiset was still a few weeks away with a bruised right hand
and minor-league goalies were being asked to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon at the Staples Center, Storr returned to the
lineup with the flair that earned him NHL Player of the Week
earlier this month. He defeated San Jose 4-1, withstanding a
19-shot second period by the Sharks and confounding a team that is
second only to the Kings in goals scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure if I was going to play today,'' said Storr, who
stopped 33 shots to raise his record against San Jose to 6-1. ``But
it was important to me to get back in there. I wanted to be a part
of what's going on. It got better in a hurry and I was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Kings' fear was that Storr has had groin problems
the past few seasons. He went out in the fourth game last season
with a left groin strain and the Kings never recovered. Earlier
this season, he tweaked the right groin and was unavailable to
practice for a week. But when he was injured Tuesday trying to stop
a breakaway by Colorado's Joe Sakic, Storr first admitted it was
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact that the area already was hurt actually helped,''
he said. ``If this had been a new injury I would have been out
three to four weeks. I just knew this one could not get any
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Kings returned from the road Wednesday night, Storr
spent the next two days with trainer Pete Demers and the Kings
medical staff to stretch out the groin and rebuild strength, which
had dropped 80 percent according to coach Andy Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are miracle workers,'' Murray said. ``To get him
back this fast is amazing. Jamie came to me after practice (Friday)
and said he could play. I told him if he thought he could play, I
expected a great game. We certainly got that.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: Kings defenseman Aki Berg, who was benched for
two games earlier this month for poor play, was on the ice for the
Kings' first three goals.... Even though Murray gave the team the
next two days off, Luc Robitaille (broken left foot) will continue
to skate and is expected to return Friday against the Mighty Ducks
in Anaheim.

 &HT;    Jewish group launches anti-hate campaign
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The American Jewish Committee wants you
to know that no one is born hating, and they plan a public
relations blitz to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this week, as part of a national campaign against hate
crimes, various chapters are pinning up posters. The posters
feature babies of differing races and ethnicities happily rolling
together. The photo is accompanied by a list of suggestions for
political and religious leaders, lawmakers, school administrators
and members of the media interested in halting hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach, the posters are following bumper stickers that
the chapter there printed with money given by an anonymous donor
specifically to fight hate crimes. The bumper stickers were
distributed to area law enforcement agencies over the summer and
publicize a toll-free hotline used to report hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's Palm Beach County chapter also has sent a letter
to South Florida congressmen urging new laws that strengthen gun
control and protect minority groups. Many of the area's prominent
lawmakers and educators signed the letter, including Palm Beach
County Schools Superintendent Joan Kowal and Florida Atlantic
University President Anthony Catanese.
</P>
<P>
   The letter refers to several crimes that made national news in
the last year, including the slaying of a gay man in Wyoming and
the Los Angeles shooting at a Jewish Community Center. Organizers
said there are no local crimes fueling the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, not at the moment,'' said William Gralnick,
regional director for the American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Florida began categorizing hate crimes in 1989, defining them as
actions ``that in any way constitute an expression of hatred ...
based on (a victim's) personal characteristics.'' Gralnick said the
committee aims to be proactive rather than wait for additional
problems to arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create an environment that is not conducive to
hate,'' he said.

 &HT;    High prices put damper on New Year's Eve plans
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The big question about New Year's Eve is
not if you'll be able to find a suitably glorious hotel room or
cruise cabin in which to greet the next 1,000 years but which of
the many still-available options you should choose.
</P>
<P>
   Only 33 days before the Big Event, the potential party-goer has
a plethora of great backdrops for singing ``Auld Lang Syne.'' A
spare cabin on the legendary Queen Elizabeth 2 is not a dream but a
reality. There are rooms aplenty at The Breakers and the
Ritz-Carltons in Palm Beach and Naples on the big night.
</P>
<P>
   You heard Disney World was booked? Surprise. Rooms are available
at Disney's Caribbean Beach Hotel, Coronado Springs Hotel and the
Polynesian. There's a three-night minimum, and you have to buy a
package that includes admissions to all four theme parks. Get out
the American Express card _ rates start at $1,122.28 for two adults
(add more for the kids).
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel in New York,
which got a lot of publicity early in the year when it offered the
entire hotel to one celebrant and 181 of his or her closest friends
for a cool $1 million? As the hotel's reservation agent says:
``There were no takers.'' The hotel has vacancies on New Year's Eve
and is offering rooms for $400 per night (a two-night minimum).
</P>
<P>
   Hotel owners, cruise line agents and airline officials are
scratching their heads, puzzling over why consumers aren't rushing
to make sure they have fantastic plans for such a
once-in-a-lifetime event.
</P>
<P>
   What, they want to know, are folks planning to be doing during
the countdown Dec. 31? Watching Dick Clark on TV, for heaven's
sake? Waving sparklers in the back yard?
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say the lack of interest probably is due to one
of two things: People are procrastinating or, more probably, they
are shocked and dismayed by the outrageous prices of rooms and
special events.
</P>
<P>
   If the first theory is true, one day in early or mid-December,
everyone will suddenly pull the trigger and pick up the phone, and
those who are a day late really will be left sitting at home.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Travel Agents, the travel industry's
foremost travel barometer, is going with the second theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the prices were so high that people said, 'No way am I
paying that when I can go two weeks later and pay a third of the
price,''' says ASTA spokeswoman Kristina Rundquist. ``Suppliers
definitely overestimated the overall interest in doing something at
all costs. They think this is the event to die for, but most people
realize it's surrounded by a lot of hype.''
</P>
<P>
   She thinks there will be an upswing of reservations near the end
of the year. ``You might see people holding out for last-minute
bargains, but I think it won't be until after New Year's that
business will pick up _ when prices aren't jacked up 70 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization's 25,600-member travel agents, she says, are
not hearing Y2K fears from clients, especially about flying. In
fact, finding flights for travelers is more difficult than hotel
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem now is getting air reservations to get people to
their hotel rooms,'' she says. ``The holidays traditionally are a
busy time. We have heard some airlines are canceling flights on New
Year's Eve not because of Y2K but because people are already at
their destinations that night.''
</P>
<P>
   As the date draws closer, hotels are scrambling for big-name
entertainment to entice more business. The Ritz-Carlton Palm Beach
has booked comedian Rita Rudner to perform Dec. 31. But Rita is an
expensive date _ the price for dinner and a show in the ballroom is
$895 and that doesn't include a room. There's a three-night minimum
and room rates for those arriving Dec. 30 range from $925 to $4,485
per night. Dinner and champagne at one of the hotel's three
restaurants start at $95 for an early seating. (You'll have to
toast midnight somewhere else.)
</P>
<P>
   Rooms are available, and the hotel managers think they will
fill. ``We expect it's going to click, and people will start making
reservations,'' says Deb Hurd, Ritz-Carlton spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Lou Rawls will be one of the entertainers at the
Ritz-Carlton Naples. The price for a four-night package including
room, shows, a bottle of Taittinger champagne with two Baccarat
flutes, his and hers massages and a New Year's Eve photograph is
$6,800. A variety of rooms is still available.
</P>
<P>
   The Breakers doesn't have a big name act _ a reservations agent
said Drew Carey would perform but a hotel spokesperson said he
wouldn't _ but will have two galas. A two-night package including a
gala and a room is $2,499; a three-night package starting Dec. 30
is $2,999.
</P>
<P>
   And over in the Bahamas, Atlantis _ the mega-resort on Paradise
Island _ has been promoting its millennium events, which include
fireworks and a concert by the Steve Miller Band, for more than a
year and it still has empty rooms. Just the room is $620 per night,
but to see the band and other events plus dinner and a room for two
nights is $2,247.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of Carnival Cruise Lines' 14 ships have cabins available
on special millennium cruises. And there's room at the inns in Las
Vegas, including New York-New York Hotel, which has a three-night
minimum with room rates starting at $579 per night, and that
doesn't include any amenities or shows. The regular rate is $69.
</P>
<P>
   In London, which probably has more millennium festivities than
any other European city, the Dorchester, the city's most elegant
address, and Park Lane Hotel have rooms available on the big night.
</P>
<P>
   And that QE2 millennium cruise: The least expensive available
cabin is $11,400 per person, double, for the Dec. 20 to Jan. 4
cruise from Miami to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   With these prices, a lot of people might elect to stay home,
says ASTA's Rundquist.
</P>
<P>
   And where will she be New Year's Eve? ``At a friend's house for
a masked ball.''

MIAMI BEATS SYRACUSE, 45-13  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A decade so full of glorious achievement is winding to
an ignominious conclusion for Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Every Syracuse football team had a winning record in the 1990s _
81-35-3 in aggregate _ and the decade was punctuated by three Big
East Conference titles and eight bowl games, assuming the Music
City Bowl in Nashville will see a silver lining in Saturday's
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The regular season ended for Syracuse Saturday with a 45-13 rout
by Miami before 35,208 in the Orange Bowl. It left Syracuse at 6-5,
with four losses in its last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Hurricanes, still smarting from last season's
66-13 loss to Syracuse, raised their record to 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no clue how they made us feel last year,'' Miami
defensive tackle Matt Sweeney said of Syracuse. ``We owe them
something big.''
</P>
<P>
   In this season of collapse, the Syracuse defense has been able
to maintain some respectability, ranking ninth nationally in total
defense entering this game.
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday the defense played reasonably well until the
humidity slowly sapped it of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Miami's success in the first half came on breakdowns by
Syracuse's special teams and its offense.
</P>
<P>
   The special teams' giveaways started early. Just 6 minutes 12
seconds into the game, the designated snapper Mike Bennett spotted
the hosts a 2-0 lead when, with Syracuse at its 1-yard line in a
punting situation, he hiked the ball out of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Syracuse defense then held Miami to 2 yards on its next
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over at its 31, Syracuse drove 69 yards in 14 plays to
take a 7-2 advantage, its only lead of the game. Quarterback Troy
Nunes clicked on two passes to Pat Woodcock totaling 24 yards and
tailback James Mungro added an 11-yard run. Fullback Kyle Johnson
scored untouched on a 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Crosland's two missed field goal attempts, from 48 and 29
yards, allowed the Orangemen to maintain their lead until midway
through the second quarter, when costly mistakes changed the
complexion of the game.
</P>
<P>
   First, a 79-yard touchdown pass from Nunes to Woodcock was wiped
out by a holding call on center P.J. Alexander. Two plays later,
Miami's Santana Moss made that mistake hurt a little more. He
returned a punt 61 yards to give the lead back to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Moss swept left, then cut back inside the 20 to score untouched.
The Hurricanes tacked on a 2-point conversion, on freshman Ken
Dorsey's pass over the middle to Andre King, to make it 10-7 with
6:26 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   On their next series, the Orangemen wasted a 29-yard run by
fullback Nick Sudano when Nate Trout's 43-yard field goal attempt
sailed wide right.
</P>
<P>
   Then Miami finally began to flex a little offensive muscle. A
73-yard drive featured Moss' 20-yard reception from Dorsey and
Clinton Portis' 29-yard run, and ended when Dorsey hit split end
Reggie Wayne on 17-yard touchdown pass for a 17-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With Syracuse still in the game, Nunes then gave the Hurricanes
an enormous lift heading into halftime. Cornerback Leonard Myers
stepped in front of Woodcock on a pass by Nunes and returned it 54
yards down the left sideline to make it 24-7 Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The margin only grew in the second half as Miami scored 21
points in the third quarter. Portis scored on a 3-yard run 3:33
into the half, then Moss scored on a 16-yard pass from Dorsey and
tight end Bubba Franks scored on a 17-yard pass, even with
linebacker Morlon Greenwood tipping the ball. Miami had a 45-7 lead
entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse closed the gap on a 1-yard run by Mungro early in the
final period. But by then, it just served to make the final score
look a little less ugly.

CRASH INVESTIGATORS FOCUS ON INSTRUMENTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investigators focused on a pair of tiny gyroscopes on
Saturday as possible factors in the crash of a private plane in
Newark that killed a Maryland family of three and injured 25 people
on the ground as it plunged down a street, broke apart, struck
buildings and cars, and set off fires and explosions.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza plowed through
the largely residential street a mile west of downtown Newark, two
badly burned victims remained in critical condition, dozens of
residents who were displaced from a devastated block faced up to a
week in temporary shelters, and others confronted the loss of their
homes as officials condemned two buildings as structurally unsound.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash that killed the plane's owner-pilot,
Itzhak Jacoby, 56, his wife, Gail, 50, and their daughter Atira,
13, remained undetermined, and officials of the National
Transportation Safety Board said it might take six to nine months
before definitive conclusions could be drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike large airliners, small planes have no flight data
recorders or cockpit voice recorders to provide clues as to why
they crashed. But investigators appeared to be making progress on
Saturday, gathering up most of the plane's wreckage, including
parts of the cockpit control panel, a fuel pump, and a wing part.
</P>
<P>
   They also found two gyroscopes _ devices that help provide
instrument readings to show a pilot how a plane is oriented in foul
weather. Like spinning tops, gyroscopes keep their position no
matter which way a plane is oriented; without them, a pilot caught
in dense fog or a cloud would be flying blind.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the wreckage was taken to a municipal garage for
reassembly, the two gyroscopes, each an inch in diameter, were sent
to the safety board's laboratory in Washington for analysis. But
even if they were faulty, it was unclear what role they might have
played because the weather at the time of the crash was not bad
enough to have disoriented the pilot, one investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby, in three exchanges with air traffic controllers recorded
minutes after his takeoff from Linden Airport eight miles south of
Newark, said he was having problems with instruments, and he
referred specifically to ``gyros.''
</P>
<P>
   Bound for home in Bethesda, Md., after spending Thanksgiving in
New York, Jacoby and his wife and daughter took off at 10:49 a.m.
Friday, despite warnings by airport officials against doing so
because of rain and dense fog that had cut visibility at times to
100 feet. The plane went down six minutes later, and all three were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   David Muzio, an investigator for the safety board, noted on
Saturday that visibility over Newark at the time of the crash was
two and a half miles, and he said there were no indications that
weather was a factor. He also said that there were no signs that
the plane's engine or structural frame were faulty.
</P>
<P>
   The path of debris laid down by the disintegrating plane
measured 600 feet from the first point of impact on a warehouse
roof to the last item of scattered fragments, Muzio added at a
briefing at the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plane's rate of descent had been measured at 7,800
feet per minute, which is a steep dive. A normal rate of descent is
about 1,500 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Muzio said the yoke _ the pilot's steering wheel _ was turned
over to the Essex County Sheriff's Department for fingerprint
analysis, mainly to confirm that Jacoby was at the controls. The
investigator stressed that there was no implication that Jacoby's
wife or daughter was believed to be at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings of Jacoby's conversations with controllers at
Newark International Airport might be crucial clues. Jacoby, who
had filed a required plan for an instrument-assisted flight to
Dulles International Airport in Virginia, told controllers less
than 90 seconds after takeoff that he was having trouble. Muzio
said on Friday night that the pilot had cited difficulty with a
``gyro,'' mentioning it three times.
</P>
<P>
   Various government agencies were supporting the safety board
investigation, along with representatives of the companies that
manufactured the engine, frame, and other parts of the Beechcraft
Bonanza, a four-seat plane with a V-shaped tail, a 285-horsepower
engine, and capable of speeds up to 200 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Two people who were severely burned on the ground remained in
critical condition at University Hospital in Newark. Albert Walker,
59, had burns over 15 percent of his body, and Rhonda Acey, 29, had
extensive second- and third-degree burns.
</P>
<P>
   More than 75 residents displaced from Kent Street, where the
plane fell and broke apart, were evacuated on Friday and put up at
a Salvation Army center a mile away. They were not allowed to move
back in to homes that had been damaged by flames and blasts from
exploding cars.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Sharpe James, taking reporters on a tour, said that two
buildings that had housed several families had been condemned as
structurally unsound. Temporarily, he said, some of the displaced
would be put up at a hotel in nearby Orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm homeless now,'' said Theresa Gates, 28, of 23 Kent Street,
one of the condemned buildings. ``They're tearing down my building
with most of my stuff in there. I've struggled and worked for
everything I have, and now my home is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said that other multifamily buildings on the
street would have to be cleared by city inspectors over the coming
week before any of their residents would be allowed back in.
</P>
<P>
   After city inspectors found no serious structural problems with
the four buildings at 8, 10, 12 and 14 Kent Street, the mayor said
their residents would be allowed to return as early as Monday or
Tuesday after gas, water, and electrical lines could be turned back
on.
</P>
<P>
   Workers on Saturday began to raze a three-story warehouse that
was the first structure to be hit by the plane and set afire. The
aircraft then plunged down on Kent Street, where it struck nine
cars and set them ablaze. The gas tanks of most later exploded,
damaging the multifamily homes lining the street.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the block, the plane sideswiped a KFC restaurant
and broke apart. The bodies of its occupants were hurled out onto a
parking lot, and the plane's fiery debris shot across Springfield
Avenue, a commercial thoroughfare, and came to rest on sidewalks
and side streets, in yards and vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost three lives, but it could have been a lot worse,''
James said. He said that lives had undoubtedly been spared because
a nearby preschool had been closed for the long Thanksgiving
weekend, and that a fast-food restaurant struck by the plane had
not been open.
</P>
<P>
   The crash site on Saturday was a scene of terrible devastation:
the hulks of mangled, burned-out cars that had been set afire, the
shattered houses with windows and doors agape, blood spattered on
the wall of the restaurant and its parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks were cordoned off with yellow police tape to keep
out curiosity seekers, but some residents were allowed into their
homes briefly to retrieve belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Gennie Holpe, of 14 Kent Street, said as she returned for
clothing that she had spent a sleepless night on a cot at the
Salvation Army center, tormented by the recollection of the bodies
she had seen. ``I can't even sleep,'' she said. ``I'm a woman of
God, and I'm trying to be strong. But you can't even imagine
something like this. It was like a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rosella Reese, 84, the owner of 27 Kent Street, who had been
forced temporarily out of a home she had lived in for 43 years,
voiced sorrow for the dead and for her devastated street. ``This
pilot took his whole family,'' she said, ``and destroyed this
community with it.''

BROADCAST OF MAN'S DEATH REKINDLES A DEBATE IN LOS ANGELES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The year after a suicide broadcast on live
television prompted soul-searching and public apologies from news
directors, five Southern California stations showed a car chase on
Friday that ended with the man being shot to death by police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The man, whose identity was not released on Saturday by the
authorities, led the police and state highway patrol officers on a
200-mile, three-hour chase from San Bernardino County to San Diego,
where he was shot after emerging from his car with a handgun aimed
at officers, the San Diego Police Department said. The department
said the chase began at 6:45 a.m. after a sheriff's deputy tried to
stop a white 1979 Datsun 280Z with expired registration tags.
</P>
<P>
   Many stations covered the chase from news helicopters as part of
their regular morning broadcasts. Three stations in Los Angeles _
NBC affiliate KNBC, Fox affiliate KTTV, and WB affiliate KTLA _ and
two stations in San Diego, KFMB and KNSD, carried the story to its
conclusion on the day after Thanksgiving, when children were out of
school.
</P>
<P>
   The coverage, which came with less than a week to go in the
November sweeps period that will be used to determine stations'
advertising rates, once again highlights the debate over ethical
standards for television news in a region that has come to rely on
helicopters as a staple of the broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, news directors from some of the stations said they
were performing a public service by informing viewers about a
dangerous chase on California highways and said they acted
responsibly by pulling away to a wide angle as the man emerged from
his car holding a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the individual got out of the car, they pulled way back
to a wide shot,'' said John Frenzel, the director of programming at
Fox. ``Given the circumstances, that seemed like using our best
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all stations in the area thought it was a large enough
story to supersede normal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   KCBS, which was broadcasting its national morning news program,
broke in with occasional reports on the chase but did not carry it
all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that some bad guy's running away from policemen is
not a huge surprise,'' said Roger Bell, the news director of KCBS.
``I think we know they're going to end badly.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, Daniel V. Jones, apparently distraught over his
treatment by a health maintenance organization, set himself and his
dog on fire on a freeway and later shot himself in the head with a
shotgun. Stations that showed live coverage received calls from
angry viewers.
</P>
<P>
   KNBC received 2,000 complaints in that instance, but that
station had the closest image of the shooting on Friday, according
to The Los Angeles Times. Managers at the station declined to
comment on Saturday.

EARLY GAMES REVEAL SOME SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're almost at the quarter-pole in the 1999-2000 NBA season and
it's a good time to take a look at some of the surprising and
disappointing teams in the league. The Celtics, of course, have to
be considered something of a surprise, although Rick Pitino would
tell you he knew all along that it'd be thus.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have some company in the upside department. Here, in
no particular order, are some teams who will not want to see
November end.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Sonics have had an incredibly soft schedule in
terms of competition _ their toughest road game has been at Phoenix
_ but they've also had success on the road. They are getting a big
lift from two newcomers, Vernon Maxwell and Ruben Patterson (the
Western Conference's version of Adrian Griffin). By the end of this
week, however, they'll have played the Clippers three times, the
Warriors twice, and their early Eastern swing was hardly taxing. We
also should note that Gary Payton has brought his A game.
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO: We figured the Kings would be better. They got off
to a ridiculous start in part because they've played only two
non-Japan road games so far. And those were in Texas against
Houston and Dallas. And their Arco Arena wins: Utah, Denver,
Vancouver, Houston, New Jersey, and Golden State. So we'll reserve
judgment until they come back from their Eastern swing, when they
play Miami, Orlando, Atlanta, Washington, and New Jersey. Then they
go back home and face the Lakers, Heat, and Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI: The story here is the resuscitation of Jamal Mashburn.
He's playing as well as any small forward in the league and has
responded wonderfully to the new rules and Pat Riley's Showtime II.
The big unknown is whether Mashburn can stay healthy. If he can,
the Heat will remain the East's best team and possibly make it out
of the first round of playoffs. It also doesn't hurt that Alonzo
Mourning and Tim Hardaway are playing as if they know this might be
their year.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there are teams that will be happy to move into a new
month, although for a couple, it may already be too late.
</P>
<P>
   NEW JERSEY: Maybe we had the Nets overrated coming into the
season, but two wins in their first 12 games? It'd be nice if Don
Casey had his full roster, although expectations will be huge for a
quick U-turn. And what has happened to Keith Van Horn? The guy
looks as if he went to Antoine Walker's Shot School. It'd also be
nice if Kerry Kittles sucked it up and Stephon Marbury realized
that numbers don't make the player.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: A revolution is brewing, and Rudy Tomjanovich is
sticking with his old, loyal generals instead of his new, brash
recruits. The Rockets need to decide what team they're going to be.
The one problem is that Houston has lost a lot of home games, and
it's always difficult to get it back on the road. Maybe the voters
of Houston knew what lay ahead when they rejected a new arena
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA: After their Thanksgiving loss at home to Detroit (their
second in Conseco Fieldhouse), Jalen Rose said the Pacers were
``awful.'' He said they were playing like ``garbage'' (the refuse,
not the band). They looked awful against the Celtics because they
showed up and did very little extra, including rebounding. They
have to come to grips with Rik Smits, who can't play a speed game
anymore. And what has happened to Reggie Miller's shooting eye?
These guys can't be dismissed, but they're losing games they didn't
lose in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery redux
</P>
<P>
   From the Don't Rub It In Dept.: When the Spurs were in town last
week, we asked Gregg Popovich to go back to May of 1997 when the
futures of two franchises were determined by bouncing lottery
balls. Popovich said before the Tim Duncan Lottery, he had a
special task for assistant Mike Budenholzer: make up lineups and
put them on wooden boards for the Spurs with the names of likely
draftees. Then, match those lineup boards against other teams in
the Western Conference. The Spurs figured they'd get a top three
pick; they had the third-worst record in the league behind
Vancouver and Boston. So Budenholzer put Van Horn's name on the
list and matched it up against other teams. ``There was another
guy, too,'' Popovich said. But it wasn't Duncan. ``We didn't even
bring his name up,'' Popovich said. Then came the lottery. And all
those boards that Budenholzer had painstakingly made? ``He asked me
what to do with them,'' Popovich said. ``I told him to use it as
firewood.'' The Spurs never worked out Duncan or brought him in for
the obligatory interview. Hardly anyone even bothered to call and
inquire about Duncan's availability. ``Rick (Pitino) called about
10 minutes after the lottery, which I expected,'' Popovich said.
``I would have done the same thing. He offered me his team, his
horses, anything. But there were other times when someone would
call and start talking and we both just started laughing.''
Popovich said he went to St. Croix for a week and knew what he had
when he discussed the Utah Summer League with Duncan. ``I told him
it would help him with things like illegal defenses, getting to
know our coaches, our system, and a general introduction to the
NBA. He said, `If it'll help me, I'll be there.' That's what I knew
what I had.'' Popovich also saw the no-flash, no-frills Duncan in
one game against Portland. ``He got a shot blocked by (Kelvin)
Cato, who knocked it into the 15th row, and then (Cato) did all
this jumping around and dancing,'' said Popovich. ``Tim's
expression never changed. Then, later in the game, Tim sent one of
Cato's shots into the 15th row and his expression still didn't
change. I knew he was special then.'' . . . Stanley Roberts played
with Shaquille O'Neal in college and for a handful of teams in an
otherwise uninspired NBA career. But he'll be known more for two
things: his weight and his expulsion from the league for failing a
drug test. Roberts is the first player to be banished since the NBA
and the Players Association agreed to increase the number of banned
substances. The league said Roberts was found to have an
amphetamine-based designer drug in his system. In an interview with
a Houston television station, Roberts said he never took a designer
drug and was not given a re-test. The league said he was re-tested
and failed that as well (Roberts said the same sample was used).
``This is a tragic thing,'' Sixers coach Larry Brown said. ``This
is really a disappointment.'' . . . The Sixers called up Kevin
Ollie to take the spot of the injured Allen Iverson. If nothing
else, the injury will eliminate the problem Brown faced in trying
to pair Iverson with Larry Hughes. Now he can put Hughes in at
shooting guard and the kid will get a chance to show his stuff. A
lot of people think he has a lot of stuff to show. The Celtics
considered signing Ollie before they went out and got Doug Overton
. . . Iverson, by the way, is on the cover of the latest Sporting
News. In the article, which talks about the new rules benefitting
Iverson's style, the Answer says, ``The only person who can stop me
is me, if I take bad shots'' _ which he does ``or rush things'' _
which he also does. ``But no individual in this league can stop
me.'' But a broken thumb can . . . Jim McIlvaine was on the Nets
last year when they started 2-10, and this year's team was 2-10
after a victory Wednesday over Golden State. ``I think the attitude
is better this year,'' McIlvaine said. ``We have guys who are still
doing the extra work, the lifting, things like that. That's
encouraging. But we do miss Jayson (Williams), his energy, his
enthusiasm. It's just a big, gaping hole that won't be filled until
he comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Slow time for Mullin
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McHale went out this way and didn't like it. Chris Mullin,
also one of the NBA's Top 50, is now, basically, an afterthought in
the Indiana rotation. But McHale's dwindling minutes in his final
year were due as much to injuries as declining skills. Mullin is
healthy and can still shoot, but he has been relegated to DNP
status on a number of occasions because he can't beat out Rose or
Al Harrington. ``This is something everyone goes through at some
point in their career,'' he said. ``I want to handle this thing the
same way I handled things when I was averaging 25 a game for the
Warriors and leading the league in minutes. There was someone
behind me back then and now I'm the one behind them. But the kids
are playing well, they're open to instruction and work, and that
makes it more enjoyable. It's easier when you're around guys with
that kind of attitude. Right now, it's working. But I'm in shape
and I'll be ready.'' . . . The Knicks' horrific schedule (13 of
their first 18 on the road) improves this week with roadies in
Milwaukee and across the Hudson against the Nets. They went 2-3 out
West and returned to find that Larry Johnson, who missed some of
the trip, will be out a while longer with back woes. LJ says he'll
be back in a couple weeks after undergoing steroid treatments. If
that doesn't work, he may need surgery. Patrick Ewing, meanwhile,
is hoping to be back by Christmas. The Knicks are playing the way
they did for most of last season: fractured, disjointed, aimless.
Latrell Sprewell got revenge of sorts when the Knicks won in Golden
State last weekend. But he also was fined $10,000 for swearing at
fans . . . You could have made some serious change had you walked
into a parlor in Vegas and put some money on Bob Sura and Brevin
Knight being the starting backcourt in Cleveland. Sura, of course,
was Fratello non grata but has been liberated by the new rules and
a new coach. Knight was _ and always will be _ undersized and is
entering free agency. The Cavs even drafted Andre Miller to protect
themselves in the event Knight could not be re-signed (and, of
course, because Miller was a logical pick at that spot). Knight won
the job hands-down in training camp, has improved his shooting
dramatically, and has seen his game improve with the new rules. So,
can we establish that Knight is a keeper? Not in his mind. ``I have
to prove it every year. Next year, there'll be different questions
and I'll have to do it all over again,'' he said. ``That's how I
look at it. I've been proving it all my life. You have to do that
until you become the best, or are considered one of the best. Until
that happens, you're always going to have to prove something. I
know what I need to do to make us win, to make us go. I know what I
need to do to make me successful. So that's all I worry about.''

PATRIOTS HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Something has always seemed to click in
these back-to-the-wall situations the past two seasons. The
Patriots respond to the gloom and doom with victories. They go from
bums to contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Twice they have resurrected themselves from ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Can this collection of underachievers rebound against Buffalo
and save their playoff hopes a third time in three years after the
midseason mark?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it in the past, but if we don't do it Sunday, it
won't mean anything,'' said Larry Whigham, who as an emotional
leader on the field is often a good judge of the team's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't accept losing here. We might lose for a few games,
but we don't continue it. We have too much pride. There's too much
athleticism here for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Whigham said the Patriots had an intense week of practice. Not
overly tough. Nobody was heaving buckets. He called it ``intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll said Thursday and Friday were intense, with
Thursday having a lot of ``hard hitting.'' But Wednesday's practice
didn't meet his standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look around this locker room,'' said Whigham after
Friday's practice, ``nobody is panicking. Everybody, to a man,
knows what has to happen. We know because we've been through it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. A brief history:
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Carroll era starts with amazing success, as the
Patriots roll to a 4-0 start and get to 5-1 before the tumbling
begins. A 24-19 loss to the Jets at the Meadowlands in the second
Tuna Bowl is the first of three consecutive losses. The hex is
broken by beating the Bills, 31-10, to go to 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the Mosh Pit incident, which precedes a 27-7
thrashing by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. At 6-5, the Patriots are in
third place behind the 7-4 Dolphins and Jets, one game ahead of
Buffalo at 5-6.
</P>
<P>
   With backs against the wall, the Patriots respond by beating
Miami, 27-24. Then they eke out a 20-17 victory over Indianapolis.
Miami knocks off Oakland and the Jets begin their swoon with a loss
to Buffalo. There is a three-way tie for first place at 8-5 among
the Patriots, Dolphins, and Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins and Patriots keep pace the following week, the
Patriots winning at Jacksonville, 26-20. Both lose their
next-to-last games of the year, and then in the final week, the
Patriots win at Miami, 14-12, to take the division title with a
10-6 record. They beat Miami again in the wild-card game before
succumbing to Pittsburgh, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Patriots start 4-1 before sinking to 5-5 at their
lowest moment. Injuries had mounted by this time, and New England
was in fourth place. Talk of firing Carroll is at an all-time high,
but once again the Patriots save the coach and their self-respect
with three straight wins, starting with a 26-23 victory over Miami
on a Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The streak ends with a loss to St. Louis, in a game they
expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   With Drew Bledsoe out with a fractured index finger, the
Patriots face a desperate situation _ having to beat the 11-3 San
Francisco 49ers with Scott Zolak to qualify for the playoffs. They
win with three seconds left on Adam Vinatieri's 35-yard fied goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots finish fourth but make the playoffs. Without
Bledsoe and other injured players, they do not get past the
wild-card round, losing to Jacksonville, 25-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the same situation two years ago, against
Buffalo,'' recalled Carroll. ``Same thing. I wish we didn't do it
this way, but this is what we're faced with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The core guys around here have been through adversity and know
how to deal with it,'' said defensive end Ferric Collons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of making plays. Nobody is scared or nervous. We
had the same season last year, slowed down a little bit, and then
picked it back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we have lulls? I don't know. I think this team has the
best talent in the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we can come back from terrible odds shows the talent.
Call it luck. We win games when we're supposed to and other times
we shoot each other in the foot. We go out there and self-destruct
and then we look at the film and there's no way the other team
should be able to do what they do against us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a week when the Patriots needed to be extra serious, they had
two players, Lawyer Milloy and Vincent Brisby, involved in a
scuffle at a nightclub, and another, Terry Glenn, late for practice
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to the radio and I hear people saying this team has
been torn apart by dissension,'' said defensive tackle Chad Eaton.
``Well, that's not true. Everybody in this organization wants to
win. I don't see it coming apart for us. The coaches are putting us
in position to make plays and we've just got to deliver.''

BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS IN THE CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On those days when he would head over to Bass River to hit
balls, Jason Caron would hope to run into Jim Hallet. ``He was my
idol. I'd watch him chip and putt for hours,'' said Caron.
</P>
<P>
   Hallet's hard work and gift for golf led to a few years of glory
on the PGA Tour until hand injuries took their toll. The pride of
South Yarmouth took a few years off, then tried to revive his pro
golf career at the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament this fall. Though
he failed to make it through the first stage, Hallet can be given
credit for lending inspiration to one who made it all the way:
Caron.
</P>
<P>
   His was perhaps the longest of long-shot stories at last week's
final stage. Caron, 27, was just another titanium-carrying young
gun who was supposed to collapse at the first scent of pressure. He
was from the Hooters Tour. No PGA Tour experience. Heck, no Nike
Tour experience. Just how was he going to survive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I got down there and told myself it was just another
tournament,'' said Caron. ``I just focused on golf, and in the back
of my mind I told myself to just play the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   His best was just good enough. He finished the six rounds at 8
under par, which was the cut line. The kid from Dennis-Yarmouth
High School was in the last group of qualifiers, one of just 40
golfers to earn a coveted PGA Tour card for next year. You could
not even have been quoted odds on that happening just a few weeks
ago, when Caron was one of nearly 2,000 young men who carried a
crazy dream in a bag along with 14 golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't think you can make it,'' said Caron.
``I'm proof that dreams come true.''
</P>
<P>
   And how truly well he played.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 40 golfers who earned their cards at the Doral Resort in
Miami, Caron was one of the few who had to play his way through the
first and second stages.
</P>
<P>
   Four rounds at Jennings Mill GC in Bogart, Ga.: 71-71-67-70_279.
Tied for sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Four rounds at Kiva Dunes in Gulf Shores, Ala.: 71-69-72-70_282.
Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Six rounds at Doral: 68-69-70-70-67-68_412. Tied for 35th.
</P>
<P>
   Toss all the numbers together and you get a ticket to the big
leagues and a chance to walk the fairways in Tiger Woods's
monstrous shadow. But before rushing forward, stop and ponder the
remarkable stretch of golf Caron just played. In 14 rounds of
tournament golf, he never once shot over par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the first group (on the final day at Doral) so when I
finished, I sat around a long time,'' said Caron, whose brother
Nate caddied for him. For much of the sixth day, it appeared that 9
under was the magic number, but nerves being what they are, the bad
shots piled up late in the day and 8 under got in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I birdied nine and 10,'' said Caron, who graduated in 1994
from Charleston Southern University in South Carolina, ``but made a
double at the 12th to fall back to 6 under.'' But birdies at the
13th and 16th got him to 8 under, and when he parred in, the long,
agonizing wait was on.
</P>
<P>
   When he had made it, Caron couldn't help but think of Hallet,
and of the people at Bass River and Bayberry, those Yarmouth
courses where he had spent so many countless hours. He was never
high-profile on the state amateur scene, but always he had the
dream, and ``there are so many people (on the Cape) who have been
very good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls came from friends and well-wishers (including
Hallet's father), and Caron will attempt to offer thanks in person
when he comes home for Christmas. The stay, however, will be short
and sweet, for duty calls and there will be long practice sessions
down South in preparation for a most improbable date with the 2000
PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy endings
</P>
<P>
   Caron's was one of the nice tales from the Q School finale, but
there were some horrors. None more disheartening than Jaxon
Brigman. He finished at 8 under thanks to a sterling 5-under 65 and
was accepting congratulations for earning his card. Then an
official asked him why he signed for a 66. Brigman was in shock.
Indeed, he had signed a scorecard that said he shot 66. Because it
was higher than what he had actually shot, he had to accept the
score, which put him at 7 under and onto the BUY.com Tour next
year. Next tale of woe belongs to Vic Wilk, who came to the tee on
his 108th hole at 9 under and probably thought he needed a par to
secure his card. But he hooked his drive into trees, and instead of
playing it safe and possibly making bogey (which would have got him
in at 8 under), Wilk gambled. He tried to hook a shot around trees
onto an island green, but it never took the big turn, landing in
the water. He made a double-bogey and missed the cut at 7 under.
Then there was Brian Tennyson, who was 10 under through 15, only to
finish bogey, three-putt bogey, double-bogey, and miss out at 6
under. Brian Claar was 9 under until a double-bogey at the 17th
left him holding a pass to the BUY.com Tour . . . It wasn't under a
blazing spotlight, but Melanie Curtin had her own challenge at a
qualifying tournament to secure a spot on the Futures Tour. The
28-year-old Weymouth native didn't know what to expect in Lakeland,
Fla., last week and she was surprised at the depth when she
arrived. ``I looked up on the putting green and said, `That looks
like Jenny Chuasiriporn,' '' said Curtin, who blossomed on the WGAM
scene the last two summers. Indeed, Chuasiriporn, like Curtin, was
trying for a spot on this training ground for future LPGA Tour
players. The 1998 US Women's Open runner-up finished in a tie for
fifth to breeze, while Curtin, after a 70-75 start, fell back to an
80-77, but still earned full-time playing status for next year.
``I'm hoping to have two good years on the Futures Tour and move
onto the LGPA Tour,'' said Curtin, who entered the tournament as an
amateur but will now turn pro. ``I'm committing myself to a full
schedule, but not expecting too much the first year.'' . . .
Remember Philip Walton? He secured the stunning Ryder Cup victory
for Europe at Oak Hill in 1995 with a singles win over Jay Haas,
but the fame was certainly short-lived. He plummeted to 92d on the
Order of Merit the next year, was 66th in 1997 and 1998, and his
best tournament finish in 1999 was 35th, which gives a hint as to
why he was back at Tour School last week. Alas, his struggles
continued as the 37-year-old Irishman finished 77th in the
six-round test at Sotogrande, Spain. Needless to say, he won't have
his card next year, thanks in large part to scores of 77, 78, and
81. Other veteran Europeans who failed at the final of Q School
included Stuart Cage and Paul Way, who as a 20-year-old made the
European Ryder Cup team in 1985. Trevor Immelman, a promising
youngster from South Africa, was another failure at the European Q
School, but 1998 British Open sensation Justin Rose prevailed with
a tie for third. Since turning pro after nearly winning that Open
at Royal Birkdale, Rose has rarely made a cut and he failed to gain
his card at last year's qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   She will be missed
</P>
<P>
   It was strictly for fun, a little game of word association with
Arnold Palmer. Pebble Beach. Augusta. The Masters. For everything
thrown out, he was quick with a reply. Then they threw at him the
words ``Winnie Palmer'' and, without missing a beat, he said: ``She
let me be Arnold Palmer.'' Indeed, his wife was the greatest part
of his life and he never hesitated to tell you that. When she died
last Saturday at 65 after a battle with cancer, it was a terrible
loss for the game's greatest ambassador, and for the many people
who had enjoyed her company through the years. People like Richard
Connolly of Concord, who has enjoyed a longtime friendship with
Palmer and was among those who attended the funeral service last
Monday. ``The theme of the service was `smile, be happy, and try to
help people,' '' said Connolly. ``That's the way she was. She was
so special.'' A few winters ago, more than a thousand people turned
out for a Ouimet Scholarship dinner to honor the King, and at a
private reception, which was wall-to-wall with Boston business
leaders, a gentleman seemed a bit frantic. A woman asked him what
was wrong, and he proceeded to tell her how busy the day had been,
what with meetings with bosses and no time for lunch. Relax and get
a drink, she said, and the man did just that. When he returned, he
discovered that the woman had retrieved some hors d'oeuvres.
Thankful, he extended his hand and introduced himself. ``Nice to
meet you,'' the woman said. ``I'm Winnie Palmer.'' . . . What many
people never realized was that while Palmer and Jack Nicklaus
carried on a heated rivalry on the golf course, their wives
developed a close friendship. Barbara Nicklaus told reporters that
recently, while sweating out a hurricane at their home in Southern
Florida, she received a call from Winnie, who, despite more
pressing concerns, was offering her wishes and prayers . . . The
Nicklauses had faithfully watched all five rounds of son Gary's
effort in the final stage of tour qualifying, but missed the sixth
when they went to Latrobe, Pa., for the funeral. What a round they
missed. Gary, 30, shot a 63, tied for 12th, and easily qualified
for his PGA Tour card in 2000. He had failed nine other years to
make it through Q School and his proud father told reporters:
``I've been telling Gary all along that he's a lot better player
than he gives himself credit for being.'' Locally, golf fans got to
see just how good the kid is when he was paired with his father in
the CVS Charity Classic at Rhode Island CC in Barrington in August.
On the first day, Gary won a skins pool and veteran PGA Tour stars
were telling observers how impressed they were with the youngster.
</P>
<P>
   The rich get richer
</P>
<P>
   You perhaps were thinking of getting Woods a Christmas present,
perhaps a golf bag emblazoned with ``Buick'' on its side? Forget
it. He's already got a bunch of them on order _ thanks to an
endorsement deal that is reportedly worth $10 million-$15 million
through 2001. Part of the deal calls for Woods to play in six of
eight Buick events over the two seasons (the company sponsors four
a year), which brings up an interesting question. Woods has been
adamant about resting the week before major tournaments, but that
will have to change this year because the Buick Classic
(Westchester, N.Y.) is the week before the US Open and the Buick
Open (Grand Blanc, Mich.) leads into the PGA Championship. Assuming
Woods plays the Buick Invitational in February (he's the defending
champ and loves Torrey Pines in San Diego) and the Buick Challenge
in September, it stands to reason that he'll have to choose between
playing before the Open or the PGA. A guess: Woods will rest before
the US Open at Pebble Beach and play the Buick Open the week prior
to the PGA at Valhalla since Michigan-to-Kentucky isn't as taxing .
. . Thomas Bjorn's playoff victory over Sergio Garcia at the Dunlop
Phoenix tournament in Japan may have barely registered on the radar
screen, but it had major implications _ as in a trip to Augusta for
the Dane. It moved Bjorn to 39th (he had been 55th) in the world
rankings, and the Top 50 get invited to play in the Masters . . .
The Golf Channel is a must for any diehard fan, but it is
especially crucial during the winter when events such as this
weekend's Holden Australian Open are shown live. Monday night, Dana
Quigley will appear on TGC's ``Golf Talk Live,'' from 8 to 9 . . .
Jim Maddalena, the assistant pro at Willowbend in Mashpee, has been
on a pretty good roll. He won three straight events in the Cape Cod
Pro-Am League and is in a tight battle with Jeff Bailey for the
Sullivan Award.

BAD SIGNS IN SCOUTING DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In yet another sign that all is not well within the ranks of the
Red Sox scouting department, Luke Wrenn, the scout credited with
signing Nomar Garciaparra, has resigned to take a position with the
Arizona Diamondbacks. Wrenn was hired by Mike Rizzo, a former Sox
area scout who is now the scouting director for the Diamondbacks.
Wrenn is merely the latest scout to leave the Sox fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've written to the management in Boston,'' Wrenn said. ``They
know why I'm leaving. I'll leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrenn, who will remain in the same area (scouting central and
northern Florida for the Diamondbacks), acknowledged that he was
frustrated that the Sox failed to sign players that were drafted
from his area last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frustrated that we were unable to sign my guys we had
drafted seventh, 16th, and 26th,'' said Wrenn, who had scouted 26th
pick Marshall McDougall, the Florida State second baseman who hit
an NCAA-record six home runs in one game last season. ``But that
was this year's frustration. To me, it was just the last straw.
They knew I was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of my mind I was hoping that I could stay, and
under certain conditions I would have stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   What Wrenn would not say is that there clearly was a conflict
with Sox scouting director Wayne Britton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of guys who have left,'' Wrenn said.
``But as long as Boston keeps playing well, you're not going to
hear much about it. We are about the farthest people away from
Boston, but area scouts are some of your hardest-working people,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Headed for trouble

   Remember that head-first slide Kenny Lofton made into first base
in Game 5 of the Division Series? He suffered a dislocated left
shoulder, and now the Indians fear there may be rotator cuff damage
that could sideline him until June. That could leave the Tribe
scrambling for a leadoff man and center fielder. Lofton is
scheduled to see Dr. James Andrews for a second opinion this week .
. . It will cost more _ a lot more _ to have a good seat at Dodger
Stadium next season, to watch a team that is drawing ever closer to
having a $100 million payroll. Price of a premium seat in Chavez
Ravine has gone up 43 percent, from $28 to as much as $40. It will
still be possible to buy some seats in the upper deck and bleachers
for as little as $6 . . . The Rockies also raised ticket prices for
the third time since moving into Coors Field. The increases average
4 percent . . . The Dodgers, who probably won't know until next
month the outcome of Major League Baseball's investigation into
whether they signed third baseman Adrian Beltre as an underage
player, are distancing themselves from Tommy Lasorda's charge that
there are ``50 players in the major leagues that have been signed
illegally.'' But given the ease with which false birth documents
can be obtained in countries such as the Dominican Republic, where
such record-keeping is haphazard at best, what some may dismiss as
an emotional outburst from the volatile Lasorda may be closer to
the truth than those in the game care to acknowledge. Under current
rules, teams cannot sign a player in draft-exempt countries, like
the Dominican, until age 16, with the added provision that the
player must be 17 by the time he completes his first professional
season. There is incentive for both players from impoverished
circumstances and teams eager to grab top talents to cheat. As
difficult as it may be for MLB to verify a player's age, some sort
of monitoring system must be put in place. In Beltre's case, agent
Scott Boras is accusing the Dodgers of knowingly signing the player
before his 16th birthday and attempting to have the third baseman
declared a free agent . . . Bill Russell, who succeeded Lasorda as
Dodger manager and then was fired two years later, has made it back
to the big leagues as the third base coach of the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays. Russell managed the Devil Rays' Double A affiliate in Orlando
to the Southern League title last season . . . Blue Jays manager
Jim Fregosi is ready to take on all comers who are ripping Toronto
for its trades of outfielder Shawn Green to the Dodgers and pitcher
Pat Hentgen to the Cardinals. ``My only concern is how Raul
(Mondesi) is portrayed in this city and if they take it out on
him,'' Fregosi said of the outfielder who came to the Blue Jays
from the Dodgers. ``I don't think that's fair. Let them take it out
on me. I'll take the heat. In my estimation, Mondesi is a very
talented player who plays the game as hard as anybody.'' Meanwhile,
Blue Jays fans already barbecuing GM Gord Ash are ready to pounce
again if slugger Carlos Delgado becomes the next to leave . . .
Tuffy Rhodes, who made a cameo appearance for the Red Sox in 1995,
led the Japan Pacific League in home runs with 40, runs with 94,
and RBIs with 101 while playing for Kintetsu.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions to the number
</P>
<P>
   Clip and save: Pedro and Ramon Martinez will go 30-12 between
them next season, according to projections made by Stats Inc.,
which acknowledges that pitching projections are trickier than
those for position players. Pedro the Younger will go 19-5 with a
2.21 ER1, while Ramon will go 11-7 with a 3.44 ERA. The Stats folks
are predicting another big year for Garciaparra, too: .319, 33 home
runs, and 111 RBIs, and another sub-.300 year for Mo Vaughn (.296,
34 home runs, 106 RBIs). Vaughn hit .281 last season, only .258
against righthanders, against whom his ankle injury bothered him
most. Vaughn was still tough with runners in scoring position,
batting .348 (46 for 132), though Angels fans might be hard-pressed
to come up with one big hit during a misbegotten '99 season. Stats
also gives Mark McGwire a 32 percent chance of finishing his career
with 800 home runs, with Ken Griffey having a slightly better
chance (34 percent) . . . Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez are the
only active pitchers averaging double figures in strikeouts per
nine innings. Johnson has 10.77 whiffs per nine innings, Martinez
10.16. Hideo Nomo, surprisingly, is third at 9.66, with Roger
Clemens fourth at 8.62. Clemens is the active leader in wins (247),
starts (479), innings (3,462 1/3), complete games (115), shutouts
(45), strikeouts (3,316), and hit batsmen (114) . . . Further ammo
for those arguing that Fenway Park's infield ranks among the worst
in the league: The Sox last season made 17 more infield errors at
home than on the road (56 to 39) and the opponents' fielding was
worse, too (42 errors in Fenway, 31 on their home fields). No AL
team made more infield errors at home last season than the Sox. In
the last three years, the Sox have made 159 infield errors at home,
131 on the road. Opponents have made 116 at Fenway, 109 in their
home parks . . . Reliever Russ Springer, who went to the World
Series with Atlanta, was happy to return last week to the team that
traded him to the Braves, the Diamondbacks. Springer, who signed a
two-year deal for slightly less than $2 million, recalled what it
was like when he was first drafted by the expansion team. ``I live
in the woods in Louisiana _ I mean, out in the woods,'' Springer
said. ``When you hear a car coming, you know it's coming to your
place. Either that, or somebody made a wrong turn. It was one of
those package-express trucks with a package of stuff from Arizona
saying, `Welcome to the Diamondbacks.' Things like that show class.
I'll always remember that.'' . . . Padres president Larry Lucchino
is back to work after undergoing surgery last month for prostate
cancer. This was his second bout with cancer. In the '80s, he
endured non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell's travels
</P>
<P>
   Alan Trammell was disappointed to end his 23-year association
with the Tigers, but wound up with a fine consolation prize when he
was hired as a coach in San Diego, the town in which he grew up.
``Down the road, I probably would like to manage,'' Trammell told
reporters. ``But I've only coached one year in the big leagues, and
one year is not enough. I need to coach.'' . . . For the second
straight winter, Giants outfielder Ellis Burks has undergone
surgery on both knees. Burks played in just 120 games last season
and never fully recovered. He said this go-round should be easier.
``Taking extra time rehabbing, I hope to have two strong legs and
not worry about taking days off after a night game,'' said Burks,
who even on gimpy knees had a good season, hitting 31 home runs,
second on the club to Barry Bonds, and driving in 96 runs . . . The
Yankees are scheduled to play an exhibition April 1 against the
Giants in new Pacific Bell Park, their first game in San Francisco
since 1962, when they beat the Giants in seven games to win the
World Series. That's the series that ended in Candlestick Park with
Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson catching Willie McCovey's
wicked liner with runners on second and third to preserve Ralph
Terry's 1-0 win . . . The hiring of Rod Carew, deposed as Anaheim's
hitting coach, completes the first staff of new Brewers manager
Davey Lopes. Carew joins pitching coach Bob Apodaca, third base
coach Chris Speier, bench coach Jerry Royster, first base coach
Gary Allenson and the lone holdover, bullpen coach Bill Castro. ``I
thought he was still part of the Angels organization,'' Lopes said
of Carew. ``I couldn't believe we got a guy of that caliber.'' The
Brewers originally were planning to offer the job to Gary Matthews,
already on board to coach their minor league hitters. But Matthews
took a radio job with the Blue Jays instead . . . Cardinals GM Walt
Jocketty said McGwire, whose $11 million contract option was
recently exercised by St. Louis, was upset by the $84 million deal
to which the Dodgers signed Green. ``Guys are getting more and more
money,'' Jocketty said. ``He kind of wanted to make a statement by
picking up the option _ that `we don't have to have the top
dollar.' '' . . . And don't laugh, but Heathcliff Slocumb, the
Human Angioplasty, has quietly rehabilitated his career, last week
signing a two-year deal for close to $3 million with the Cardinals.
Slocumb's days as a closer are probably long over, but he was
effective as a middle- and late-inning man, compiling a 3-2 record
with a 2.36 ERA. The Cardinals are still looking hard at free agent
Mike Jackson as their closer . . . Rafael Palmeiro's rehabilitation
work on his knee is going so well that he plans to shed his
protective brace next season. ``It feels better every day,'' said
Palmeiro, who said he plans to play every day at first base next
season after starting just 28 times there for the Rangers last
season. ``I can't believe how good it feels.'' . . . Closer
Kazuhiro Sasaki has company among Japanese pitchers looking for
work on this side of the international date line. The Mariners,
among the teams interested in landing Sasaki, also were visited by
lefthanded starter Kimiyasa Kudo, who is 37 but a two-time MVP in
Japan's Pacific League. ``Kudo is a solid professional pitcher,''
said Jim Colborn, Seattle's Pacific Rim scout, who also played and
coached in Japan. ``He has been a key part of several championship
teams, including this past season, when he pitched one or two
shutouts in Daiei's win in the Japan Series.'' Kudo's courtship was
much lower key than the one the Mariners afforded Sasaki, who
stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel, dressed at Griffey's locker, and
was given a jersey with No. 22, his favorite number. Sasaki was
born on 2/22/78, reportedly at 2:22 a.m. Or so the story goes.
Sasaki also visited with the Yankees, Mets, and Diamondbacks.

HE COULD BE WHIPPING UP A MIRACLE 
</HEADLINE>

 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ So it has begun again for the University of
Massachusetts. Another season, really, with higher stakes. Which is
the way Mark Whipple likes it.
</P>
<P>
   Make that loves it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really special,'' said the UMass coach in a locker
room filled with players who believed the gospel he had preached
all season and repeated Saturday on a postcard Southern afternoon.
``Enjoy it. Keep the faith. Just a great, great win.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was. UMass 30, Furman 23, in overtime in the Division 1-AA
playoffs, which will continue next week for the Minutemen in
Statesboro, Ga., against mighty Georgia Southern.
</P>
<P>
   You are tempted to say this was as good as it gets for UMass.
But then you must remember that a year ago it was even better, when
the Minutemen went from worst to first and won a national
championship in Whipple's first season in Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Now another journey is under way and Whipple is leading the
Minutemen, with their three regular-season losses, on another
Southern Exposure reality tour.
</P>
<P>
   Take a good look at Whipple, UMass fans. Appreciate what you
have. The man can flat-out coach, and Saturday he and his staff
proved it.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Minutemen the better team? Questionable, especially on
the road, against a team that was good enough to not only spank
eight 1-AA opponents, but 1-A North Carolina as well.
</P>
<P>
   But UMass was tougher. Tougher at the start, tougher at the end.
And the reason was Whipple, who coaches with tough love.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple didn't know what to expect when his team got off the bus
at Paladin Stadium Saturdya morning in 60 degree sunshine. He did
know he was worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating North Carolina was not a fluke,'' he said, sitting in
the tiny coaches dressing room, while his players put on their
uniforms an hour before the game. ``These guys are good. They've
got speed. I just don't know. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   What concerned Whipple was that he couldn't do anything more
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of my hands,'' he said. ``I just hope . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple's concern was well-hidden. He is not one for big pregame
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never won a game yet with a pregame speech,'' he said before
walking into the locker room and delivering a simple pep talk,
telling his players to ``go out and enjoy yourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it. Nothing about being better. Nothing about acting
like national champions.
</P>
<P>
   That is not Whipple's style. His words have a punch.
</P>
<P>
   Which was evident at halftime when the Minutemen came into the
locker room trailing, 14-10, the result of several defensive
breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the worst defense you guys have played all season,''
Whipple roared. ``What are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   But then he backed off, calm again, back in the coaches room,
while his players banged lockers, beating themselves up more than
Whipple ever could.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, it was time to bring his team back up, to
erase the lingering doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're better than them,'' he said. ``It's going to happen.
It's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So it did, with some help, of course, as a 37-yard field goal
attempt by Jason Wells just curved wide left with 12 seconds left
in regulation, guaranteeing an overtime instead of the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   It happened with kids like tailback Marcel Shipp banging away
for 170 yards and two touchdowns, including the decisive 1-yard
dive in OT; it happened with wide receiver Adrian Zullo sacrificing
his 5-foot-7-inch, 151-pound body all afternoon while making a
game-high 10 receptions for 121 yards and one touchdown; it
happened with quarterback Todd Bankhead picking apart the Furman
defense for a pair of touchdowns and 287 yards; and it happened
with the defense, which seemed to stretch nearly to the breaking
point all afternoon, making four plays when it needed to in OT.
</P>
<P>
   There was more on this magical afternoon: UMass athletic
director Bob Marcum, standing on the sideline, being as neutral as
he could throughout the game, finally heading behind the goal posts
as Wells set up for the late field goal attempt and trying to will
the ball wide; the handful of UMass fans who made the trip, wishing
to believe another miracle could happen on this afternoon and this
season; and a team that believed in itself more than anyone else
did.
</P>
<P>
   UMass entered these playoffs by a different route than a year
ago, when no one gave it the slightest chance to win one playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Minutemen fooled people then, and again Saturday, as the
10th seed in the 16-team field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We own the South,'' shouted some players as they walked off
the field amid the stunned silence of the crowd of 7,215, which
could hardly believe what it had just seen.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it. Next up is Georgia Southern, anxious to prove that
its loss to UMass in the national title game last season was some
early Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern has never lost a playoff game at home. So once
again UMass is faced with the impossible. Right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the faith,'' said Whipple to his grinning, jubilant team.
``Keep the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not?

RETURN WILL HIT HOME WITH SMERLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ The prodigal son comes home Sunday, although it took a
funeral to get him here.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's Patriots-Bills game, Fred Smerlas _ along with
former teammate Reggie McKenzie _ will receive the Ralph G. Wilson
Distinguished Service Award, an honor bestowed on former Bills by
the owner himself. Considering that Smerlas fought and bled for the
Bills for 11 years and made as many Pro Bowls as O.J. Simpson
(five), that might not seem surprising, until you learn that when
the end came, it was like the bitter breakup of a long marriage.
Love was still there, but too much hurt and pain had piled on for
the end to be pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Always a fighter, the Waltham native ripped the organization and
head coach Marv Levy every chance he got, because in his mind, they
had forced him out of the town he'd been born to play in. Smerlas
could never forgive the Bills for that, and so a cult hero went off
to end his career in San Francisco and back home in New England
more than $1 million richer but more aware than most that money
cannot buy happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be in San Francisco,'' Smerlas said of the
year he spent in purgatory by the Bay after Levy told him the Bills
didn't want him anymore. ``I wanted to be in Buffalo. How many
people would say that? But that's me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a home there. I loved the town and the people, and
they loved me. I played a hard-nosed position there for 11 years.
That was my turf. I defended that turf all my life. I fought my ass
off for it, and then they were ready to just take it away from me
without a fight. What hurt was that I didn't get a shot to fight
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I didn't get my respect in high school or in college
and now in Buffalo, even after making the Pro Bowl five times and
being an alternate four more times. There's always been a rage
inside me. On the inside, I'm still the fat kid protected by a
300-pound body, so when Marv didn't give me a shot to fight for my
job, that's what hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   What Smerlas never understood was that it was hard on Levy, too.
A kind man and one of the game's great coaches, Levy determined
that a once-great player was entering his final days, but when he
began splitting playing time between Smerlas and undersized Jeff
Wright, he felt Smerlas did not take well to it.
</P>
<P>
   After a season of trying to split the position, Levy feared the
worst because Smerlas was both a team leader and a folk hero in
Buffalo. Rather than risk dividing his team over the issue of
Smerlas's slow removal, he did it in one painful swoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the hardest things I ever had to do,'' said
Levy from his home in Chicago. ``He was deeply hurt, and I
understood that. It was hurtful for us both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred was a fan favorite. He was a leader on our team. He'd
contributed a lot for many years. But when I told him we were going
to play Jeff Wright more, Fred was uncomfortable with that. I just
didn't feel he could sit behind another guy. Even mentioning it
seemed to wound him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was truly hurt by it for a long time. I knew it and that
hurt me, because I had a great regard for Fred. Fred Smerlas was
among the best to ever play his position. He was so quick they'd
call him offside sometimes when he wasn't. He had very quick hands
and he was so strong. He is among the five or six best to ever play
nose tackle and he'd always cultivated the image that he was the
toughest guy in town, which he probably was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a little showmanship, a little of that WWF persona to
him, and I think that made the way it ended harder on him. There is
only one other cut I ever made that was as difficult. I was in
Kansas City and every year we'd bring in a young kicker to compete
with Jan Stenerud and then we'd cut the guy at the end of training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one year we brought in a kid and he blew us away. He was
making 50-yard kicks and kicking off through the end zone, and
after the third preseason game I told Jan this was going to be
competitive. When I let him go, Jan was extremely bitter and hurt.
He went on and played in Minnesota and Green Bay and did fine, and
the kicker we kept was Nick Lowery and he did well. He made two
kicks of 51 and 56 yards the first game, which saved my bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years later, I'd see Jan places and he'd spin on his heels and
just walk away, but about 10 years later I was at the league
meetings and I felt this guy standing over me. It was Jan. He said,
`How are you, Marv?' and that was the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of Smerlas's feud with the Bills came under sadder
circumstances. Several years ago, ex-Bill Doug Prader was killed
when he slipped in the shower and struck his head. Smerlas returned
to Buffalo for the funeral. Levy also came back, and when he saw
Smerlas, the old memories _ good more than bad _ rushed back and
the old coach approached his old, angry player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the reconciliation began,'' said Vic Carucci, a
longtime Buffalo writer and the author of Smerlas's biography.
</P>
<P>
   That book came out in 1990, the same year Smerlas was released,
a year that coincided with the first of the Bills' four Super Bowl
teams. Carucci remembered the bitterness his subject felt in those
days and for many years thereafter, bitterness that didn't begin to
fade until Levy approached him at that funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levy saw the aging of a great player and tried to use Freddie
and Jeff both, but Fred didn't like it,'' Carucci recalled. ``San
Francisco came along and offered Fred the biggest money of his
career, and he took it because he knew if he stayed, he stayed
without any assurances anymore that he'd be on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred was just a beloved guy in this town and people took it
hard. It was not a happy time. When he came back that next season
to do a book signing people showed up with baked goods! There were
people literally with tears in their eyes, asking him to sign the
book. Nobody wanted it to end on the terms it did, but that's how
it went and Fred was bitter about it for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Smerlas once more will stand on the field he never wanted to
leave, with his wife and children, watching highlights of him in
action on the scoreboard. For just an instant those kids will have
an idea what it meant to be Fred Smerlas in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   They'll know something else, too. They'll know he's home and
glad to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back on it now and I realize Marv had his idea of how
to do it and he was 95 percent right and 5 percent wrong and it
ended up hurting both of us, but that was his assessment,'' Smerlas
said. ``It was hard for him, too. I was a volatile guy, and he was
afraid it could be an explosive situation. I was a leader and a guy
who liked to get crazy and maybe he felt the team couldn't face it
if I was there and not playing. I can see that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be great to be back. I was born in Waltham and created
in my cellar where I gained 100 pounds in three years lifting
weights without steroids, but I was formed in Buffalo. If I'd gone
anywhere else I might not have been the player I was. I was a
blue-collar guy playing in a blue-collar town, and the people there
saw that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-charging Rams
</P>
<P>
   How's this for a turnaround? Armey's Army, the St. Louis Rams
team that ex-Patriot personnel man Charley Armey helped rebuild the
last two years, could clinch the NFC West with a victory and a
Carolina loss. The Rams haven't won an NFC West title since 1985,
but if they lay claim to it Sunday, they would tie the 1985 Bears
and '97 49ers for earliest clinching of a division title since the
16-game schedule was instituted in 1978 . . . Speaking of the
Panthers, how's this for drafting consistency? Three of the four
No. 1 picks in franchise history have been arrested. Latest was
wide receiver Rae Carruth, who was charged Friday with attempted
murder of his pregnant girlfriend following a drive-by shooting. He
joins 1995 No. 1 pick Kerry Collins and 1998 selection Jason Peter
on the police blotter, both of whom were charged with drunken
driving. Collins was convicted; Peter's charges were dismissed last
summer but are being appealed by local prosecutors . . . Eagles
coach Andy Reid was so disgusted at his team's performance in last
Sunday's 44-17 loss to Indianapolis that when the team came to
Veterans Stadium Monday to watch the game film, he told them to go
home and watch soap operas instead . . . Steelers quarterback
Kordell Stewart is 4-2 on the road with an 87.3 efficiency rating;
at home, the Steelers are 1-3 and he has a 41.3 rating. This week
marks a year since the Steelers beat a team with a winning record .
. . Some wounds heal badly. As Dolphins line coach Paul Boudreau
was walking off the field after last Sunday's 27-17 victory over
his old employers, the Patriots, he grabbed a reporter and said,
``In your next report card, give the guy an F that said I couldn't
coach run blocking.'' Boudreau's comment was a slap at Pete
Carroll, who sacrificed Boudreau to help save his head coaching job
a year ago. It was the second straight year an assistant was axed
when things went bad, with offensive coordinator Larry Kennan being
the other sacrificial lamb. After the game, Boudreau said of
Carroll, ``I don't think we're going to exchange Christmas cards
this year. I wouldn't be human if I told you otherwise.'' . . .
Carroll had an interesting answer when asked why this group of
Patriots seems to start fast every year before slacking off and
putting themselves in must-win situations. ``I don't know,'' said
Carroll. ``We've been 6-4 the last three years. The fact remains
here we are again. It may just be the nature of the key guys on our
team.'' (It is a condition that preceded Carroll, in that pretty
much this same group would not have made the playoffs in 1996 had
it lost the final regular-season game to the Giants.) . . .
Wednesday's altercation between Lawyer Milloy and Vincent Brisby
during a charity party hosted by Willie McGinest may have been a
minor incident, but team owner Bob Kraft was not happy about it,
especially the fact that the night before Thanksgiving half of his
players were out partying and most of them didn't have sense enough
to hire a limousine. How many Rod Rutledge situations do they need
before they grow up in Foxborough? . . . Here's a good reason why
rookie Patriot quarterback Michael Bishop should be jumping at the
chance to get experience in NFL Europe rather than debating it:
European grads Kurt Warner, Jon Kitna, and Brad Johnson are a
combined 22-8 as NFL starters this season . . . In case you think
the recent rise of the Jets is a fluke, here's how they've done it:
In their last seven games, they have allowed 14.3 points a game
while going plus-9 in takeaway-giveaway margin. That's a formula
for winning . . . In the fourth quarter of a 17-7 victory over the
Bills last week, young Jets quarterback Ray Lucas was confronted by
Pro Bowl receiver Keyshawn Johnson after Lucas bounced a pass in
front of Johnson on a slant pattern. According to witnesses,
Johnson was cursing and told Lucas, ``What the hell are you doing?
Don't do that again!'' Lucas, making only his third professional
start, cursed right back and said, ``Here's the play. Run it!''
What followed? Lucas rolled to his right and completed a 16-yard
touchdown pass _ to Wayne Chrebet . . . Tampa head coach Tony Dungy
apparently was not impressed with the league outlawing the
throat-slashing gesture. ``I saw my son use it once,'' Dungy said.
``I think it was in a Pokemon game.'' Asked if he opposed it, Dungy
cracked, ``I do now that the league wants it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a run for it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the Arizona Cardinals' recent two-game
winning streak. It has made them possible contenders in the awful
NFC East, but it's unlikely that they can win often enough down the
stretch to be where the preseason predictors said they'd be. Still,
there's a lesson for the Patriots in the Cardinals' recent
renaissance. Arizona has won two straight by averaging 130.5 yards
rushing. In their previous two games (one of which was a loss to
New England), the Cardinals totaled 131 yards . . . Speaking of
Arizona, don't be surprised to see quarterback Jake Plummer play
some Sunday despite the pain that persists in his thumb. Dave Brown
will start against the Giants but if he wavers, Plummer believes
he's ready to help . . . Here's what happens when people mistakenly
write off great players at the first sign of weakness. Three years
ago, much of the football world was convinced Emmitt Smith was
finished and Curtis Martin would never recover from a torn groin
and stomach muscle. Martin is third in the NFL in rushing and Smith
needs 22 more yards to become only the second back in NFL history
to rush for 1,000 yards nine consecutive seasons. Barry Sanders,
who retired this summer, did it 10 straight seasons . . . In case
you're keeping score, there have been only 34 reversals of
officials' calls through the instant replay system. Perhaps more
important to some, the average length of time it has taken for a
call to be made is 2 minutes 54 seconds. Whatever happened to that
90-second promise? . . . Old friend Kevin Turner may have played
his last NFL game. Turner has been troubled all season with neck
stingers that have caused momentary paralysis in his hand and arm,
and when he suffered another such injury last Sunday against the
Colts, the Eagles put him on injured reserve. Turner did not
dispute it this time, after earlier in the year asking to remain
active. Always a warrior, the ex-Patriot fullback played hard for a
bad team this season despite having his $1.2 million salary sliced
to $800,000. It may be the last paycheck he draws in the NFL,
although Turner would like one more shot with a winning
organization. The Patriots could do worse than giving him a shot if
he's healthy next summer . . . There are a lot of reasons a
quarterback can be benched, but Browns coach Chris Palmer may have
come up with a new one. He informed rookie Tim Couch that if he
continues to run downfield and refuses to slide for his own
protection, he will be benched . . . Matthew Hatchette has unseated
veteran Jake Reed as the Vikings' third receiver because Reed has
had a string of drops . . . The Arena League's growth will continue
now that it has signed a TV deal with TNN, ESPN, ESPN2, and ABC
beginning next season. The indoor game got a boost from the play of
Warner, whose career began in the league. There will be a Game of
the Week on TNN and playoff games on all four networks. In total,
25 games will be shown nationally . . . When Detroit defensive back
Mark Carrier was suspended for a game and fined $50,000 for
slamming his helmet into Green Bay's Antonio Freeman, it should not
have come as a surprise. Carrier has been disciplined six times
since 1992 for helmet mania.

BC'S DEFINING MOMENT: THE ENTIRE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ Boston College's football team had just ended
its regular season with an 8-3 record (4-3 Big East) after Friday's
38-14 loss to second-ranked Virginia Tech before a Lane
Stadium/Worsham Field crowd of 53,150. In his postgame remarks,
third-year coach Tom O'Brien was asked to describe the defining
moments of BC's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien didn't know where to begin.
</P>
<P>
   He paused to collect his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Then he started at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overtime win at Baylor started it all off, because if you
don't win that one, you don't know where you go,'' O'Brien said,
referring to a 30-29 victory in the Sept. 4 opener at Alumni
Stadium. ``The last-minute win against Pitt (20-16) was obviously a
big boost to this football team. Then, going to Syracuse and
winning (24-23) and then Notre Dame (31-29). Our two rivals are
Syracuse and Notre Dame. If we're going to be successful, you have
to beat your rivals some time. You can't have a rivalry if you
can't beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this point, I don't think there's a bigger victory than the
one we had last week.''
</P>
<P>
   BC's eighth triumph of the season, in South Bend, Ind., which
virtually guaranteed the No. 22 Eagles a trip to the Insight.com
Bowl Dec. 31 in Tucson, Ariz., indeed ranked as its biggest. It
would have been surpassed only by a ninth win against the Hokies
(11-0, 7-0), who clinched the Big East title outright and expect to
play top-ranked Florida State in the Sugar Bowl for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   As cubes of sugar rained down from the stands Friday, raucous
Virginia Tech fans rushed the field. The Eagles, meanwhile, trudged
off in single file, oblivious to the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But BC could take solace in one fact: The season is not over yet
for its 12 departing seniors. There remains a bowl game to be
played against a yet-to-be determined opponent. If it is indeed the
Insight.com Bowl _ a virtual certainty after Miami's victory over
Syracuse Saturday sent the Hurricanes toward the Gator Bowl _ the
foe will come from the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. The Eagles are not likely to encounter a
team that approaches the level of Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it,'' said senior free safety Pedro Cirino. ``There's
not too many Michael Vicks around.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick, Virginia Tech's amazing redshirt freshman quarterback,
outgained BC in total offense, 366 yards to 319. He threw for 290
yards and three touchdowns (of 69, 59, and 30 yards), and rushed
for 76 yards (including a 5-yard TD). Despite facing a 24-0
halftime deficit, the Eagles distinguished themselves with a
spirited second-half effort highlighted by a gallant fourth-quarter
stand, Tim Hasselbeck's 97-yard TD pass to Dedrick Dewalt, and
William Green's impressive 45-yard TD run _ the longest of his
career _ with 46 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play hard for 60 minutes,'' O'Brien said.
``That's our signature right now. Our No. 1 (Green) took off there
at the end of the game. He may be the only guy we have on our team
who can run like some of the guys they have on their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't matter what the score is or what the clock
says, we're just going to play. That's what we've got to do in
order to be competitive, in order to have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the lesson freshmen like Green learned in their first
season at The Heights. It was a first year that differed vastly
from that of BC's seniors, who were devastated by a gambling
scandal that rocked the program in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great to have guys like Chris (Hovan) and Pedro and
all the other seniors just to show us the way,'' said Green, one of
six freshmen who saw playing time this season. ``They showed us how
to never give up and how to play hard. They showed us that this BC
team can do it, that we can play against the best.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Brien cautioned that sustained success is not likely to
come overnight. To illustrate his point, he mentioned how it took
Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer 13 years to position his team for
a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been here 10 years longer than I have (at BC) _ that's
what the difference is,'' O'Brien said. ``It's continuity, and
that's the bottom line. He keeps his assistants, they do a great
job. They're not always nationally ranked in recruiting, but they
find players and do a great job of coaching. But it's been 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Virginia (media) guys remember in his sixth year
here he was 2-8-1, and they were ready to hang him here. But the
administration stuck by him and from that point on they took off.
So you have to give a lot of people credit for his success, but
he's No. 1 at the top of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Any successful program is built on a solid foundation, something
O'Brien and his staff were able to establish this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future has to be bright,'' said O'Brien. ``We've proven
that we can do it, and we have some good young freshmen, and we're
going to continue to recruit as well as we can so that we can
continue to get speed. That's still the bottom line. That was the
difference (against Virginia Tech). We were able to negate some of
the speed in a couple of teams this year, but we had problems with
the Miamis and the Virginia Techs of the world.''

A NEAT TRICK BY PERSISTENT SYLVESTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dean Sylvester may or may not be in the National Hockey League
to stay, but based on his showing last Monday night, the former BC
High winger undoubtedly will be in Atlanta at least through the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   In the true spirit of giving, the 26-year-old Sylvester gave the
Thrashers their first hat trick in a 6-3 win over the Vancouver
Canucks at Atlanta's Philips Arena. After four years of displaying
a promising scoring touch in the minor leagues _ with stops in
Mobile, Kansas City, and Rochester _ he abruptly notched his first
three NHL goals, knocking in a pair during the first period and
then completing the hat trick at 11:29 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty exciting,'' said Sylvester, speaking from his
hotel room outside Atlanta, where he'll remain while the Thrashers
figure out how he fits into their plans. ``But, hey, you've got to
live life the way you're used to _ just keep your feet on the
ground and not get too carried away.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester is a model in perseverance. After graduating from high
school in '91, he was not recruited by Boston-area colleges, and he
was not selected in the NHL amateur draft at age 18. He was three
years into his scholarship at Kent State when the school folded the
hockey program. He quickly transferred to Michigan State, played
there his senior year, and picked up his undergraduate degree in
finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought of quitting,'' said Sylvester. ``Heck, I was
just getting started.''
</P>
<P>
   Selected by San Jose in an early '90s supplemental draft,
Sylvester signed with Mobile in the East Coast Hockey League when
the Sharks opted not to sign him. He moved up to Kansas City
(International Hockey League) halfway through the 1995-96 season
and stayed there two more years (averaging 28 goals) before signing
with Buffalo as a free agent last October. He popped in an
impressive 35 goals with Rochester (American Hockey League) last
season, but got only a brief look with the Sabres before they
swapped him to the Thrashers just prior to the June expansion
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got hands _ that's what made him attractive to us,'' said
Atlanta general manager Don Waddell. ``He's shown he can score
before, and if you can score 35 or 40 goals, I don't care what
level you're playing, I think that shows you at least know how to
score. We were looking at players, and asking what element they
could bring, be it toughness, skill, speed, whatever. Sylvester
brought hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't bring enough, it turned out, to convince Waddell
and head coach Curt Fraser in training camp that he was ready for
the NHL. They demoted him to the Orlando (IHL) affiliate and went
into their inaugural season with a lineup stocked with other
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sent him down, I told him, `Dean, I can't tell you
whether this is for a week or a year _ that's your decision,' ''
recalled Waddell. ``But we kept getting good reports, got into some
injury trouble, and here he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester, who grew up in Hanson, scored all three goals against
Canucks netminder Garth Snow of Wrentham (is there no end to the
NHL's Bay State connections?), and became the first NHLer in four
years to bundle his first three career goals for a hat trick. The
last: San Jose's Alexei Yegorov, who did it in the 1995-96 season
and hasn't scored an NHL goal since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to use my size as much as possible to help me score,''
said the 6-foot-2-inch, 200-pound right winger. ``I'm not what
you'd call a dangler. I usually work for my goals. The key is
positioning. I think if you put yourself in position to score, then
that's the half of it. I grew up watching Cam Neely, and he'd get
in the corners and bring it out on net. I like to try to play that
kind of game.''
</P>
<P>
   The boisterous Atlanta crowd, just getting reacquainted with
hockey rituals (remember, the Flames bolted in '80), even
celebrated the occasion by tossing a few hats on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, I can count them in my head . . . there were, oh,
I'd say about 10,'' said an amused Waddell. ``But there were a
couple of reasons for that. It wasn't a bang-bang goal. The puck
hit the goalie first and bounced in off Dean. By the time play
started, the PA announcer hadn't announced the goal yet, so not
everyone knew it was him and what it meant. Play was up and running
for about 30 seconds before it was announced. Our PA's not in full
stride just yet. We've got some bugs to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky to be alive
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Los Angeles said Montreal's Brian Savage could have
been killed last Saturday night when he fractured at least one
vertebra after getting clobbered by Ian Laperriere. Three days
later, Savage returned to Montreal in a body cast, and he has only
an outside chance of returning to the lineup this season. Remember,
earlier this year Dallas superstar Mike Modano had an ugly fall and
said he might have to consider retiring if players' blatant
disregard for each other isn't reined in. Laperriere is aggressive,
to the point of being chippy, but is by no means a headhunter.
Leaguewide, however, these incidents are occuring with frightening
frequency, and it does seem only a matter of time before someone is
left paralyzed or dead on the ice. The game has its inherent
dangers, but it would be in everyone's interest for the league and
the Players' Association to sit down immediately _ summer could be
too late _ and discuss ways to keep the game exciting but safer . .
. The Thrashers were quick to move ex-Bruin prospect Randy
Robitaille, in part, because they were having problems signing him.
``He's small, too,'' said Waddell, who flipped the 5-foot-11-inch
Robitaille to Nashville for veteran Denny Lambert. ``If you're
going to use him up the middle _ and that's his best position _ his
size is a factor. We also had Terry Yake, Mike Stapleton, and
Patrik Stefan projected ahead of him. So when it came to getting
someone with Lambert's grit for the lineup, we made the move.'' . .
. Correction from the big penalty box: A note here last week made
reference to former Kings owner Bruce McNall serving his sentence
in California, but he is in a federal prison in Safford, Ariz.
Sorry for that missed line change. The NHL's former chairman of the
Board of Governors still has three years to go on a 70-month
sentence, but good behavior can knock off about 11 months . . .
Again, congratulations to the Lawrence Eagle Tribune's Russ Conway,
a great one himself, who was ushered into Hockey's Hall of Fame
along with Wayne Gretzky last week. Conway's diligence led to Alan
Eagleson's decline, fall, and all-expenses-paid (would Eagle expect
less?) trip to the slammer for a variety of crimes. It took years
for Conway to get the job done, a feat in itself, but all the more
impressive when working for a 365-day-a-year product . . . The
Oilers have won five Stanley Cups, four in the nine seasons Gretzky
was there. In the 20 years since the Oilers entered the league in
'79, the Original Six clubs of Boston, New York, Montreal, Toronto,
Chicago, and Detroit have amassed five Cups. That's not something
you'll find under Gretzky's name, but it could be his most
impressive stat.
</P>
<P>
   Know when to fold 'em
</P>
<P>
   That $3 million-plus per year that Byron Dafoe finally signed
for must be looking pretty good to Nikolai Khabibulin right about
now. The Coyotes picked up Sean Burke as their No. 1 netminder last
Friday _ dishing Mikhail Shtalenkov to the Panthers _ and Phoenix
GM Bobby Smith promptly said he won't negotiate with Khabibulin
until after this season . . . Keep Dec. 13 in mind. It's Stanley
Cup ring delivery day in Dallas. The Stars endured a lethargic
first quarter (projecting to just under 80 points) and rings alone
won't pull them out of their funk. But the day should provide an
emotional boost, and that could help a few of the veterans shake
their Cup hangover. More important to the big picture in Big D: the
return of Jere Lehtinen, out since mid-October with a broken ankle.
Among the best two-way players in the game, Lehtinen makes the
Stars better on both ends of the rink . . . The Bruins will see an
improved Capitals squad in D.C. Thursday night. Virtually comatose
the first six weeks of the season, the Capitals at least have found
a pulse, thanks in large part to improved penalty killing: They
burned off 53 consecutive shorthanded situations prior to allowing
a power-play goal in Buffalo Wednesday . . . Sunday night at the
Vault, the Bruins will face their former coach, Butch Goring, for
the first time since he was sent packing at the start of the
1986-87 season. Working on Long Island with a
not-even-quite-Wal-Mart lineup, Goring has little hope of
pitchforking his bunch onto the playoff pile. Among the Islanders'
biggest disappointments: the ineffectiveness of right winger Mark
Lawrence, who showed great promise (30 points/60 games) last season
. . . Why does every team in baseball have a hitting coach, but
nowhere in hockey will you find someone on the payroll as a scoring
coach? It is, without question, the most overlooked, and yet most
significant, part of the game. Lasting image: John Bucyk in his
playing days, wrapping up each practice with a bucket of pucks,
dotting forehanders and backhanders to the top shelf. Goalies are
better today, but equally significant in the decline of scoring is
the fact that forwards need to spend more time working on: 1.
positioning; 2. release; 3. touch . . . During his Hall of Fame
news conference Monday, Gretzky delicately tiptoed around the Maple
Leafs' last-minute decision not to sign him as a free agent in '96.
The deal was nixed by Leaf ownership looking to trim salary.
Gretzky: ``Every person who grows up in Southern Ontario _ it's
such a hotbed for the Maple Leafs _ every youngster here grows up
dreaming about playing for the Maple Leafs. To be in Maple Leaf
Gardens, that's really something special. I loved when I played
there. I wish I could have been _ some way, somehow _ a Maple Leaf.
But it just wasn't in the cards.'' . . . How about those Lightning,
dropping the mighty Flyers, 4-1, last week? And they did it landing
zero shots in the second period. They also did it with only eight
guys in the lineup from the final game last season. New GM Rick
Dudley (formerly of the Vipers' and Senators' front offices) again
is pulling off an impressive turnaround . . . Hockey has gotten to
you if you look at the upcoming calendar switch to 2000 and wonder
whether they're going to play the next period running time.

HARD HEADED QBS PAY BIG PRICE TO KEEP PLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   That's all; just why?
</P>
<P>
   If you had accomplished all Steve Young has accomplished, and
doctor after doctor told you that you were risking your health
because you've had too many concussions, you'd like to think you'd
have sense enough to quit. Correct?
</P>
<P>
   And if you were Troy Aikman, winner of three Super Bowls, and
each year you challenge the odds in the face of concussion after
concussion, wouldn't you decide it was better to quit than risk
being spoon-fed your dinner by a nurse _ all this before you're
even close to age 40?
</P>
<P>
   To you and me, there is no issue. Every rational instinct tells
us that these two great quarterbacks are foolish beyond measure for
stepping on a football field again (which Aikman did on
Thanksgiving).
</P>
<P>
   But we are not, never have been, and never will be skilled
professional football players. Only someone who has walked in their
shoes can begin to understand why these two intelligent men insist
on playing.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grogan is such a man. He played quarterback with a
kamikaze style for 16 seasons. He was fearless, daring, and
astonishingly competitive. He loved what he did. And he understands
what we can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say about Steve Young, `The guy's won a Super Bowl.
He's the top-rated quarterback of all-time. He's going to the Hall
of Fame. So why is he running around looking for just one doctor
who will tell him it's OK to keep playing?' '' muses Grogan. ``I
think I understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you love doing something as much as he does, the idea of
quitting is very hard to accept. You want to milk it as long as you
can. He feels he can still play, and he can't fathom the idea of
some game being the absolute last one, knowing that you will never
do this again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when you realize, `That's it. It's over.'
In his case he knows he will never win another Super Bowl, at least
not with that team, but that has nothing to do with it. He just
truly loves to play football. And I'm sure it's the same thing with
Aikman.''
</P>
<P>
   Just being in that arena is an irresistible high. You are doing
something that sets you apart from the mainstream, and it gives you
a rush you doubt will ever be replicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I miss it?'' Grogan asks. ``In all honesty, I do. If
someone offered me a chance to play tomorrow, I'd do it. And I'm
46.''
</P>
<P>
   Young turned 38 five weeks ago. He has been beaten up the last
couple of seasons, primarily because the 49ers' offensive line has
deteriorated. He has suffered a number of concussions, and he has
been advised by a number of doctors that he should not play again
if he wishes to live a normal life away from the gridiron.
</P>
<P>
   Grogan was no stranger to concussions, but his major medical
crisis was a ruptured disk in his neck. Oh, he had the normal
assortment of problematic knees, ankles, and elbows, but the
scariest injury was this neck business, which necessitated surgery,
and from which he recovered in time to play a little more football.
At the time, there were many people advising him to quit, but he
had no intention of doing so unless the proverbial medical gun was
placed at his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I was doing anything stupid,'' he says. ``If
the doctors had ever said to me that I'd be risking serious
permanent injury if I kept playing, I think I would have quit. But
no doctor ever told me that. They said surgery would enable me to
play, and it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Grogan's last year was 1990. If he had to do it all over again,
he would have paid a little more attention to his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was knocked out several times,'' he says. ``In those days,
nobody made a big deal out of it. You hear about guys getting
`dinged,' or something like that, and that happened frequently. I
couldn't count the number of times I was hit that way. But there
were at least two or three times I was knocked out cold, and that
concerns me now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I was out for maybe 20 minutes. But I had to go back in
because the guy who relieved me _ I think it was Matt Cavanaugh _
was knocked out of the game and I had to go back in and finish. I
think knowing what we know today I'd have done it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Football players are inherently tough. We all know that. But
quarterbacks bring an extra element. Whatever Bruce Armstrong's
level of satisfaction, for example, it simply can't be the same as
Drew Bledsoe's. Armstrong has to derive satisfaction from a hidden
job well done. A quarterback controls the agenda. Not one fan in
100,000 can name anyone on the Denver Broncos' offensive line that
played against the Cleveland Browns in the AFC Championship game
Jan. 11, 1987. But 99,999 out of 100,000 fans know that John Elway
took his team 98 yards for the game-tying touchdown on what has
been immortalized as The Drive. A Steve Young or a Troy Aikman has
a very hard time stepping away from that kind of spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that the 31-year-old Aikman won't entertain the
thought of retiring. But Young is a different matter. He at least
acknowledges the possibility that he has played his last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he wants now,'' reasons Grogan, ``is to go out on his own
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   What scares Grogan is that the damage already may have been
done. When Young finally does retire, it will be because of
multiple concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am following this story with great interest,'' Grogan says.
``I want to learn about concussions myself. I want to learn what I
have to look forward to as I get older.''
</P>
<P>
   But Grogan would play again. These guys constitute a different
species.

HARD WORKING SMITH AN ACCOUNTABLE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Antowain Smith's job here is pushing the pile,
tracking behind his fullback _ usually former Patriot Sam Gash _
and power-slamming into a wall of flesh, muscle, and all the
assorted plastic-and-fabric protection that makes up the NFL's
big-man Sunday haberdashery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing too tricky about it,'' says Jonathan Linton,
Smith's fellow Bills running back, explaining what it's like to
work in a two-back formation. ``You just keep your head down,
follow your fullback, and run to where you see less feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, the 27-year-old Smith was pushing a vastly
different pile, reporting to work five days a week on the 3-11
shift at Gureny Manufacturing in Prattville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a job to die for, but one to dye for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clothes factory,'' Smith said the other day,
recalling the three years following high school, his voluntary
respite from football, that he spent laboring at $5.50 an hour.
``My job was to put all these clothes in a big ol' tub _ clothes
and clothes and more clothes _ and dye 'em up. That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by turf toe for almost two weeks, Smith isn't certain
how effective he'll be Sunday when the Patriots visit for a
critical (read: make or break) AFC East matchup for both squads.
This is Smith's second season as the Bills' No. 1 running threat,
which also makes it the second season that all of Western New York
has been crossing off each and every one of his rushes, wondering
how much longer it will be before he blossoms as the next Thurman
Thomas. Not that Thomas has gone anywhere, but he is 33 now, hasn't
made a single rush all season, and whenever he comes back, he will
fill the senior statesman's situational-runner's role.
</P>
<P>
   While patience may be short among Bills fans _ and perhaps
quietly likewise in the Bills' front office _ Smith is known for
not falling prey to anyone's clock of expectations. He spent those
three years out of football taking care of his ailing grandmother,
working the second shift at Gureny so he could use two or three
mornings a week to shuttle his beloved Clara Smith back and forth
for dialysis treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In order to stay close to home, Smith also passed up a
scholarship at Auburn, even after signing the papers to go there,
just to help out at his grandparents' home. He was some 36 months
away from the gridiron in '94 when he returned to school at East
Mississippi College, and even then he wasn't entertaining any idea
of playing in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth is,'' he said, ``I never took football seriously at all.
And when it came time to take care of my grandmother, that didn't
really feel like a sacrifice. I mean, hey, I was 18 years old, and
of course I wanted to be doing things with my friends. But at the
same time, I had to be there for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Lykes was 16 when she gave birth to Antowain and the
feeling that she was too young to take care of him. From infancy,
he was raised by Clara and John Smith in Millbrook, Ala., just
outside Montgomery. Both his grandparents now deceased, Smith has
marked a T-shirt with their initials, J.S. and D.S., and wears it
under his No. 23 game jersey every time he takes the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me this feeling, that they're out there with me _
somehow I feel closer,'' said Smith, who was compelled to return to
school in order to fulfill one of his grandmother's dying wishes.
``I do it because it's a way of showing I think about them every
day. My grandparents did everything they could for me, and when it
was my turn I just figured, `Hey, I'm healthy, I can get a job and
help out here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In June '93, Clara Smith died at age 70. The following spring,
with help from his high school coach, Antowain arranged a tryout at
East Mississippi Junior College in Scooba, Miss., about a
three-hour drive from Millbrook. EM's coach, Tom Goode, took Smith
out to a soaked, muddy practice field, stopwatch in hand, and
clocked the aspiring applicant at an eye-popping 4.5 in the 40-yard
dash.
</P>
<P>
   Audition complete. Smith's life was starting to play out like a
scene from ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Lord, what a deal,' '' Goode recalled for the Buffalo
News a few years later. ``I told him, `The practice is over. You
can come here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Simple is as simple does.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't seem quite so simple a couple of months later when
Smith, eager to get back on the field after his three-year hiatus,
found his first day of practice overwhelming. Scooba, he quickly
discovered, didn't exactly feel like the center of the universe,
even to a kid from the little town of Millbrook. Worse, however,
was the head-to-toe pain he felt after Goode's grueling workouts.
Smith wanted to fulfill his grandma's wish, but there were limits
to his loyalty. Exhausted that first day, he made up his mind to
quit and called back to Millbrook for a lift home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit, I'm telling you, I just quit,'' Smith recalled last
week, now able to chuckle at the memory. ``I actually told the
coach, `Thanks for the opportunity and everything, but I can't do
this.' Three years with no football, and I hadn't run. I just
thought, `Man, I'm in no shape for this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So why did Smith stay in Scooba?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' he said, ``no one would come and get me.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, each day got better, and then better, and Smith went
on to become a JUCO All-American in his one year at East
Mississippi, where he gained more than 1,100 yards. The exposure
led to two years at the University of Houston, where, under the
tutelage of ex-NFL assistant coach Kim Helton, he went on to roll
up 1,239 yards and 14 TDs, helping the Cougars reach the Liberty
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Helton wooed Smith to Houston, in part by promising him that he
would use his NFL connections _ established while he was coaching
with the Buccaneers, Oilers, and Raiders _ to help him find footbal
opportunities after college. By then, Smith would be 25 years old,
of course, and not the prototypical NFL draft pick. Helton's idea
was enticing, but Smith also wasn't counting on anything other than
adding to his education and maintaining that promise to Clara
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I just never took football seriously,'' said Smith, who
was so attracted to basketball as a youngster that he didn't think
about playing football until his senior year of high school _ and
ultimately only then to win a bet with schoolmates. ``My coach at
Houston was telling me, `Son, you've got a great opportunity here,'
but, for whatever reason, I just didn't take it all that seriously.
But then I started to see other guys start to make it, guys I'd
played against, and I began to think, `Hey, I can do that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same point, I was never thinking I could be here in
the NFL. Then eventually, I started to see NFL scouts coming to our
practices, and the coach was saying they were there to see me, and
that's when I said to myself, `Damn, OK, I do have a shot here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The chance began to crystallize soon after Smith's second year
at Houston when he put up strong numbers at the NFL combine. The
Bills, only weeks from seeing Thomas complete his last of eight
consecutive 1,000-yard-plus rushing seasons, used their No. 23 pick
overall with the hope that Smith could be somewhat of a first-round
sleeper. He was, after all, three or four years past the point
where GMs typically like to harvest top talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Bills GM John Butler said at the time, ``it's not like
he's a beat-up 25. He hasn't been hit a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith now is a season and a half into full-time ball-lugging
duty. He piled up a fairly impressive 1,124 yards and eight TDs
last season, but the Bills nonetheless felt compelled over the
summer to try to woo the problematic Lawrence Phillips to their
backfield. This past week, with Phillips cut free by the 49ers,
Bills coach Wade Phillips (no relation) said the Bills had no
interest in picking up the troubled but gifted runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is set right now,'' said the coach. ``Our team is
certainly set. We aren't looking for anybody right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who suffered the turf toe injury late in Buffalo's win
over Miami two weeks ago when he collected a season-high 126 yards,
was limited to only two carries and 6 yards in last Sunday's loss
to the Jets. He has 543 yards this season, with a respectable
average of 3.7 per carry, and five TDs. Phillips figures he'll have
Smith available Sunday, but is not sure if the injured toe will
limit his effectiveness. Linton would get the majority of the
carries in Smith's place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be 100 percent,'' said Smith. ``I know it's
going to hurt, but I'm going to have to block that pain out of my
mind and keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills are off next week, the bye in their schedule,
presenting an opportunity for Smith to rest and come back Dec. 12
with the chance that rest will aid his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``But another week and we might not be around,'' said Smith,
knowing the importance of Sunday's matchup. ``I'm not planning to
sit out.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, not so long ago, Smith had every Sunday to himself.
All his weekends were carefree in those years immediately after
high school. He could hang with his friends, play some pickup
basketball, and help out around the house before getting back to
the factory. All that changed dramatically when he turned pro, his
days of take-home pay of less than $200 traded in for a five-year
contract worth an average $1 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of that makes me appreciate this all the more,''
said Smith, reflecting on the trail that led him here. ``I think it
makes me that much more humble, I guess you'd say. I think it shows
you can do anything you want in life, if you're willing to work at
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started late. I was the oldest guy in the draft at 25, and
at 25 you have to come in and show you can do it. I feel I have to
make my point in a short time, because, like everyone knows, the
life of a running back isn't that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that sense, I'm already behind.''

LEND-HOUSING _ Phoenix has become a bright spot in getting
mortgages to minorities. The number of home loans to Hispanics and
African-Americans grew at a faster rate than mortgages to Anglos
during the past four years, unlike many other metropolitan areas.
Mortgages to African-Americans jumped nearly 92 percent from 1995
to 1998 in Phoenix. Conventional home loans for Hispanics rose by
74 percent, while lending to Anglos increased 68 percent. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOBACCO _ Big Tobacco wants to bankroll a program to teach Arizona
kids how to resist smoking, alcohol and drugs. Cynics might scoff.
But not Arizona State University. ASU's Hispanic Research Center is
state coordinator for the tobacco money and is seeking applications
from school districts, much to the dismay of anti-smoking
advocates. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AHWATUKEE _ Ahwatukee Foothills fancied itself a suburban heaven
for the upwardly mobile _ the place to move for good schools, low
crime and mountain views. The name ``Ahwatukee'' itself, a Crow
Indian word for ``House of Your Dreams,'' reflected what thousands
hoped to find in Phoenix's promised land south of South Mountain.
But now, many residents in this community of 98,000 wonder whether
it's becoming a paradise lost. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY (Undated) _ I no longer decide whether to tune in to NBC's
The West Wing simply because I like or dislike the show. It's gone
beyond that. I always catch the White House drama now because I'm
hooked. It's not a matter of taste, or even quality, anymore. It's
a matter of wanting _ needing, almost _ to know what happens next.

OKLAHOMA ROUTS RIVAL, IMPROVES BOWL STANDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ Oklahoma enhanced its bowl standing while it
convincingly exacted some revenge on an old rival yesterday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   With representatives of the Alamo and Independence bowls looking
on with a raucous Memorial Stadium crowd of 75,374, the Sooners
posted a 44-7 Big 12 Conference victory against] Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   By winning its seventh game, Oklahoma emerged from a pack of Big
12 teams with six victories and all in bowl contention. If the
Sooners had lost, they would have been at 6-5 with Texas Tech,
Oklahoma State and Colorado and with not enough bowl invitations to
go around.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sooners rendered that point moot with its fifth home
victory of the season and joined Texas A&AMP;M as the Big 12's other
7-4 team. Now, Oklahoma simply awaits an invitation, most likely
from the San Antonio-based Alamo or the Shreveport, La.-based
Independence, or from the Insight.com Bowl in Tucson, Ariz. _ three
of the six bowls that have tie-ins with the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pretend to know a lot how bowls make their selections,
but I told the players we didn't want to leave it to chance,'' said
first-year Sooners coach Bob Stoops. ``With seven wins, we'll get
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (5-6) never got untracked offensively against the
Sooners' defense, led by defensive backs Roy Williams and Rodney
Rideau, who had 14 tackles each. The Cowboys also were short-handed
on defense after coach Bob Simmons suspended four starters earlier
in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State quarterback Tony Lindsay came in with consecutive
victories against the Sooners, but his counterpart, Oklahoma
quarterback Josh Heupel, took the upper hand this time. Heupel, who
later in the afternoon was selected the Big 12 coaches' newcomer of
the year, threw two touchdown passes, passed for 287 yards and ran
for a TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like going in for us to win we had to do some things
offensively, put points on the board, sustain drives and avoid
turnovers,'' Simmons said. ``In this ballgame, we were unable to do
any of these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Heupel directed the Sooners on scoring drives of 34, 55 and 75
yards. His 3-yard TD pass to Brandon Daniels on Oklahoma's third
possession was offset by a 23-yard interception return by Oklahoma
State linebacker Tarrell Knauls in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma fullback Seth Littrell put the Sooners ahead for good
on a 4-yard scoring run. Tim Duncan's extra point gave Oklahoma a
14-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sooners' first possession of the second half, Heupel
victimized the Cowboys' new faces in the secondary _ three starters
were among those suspended _ with a 73-yard scoring strike to
freshman Curtis Fagan.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Duncan added a field goal and Heupel
guided the Sooners on a 10-play, 43-yard drive, scoring on a 7-yard
bootleg run. Cornerback Mike Woods returned an interception 43
yards and backup punt returner J.T. Thatcher brought back a punt 81
yards for final TDs that got the home crowd roaring.
</P>
<P>
   For Littrell, a junior who had not beaten the Cowboys, it was
sweet revenge. Littrell said he heard talk this week that some
Oklahoma State players had called Memorial Stadium their second
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the way it's going to be then, hey, welcome home,''
Littrell said.

COWBOYS ARE OFF; LET CRITICISM TAKE A DAY OFF, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's best the Cowboys are idle today. Perfect timing, you might
say, for a necessary mental and physical freshening, plus a
refresher course on the finer points of football.
</P>
<P>
   This is needed on a Sunday without a game. Except I'm not
talking here about the players or coaches.
</P>
<P>
   It's us. Local fans and media, plus that weird assortment of
talk-show tongues. December is coming. It's stretch-run month in
the NFL. We've got to get our act together. We've got to stop
sounding and writing like football fools. I'm guilty. You're
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the big-time national TV guys have called us a
``knowledgeable football crowd.'' Knowledgeable? Since when?
</P>
<P>
   In this strange season of ups and downs for the Cowboys, the
public emotional swings change week to week. But the whipping boy
doesn't. When something goes wrong _ meaning a loss _ it's always
Chan Gailey's fault. This comes with his territory. It's OK to
pound on Gailey, because we always pound on the offensive
coordinator around here. Only the head coach catches more grief.
Gailey is both, so he gets both barrels.
</P>
<P>
   But with the displeasure, do we really know what we're talking
about? What follows is a list of examples. See if you recognize any
of these constant screams.
</P>
<P>
   HALFTIME ADJUSTMENTS: This is the new buzz phrase around North
Texas. Lose a lead in the second half, which the Cowboys have
certainly done, and then lose the game, which they've done five
times, and the howls come rolling in about a lack of ``halftime
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's true, but when did any of us exactly become experts
on halftime adjustments? Did you immediately recognize the change
in the second half on Thursday when defensive coordinator Dave
Campo went to the ``zone blitz'' instead of the ``man blitz''
against the Dolphins? Did you?
</P>
<P>
   Fan-wise, 99.9 percent wouldn't know a halftime adjustment from
a leftover turkey sandwich. Media-wise, it would be 100 percent
except for Channel 11's Babe Laufenberg.
</P>
<P>
   TOO CONSERVATIVE: This ties in with Gailey's play-calling, which
frankly, is right out of the Jimmy Johnson book on winning
back-to-back Super Bowls in this decade. It's pretty simple. Make
the other team stop the run. And just keep running it, and running
it, and ...
</P>
<P>
   Did Emmitt Smith have a great game against the Dolphins? No,
despite 103 yards.He averaged only 3.3 yards per carry, the same as
the failed Miami running game. But because Gailey kept going to the
run, the play-action fake to Emmitt in the fourth quarter caused
cornerback Terrell Buckley to bite. Rocket Ismail blew past him,
and the 65-yard TD bomb from Troy Aikman blew open a tight game.
</P>
<P>
   If it will make you feel any better, Gailey would have made a
great offensive coordinator for Johnson in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   TOO BLAND: As in Gailey's personality. But on this subject, do
you remember a fellow by the name of Tom Landry? Or maybe you want
a clown like the last head coach.
</P>
<P>
   DUMP-OFF PASSES: What about those 5-yard throws when 10 yards
are needed? Has Gailey lost his marbles? Or could it be this is the
final desperation option on the play? Could it be that all else has
failed because the receivers couldn't get open on the primary
routes? Could it also be a ``hot read,'' meaning the blitz is in
the face of Aikman or Jason Garrett? Think about it before you
speak loudly in the press box or the stands or the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ALL THOSE SUPERSTARS AND ONLY A 6-5 RECORD: Name one current
superstar on the Cowboys. The injured Larry Allen? Probably. But
there are no others. Only the paychecks are superstar-ish.
</P>
<P>
   NINE-TOED IS ``BACK'': Did the two interceptions on Thursday
return Deion to elite status? Only in his mind. The first pick was
set up by safety George Teague tipping the pass. Teague made the
play. The second was when a Miami receiver fell down.
</P>
<P>
   Deion will be ``back'' when Campo discontinues giving him
constant safety protection, which certainly wasn't the case
Thursday. The former Nine-Toed used to be a one-man show on his
side of the field. It's the front seven making the defense work by
controlling the run without safety help. This allows the safeties
to tail the corners, including His Holiness.
</P>
<P>
   IN A LOSS, GIVE THE OTHER TEAM CREDIT: This is impossible around
here, but about three weeks after the fact it was interesting to
hear an admission that the Indy Colts are pretty darn good.
Actually, the Colts may be the best team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   LEGITIMATE CRITICISM: Ripping Gailey is actually easy. Just zero
in on the number of penalties. It doesn't matter if it's his fault
or not, the yellow flags are Gailey's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above are just something to mull over on a Sunday
without the Cowboys playing. But please mull hard. Our reputation
is at stake.

LAKERS WAITING ON KOBE FOR ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Guessing when Kobe Bryant will return to the Los
Angeles Lakers' lineup has become impossible, with estimates being
pushed back weekly.
</P>
<P>
   What coach Phil Jackson does know is he won't truly have a
handle on his team's character until Bryant does come back.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, the Lakers will need another big body to help at power
forward and center no matter how much Bryant brings to the game in
other areas. And obviously, they will be improved with Bryant on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But how sufficient is the current roster? How will the starting
five function when Bryant rejoins Shaquille O'Neal and Glen Rice?
Will all the pieces fit together well enough to avoid any
significant roster moves before the February trading deadline?
</P>
<P>
   None of that will be clear until Bryant has played at least a
month, meaning those answers might not be apparent until January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to as a team assess what we're going to be like with
Kobe on the team without having him here,'' Jackson said. ``How
good can we be once he's back and increasing our team speed? Right
now we can't run, we're not a good team running or fast breaking.
Most of our best games, or the most consistent way we play, is to
slow the ballgame down a little bit, be precise with our offense.
Kobe is going to change that, but I don't know how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is defensively what does he give us, with a
guy that can hound the ball, hound the ballplayer a little bit and
get to a level where he can be a stopper? Or we can trap or do
something else differently on defense? And I don't know what Kobe's
going to bring to us at that level, because he plays with such
energy and is a good ball chaser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make kind of an assessment as to where this
team's going to go behind that kind of energy. As we look at
personnel on this club, we still have to be very flexible as
management to see what we can do to improve the team. ... We're
going to have to look at it after the New Year.''
</P>
<P>
   By January, Bryant will presumably have been playing for three
or four weeks. That's if the latest estimates hold. He's scheduled
to have his broken right hand re-examined Tuesday, and the current
expectation is he will return a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Breather: The Lakers don't play again until Tuesday at Seattle,
giving them their first three-day break between games this season.
Jackson took the opportunity to give the players the day off
Saturday.

MINUTEMEN GET PLAYOFF WIN IN OT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ ``Oh my God, we did it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, University of Massachusetts linebacker Kole Ayi
watched a Furman fourth-down pass fall incomplete, and then he
uttered those words. Surely they resonated in the mind of every
Minuteman player and coach as they dashed onto the field in a wild
celebration, elated that one of the most suspenseful and dramatic
games in school history had ended in victory.
</P>
<P>
   But UMass's season marches on.
</P>
<P>
   Ayi was right. UMass has done it again. After playing Furman to
a 23-23 regulation tie, the defending Division 1-AA national
champions scored on a Marcel Shipp 1-yard run, then stopped Furman
on four downs for a 30-23 overtime triumph in the first round of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   UMass, seeded 10th, improved to 9-3 and will meet second seed
Georgia Southern Saturday in Statesboro, Ga., in a rematch of last
year's 1-AA title game. Georgia Southern routed 15th-seeded
Northern Arizona, 72-29, Saturday. Furman finished 9-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous football game, maybe the best football
game we've been in in two years,'' said UMass coach Mark Whipple,
who took over the program in 1998 _ following its worst season this
century _ and led it to unprecedented heights.
</P>
<P>
   UMass has won five consecutive postseason games, including four
away from home. It has beaten four higher-seeded teams in that
span.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could just tell in that overtime, our seniors didn't want
our season to end,'' said Ayi. ``They just stepped it up and came
through for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a see-saw affair, with both teams making big plays to
keep drives going or to stop them. But in OT, the Minutemen took it
to a higher level and Furman didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Credit goes to Shipp (36 carries, 170 yards, 2 touchdowns), who
redeemed himself after fumbling at the Furman 1 with 1:19 left in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of OT (which begins at the opposition's
25-yard line), UMass quarterback Todd Bankhead completed an 8-yard
pass to Pete Cariello. Then Shipp took over. He ran to the 11 for a
first down. Then he ran to the 6. Then he scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (fumble) was the worst thing that could have happened,''
said Shipp. ``It was just a case of me seeing the end zone and
trying to get extra yardage. But the guys didn't let me get down,
so I went back out there aiming to make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Furman, which won the coin toss in OT but deferred to
UMass, had its chance. On first down, wide receiver Desmond
Kitchings was stopped 4 yards behind the line of scrimmage by
linebacker Matt Dawson. It seemed that a Paladin offense that had
ground out yardage all day had lost some of its sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence came on the next two downs, when quarterback
Justin Hill (15 for 25, 183 yards) was sacked for a 6-yard loss by
defensive tackle Aaron Parker, and Hill threw incomplete to split
end Zach Smerdzinski.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with his team needing 20 yards to keep its season alive,
Hill threw an incomplete pass that was intended for Kitchings. And
the UMass celebration began.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple had said before the game that even though Furman had
arguably the most talented mix of rushing and option football he
had seen this season, he hoped UMass's playoff experience would
take over. Furman had not been to the playoffs since 1996 (only
four current players suited up in that game).
</P>
<P>
   But you couldn't tell that during regulation. Furman ground out
240 yards rushing, 92 kickoff-return yards, and went 10 for 17 on
third-down conversions. It was on a third-down, 1-yard run by Derek
Russell with 8:53 left in the first quarter that gave the Paladins
a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   UMass went ahead, 10-7, on a 15-yard pass from Bankhead to Zullo
and a 34-yard field goal by Jason Cherry, but Furman, whose special
teams earned it good field position all game long, led, 14-10, at
halftime following a Russell 1-yard run that capped an eight-play,
49-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded touchdowns but both missed on conversion tries,
and UMass took a 23-20 lead on a 31-yard pass from Bankhead to Sean
Higgins with 5:01 left in the third. Then Furman kicker Jason Wells
made a 39-yard field goal with 11:12 left in regulation to tie it
at 23.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:31 left, UMass cornerback Jerard White intercepted a
pass, but UMass stalled after four downs. Furman got the ball back
at its 22 and marched to the 19-yard line. But with 12 seconds
left, Wells missed a 37-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have gone either way,'' said Furman free safety John
Keith. ``I thought it was good, but then I'm biased.''
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for the overtime heroics, and the Minutemen
seemed sharper, more aggressive. After Shipp's runs, the defense
took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just happened to dodge a bullet with the field goal, and
our players made plays in the overtime we hadn't made,'' said
Whipple.

HARD QUESTIONS AWAIT USC'S HACKETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a 45-19 victory over Louisiana Tech, USC's
players were in a celebratory mood Friday night, too giddy after
containing one of the best quarterbacks in the nation to ponder how
different this season was supposed to have been.
</P>
<P>
   USC finished 6-6 and failed to qualify for a bowl game, but for
a brief moment, that was secondary to intercepting Louisiana Tech
quarterback Tim Rattay three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to look back at the negative,'' free safety
David Gibson said. ``I'm just happy we went out and got three wins
in a row (to end the season). If we'd lost those games, it could
have been a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gibson wasn't going to get too carried away. Asked if this
was finally an example of USC playing high-level football for all
four quarters, Gibson said, ``We were a little too late for that,
but we'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   USC won its final three games and ended its losing streak
against UCLA at eight years, but today there are plenty of
questions going into next season.
</P>
<P>
   Among them:
</P>
<P>
   Who's coming back?
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett didn't rule out changes on his coaching
staff Friday night and it's something that will be addressed next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Hue Jackson is the No.1 candidate to
depart, but speculation has also focused on offensive line coach
Steve Greatwood after the season-long struggles with that unit.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be the kicker?
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore David Newbury was yanked in the final game and
replaced by junior David Bell, but Hackett sounded like he was
inclined to sign another kicker. It's the most noticeable example
of how disappointing USC's special teams were.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be the tailback?
</P>
<P>
   Chad Morton is gone, so the heir apparent would appear to be
Sultan McCullough. But Banning High star Chris Howard will be in
the mix and the Trojans are looking to get another back to commit.
They probably wouldn't mind signing Maurice Morris of Fresno City
College.
</P>
<P>
   How much fine-tuning will occur on defense?
</P>
<P>
   USC returns 10 of 11 starters, but outside linebacker Sultan
Abdul-Malik will probably return to defensive end, and safety
Darnell Lacy returns from an academic suspension. Lacy beat out
starter Ife Ohalete last spring and could set up an interesting
battle if the Trojans don't move one to free safety.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, USC will be better. An easy schedule and
the return of Carson Palmer guarantees that. An ill-advised attempt
to play Michigan in the Kickoff Classic could alter just how better
the Trojans will be, however.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a few questions to rethink from this season, such
as how many more games USC could have won if John Fox had started
at quarterback earlier than the ninth game?
</P>
<P>
   They definitely would have made a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   If you answer that Fox was too rusty to start sooner, then maybe
he should not have been tossed aside so casually and encouraged to
play tight end and linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is why didn't the Trojans try something
different, like the shotgun, when pass protection became such an
issue with Mike Van Raaphorst at quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   In the happy atmosphere of the locker room after defeating
Louisiana Tech, these types of issues were best put aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stars of the day were the seniors,'' Hackett said.
``As hard a season and as down as they were, they found a way to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won three in a row, beating UCLA and stopping Tim Rattay
is a nice impetus going into the offseason.''

NEBRASKA LOOKS TO REVERSE LOSING TREND VS. TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sting from an emotional loss to their arch-rivals had yet to
diminish for the Texas Longhorns when coaches began trumpeting the
idea of following in the footsteps of players from Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies bounced back from a draining loss to Texas with a
victory over Kansas State in the 1998 Big 12 championship game. The
seventh-ranked Longhorns (9-3), in the wake of a 20-16 loss to No.
24 A&AMP;M, have a similar rebound opportunity against No. 3 Nebraska
(10-1) in Saturday's Big 12 title game in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Texas players said they plan to follow the A&AMP;M blueprint and
claim their first Big 12 championship since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coaches mentioned something about that right after the
game,'' said defensive tackle Casey Hampton, reflecting on the
locker-room scene Friday in College Station. ``We're a different
team from A&AMP;M, but we can do the same thing. This loss is going to
be out of our systems \Rquickly\S. It won't keep us down. I hope
we'll come back like we're supposed to and get the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike A&AMP;M, which was winless against Kansas State since the
advent of the Big 12 heading into last year's title game, Texas has
a history of success against Nebraska. The Longhorns are 3-0
against the Cornhuskers as Big 12 rivals, including a 24-20 victory
Oct. 23 in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the rematch in San Antonio _ the first Big 12
title game to feature teams that met during the regular season _
will feel like another home game for the Longhorns. Texas fans have
bought more than 42,000 tickets for Saturday's 2:30 p.m. contest in
the Alamodome, which seats 65,051.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the team goes, I'm totally confident we'll rebound
well,'' said cornerback Ahmad Brooks, who was beaten for three
pivotal completions in the second half against A&AMP;M, including the
game-winning touchdown pass with 5:02 remaining. ``We've got a
great football team. When great football teams lose, they don't
stay down. They fight back because they hate losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most players and coaches involved in Saturday's title game,
Brooks said he has never played the same team twice in one season.
Rematches happen by design in the NFL but remain a rarity in high
school or college football.
</P>
<P>
   Prevailing in such a situation, Brooks reasoned, depends on
which team makes the best adjustments to lessons learned in the
first encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever worked the first time, I'm sure the coaches would
build a game plan around that,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   During the teams' first meeting, Texas won the turnover battle,
3-0, and quarterback Major Applewhite dissected the Nebraska
secondary during a second-half rally. Applewhite connected on 8 of
9 passes for 166 yards and two touchdowns against the Cornhuskers
during the second half in Austin. His accurate arm rescued the team
from a 13-3 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Limited to one quarter of action because of a stomach virus
during the loss to A&AMP;M, Applewhite said he expects to be 100
percent physically by Saturday's kickoff. Applewhite attributed
bouts of dizziness and nausea that hampered him in College Station
to ``food poisoning or a 48-hour virus'' and said he is not
concerned about lingering effects.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska players, on the other hand, have a lingering desire to
heal a long-standing wound. Since the advent of the Big 12, the
Cornhuskers own a 33-5 record in conference play but are 0-3
against the Longhorns. During the waning moments of a Nov. 13
victory over Kansas State, Nebraska fans chanted, ``We want
Texas!'' The Nebraska band played a few bars of the Texas fight
song during Friday's 33-30 overtime victory over Colorado that
sealed the Huskers' spot in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the rematch with Texas, Nebraska defensive tackle
Steve Warren said: ``We've been thinking about this game for weeks.
We feel we should not have lost that first game. Now, we have a
chance to redeem that loss.''
</P>
<P>
   During the teams' Oct. 23 meeting, the Cornhuskers fell despite
a 429-275 edge in total offense because of three lost fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we controlled the game, but they came away with
the win. That's been frustrating to deal with. What we have to do
now is reverse that,'' tight end Tracey Wistrom said.
</P>
<P>
   The key to doing so, said Nebraska coach Frank Solich, is to
reverse an ongoing trend. Nebraska has more fumbles (47) and lost
fumbles (23) this season than any Division I-A team. In their past
two games, the Cornhuskers have fumbled 18 times, losing eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be 10-1 and lose that many fumbles, it seems strange,''
Solich said. ``If you don't have a great football team, you can't
overcome that statistic.''

MINORITIES FIND IT EASIER TO BUY A PHOENIX HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE REAGOR  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix has become a bright spot in getting mortgages to
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The number of home loans to Hispanics and African-Americans grew
at a faster rate than mortgages to Anglos during the past four
years, unlike many other metropolitan areas. Mortgages to
African-Americans jumped nearly 92 percent from 1995 to 1998 in
Phoenix. Conventional home loans for Hispanics rose by 74 percent,
while lending to Anglos increased 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's a turnaround for Phoenix, which during the 1980s and early
1990s was considered one of the nation's worst areas for minority
lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is making strides toward helping minorities catch up
in home ownership,'' said Marty Shalloo of the Association of
Community Organizations for Reform Now.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still a lot to be done, he said. For example, Anglos
still have a disproportionate percentage of loans compared with
their percentage in the population.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's home ownership rates are coming closer to mirroring
Housing and Urban Development national statistics. Recent data from
HUD show 72 percent of Anglos own homes, compared with 46 percent
of African-Americans and 45 percent of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ACORN recently tracked racial lending disparities nationwide. It
also found that government-backed loans, such as Federal Housing
Administration mortgages, jumped the most, 75 percent, for
Hispanics, the fastest-growing segment of Phoenix's population and
the most underserved in the housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgages to Anglos continue to dwarf those to minorities in
other big cities, such as Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago and
Dallas, ACORN's study found. Nationwide, home loans to Anglos grew
twice as fast as they did to Hispanics and African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, low interest rates, a booming housing market, more
efforts by lenders and assistance from minority groups have helped
improve the minority lending record.
</P>
<P>
   All those factors helped Cathy Acero buy a home. She had rented
a house in west Phoenix for several years when her landlord gave
her the chance to buy it earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I could do it,'' said the mother of two
teenage girls.
</P>
<P>
   Acero called several lenders and was quoted rates and
requirements she couldn't manage until being referred to the
non-profit Community Housing Resources of Arizona. It works with
fledgling home buyers, mainly minority and low-income, helping with
down payments, establishing or cleaning up credit records and
finding a lender.
</P>
<P>
   Acero said she didn't feel like lenders were discriminating
against her when they talked about mortgages out of her reach. She
just felt like buying a house was beyond her means.
</P>
<P>
   Minority home buyers can face two forms of discrimination. The
first is blatant _ lenders who refuse to do business with
minorities, using such practices as red-lining, or refusing to make
mortgages in certain parts of town.
</P>
<P>
   The other is often inadvertent _ lenders' rigid requirements,
geared to Anglo buyers, that sometimes don't take into account a
diversity of lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Both have resulted in huge rejections rates of minority home
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent increases in mortgages to Hispanics and African- &QL; 
Americans, loan denials are still a huge problem for minorities
trying to buy a house in metro Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's rejection rate of Hispanic applicants is one of the
worst in the country. Hispanics were 237 percent more likely to be
denied a home loan than Anglos, ACORN found last year.
</P>
<P>
   But most advocates of minority home buying don't seem too upset
by the findings, attributing it to more people applying for
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the denials may be to people who aren't ready to buy a
house but are being tapped by real estate agents and lenders trying
to focus on the Hispanic market, said Arturo Portillo, senior vice
president of community support for Chicanos Por La Causa.
</P>
<P>
   His group helps Hispanics get into houses, counseling them on
legal and credit issues so they can get a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Most minority lending advocates such as Portillo say banks are
doing better at reaching out to Hispanic home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s and '80s, many Valley lenders were criticized for
their lack of effort in the minority markets. Some were even
accused of redlining.
</P>
<P>
   There were few Spanish-speaking loan officers or branches in
predominately African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods. Loans
were approved only if the applicants fit set criteria, which they
usually didn't because of different cultures and spending patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators enforcing banks' Community Reinvestment Act
requirements have helped, and many lenders have changed the way
they do business with minorities, lending proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to speak people's languages,'' said Carl Blunt,
regional community development manager for Norwest Mortgage. ``You
need to go to their churches, to their supermarkets and to their
neighborhoods so you can understand where they are coming from when
they apply for a home loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent increases in home loans, Hispanics still make
up a small portion of the home buying market considering that they
represent 20 percent of the population and that that number is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hispanic population is a huge market for lenders and
Realtors, but they have to reach out to them,'' said Gene Lines of
Venture Financial, which does half its business with Hispanic home
buyers in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   He said Hispanics traditionally save their money at home, not in
a bank, and don't run up a lot of credit. This makes it difficult
for lenders to make them fit a standard application process.
</P>
<P>
   Matha and Cesar Castaneda have rented since they got married,
and didn't think they could afford a house. They also were afraid
of the process because of nightmare stories they heard from
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But then Matha saw an ad in Spanish for Lines' company.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we didn't want to try,'' Cesar said, ``but we got a
lot of help by people who understood where we were coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair, who work in north Scottsdale, found a home they could
afford in south Scottsdale, which is closer to their work than
where they were renting.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans, who saw the biggest jump in percentage of
home loans, are a smaller part of the market and population but
still underserved.
</P>
<P>
   And studies have shown African-Americans are the most likely to
be taken advantage of by lenders with more pricey mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said mortgage discrimination is still
driving the home ownership gap between Anglos and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The American dream of home ownership could become tougher for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Rising home prices will hurt minorities in coming years, said
Jay Butler, director of Arizona State University's Real Estate
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Also, recent changes in banking regulations could weaken
financial institutions' community reinvestment requirements, which
could cut back on the institutions' minority lending efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But many lenders say they plan to redouble their efforts with
minorities because those growing populations are the future of
their home loan business in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If minorities can't buy a home in Phoenix in this economic
climate and building boom, what is going to make their chances in
the next five years any better if banks don't have to try as hard
and home prices go up?'' ACORN's Shalloo asked. &QL;

ASU WILLING TO TAKE BIG TOBACCO MONEY  
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Big Tobacco wants to bankroll a program to teach Arizona kids
how to resist smoking, alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics might scoff. But not Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's Hispanic Research Center is state coordinator for the
tobacco money and is seeking applications from school districts,
much to the dismay of anti-smoking advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have there is a university pimping _ let's say
`brokering' _ for the tobacco industry,'' said William Novelli,
president of the national Campaign for Tobacco-Free Youth.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Keller, director of the ASU center, has an answer for
that: Money is money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a need to be dogmatic and
`holier-than-thou,' '' Keller said. ``The tobacco industry is
positively motivated in the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The same controversy is cropping up in school districts across
the country, as Philip Morris and Brown &AMP; Williamson have set aside
up to $30 million for Life Skills Training. The three-year program
is a voluntary move by the companies, spokesmen say, not part of
any court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 6th- through 8th-grade students can be served the
first year, including 5,000 in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Life Skills curriculum was developed years ago by educators
independent of the tobacco industry. It's aimed at instilling
self-esteem, assertiveness and the strength to resist pressures to
engage in substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Keller likes the program and sees no harm in letting tobacco
companies pay for it in a state that ranks near the bottom in
education spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want publicity out of this,'' Keller said. ``They
would prefer to be deep in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of Big Tobacco trying to get in our schools
by using the back-door approach,'' said Brad Christensen, spokesman
for the Arizona Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   And Novelli contends that the industry's largesse is simply a
public-relations ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies have embarked on a huge program to buy
respectability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Novelli said that, although they're promoting smoking-prevention
programs, the companies also are waging advertising campaigns to
recruit new smokers, 90 percent of whom are children.
</P>
<P>
   Denver and San Diego school districts have rejected the
companies' offers, he said; West Virginia said yes to $4.5 million
over the next three years, Novelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco company representatives defend their companies'
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an effort to address the youth smoking problem,'' said
Tom Ryan of Philip Morris. ``There is no ulterior motive.''
</P>
<P>
   Corky Newton of Brown &AMP; Williamson said, ``We produce a product
that is dangerous. It is not intended for kids, but it is falling
into the hands of kids. We should be actively involved in trying to
prevent kids from trying that product.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth McAuliffe, a junior at Mesa High School and a leader
in anti-smoking groups, is skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might have their hearts in the right place, but not
really,'' she said. ``If they really want someone to not get
involved in smoking, they would stop making the product.''
</P>
<P>
   The Life Skills Training program was selected because of its
proven track record and endorsements from the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention and the American Medical Association, Newton
and Ryan said. It is expensive to implement, involving two-day
training sessions for teachers, as well as printed materials.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mike Evans, community coordinator for the Mesa
Partnership for Tobacco-Free Youth, Life Skills achieves its broad
objectives, but its tobacco component is weak when compared with
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Public Schools declined ASU's invitation to participate on
that basis, a district official said. Kyrene Elementary School
District declined because the program duplicated its existing
curriculum. Tempe Elementary Schools will meet with Keller next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Keller said ASU's Hispanic Research Center, which has long been
involved in substance-abuse programs, sought out the tobacco
companies and received a $50,000 planning grant last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Nodora, DHS administrator of Tobacco Education and
Prevention programs, said his office allocates $35 million a year
for tobacco-control programs. The tobacco industry is not working
with government agencies such as his to coordinate educational
programming, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans believes schools should reject the program simply because
of its funding source.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profits they made to do this were made on the backs of the
sick and the dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Newton said, ``What is the definition of good money
vs. bad money? Our feeling is it is good money. What makes it good
money is it is intended for a good use.'' &QL;

AHWATUKEE AREA REELING FROM UNPLANNED GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS FISCUS AND BETTY BEARD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ahwatukee Foothills fancied itself a suburban heaven for the
upwardly mobile _ the place to move for good schools, low crime and
mountain views.
</P>
<P>
   The name ``Ahwatukee'' itself, a Crow Indian word for ``House of
Your Dreams,'' reflected what thousands hoped to find in Phoenix's
promised land south of South Mountain. But now, many residents in
this community of 98,000 wonder whether it's becoming a paradise
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not growth, but the quality of growth,'' said
Ignacio San Martin, an associate professor in Arizona State
University's School of Planning and Landscape Architecture.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 residents each year flock to Ahwatukee
Foothills. They enjoy the spacious homes, top-achieving public
schools and hiking in South Mountain Park, the country's largest
municipal park.
</P>
<P>
   But the consequences of ill-planned growth are evident
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The community has only one soccer field, which means that many
children travel to Tempe and Chandler to practice. Its booming
commercial center at 48th Street and Ray Road features a parking
lot built for 2,300 cars, yet the 24-screen movie theater alone has
about 4,000 seats. On an average day, more than 70,000 cars pass
through the 48th and Ray intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Residents complain that they have no community center, too few
fire stations, that the police substation is in a storefront, that
the single library is too small and that they face massive
rush-hour tie-ups. Violent crime rose 133 percent from 1993 to
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're drowning in traffic,'' resident Tom Bertram said. ``It
comes down to poor, poor planning. I think it's terrible the way
they're wrecking the rest of Ahwatukee.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahwatukee Foothills has become a Valley-wide example of how not
to handle rapid growth. Citizens in other parts of metropolitan
Phoenix have demanded that developers pay higher impact fees to pay
for parks, schools and other amenities. Residents of north Phoenix
and Scottsdale are demanding that planners consider long-range
traffic outlooks.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix's North Gateway community (generally north of Deer
Valley Road and east of Interstate 17), residents are thinking
about planning enough parks, schools and jobs while the area is
still mostly vacant. The goal is to have 80 percent of the
residents work nearby. USAA, the country's largest insurance
company, is considering a site there that would employ up to 15,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Developers are cooperating because they've learned that when a
community is planned correctly, the land becomes more valuable,
said Clancy Jayne, chairman of the North Gateway Village Planning
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel there's no question it will be the place to come. . . .
And a lot of it is because of the mistakes made down there,'' he
said, referring to Ahwatukee Foothills.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the problems facing the community continue to occur
in suburbs from Atlanta to Los Angeles as people flee urban ills,
only to build communities that create more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Ahwatukee is a classic case of growth in
American cities,'' said urban planner Michael Dollin of the Joint
Urban Design Program at Arizona State. ``Initially, you want to go
to the fringe. It doesn't have the urban ills of the inner city. We
tend to think we can escape.''
</P>
<P>
   With a little foresight, many of Ahwatukee Foothills' problems
could have been prevented, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix shouldn't have rezoned so much commercial land for homes
and apartments, said San Martin, the professor. Those decisions
have forced residents to trek to jobs many miles away.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, landowners gambled and lost when they supported the
rezoning of 139 acres of commercial property near Interstate 10,
hoping that hundreds of new homes would speed the construction of a
new road. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, residents opposed a rezoning that substituted homes for
a proposed resort. The City Council voted unanimously for homes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of achieving a balance of jobs and houses, Ahwatukee
Foothills became a bedroom community whose occupants leave to work
and shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted to have more employment,'' said Joy Mee,
assistant Phoenix planning director. ``What's happening is that
people who own land and want to sell want to sell it for what's hot
at the moment. And what was hot frequently was residential.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the City Council approved rezonings that allowed some
commercial or office zoning to change to residential, over the
objections of the planning staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen growth in the job base and limited hotels and
retail. But there's not as much office space as would be
desirable,'' Mee said.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1990s, commercial development had taken off at Ray
Road and 48th Street. Retail dollars began flowing into Ahwatukee
Foothills, and the intersection became one of the most congested in
metropolitan Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The city's parking code permitted too few spaces for the
24-screen theater and surrounding stores and restaurants. The
situation led to Phoenix officials rewriting the code.
</P>
<P>
   But even more distressing, residents say, was the city's
reluctance to ask developers to help pay for police and fire
stations, libraries and parks.
</P>
<P>
   Mee said communities have failed to set aside enough land for
parks and schools, not to mention day-care centers, nursing homes,
senior centers or community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently, developers are in a hurry to get their money and
get out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the rest of the area will benefit from lessons
learned in Ahwatukee Foothills, authorities say. With proposed
impact-fee increases, planners hope to expand the uses of the money
to include streets, water, sewers and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Within Ahwatukee Foothills, the city would increase net fees
from about $900 now to $2,760 for homes east of 19th Avenue and set
them at $6,799 for homes west of 19th Avenue. The actual impact
fees would be much higher, but developers would get credits for
donating park sites and other features.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ahwatukee Foothills' difficulties were tough to avoid.
The geography of the area, featuring a mountain between it and
downtown Phoenix, made rush-hour jams inevitable, some say.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, a committee studying the sparsely populated land south
of South Mountain worried that the area was a ``12-mile-long
cul-de-sac'' without a road to downtown Phoenix. Twelve years
later, there still is no easy way to get people to jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Planners believed that the state would build the South Mountain
Freeway through Ahwatukee Foothills, but the money never became
available, Mee said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, she said, developers have left incomplete roads.
And &UR; backers of a toll road concluded in early 1998 that they
couldn't attract enough traffic to make the private $360 million
project work.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid growth and bad luck also contributed to the woes. When
Phoenix voters approved $1 billion in 1988 to improve the city's
quality of life, little money went to Ahwatukee Foothills. At the
time, nobody thought the area would need parks and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The next major bond election took place this year, when voters
approved money to help pay for a regional park in Ahwatukee
Foothills. But the community already had fallen behind.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the lack of playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Edwards coordinates the Ahwatukee Foothills Soccer Club. Of
the 19 teams, six have to practice outside Ahwatukee Foothills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely frustrating. . . . We've had coaches come to
arguments because of practice space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcita Ryon and other community activists have hoped to pay for
new recreation facilities by raising private money. She and her
friends set out more than 18 months ago to raise $1 million to
equip Mountain View Park, which has a wide swath of dirt where
playing fields could be. The group has raised just $15,500.
</P>
<P>
   Schools also are experiencing a lack of space. Of two Ahwatukee
Foothills high schools, one already is over capacity. The other
doesn't have much room to spare. Five elementary schools each has
more than 800 students.
</P>
<P>
   Crime also is a concern. From 1993 to 1998, violent crime in the
area increased 133 percent, according to an analysis of Phoenix
police records by ``The Arizona Republic.'' Overall calls to police
jumped 188 percent, while property crimes climbed 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the population rose by 85 percent, faster than
the increase in property crimes but not nearly as fast as the rise
in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flaws, longtime residents say life in Ahwatukee
Foothills has many new advantages: an increasing number of quality
restaurants, churches, movie theaters and bookstores, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a paradise,'' said Phoenix Councilman Sal DiCiccio, who
represents the area and has lived there since 1987, when it had
only one store.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the few places in the city where a woman can feel
safe jogging at 1 a.m. without a dog. He contends that the
geography, and the four roads in and out, keep out criminals and
make the community relatively safe, despite the rising crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of life is tremendous,'' DiCiccio said. ``The
traffic is bad, but you feel safe, and it has good schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The area that today is Ahwatukee Foothills began as just
Ahwatukee. In the early 1970s, the Presley Development Co. built
the community in the shadow of South Mountain. A handful of other
major developments sprouted during the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, its population stood at about 36,000. During the
ensuing nine years, it has nearly tripled. In one stretch, dense,
high-end apartments line both sides of 48th Street for nearly a
mile.
</P>
<P>
   As developers keep building, ASU's San Martin questions whether
city leaders and planners are keeping a critical eye on the bigger
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have never looked at the implications of fast growth,''
he said. ``Politically speaking, you don't want to slow the
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Masel, a resident and a member of the area's citizen
planning committee, agrees that officials were quick to change
course, depending on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is malleable and political,'' he said. ``Developers
tell the city, `Apartments are the only thing that's selling,' so
they get the zoning they need.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all bad, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, Ahwatukee is doing pretty well. People vote with
their dollars, and they're moving there.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is: How can Ahwatukee Foothills fix its
problems?
</P>
<P>
   Mee, the assistant planning director, points to the proposed
increase in development fees for new homes. The first public
hearing will be next month. If approved, the fees could help meet a
variety of needs, from streets to sewers.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix also plans to hire a consultant who would study current
traffic needs and examine what the demands might be in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   A transit plan recently proposed for the city includes
circulator buses to help people move around Ahwatukee Foothills and
to encourage people to ride buses.
</P>
<P>
   But is it too late?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no clear solution,'' San Martin said. ``That they can
maintain the quality of life in Ahwatukee is highly questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the future, if problems aren't solved, he said,
``Anyone who has a choice won't live there.'' &QL;

NBC'S `WEST WING' KEEPS US COMING BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I no longer decide whether to tune in to NBC's ``The West Wing''
simply because I like or dislike the show.
</P>
<P>
   It's gone beyond that. I always catch the White House drama now
because I'm hooked. It's not a matter of taste, or even quality,
anymore. It's a matter of wanting _ needing, almost _ to know what
happens next.
</P>
<P>
   A good show works that way _ you're not just watching actors,
you're watching friends, people you feel like you know. Think about
the glory days of ``Seinfeld.'' You doubtless knew more about
George Costanza's employment misadventures than you did those of
your own relatives.
</P>
<P>
   I want to know, for instance, whether Leo, ``The West Wing's''
gruff-but-lovable chief of staff, will divorce his wife. The odds
are good, it seems _ when his wife asked him whether his marriage
wasn't more important than the work he was doing for the White
House, he said no.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``The West Wing'' isn't a show about Leo, any more than
it's a show about the president, or any of the other compelling
characters we follow each week. It's a true ensemble drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people tell me that they feel that with every
episode, like it's over before they know it,'' John Spencer, who
plays Leo, said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good sign. Rarely does ``Providence'' seem to fly by,
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sorkin, who created ``The West Wing,'' has a good track
record for this kind of television. His ``Sports Night'' holds a
similar sway over the few viewers who watch it. (Thanks to the low
ratings numbers, the show is on hiatus until December. Do your part
for quality TV _ when it returns, watch it. ``The West Wing,''
happily, is a hit.)
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of both shows is the dialogue _ rapid fire,
tongue-tripping, flat-out good. It works to even better effect in
the hour-long ``West Wing'' than in the half-hour ``Sports Night,''
in which characters have the occasional tendency to trip over each
other's lines. ``The West Wing'' allows for a slightly more
leisurely pace, although still quick enough that stagnation is
never a consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled by the dialogue,'' Spencer said. ``I think the
gig is a hard one for many reasons, but not the words.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, almost every single one of them, are Sorkin's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron's poetry, his language, is such that it becomes acutely
necessary to learn it verbatim,'' Spencer said. ``One word throws
off his rhythms. They're sticklers there, and Aaron himself, about,
`No word must change.' There's no ad-libbing. It has to be said as
written. And he's right _ it's better said as written.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Spencer's first go-round with a writer who pens
nearly every word _ David E. Kelley hired him for ``L.A. Law.'' Not
a bad couple of jobs for a guy who rarely does television work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different ballpark,'' Spencer said of working with
writers such as Sorkin and Kelley. ``Sometimes, as an actor you're
trying to spin (excrement) into gold. When you start with a base
metal, you're 75 percent into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of actors bitch about television, but my personal
television experience has just been incredible. I've been really
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Better lucky than good, as they say. But Spencer, like the rest
of ``The West Wing'' ensemble, is plenty good, as well. Let's face
it, any writing that can make Rob Lowe seem both likeable and
believeable is right on the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone, I think, is so suited to the role,'' Spencer said,
and he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer stands out as Leo, but equally good are Bradley Whitford
as Josh, Leo's deputy, and Richard Schiff as Toby, the White House
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Sheen, who plays President Josiah Bartlet, sometimes
can't help trying to chew up the scenery, but that's more amusing
than distracting _ he is, after all, playing the most powerful man
in the world, so he might as well act like it.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer has met John Podesta, President Clinton's chief of
staff. Naturally, he wondered what his real-life alter-ego thought
of ``The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he liked it,'' Spencer said. ``I asked him did he
think we were coming close to the mark and he said yeah. He said
what lawyers used to say about ``L.A. Law'' _ `You're showing the
more exciting parts of it, not people poring over papers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to describe the show to someone who hasn't seen it is a
tall order. White House staffers toil to get legislation passed.
Compromises are made. Feelings are hurt. Over-earnest characters
give corny speeches. Sappy music swells. No one has yet
specifically mentioned Mom and apple pie, but that's certainly the
aura the show gives off.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as cliched and hackneyed as all that sounds, ``The West
Wing'' simply works.
</P>
<P>
   That's largely because, although politics is definitely a
driving force in the show, ``The West Wing'' is really nothing more
than a good workplace drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, on one level, ``The West Wing'' is about people
going to work,'' Spencer said. ``The arena happens to be the
American government, the White House. But it's people going to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's the rest of us watching them. It's one political deal
that's easy to make. &QL;

   IRVING, Texas _ Anaheim's Teemu Selanne scored once, and Jere
Lehtinen sighed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Selanne scored again, and Lehtinen squirmed. &QL;
</P>

   When Selanne scored his final goal on Friday for a game-sealing

the Mighty Ducks on Friday, struggling to sneak close to .500 and
battling general locker-room crankiness, it can't be soon enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen fractured his ankle on Oct. 16 against Nashville, and
the Stars haven't been the same since. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They were 4-3-1 when Lehtinen went down. They have gone 5-7-2
since. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His linemates, Brett Hull and Mike Modano, had eight goals and
five assists between them in the seven games before Lehtinen was
sidelined. He had two goals and two assists. They have had nine
goals and nine assists in the 16 games since. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Jere, the Stars are banking on your return as a
last-resort way to jump-start a slumping first line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we put Lehtinen back in there when that time comes
and the chemistry is not there then we'll have to make realistic
long-term changes on that line,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``In other words, I think the assumption everybody has is when
Lehtinen comes back in that's going to mean that line gets up and
running. Well, times change.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have asked that line to be a checking line, to shut
down lines like Selanne's. Hitchcock acknowledges that's a hard way
to play, but it's a way that Lehtinen has spent his career
playing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without him, the No. 1 line hasn't embraced the role as
enthusiastically. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be looking for any loose ice. You have to be able to
compete in the tight critical areas,'' Hitchcock said. ``And I
don't think that lines has done that this year. ... It's less about
the line changing. I think the personality within the line has
changed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the change in personality to one thing:
``winning.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That the personality shift and subsequent struggles have
coincided with Lehtinen's stint on injured reserve isn't merely a
coincidence, Stars players say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's why it isn't mere hope that his return might spark some
type of turnaround. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially important for that one line,'' Stars forward
Mike Keane said. ``If our No. 1 line is scoring, then maybe we
don't have this conversation every day, maybe we're on a three-game
winning streak instead of back to where we're battling again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Stars need Lehtinen like Jerry needed Jimmy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only question left to be answered is when will they get
him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Lehtinen said yesterday after skating for 25
minutes with his teammates. The only difference was he had on a
white jersey with a bright red cross on the front to remind
everybody he wasn't to be hit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Switzerland jersey,'' Lehtinen said. ``I feel OK, but
not ready. It's sore and a little weak, but still we're going
forward. There are no backups at all.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Lehtinen were just another player, he'd probably be back by
now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars can't afford for him to be just another player. So
it's imperative they wait until his ankle has healed completely,
and he has confidence in it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to have pretty good confidence to go back out and play
because I have to be ready to do everything,'' said Lehtinen, who
plays on the power- play, penalty-kill while also logging
first-line minutes. ``But, of course, it's tough. Any time when you
are out, it's tough watching games especially now when we haven't
won so many games. It's hard.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The frustration that has permeated the players in the lineup has
seeped to the players who aren't in the lineup. The lackluster loss
to the Mighty Ducks was especially frustrating, seeing that it came
on the heels of what appeared to be a corner-turning victory
against the Los Angeles Kings on Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to keep turning the wheel to get around the
corner,'' Keane said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which makes this upcoming four-game road trip with games against
the Atlanta Thrashers, the New York Islanders and the Montreal
Canadiens, all struggling teams, critical. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I wouldn't exactly say critical, but once we win one it
would be nice to win a couple of straight ones to give us a little
bit of air to breathe,'' Stars backup goalie Manny Fernandez said.
``Right now, we win one and do all of the work to get out of the
hole, and when we're finally out instead of winning again we lose
and get right back in.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to tell that to Lehtinen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars winger has watched the whole thing unfold on a
television set, powerless to do anything about it, instead left to
wait until his ankle was ready to go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's like over 20 games played and we have played
good games and we still haven't won,'' Lehtinen said. ``I think the
main thing is we have to start winning.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's just the guy to do it, too. &QL;

<HEADLINE>
IMPROVED DEFENSE WOULD BE BIG CATALYST FOR REDSKINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been said here all season that if the Washington Redskins
could find a defense to go along with their high-powered offense,
the NFC East crown would be a lock to go to the nation's capitol
for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   This is not good news for the Cowboys, Giants, or Cardinals, for
if the Redskins past two games are any indication, Norv Turner
might have saved his job.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Redskins suffered a 35-28 loss in Philadelphia two
weeks ago, the defense held rookie quarterback Donovan McNabb to 60
passing yards and the Eagles to 236 total yards. Last week, in a
23-13 victory against the New York Giants, the Redskins held the
Giants to 72 rushing yards, and held an opponent to fewer than 20
points for only the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked 31st on defense for much of the season, the Redskins have
inched ahead of the expansion Cleveland Browns for 30th place. The
modest achievement brought a mock laugh from defensive coordinator
Mike Nolan, who quipped: ``What a disappointment. \ROur players\S
won't play as hard now.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there had been nothing for Nolan to laugh at.
When the club's defensive struggles began early in the season, team
owner Daniel Snyder ordered Turner to hire an assistant to help
Nolan. The club hired Bill Arnsparger, who coached the Miami
Dolphins' 1972 ``No Name'' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the club's 38-20 loss at Dallas on Oct. 24, reports
surfaced that Snyder wanted Turner to fire Nolan. Snyder was talked
out of firing his defensive coordinator. And in the past two weeks
he is finally seeing some results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it takes time, and you never know when it's going to
come together,'' defensive tackle Dana Stubblefield said.
</P>
<P>
   With the return of pass-rush specialist Ndukwe Kalu from a
broken foot, and the promotion of defensive end Anthony Cook over
Kenard Lang, the Redskins have been able to apply more pressure on
the quarterback. Last week, Nolan rotated Lang, Cook, and starter
Marco Coleman at defensive end, and the strategy seemed to confuse
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins had four sacks, and the pressure forced the Giants'
quarterbacks into three interceptions. It was Kalu, a native of San
Antonio, whose hit on Kent Graham led to Coleman's 42-yard fumble
return for a touchdown, which proved to be the clinching points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ndukwe's our one true speed rusher on our football team, and
it showed up in a big way with the touchdown,'' Turner said. ``It
showed up on a bunch of other plays where he's close and has
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook's promotion over Lang should also be noted. Nolan said Cook
lost his job because he needs to ``play with more intensity and
continue to hustle to the ball.'' Cook, Nolan said, is ``very good
at the point of attack. He helps change the line of scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the improved play of the defensive line, Nolan
has ordered more blitzes in the past two weeks, sending cornerbacks
and safeties when the time is right. Rookie cornerback Champ Bailey
had a sack against the Eagles on Nov. 14, and strong safety Sam
Shade had a sack last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got a ways to go ... \Rbut\S we're executing
better,'' Coleman said. ``We're doing the things we were supposed
to do all along. We're getting guys to where they're supposed to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins aren't boasting too loudly. Philadelphia and the
Giants have two of the worst offenses in the league. Washington
still has games against Detroit, Indianapolis, and Miami. There is
even something to prove in today's home rematch against the Eagles
as Philadelphia running back Duce Staley had 122 of the club's 198
rushing yards last time out against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1,'' Stubblefield said, ``we have to stop Duce from
running down the middle. No. 2, if we can keep the quarterback
contained like we did the last time, we have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT ON ...
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sakuma San Francisco 49ers general manager Bill Walsh says
the 49ers will make a substantial comeback.
Walsh says next draft critical to 49ers' future
As the 49ers tumble toward their worst season since 1980, general
manager Bill Walsh, whose savvy drafting and West Coast offense
were the backbone to the 49ers' dynasty from 1981-1998, has come
under fire. In an engaging interview with the ``San Jose Mercury
News'' last week, Walsh admitted that he's made some mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few excerpts:
</P>
<P>
   On his perception as, ``The Genius,'' Walsh was asked if he's
lost his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably have, but I have a curveball. I'm not looking to
regain some kind of reputation. ... They don't need the original
Bill Walsh. They might have him down the hall \Rin coach Steve
Mariucci's office.\S''
</P>
<P>
   On if the Lawrence Phillips situation was a sign the 49ers were
desperate:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. We had no running back, period. We knew Charlie Garner
could break a play, but could he go 16 games? Lawrence Phillips was
the only man out there. Those are calculated moves you make in
sports, it's that simple. Miscalculation? Darned right? Did we get
more than our share of them right this year? No. Lost my fastball?
Sure. But I can't play tennis like I did, either.''
</P>
<P>
   On how long the 49ers might be down:
</P>
<P>
   ``We've run our course with a dynasty. Now we have to get it
back. Will it be a blip on the screen? No. It will be very
substantial. Will we come back. I'm sure we'll come back if we make
the right decisions in this year's draft. I'm not sure there will
be free-agent signings that will amount to that much. But it's run
its course. The salary cap has caught up to us. Two great players
\RJerry Rice and Steve Young\S are winding down quickly on their
careers. And we have an overrun of maybe $15 million for next year.
That's the reality of it.'' \Nsubheds:AFC NOTES Unhappy backup The
Patriots want backup quarterback Michael Bishop to go to NFL Europe
and get more experience, and perhaps develop as Kurt Warner or John
Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, unhappy languishing behind starter Drew Bledsoe, said
he'd rather play another sport than go to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my dream to play football in Europe, it's here,''
Bishop said. ``If I do anything, maybe I'll go play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, who played quarterback at Kansas State in 1998, was an
outfielder at Willis High School. According to Bishop's agent, Phil
Lartigue, Bishop had an invitation to try out for the Arizona
Diamondbacks last spring and has caught the eye of the Cleveland
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Tough doesn't pay One of the few things Browns fans
have had to cheer this season is the scrambling of rookie
quarterback Tim Couch, who fights for every yard and gets up
quickly after a tough tackle.
</P>
<P>
   While Browns fans cheer Couch's tenacity, Couch's coach, Chris
Palmer, worries. In fact, last week, Couch told his quarterback to
either learn to slide to avoid contact or be benched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to learn to slide, or I'll take him out of the
ballgame,'' Palmer said. ``The league is trying to protect the
quarterbacks because they are so much a part of what the NFL is.
You've got to be smart. You have to slide and do the things that
are neccessary to make the next play.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Raging Cowher Steelers coahc Bill Cowher was more
animated than usual at his weekly press conference, and much of his
anger was vented at his offense, which ranks 25th overall and 29th
passing. He hinted that he'd make changes if the offense didn't
improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making a change to send a message,'' he said. ``I
would make a change if I felt it was in the best interest of this
team to get results, get it done. It's not any one person I'm
trying to pinpoint. I'm just stating facts. We're not getting it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The blame game should probably start with quarterback Kordell
Stewart, who averages a measly 5.4 yards per pass attempt, and
whose quarterback rating of 68.4 is 27th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Troubled Bills Even though Buffalo's 7-4 record would
lead two divisions in the NFC, the Bills face a must-win game
against the New England Patriots today. That's because their 7-4
record is good for just third place in the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Bills quarterback Doug Flutie thinks it will take a team 11 wins
to make the playoffs in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go 10-6 like last year, it's rolling the dice,'' Flutie
said.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Briefly Another reason free agents hate playing in
Cincinnati? The club released punter Will Brice last week, and
according to Brice, they refused to pay for his plane ticket home.
... When Jaguars wide receiver Jimmy Smith had 220 yards against
the Saints last week, it was his first 100-plus yard receiving day
since Week 3. ``The last few weeks weren't fun for me personally,''
Smith said. ``When you are a two-time Pro Bowl wide receiver, you
don't want to spend the entire game blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:NFC NOTES `Miracle' Bucs The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have
won a game despite having six turnovers. They have won another game
despite allowing seven sacks, and they have won twice without
scoring an offensive touchdown. When asked how his team has rallied
to win three consecutive games and now finds itself, at 6-4, tied
with Detroit and Minnesota for the NFC Central lead, all Bucs coach
Tony Dungy could do was drop his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done some miraculous things,'' Dungy said. ``It's like
we're trying to set football back and show you all the ways to win
without being fundamentally sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit should go to the Bucs' fourth-ranked defense,
and rookie placekicker Martin Grammatica, who kicked four field
goals in the club's 19-10 victory against Atlanta, including two
longer than 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, though, the Bucs know they need to score to be
a serious playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious we need to score more points,'' fullback Mike
Alstott said. ``We need to be more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Birds of a feather The underdog Eagles might not win
their game against the Washington Redskins today, but at least
they'll be fresh. After the Eagles' 44-17 loss to Indianapolis last
week, coach Andy Reid gave his players last Monday off and threw
away film clips of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing we can learn from this,'' Reid said. ``Clear
your minds. Go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Eagles punter Sean Landetta agreed with Reid's decision to give
the club last Monday off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good move,'' Landetta said. ``Every player on
every team has the best chance to win every Sunday when they go in
as positive as possible. Watching this film won't help that.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Briefly The Rams can clinch the NFC West title today
if they defeat New Orleans and Carolina loses to Atlanta. But don't
expect the Rams to let up if they win their first division title
since 1985. The Rams are 8-2 for the first time since 1985, and
have a two-game lead on their nearest competitors for homefield
advantage in the playoffs. ``Homefield advantage is huge,''
quarterback Kurt Warner said. ``We want to keep winning so we can
play as many playoff games at home as possible.'' ... The Bears _
yes, the Bears _ might have one of the most dangerous set of wide
receivers in the league. Bobby Engram (56 receptions) is seventh,
and Marcus Robinson (53) is eighth in the league in receptions.
Curtis Conway was leading the NFC in receptions before he was
injured in Week 5 at Minnesota, yet he is averaging a touchdown
nearly every eight times he catches the ball. The nightmare for the
Bears' front office is that all three wide receivers are free
agents next season.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:KEY GAMES
</P>
<P>
   New England at Buffalo: In the toughest division in pro
football, this is a must-win game for both clubs. The Patriots need
this game the most, but they can't afford another five-interception
game from QB Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots 21, Bills 16
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay at Seattle: These clubs have never made the playoffs
in the same season since they both came into the league in 1976.
But both are now leading their respective divisions. Tampa Bay has
the better defense, but Seattle has a better team, and they are
playing at home.
</P>

KINGS BEAT SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Who would have thought the Los Angeles Kings and
San Jose Sharks would not only be the hottest teams in the NHL but
the hottest ticket in town?
</P>
<P>
   How about the sellout crowd of 18,118 at Staples Center that
watched the Kings beat the Sharks 4-1 in a rare Saturday afternoon
game. Those fans remember when it was even more rare to see these
two this good.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Phoenix Coyotes, the Kings and Sharks are playing
an exciting game of Pacific Division roulette. The Kings already
have beaten the Sharks twice. The Coyotes have defeated the Kings
twice. The Sharks are 1-0 against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so long ago you couldn't imagine the Kings and San
Jose battling for the top spot in anything,'' said Glen Murray, who
scored two power-play goals. ``But this is real. These teams play
hard and have good players. This is the result.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this season, the Kings had missed the playoffs five of
the past six years, San Jose four of the past six. A Kings-Sharks
game at the Forum last November would not have drawn Murray's
family.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Kings have a new building, but it is more than
that. On a holiday weekend with beach weather outside, the Kings
played like they deserved their fourth sellout. With the victory,
they are 14-7-4 and have 33 points, one ahead of Detroit and two in
front of San Jose. The Kings also lead the league with 82 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the proof has been our power play,'' said Murray, who
ended an 0-for-29 slump with the man advantage on a first-period
goal. ``Sure we've been missing some guys, but the attitude around
here hasn't been panic. We know there is a enough talent here to
get out of any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the 19 shots San Jose took on Kings goalie Jamie Storr in
the second period just five days after Storr suffered what appeared
to be a serious groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow through all that, the Kings emerged with a 2-1 lead on a
pretty goal by Donald Audette in front of Sharks goalie Steve
Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Murray skated past the blue line and faked a slap shot. Murray
then redirected the puck to center Bryan Smolinski on Shields'
right. His shot was stopped, but Audette collected the rebound and
scored his 10th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That ties Audette with captain Rob Blake and injured Luc
Robitaille for second on the team. The leader, Ziggy Palffy, scored
his 12th on an empty netter in the final minute of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Glen was going to take the shot, then I heard Bryan
scream at him,'' Audette said. ``The (second) line worked really
well today.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't true Wednesday when the Kings lost 3-2 in overtime
to the defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray met with the second unit before
Saturday's game to discuss its poor effort. The result: three goals
and five assists for the group and the next two days off for the
team. Murray now has nine goals and Smolinski leads the team with
16 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't yell; he never does,'' Smolinski said of the coach.
``But he really knows how to embarrass you. We responded to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also responded defensively. After Murray added his
second goal with 10:07 left in the game, the Kings killed off two
power plays before Palffy's goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minutes, Storr showed off the Kings' new bravado by
tripping Sharks center Vincent Damphousse then pushing him to the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a little trash talking that got out of hand,''
Storr said. ``It was nothing serious. I remember watching him when
I was a kid in Toronto, but I would never say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not with a November game this important.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

criticism from publishing houses.)
