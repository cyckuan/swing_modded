<HEADLINE> Zambian Leader Condemns Political By-Eletion Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 10 (Xinhua)-- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today condemned political violence that had characterized
campaign of the Mkaika parliamentary constituency by-election in
Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public rally in Katete of the province, Chiluba
said it was regrettable and very sad to hear reports about
political violence in a democratic country like Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said his government stood for peace and he would not
tolerate political parties or their leaders to incite violence in
the country.
</P>
<P>
If violence broke out, the victims were innocent Zambians, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the opposition United National Independence Party
(UNIP) and its president Kenneth Kaunda of standing behind the
violent activities in Mkaika.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) and the
opposition UNIP are major rivals in the Mkaika by-election.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economists Raises Near-Term Growth Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The recent string of
brighter-than-expected economic reports has prompted U.S.
economists to upgrade their prognosis for the health of U.S.
economy in the near term, "The Wall Street Journal" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Prior to last week, many U.S. economic forecasters had
expected that the U.S. economy had grown at an annual rate of
between 1 percent and 1.5 percent in the first quarter of this
year and would gain between 1.5 to 2.5 percent in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
But many U.S. economists now believe that the gross domestic
products (GDP) of the country can grow at annual rate of between
1.5 to 3 percent during the first half.
</P>
<P>
The consensus estimate of 52 economists released on April 9 by
Blue Chip Economic Indicators showed a small rise from last
month's survey. The group of academic, corporate and Wall Street
economists raised its estimate of annualized GDP growth in the
first quarter to 1.5 percent from 1.4 percent last month. They
also expected that the economic growth in the second quarter will
be 2.3 percent, revised from 2.1 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said they expected the economy would increase
by a rate of 2 percent in the first quarter and 2.5 percent in the
second quarter. A few of economists have a more optimistic
expectation on the U.S. economy in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the main catalyst for the revised estimate
was the unexpected strong reports on employment growth in March
and consumer spending in February.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Labor Department reported last week that 140,000 jobs have
been created last month following a 624,000 increase in February.
Meanwhile, personal income and spending expenditure data indicated
that consumers are continuing to spend despite heavy debt loads.

<HEADLINE> African countries Call for Nuclear-Weapon-Free World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- African signatories of an African
Nuclear-Weapon Free-Zone Treaty today issued a declaration calling
for establishing a world free of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The call is contained in the Cairo Declaration issued here
following the signing of an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone
Treaty by the participating African states.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers and representatives of more than 40 African
countries signed the treaty here earlier today, pledging not to
build or stockpile nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Declaration urged the nuclear weapon states to
actively pursue the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world as
embodied in Article VI of the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT).
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on the nuclear weapon states to pursue
the goal through an urgent negotiation of agreements with
effective measures of verification towards a complete elimination
of nuclear weapons at "the earliest possible time."
</P>
<P>
The declaration recognized the valuable contribution that the
establishment of nuclear weapon free zones in Latin America and
the Caribbean, South Pacific and South East Asia have made to the
process of nuclear non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
The document also stressed the importance of promoting regional
and international cooperation for the development of nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social
and economic development of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The signatory states requested U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali to provide necessary assistance in 1996 in order to
achieve the aims of the Cairo Declaration.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the signing ceremony of the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, Ghali said that the treaty would
"advance global disarmament and contribute to efforts to prevent
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and strengthen the
international non-proliferation regime."
</P>
<P>
"It is a promising example to others wishing to contribute to
broadening the areas of the world from which nuclear weapons will
be forever proscribed," he said in a message read out by his
personal representative Vladimir Petrovsky.
</P>
<P>
The treaty also prohibits nuclear tests in Africa and bans the
burial of imported nuclear waste on the continent. China, the
United States, Britain and France, four of the world's five
nuclear powers, signed two protocols attached to the treaty,
pledging not to use nuclear weapons against Africa or undertake
nuclear tests in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The other nuclear power, Russia, apparently had reservation
over Protocol I and Protocol II to the treaty and did not sign
them. But it was expected to sign later.
</P>
<P>
A number of African countries such as Liberia, Somalia and
Seychelles did not sign the treaty. Some of them, however,
are expected to sign soon.
</P>
<P>
The first Cairo Declaration was issued in 1964 when the first
African summit here proclaimed the "Denuclearization of Africa" and
called for the elimination of all types of nuclear weapons in
Africa.

<HEADLINE> New Poll Shows US Citizens Support UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A new survey of the
American public opinion showed that the majority of Americans are
prepared to translate their support of the U.N. into votes at the
polls.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the Wirthlin Group for the United
Nations Association of the United Sates (UNA-USA) also found that
by a large margin, Americans continue to support full payment of
U.S. dues to the U.N. though they are more unwilling to put U.S.
troops under U.N. command than they were four years ago.
</P>
<P>
All other things being equal, 71 percent of Americans would
vote for the candidate who would strengthen the U.N., compared to
19 percent for the one who would weaken it, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
On U.N. funding, 64 percent believe the United States should
always pay its full dues to the U.N. on schedule, while only 28
percent support withholding dues to pressure other countries to
accept U.S. proposals for reform.
</P>
<P>
On U.N. priorities, large majorities call for the U.N. system
to treat human rights, peacekeeping, environment and elimination
of nuclear weapons as "high priority" issues. Though Americans see
promoting world economic growth as somewhat less urgent, it is
still an important U.N. priority, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Wirthlin Group through
telephone interviews among 1,000 randomly selected adults on April
2-4.

JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Namibia is considering to
introduce a computerized vehicle registration system, the South
African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the capital Windhoek, Namibia's

Community), it will assist in combating vehicle theft and
fraud," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The new system, to be based on the South African national
traffic information system, would be developed by the Ministry of
Roads, Transport and Communication in cooperation with the office
of the prime minister, said the report.

<HEADLINE> mee041128hke --Lebanon Refuses to Disarm Hezbollah before Israel  Withdraws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri said today that his country refuses to disarm the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, before Israel withdraws
from Lebanon's occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
The only solution to the tension in south Lebanon is "an
Israeli withdrawal from the South and Western Beqaa," he told a
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's remarks came following a series of air raids and
bombardments launched by the Israeli forces in various Lebanese
areas since early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Five Lebanese were killed and some 15 others were wounded in
the air raids, according to preliminary statistics by Red Cross
sources.
</P>
<P>
"The resistance is a result of the (Israeli) occupation," he
added. "We call again on Israel to pull out of Lebanon's occupied
lands, because a continuity of the Israeli occupation will give an
excuse to all the operations which are carried out on the Lebanese
lands,"
</P>
<P>
He re-stated that the Lebanese authorities would be responsible
for the security in south Lebanon after the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz announced
that his ministry is "seriously" studying a move to lodge a
complaint with the U.N. Security Council against today's Israeli
aggression in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hariri held a meeting today with Defense Minister Mohsen
Dalloul, who announced that the meeting was focused on "the
Israeli aggression targeting most of Lebanon's area today."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that diplomatic contacts were under way in order
to avoid further escalation of the tension.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas fired 14 Katyusha rockets into northern
Israel Tuesday morning, wounding some 36 local Jewish settlers,
in a revenge for the killing of a 16-year-old girl and three other
villages in south Lebanon Monday night.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hezbollah carried out a series of attacks at the
Israeli occupation forces in the bordering buffer zone carved by
Israel in 1985, killing one Israeli soldier and wounding three
others.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces also continuously and intensively bombarded
southern Lebanese villages in the past two days.

a Cabinda-based anti-government group, the Front for the
Liberation of Cabinda, agreed to end hostilities and work out a
peace plan, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>

The group, known as Flec-Renewal, has been fighting for the

negotiations to resolve the Cabinda conflict.
</P>

PARIS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and French
President Jacques Chirac stressed in their talks here today the
importance of developing a long-term partnership of friendly
cooperation between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the 90-minute meeting, held in a frank and friendly
atmosphere at the presidential palace, Li said the world is now
developing toward multipolarization and that a multipolarized
world is much safer than one where there is only one country
dominating.
</P>
<P>
During the process of polarization of the world, the
Asia-Europe relationship has gained progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the strengthening of Asian-European
cooperation benefits the development of bilateral ties between
countries in the two continents, which is an important factor in
safeguarding world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Li said China and France share the desire to establish and
develop a long-term partnership of friendly cooperation between
them, which will not only facilitate the development of the
Sino-French bilateral ties into the 21st century but also benefit
world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
French President Chirac expressed his agreement to Li's remarks
on the trend of multipolarization of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the world can neither be led by one country nor one
group as there are now many newly-emerging forces which include
China, the rest of Asia and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, "we have a common duty in safeguarding world
peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that France hopes to strengthen coordination
and cooperation with China and hold bilateral close consultations
on regular basis on major international issues such as disarmament
and regional security.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Li also described the agreements and contracts
signed by China and France Wednesday as new achievements in the
development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the letter of intent on bilateral cooperation in
manufacturing a new type of plane for civil aviation signed this
morning is a major project of cooperation in high technology and,
if materialized, will mark a big stride forward in the development
of the Sino-Franco and Sino-European relations.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his agreement to Li's views, the French president
wished good luck to the cooperation projects, saying they will
benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also reiterated that France will strictly abide by the
joint communique on the normalization of relations between France
and China, issued by the French and Chinese governments on January
12, 1994 and that there will not be any change in this position.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting today, Chirac also said France supports China in
entering the World Trade Organization as early as possible, adding
China's entry to the organization should not be politicized.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier conveyed an invitation from Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to Chirac to visit China and Chirac accepted
it, expressing the hope of an early trip.

At a press conference held in his office, the prime minister
pointed out that the Israeli occupation is the very reason of the
resistance, and the Lebanese government would not disarm the
Hezbollah until the Israeli withdrawal and a liberation of the
Lebanese lands are materialized.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's remarks came following a series of air raids and
bombardments by the Israeli forces in various Lebanese areas from
the dawn until late this afternoon, resulting in killing five
people and wounding 15, according to preliminary statistics by
Red Cross sources.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is a country suffering from the terror, and has paid a
very high price for the terror," Hariri stressed, "and thousands
of Lebanon's sons have lost their lives because of terrorist
activities."
</P>
<P>
"But Lebanon can not remain a victim of the terror and a
victim of war," he said, "we are a country pushing the peace
process and giving the priority to the peace."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Lebanon's demand for an implementation of
U.N. Security Council resolution 425, which calls for an Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The resistance is a result of the (Israeli) occupation," he
said. "We call again on Israel to pull out of Lebanon's occupied
lands, because a continuity of the Israeli occupation will give
an excuse to all the operations which are carried out on the
Lebanese lands."
</P>
<P>
He re-stated that the Lebanese authorities will be
responsible for the security in south Lebanon after the
Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Hariri held a meeting with Defense Minister
Mohsen Dalloul, who announced that the meeting was focused on
"the Israeli aggressions targeting most of Lebanon's regions."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that diplomatic contacts were under way in
order to avoid a further escalation of tension.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister refuted an argument that today's Israeli
aggression was a result of a violation by Hezbollah of the
so-called "July understanding," a U.S.-mediated tacit agreement
which put an end to the Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in July,
1993.
</P>
<P>
Under the July understanding, Israel and the Hezbollah promise
to refrain from attacking civilian targets on each other's side
in exchange for a guarantee for the security of the civilians on
its own side.

<HEADLINE> Higher Food Prices Push Up Living Costs in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Higher food prices have increased
the annual amount the average family in Britain needs to live to
19,238 pounds (28,857 U.S. dollars) despite low housing prices, a
latest research showed.
</P>
<P>
The amount needed to pay shopping bills, mortgages, rents and
taxes has risen by 868 pounds (1,302 dollars) since last year,
Reward, the pay consultant, found.
</P>
<P>
"The cost of feeding our statistical family rose by 5.6 percent
over the last 12 months, pushed up by general rises in a number of
staple foods like potatoes, apples and eggs," said Steve Flather,
head of Reward.
</P>
<P>
Greater London is the most expensive place to live with the
average family needing 22,047 pounds (33,070 dollars) a year,
compared with just 15,669 pounds (23,503 dollars) in Merthyr,
Wales.
</P>
<P>
According to the research, families in the West Midlands have
been most affected by rising prices since 1986, needing a 3.7
percent pay increase to retain the same standard of living as 12
months ago.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Romania to Improve Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Kyriacos Christofi, Cyprus'
minister for commerce, industry and tourism, held a meeting here
today with Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu to discuss
ways and means to improve the trade relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, the Romanian minister, who left
here this afternoon after a two-day official visit to the island,
said that he discussed with Christofi about the possibilities to
improve the existing economic exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that they discussed about the means to encourage a
better information regarding the business opportunities offered
by the two countries through the participation in trade fairs and
organized missions of businessmen.
</P>
<P>
According to Melescanu, the two sides also talked about the
possibilities to improve the legal framework of their cooperation
in a bid to create a "favorable climate."
</P>
<P>
The idea of a free trade agreement was also evoked during the
talks but both sides decided to examine it at a level of experts.
</P>
<P>
Melescanu pointed out that "there is an obvious good will, I
would say a political will, to work together for improving
relations in the fields of trade, industry and tourism, because
they represent a very solid basis for the development of our
cooperation and solidarity in all fields."
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Cypriot minister described their talks as
"useful and interesting" because they facilitate their exchange
of views on the existing situation regarding the trade exchanges
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Christofi confirmed that the two sides ascertained that the
level of their trade exchanges was too low and that they decided
to try to raise.
</P>
<P>
A Romanian mission is expected to arrive in Cyprus to meet
officials of the Cyprus Tourism Organization in a bid to boost
tourist exchanges between the two countries, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released, Cyprus' export to Romania
during 1990-95 increased from 386,000 Cyprus pounds (about 772,000
U.S. dollars) to 2.2 million pounds (4.4 million dollars),
featuring pharmaceutical products, fruits and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Melescanu, who arrived here Tuesday night, also met with
President Glafcos Clerides and signed a protocol of consultations
with his Cypriot counterpart Alecos Michaelides.

<HEADLINE> Ghali Highlights Importance of African Nuclear-Free Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali said here today that the signing of a treaty
declaring Africa free from nuclear weapons will "accelerate the
stride toward a world free from nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
In a message to the signing ceremony of the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, Ghali said that the treaty would
"advance global disarmament and contribute to efforts to prevent
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and strengthen the
international non-proliferation regime."
</P>
<P>
"It is a promising example to others wishing to contribute to
broadening the areas of the world from which nuclear weapons will
be forever proscribed," he said in a message read out by his
personal representative Vladimir Petrovsky.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers and representatives more than 40 African
countries signed the treaty here today, pledging not to build or
stockpile nuclear weapons. The treaty also prohibits nuclear tests
in Africa and bans the burial of imported nuclear waste on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
China, the United States, Britain and France, four of the
world's five nuclear powers, signed two protocols attached to the
treaty, pledging not to use nuclear weapons against Africa or
undertake nuclear tests in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The other nuclear power, Russia, apparently had reservation
over Protocol I and Protocol II to the treaty and did not sign
them. But it was expected to sign later.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told a press conference
after the signing ceremony that Russia did not refuse to sign, but
only postponed its signing of the protocols.
</P>
<P>
A number of African countries such as Liberia, Somalia and
Seychelles did not sign the treaty today. Some of them, however,
are expected to sign soon.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, current Chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), also sent a message to the
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In the message read out by Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin, Zenawi said the treaty "is not only in the interests of
Africa, but also in the interests of all peoples and countries."
</P>
<P>
The treaty is the third such regional pact after the Treaty for
the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin American and the
Caribbean and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) Hans Blix, in his speech at the signing ceremony, praised
what he called a "deep and long-standing" commitment of African
states to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
He said that 51 member states of the OAU have already joined
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

<HEADLINE> 7-Year-Old Pilot in Record Flight Killed in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A seven-year-old girl hoping
to become the youngest to fly across America died today when her
plane crashed shortly after taking off from Cheyenne, Wyoming, in
a rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
Jessica Dubroff, her farther Lloyd and her flight instructor
Joe Reid all died in the crash as her single-engine plane
nosedived into a residential area near the airport, narrowly
missing a house.
</P>
<P>
Debris was scattered through the neighborhood. But there were
no injuries on the ground, said airport manager Jerry Olson. The
crash killed all three people aboard the four-seat Cessna, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Dubroff's Cessna took off from the airport at 8:25 a.m. amid
strong gusts of wind and hailstones on the second leg of the young
girl's coast-to-coast flight across America, with her instructor
at her side and her dad in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
Dubroff, hoping to make history as the youngest to fly a
round-trip across the country, started her journey Wednesday from
Half Moon Bay, California, aiming to arrive Friday in Falmoth,
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
"I fly for joy," said Dubroff, the 4-foot-2-inch pilot whose
plane has special aluminum extensions attached to the rudder
pedals so she can reach the controls. "I just enjoy being up in
the air, floating," she said before the flight.
</P>
<P>
During her 7,000-mile journey, Dubroff planned to stop every
four hours to refuel and each night to rest. She had invited
President Bill Clinton for a ride once she got to Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
"To visit you at the White House would be wonderful and clearly
to pilot an airplane that you would be in would bring me an even
greater joy," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
Dubroff, taught by her mother, started taking flying lessons
five months ago from Half Moon Bay instructor Reid, whose Cessna
was used for the transcontinental flight.
</P>
<P>
According to the plans, Reid wasn't supposed to touch the
controls except in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
The plane arrived at Cheyenne Wednesday. It showed no signs of
trouble when it took off from Cheyenne early this morning, but the
weather was stormy and visibility was poor, said Olson.
</P>
<P>
Mitch Barker, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said it was not clear whether Jessica was actually
at the controls when the crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
He said the minimum age for holding a pilot's license is 16 and
when an unlicensed pilot, such as Jessica, flies with an
instructor, the authorities consider the instructor to be the
pilot.
</P>
<P>
An 8-year-old child currently holds the record for being the
youngest pilot to complete a round-trip, coast-to-coast flight
across the United States.

<HEADLINE> Shahak: No Confrontation with Syria, Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army Chief of Staff
Amnon Lipkin Shahak said today that Israel was not seeking a
confrontation with Syria or Lebanon, and that its actions were
directed at Hezbollah (Party of God).
</P>
<P>
Israeli air forces today carried out massive air strikes
against Hezbollah targets in the southern suburb of Beirut, the
first time the Lebanese capital was hit since the 1982 Lebanon War.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Israeli airplanes also raided other
Hezbollah positions elsewhere inside Lebanon, including a
Hezbollah base in the Bekaa Valley, a region which is under the
control of the Syrian army stationed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the northern border, Shahak told Israel
Radio that he did not believe Israel's actions against Hezbollah
in Lebanon would lead to a confrontation with the Syrian troops.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Israel has no interest in hurting
Lebanese soldiers, but that the Israeli troops were forced to
response when the Lebanese troops fired against Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing against the Lebanese army," said Shahak. "We
are not here to fight them, and we can only suggest that they stay
out of what we are doing."
</P>
<P>
Reports said that one of the Lebanese army vehicles fired
anti-aircraft missiles against one of the Israeli helicopters
carrying out strikes at Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, and then
was hit by the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Shahak said that today's Israeli actions were to make it clear
to the Hezbollah that it would not be able to use the citizen of
Lebanon as shelters for their activities against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Lebanese government must now decide how
it would act to the Hezbollah activities inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports said that the Israeli side of the border
remained quiet today, although residents were told to move into
bomb shelters and security rooms, and some of the children there
were reportedly evacuated southward.
</P>
<P>
Shahak today refused to elaborate on whether there would be
further military actions inside Lebanon, and on how long the
Israeli residents would have to stay in bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, an Israeli soldier was killed and two others were
wounded when Hezbollah gunmen shelled and machine gunned an
Israeli army position inside the "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place just one day after a Hezbollah
Katyusha rocket barrage on the northern Israeli town of Kiryat
Shmona, wounding 36 people and damaging over 200 homes.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah Katyusha attack came after a 16-year-old
Lebanese boy was killed and three other children were wounded by
explosions near the "security zone" on Monday
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah blamed Israel for the explosions, however, the Israeli
army said it had not carry out any operation in south Lebanon on
that day.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Accuses Israel of Undermining Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti today reiterated Jordan's position that the Israeli harsh
closure of the Palestinian territories would hinder and undermine
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting here with Mahamoud Abbas, Chairman of Higher
Committee for Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, the prime
minister reviewed the latest developments in the Palestinian
self-rule areas and the sufferings of Palestinians as a result of
the Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, imposed since
late February following a spate of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti told the visiting Palestinian official that Jordan
supports the Palestinians and their efforts to lift the
one-and-a-half-month-long Israeli siege on the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed issues related to cooperation
between Jordan and the Palestine National Authority (PNA) and
coordination of their joint work.
</P>
<P>
Abbas told reporters after the meeting that his current visit
in Jordan was part of Palestinians' move to seek Arab support
to end the Israeli closure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zied Majali, Head of Jordan's Representative Office,
met with Chairman of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Yasser Arafat in Gaza today.
</P>
<P>
Majali asked Arafat to clarify his recent statement about an
alleged Jordanian support of the Palestinian militant group Hamas,
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader accused Jordan Wednesday of harboring
Hamas leaders who have "declared war" against the PNA.
</P>
<P>
"The orders are coming from Amman, the headquarters are in
Amman," Arafat told legislators, saying his allegations were based
 on evidence obtained in interrogation of Hamas militants jailed
by Palestinian security forces.
</P>
<P>
"The orders are coming from Amman," he repeated.
</P>
<P>
"I have talked about this during the Sharm Al Sheikh
conference and with the Europeans," he added, referring to last
month's summit in Egypt to boost Middle East peace efforts and
combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
No immediate comment was available from Jordanian officials on
the latest accusations by Arafat.

JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Swazi Prime Minister Prince
Mbilini today announced a ban on the pro-democracy protest march
in the capital planned for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mbilini was quoted by the South African Press Association as
saying that the march, organized by the opposition, intended to
"sabotage the constitutional reforms" initiated by King Mswati
III.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Decree of April 12, 1973 bans political activities
in the land-locked Southern African state surrounded by South
Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister warned protesters, who would rally around
the anti-government Swaziland Democratic Alliance, of facing the
security forces which he said would deploy "to enforce the law
and protect life and property."
</P>
<P>
The march organizers have not officially informed the Swazi
government of the march. But officials have learned of it from
local news reports this week.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, an eight-day nationwide strike demanding
political reform and free political activity, had brought the
kingdom's already crippling economy into a standstill.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Condemns Hostilities in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has condemned "in the strongest terms" the
continuing escalation of hostilities, the killings, the taking of
hostages, the ransacking and looting of U.N. and other properties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the noon news briefing today, U.N. spokeswoman
Sylvana Foa said that the secretary-general is shocked by the
grave developments in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"He urges that these disturbing actions be brought to an
immediate halt," she said.
</P>
<P>
"He calls on all the parties involved to abide by the Abuja
Agreement and to ensure their full implementation," she said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general dispatched special envoy James Jonah to
Accra to deliver an urgent message to President Jerry Rawlings,
current chairman of the Economic Community of West African States.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in Liberia last Saturday when government
troops tried to force rebel leader Roosevelt Johnson from his home
in suburban Monrovia. Johnson, recently sacked minister for rural
development, was wanted on murder charges stemming from clashes
that killed several people in the capital last week.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls for Ridding Entire World of Threat of Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
called today for ridding the entire world of the threat of nuclear
weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
In an opening address at the conference for the signing
ceremony of a treaty declaring Africa free from nuclear weapons,
Mubarak said there is growing trend that demands that conflicting
parties resolve differences by peaceful means "whereby right
predominates over power, whereby values and principles rise above
maneuvers and greed."
</P>
<P>
"The urgent need arises to rid the entire world of the threat
of nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction, weapons
considered to be the ultimate armed force and lethal threat
against human civilization," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that "nuclear deterrence which some acclaimed and
espoused was in reality a barrier to peace and development as well
as a direct threat not only to one state or group of states but to
global security and stability."
</P>
<P>
More than 40 African countries signed the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty here today, pledging not to build
or stockpile nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The treaty also prohibits nuclear tests in Africa and bans the
burial of imported nuclear waste on the continent.
</P>
<P>
China, the United States, Britain and France, four of the
world's five nuclear powers, signed two protocols attached to the
treaty, pledging not to use nuclear weapons against Africa or
conduct nuclear tests in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the other nuclear power, apparently had reservation
over Protocol I and Protocol II to the treaty and did not sign
them. But it was expected to sign later.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also called for a treaty to free the Middle East from
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"One of the causes for which we have devoted our efforts is the
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel is believed to be the only Mideast country which
possesses nuclear weapons. Egypt has urged the Jewish state to
join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Israel has so far neither denied nor admitted possessing
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak described the treaty signed today as "historic," saying
that it "is considered a major step toward" the total elimination
of nuclear arsenals in the world.

<P>
HARARE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two people died of malaria
in Harare during the rainy season which just ended.
</P>
<P>
Director of Health Services, Lovemore Mbengeranwa said today
that all the victims contracted the disease from the malaria
endemic areas outside Harare,
</P>
<P>
Harare is not a malaria endemic area because the anopheles
mosquito, which transmits the malaria parasites to man, is not
found in the city and its environs.
</P>

Local reports say about 250,000 people have been attacked by
malaria throughout the southern African country so far this year

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Import Cereals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Namibia would have to
import 98,300 tons of cereals this year because of below average
rainfall in many areas of the country, the South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
In its March crop assessment released in Windhoek, the Namibia
Early Warning and Food Information System said unlike in all
other Southern African countries where above average rainfall has
been received this season, the 1995/96 farming season in Namibia
has again been marked by erratic rainfall.
</P>
<P>
as a result, the outlook for the 1996 cereal harvest was
"uncertain" and much would depend on the rains in the last few
weeks of the growing season, said the assessment.
</P>
<P>
Based on the provisional forecast, 35,500 tons of wheat and
62,800 tons of maize would have to be imported in order to make
up for the shortage of domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to the monthly rainfall bulletin from Namibia
Meteorological Services, grazing areas in the country received
less than 60 percent of normal rainfall.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the cropping areas is also not promising as
the percentage of normal rainfall varies between 60 and 80," said
the March bulletin.

<HEADLINE> Ulster SDLP Leader Urges IRA to Restore Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- John Hume, leader of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP), the largest Catholic party in
Northern Ireland, appealed again today to the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) to restore cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC TV report, the SDLP leader in a direct
appeal to the IRA said that he was not asking the IRA to respond
to the wishes of the British and Irish governments, but the Irish
people as a whole had a strong desire for truce.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was continuing to work with Gerry Adams, leader
of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to try to achieve a
restoration of the cease-fire which was shattered by the IRA with
a huge bomb explosion in east London on February 9.
</P>
<P>
Hume said that he hoped he and Adams would be successful.
</P>
<P>
But the SDLP leader did not mention whether his party would
take part in the elections in Ulster on May 30, designed by the
British government as a stepping stone to a peace forum.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has indicated that if the SDLP decided to contest the
elections, it would do likewise although it preferred a joint
boycott by the two Catholic republican parties.

<HEADLINE> Higher Food Prices Push Up Living Costs in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Higher food prices have increased
the annual amount the average family in Britain needs to live to
19,238 pounds (28,857 U.S. dollars) despite low housing prices, a
latest research showed.
</P>
<P>
The amount needed to pay shopping bills, mortgages, rents and
taxes has risen by 868 pounds (1,302 dollars) since last year,
Reward, the pay consultant, found.
</P>
<P>
"The cost of feeding our statistical family rose by 5.6 percent
over the last 12 months, pushed up by general rises in a number of
staple foods like potatoes, apples and eggs," said Steve Flather,
head of Reward.
</P>
<P>
Greater London is the most expensive place to live with the
average family needing 22,047 pounds (33,070 dollars) a year,
compared with just 15,669 pounds (23,503 dollars) in Merthyr,
Wales.
</P>
<P>
According to the research, families in the West Midlands have
been most affected by rising prices since 1986, needing a 3.7
percent pay increase to retain the same standard of living as 12
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Scotland has the highest standard of living, benefiting from
high salaries in the computer and oil industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Communist Party of China
(CPC) official here today called for placing more emphasis on
Party building to improve cadres' political and ideological
awareness, and competence in performing their duties.
</P>
<P>
This will contribute much to China's efforts to achieve its
development goals over the next 15 years, said Hu Jintao, a
Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks at a training course for leading officials

departments, sponsored by the Organization Department of the CPC
Central Committee. The course is being held here from March 22 to
April 14.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that Party organizations at both central and
local levels have vigorously increased their efforts in Party
building, and new progress has been made in the improvement of
Party leadership at all levels, reform in selection of cadres,
improvement of party organizations at grassroot levels, and the
anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
He urged Party organizational departments to adhere to the
Party's fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly,
and strictly implement the Party's rules and regulations in
handling matters concerning cadres.
</P>

</P>
<P>
This is the first time in Beijing's history that this level of
official has been chosen openly, according to a municipal
official, who added that earlier only officials up to the section
level were selected the same way.
</P>
<P>
Executive Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa today issued certificates of
appointment to the five new officials.
</P>
<P>
Li Yunli, a female, was appointed vice-director of the
municipal family planning commission.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yan, holder of a doctor's degree, and at 32 the youngest of
the five, was named vice-director of the city's pricing bureau.
</P>
<P>
Bao Ke, who holds a master's degree, was appointed
vice-director of the Beijing branch of the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jiayi, also a holder of a master's degree, was named
deputy general manager of the Beijing International Electricity
Development Investment Corporation, a post at deputy-director
level.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Maofei, at 45 the oldest, was promoted to vice-director of
the municipal Office for Overseas Chinese Affairs.

Eligible candidates for the five posts had to be working
section-level officials who held urban Beijing residence permits,
had no less than three years of work experience at the
grass-roots, educational background of at least four years in
college, and aged 45 or below, said Yang Zhaoshi, chief of the
municipal organization department.

A total of 244 candidates applied for the posts. Of them, 173
passed written tests and 52 reached the interview stage, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The selected five still have to face a probation period of one
year. Those found unqualified for their jobs within that time will
be removed, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that 22 Chinese provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions have selected local officials, like
Beijing, on an experimental basis since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Han Tiecheng, another official of Beijing's municipal
organization department, said that Beijing will select more
officials at the deputy-director level through public recruitment
in the latter half of this year.

<HEADLINE> US Pledges to Continue to Support Bosnia Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official pledged
here today that the United States will continue to support the
rebuilding of the war-torn Balkan nation as former U.S. Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown did.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow Ron Brown's vision die with Ron Brown," said
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summer, who is responsible for
the American contribution to Bosnia's reconstruction, at a news
conference. "It will be carried on with all of the energy that...
this government can manage."
</P>
<P>
Brown was killed last week when leading a high-ranking U.S.
trade delegation from Bosnia to Croatia to seek ways of U.S.
participation in the post-war economic reconstruction in the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Summer told the reporters that he will lead the American
delegation to the pledging conference scheduled for Friday and
Saturday in Brussels for the rebuilding of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the United States "is coming prepared to do
its part" with a commitment to provide nearly 200 million U.S.
dollars for 1996 to the country.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has estimated that at least 5 billion U.S.
dollars are needed for the Bosnian reconstruction in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
Summer said that he believes that the Brussels conference will
provide some 1.2 billion U.S. dollars for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to the United States, the European
Union, Japan and some Arab nations are coming donors willing to
make sizable additional contributions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Two More Killed, Four Wounded in Israeli Air Raid in Lebanon (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Two civilians were killed and
four others were wounded in an Israeli air raid at a town some 30
kilometers south of Beirut this afternoon, adding more to the
casualties caused in a series of air raids in Lebanon today.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the air raids, Hezbollah (Party of God)
guerrillas fired a batch of Katyusha rockets into the Galilee
panhandle in northern Israel. No information on casualties has
been given by security sources.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Army Command announced that at 1:00 p.m. (10:00
GMT), an Israeli helicopter launched an air-to-surface missile at
a civilian car of BMW 728 driven by a Lebanese man and his wife
on the coastal highway between Jiye and Saida, killing the wife
and "seriously" wounding the husband.
</P>
<P>
Another missile hit a restaurant in the town of Jiye, killing
one civilian and injuring three others, the army command said in a
statement, noting that the three wounded were in "dangerous"
condition.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul announced that two
Lebanese soldiers were killed and three others were wounded in an
Israeli air raid this morning at a Lebanese army position near
the southern Lebanese port city of Sour.
</P>
<P>
Dalloul, at the end of a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Al Hariri, said that diplomatic efforts are being made in
order to avert further escalation of tension in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at noon today, the Lebanese Army Command
announced that a number of civilians were wounded in an air raid
carried out by Israeli warplanes at Beirut's southern suburbs
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese army units in the area fired back at the invading
Israeli warplanes, and have taken all the measures in order to
resist any Israeli aggression, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Police sources reported that six people were wounded in today's
Israeli air raid at Beirut's south suburb, one of them was serious.
</P>
<P>
This was the first Israeli air raid in several years that has
targeted the outskirts of the Lebanese capital.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in the area reported that the Israeli
helicopters fired 6 air-to-surface missiles, one of them fell
near the building of Hezbollah's consultative committee, and
three exploded near a hospital.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the helicopters also opened intensive
fire at the residence of Hezbollah's spiritual leader Sheikh
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah and the building of the consultative
committee.
</P>
<P>
Before launching the air raid at Beirut's southern suburbs,
the Israeli warplanes also carried out this morning other air
raids, the first of which targeting a Hezbollah base near Baalbek
in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, and the second targeting
Hezbollah targets in Iglim Al-Toffah, in addition to that one
aiming at the Lebanese army position near Sour.
</P>
<P>
The tension in south Lebanon escalated following Hezbollah
guerrillas fired 14 Katyusha rockets into the Galilee panhandle
in northern Israel, wounding 36 local Jewish settlers, in revenge
for the killing of a 16-year old girl and the wounding of three
others by a mine blast at Monday night, and Israel vowed to fire
back at the Shiite militant group Hezbollah for the Katyusha
attack.
</P>
<P>
Retaliating for a series of Israeli bombardments and air raids
in the following two days, Hezbollah guerrillas launched Wednesday
attacks at several Israeli positions in an Israeli-occupied
enclave in south Lebanon, killing one Israeli soldier and
wounding three others.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah attacks brought more pressures from Israel's
rightwing oppositions to bear on the government of Prime Minister
Shimon Peres for large-scale actions against the pro-Iranian
Lebanese group, which spearheads guerrilla warfare against the
Israeli occupation in south lebanon.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli senior officer in Lebanon threatened today that
there would be no stability in Beirut as long as the security of
the Jewish settlements in Kyriat Shmona and Nahariya in northern
Israel is not guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> By-Election Held in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A gloomy atmosphere is hanging
over Britain's ruling Conservative Party today as a by-election is
being carried out for the seat of Tamworth, Staffordshire, central
England.
</P>
<P>
The by-election was caused by the death of Conservative member
of parliament Sir David Lightbown last December. He had a majority
of 7,192 over the opposition Labor at the 1992 general election.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen political parties have contested the election, but the
battle between the Tories and Labor is particularly fierce.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, Labor leader Tony Blair and his deputy
John Brescott have visited Tamworth three times to lobby for the
Labor candidate Brian Jenkins, while Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine, Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and other
ministers have also tried every means there to win over voters for
the Tory candidate Jimmy James.
</P>
<P>
The seat is considered crucial to both parties. If the
Conservatives lose it, the government's majority in the parliament
will be cut to one, and even worse Prime Minister John Major might
be forced to call for an early general election.
</P>
<P>
Labor is confident of overturning Lightbown's 7,192 majority.
If Labor won the seat, Blair declared, there were no more "no-go
areas" for his "new Labor," and a Tory defeat would bring closer
the prospect of an alternative government for Britain.
</P>
<P>
The omens are not good for the Conservatives as many
traditional Tory supporters have expressed their despair to the
Conservative party. It was reported that the Conservatives
privately accepted that even a narrow defeat would be a moral
victory.
</P>
<P>
If the Conservatives lose, it will be the 35 successive defeat
in by-election since their last by-election victory in February
1989.
</P>
<P>
The Tory party won a surprise victory in the 1992 general election
with a 21-seat majority in the 651-seat House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Since then, deaths, two unexpected defections and by-election
defeats have gradually whittled that figure down.
</P>
<P>
Insurance mortality charts indicate that four more MPs could
die by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> India's AIIC Calls for Removal of Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The All India Indira Congress
(AIIC) today released its election manifesto promising to probe
into corruption in high places and remove poverty and illiteracy
in a time bound program, the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The AIIC, the breakaway faction of the ruling Congress party,
was recognized by the election commission last month as a national
party.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the manifesto here, the party president N.D. Tiwari
and working president Arjun Singh claimed that they were the "real
Congress" which could take the country on the path of speedy
social and economic development into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In its 50-page manifesto, the party declared that it would
launch countrywide crusades against the nexus between politicians,
bureaucrats, businessmen and criminals and set up a high-powered
constitutional machinery to stop criminalization in politics.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto, however, made no direct mention of the Hawala
issue in which the Central Bureau of Investigation has charged
both Tiwari and Arjun Singh.
</P>
<P>
The Hawala issue is a 18-million US dollar bribery case in
which some politicians allegedly received money from illegal
foreign exchange dealers.
</P>
<P>
India will hold its general elections to the Lok Sabha (lower
house of parliament) from April 27 to May 30.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Denies Suspension of Border Demarcation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today definitely denied his Maritime territory governor Yevgeny
Nazdratenko's statement about a possible suspension of
demarcation of a disputed part of the Russian-Chinese border.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, I've signed a decree to speed up the
demarcation," Yeltsin told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Nazdratenko told Vladivostok radio earlier today that the
demarcation could be halted, referring to his conversation with
Yeltsin which reportedly took place on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the local governor's statement, Yeltsin stressed
that he "doesn't understand Nazdratenko's statement."
</P>
<P>
The president said that his order to speed up demarcation was
connected with his upcoming China visit scheduled to start on
April 24.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China share a 4,300-kilometer border. An agreement
on the western section of the border took effect in 1995. Another
agreement on the eastern section has been in effect since 1992.
With the two agreements, most of the border is covered by law.
</P>
<P>
However, a demarcation work is still going in progress over
some remained parts of the border line.
</P>
<P>
Late in February, Yeltsin ordered Russian officials to finish
the demarcation in strict conformity with the 1991 agreement
between Russia and China on border issues.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a high-ranking official at the Russian Foreign
Ministry told reporters that "the demarcation group continues its
work, all being done in conformity with presidential orders."

<HEADLINE> Japan's 1996 Budget Clears Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A last minute deal between Japan's
ruling coalition and the opposition on Wednesday night allowed the
lower house of parliament to pass the 1996 budget which includes a
controversial government bail-out for seven failed housing loan
companies.
</P>
<P>
The 75.1 trillion yen (751 billion U.S. dollars) budget for
fiscal 1996, includes an unpopular plan to use 685 billion yen
(6.85 billion dollars) of taxpayers money to liquidate the failed
housing loan companies known as 'jusen'.
</P>
<P>
Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), the main opposition party had
strongly resisted the plan and had held up the passing of the
budget bill in protest.
</P>
<P>
But the party and the three-party ruling coalition - the Social
Democratic Party, Liberal Democratic Party and New Party Sakigake
- agreed on a compromise proposal which would allow the government
to temporarily freeze the planned spending of tax money to help
liquidate the jusen.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be rubber-stamped by the House of Councillors
(Japan's upper house) where the ruling coalition has a majority.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's 15th Parliamentary Election Voting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The ruling New Korea Party looks
set to retain its majority in parliament as polling stations
throughout South Korea closed this evening.
</P>
<P>
Although official election results will not be announced until
early Friday morning, a joint opinion poll by major television
stations indicated that the NKP would increase its majority,
winning an estimated 175 of the 299 seats in the National
Assembly. It has 150 seats in the out-going parliament.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party, the National Congress for New
Politics is also estimated to increase its seats from 55 to 72, a
disappointment for the party which hoped to nearly double its
seats to 100.
</P>
<P>
The minor opposition party, the United Liberal Democrats, was
forecast to increase its number of seats by one to 33, while the
Democratic Party was expected to drop to 11 seats from the current
37. Independents are forecast to win eight seats.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,385 candidates from four major parties and independents
are running for 299 seats, 253 of which will be determined through
popular voting and the remaining 46 seats will be distributed to
political parties according to the votes they obtain.
</P>
<P>
Election officials reckoned that fewer than 70 percent of the
country's 31.5 million eligible voters turned out to vote. And
some analysts said the comparatively low turnout may have helped
the ruling NKP keep its majority.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Hashimoto to Focus Talks on Security Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The military and security
cooperation between the United States and Japan will be the focus
of talks between American and Japanese leaders when they meet next
week in Tokyo, said U.S. officials and today's press reports.
</P>
<P>
The visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to Japan, originally
scheduled for last November but postponed because of budget
disputes between the White House and Congress, comes in the midst
of an American attempt to heal a security relationship between the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Japan security ties were severely damaged by the rape
of a 12-year-old Japanese schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen in
Okinawa and the anti-American demonstrations that followed on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Although fierce bilateral trade disputes will be on the agenda
when Clinton meets Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, they
will be secondary to security concerns of the two nations, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japan hosts nearly half of the 100,000 U.S. troops stationed in
the Western Pacific. It provides bases for the U.S. 7th Fleet and
more than 20,000 combat troops.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States plan to announce a cross-servicing
agreement that will permit Japan to supply U.S. forces with goods
and services such as fuel oil, spare parts and medical care.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official told the Washington Times that the agreement
would be limited to non-combat situations such as joint maneuvers,
U.N. peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
The two nations are also expected to explore ways for Japanese
defense forces to cooperate with the U.S. military if hostilities
break out in the region, the Times report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A freight train carrying
harmful chemicals derailed this morning in the northwestern U.S.,
prompting the evacuation of a small town near the site, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The train, operated by Montana Rail Link, jumped tracks at
about 4 a.m. local time near Alberton, Montana, a small town of
400 residents.
</P>
<P>
The train's five tank cars containing chlorine derailed, said
Bill Silverman, coordinator of the Missoula County Disaster and
Emergency Services. He said one of the tank cars was overturned
and leaking.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the remote town said at least 10 people suffering
breathing problems were taken to hospitals. Chris Siegler, a
doctor at St. Patrick's Hospital in Missoula said none of the
seven patients sent to his hospital were considered critical.
</P>
<P>
The leakage also closed an interstate highway that runs next to
the derailment site.
</P>
<P>
Chlorine is a greenish-yellow poisonous gas used in sterilizing
water or as a lung irritant in chemical warfare.

<HEADLINE> US Military Chiefs Ask for More Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The chiefs of the four U.S.
armed services have proposed more spending in the fiscal year 1997
than the Pentagon spending budget, military and Congress sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army asked for more than 7 billion U.S. dollars, the
Navy and the Air Force for about 3 billion dollars apiece, and the
Marines for more than 2 billion dollars in spending beyond that
already requested by the Clinton Administration for the coming
fiscal year, according to a New York Times report.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997 fiscal year budget, the Pentagon requested a total
of 242.6 billions dollars for the U.S. military spending. But the
Republican-controlled U.S. Congress has been pressing the Clinton
Administration to spend more money on the military, particularly
on new military equipment and weapons.
</P>
<P>
Most of the request by the military leaders are for new weapons
spending. General Dennis Reimer, the U.S. Army chief of staff, and
his budget experts submitted a list of 314 separate spending
requests totaling 7.14 billion dollars, the report said. The
advanced Abrahms tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, Stinger
missiles and several classified programs were prominent on the
requirement list.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force is seeking an additional 2.84 billion
dollars for spendings on JStars aircraft, new F-15 and F-16
fighter jets and new engines for AWACS planes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy has asked for a new attack submarine and at least
three destroyers on the new spending requirement list.

<HEADLINE> Former Kurdish Deputies Sentenced to 14 Months in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 11 (xinhua) -- Four former parliamentarians of
Kurdish origin were sentenced today to one year and two
months' imprisonment for making "separatist propaganda."
</P>
<P>
Each of the former deputies was also fined by the First
State Security Court in Ankara some 116.7 million Turkish lira
(about 1,600 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sedat Yurtdas, Sirri Sakik, and Ahment Turk were deputies
of the disbanded pro-Kurdish Democratic Party (DEP) while Mahmut
Alinak was an independent deputy.
</P>
<P>
They were stripped of their parliamentarian immunity along
with some other Kurdish-origin deputies, which led to strong
reactions both at home and abroad, especially from Turkey's
Western allies.
</P>
<P>
Four other parliamentarians, including Leyla Zana, a woman
deputy, had been sentenced to 15 years in jail by the same
court, according to the controversial Anti-Terror Code.
</P>
<P>
At today's court, the former deputies maintained what they
did was just "speaking out in the parliament and to the
public their views on the Kurdish problem."
</P>
<P>
If the issue cannot be solved peacefully, they claimed,
Turkey can not talk about democracy or honor any more.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of their sentences, they told local
reporters that the court's decision was a "political" one, and
rejected the charges of splitting the country.

<P>
MANILA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Singapore fully
normalized their relations as Singapore's ambassador to Manila
Simon Tensing Cruz arrived here today for his new duties.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), new
Philippine ambassador to Singapore Alberto Encomienda went to
Singapore on April 4 to assume his post.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of ambassadors followed an agreement reached by
the two governments on January 16 on the ambassadors' respective
assignments.
</P>
<P>
However, DFA sources said that the ban on the deployment of
Filipino workers in Singapore will be lifted only after the
singing of a new accord on the issue, which is expected to follow
shortly.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement seeks to ensure that Singaporean employers
will hire only fully documented Filipino workers to help ensure
their welfare and safety under existing laws of both countries.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries had been strained after
a Filipino maid was hanged in Singapore in March last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer's sales to U.S.
business have shrunk as worries over the company's viability
continue.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the USA Today, sales of Macintosh
computers to companies and institutions dropped 24 percent in
January and February. Other computer makers saw a 7 percent
decline.
</P>
<P>
Business and government sales accounted for about 40 percent of
its 1995 North American revenue.
</P>
<P>
"The sales drop shows just how tough it will be for Apple to
recover from its recent turmoil," the paper said. After years of
losing market share, doubts about whether it could survive alone
peaked in January following a rumored buy-out by Sun Microsystems,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Apple says sales to businesses rebounded in March, but admits
it will take months to win back lost customers. "Some probably are
gone for good," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Next week, Apple will report a 700 million U.S. dollar loss for
the quarter ending March 31. To promote its sales and improve
relationship with businesses, Apple executives visited customers
in 24 cities last month. Last week, Apple slashed prices by 17
percent on some business-market Macs.

<HEADLINE> 3 Lebanese Soldiers Wounded in Israeli Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese Army Command has
confirmed that three Lebanese soldiers were wounded in the
Israeli air raids at south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here this morning, the Lebanese Army
Command said one army sergeant and two soldiers were wounded,
stressing that "one is in dangerous condition."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that an Israeli helicopter opened fire at a
Lebanese position near the southern Lebanese port city of
Sour. The Lebanese troops fired with anti-air weapons at Israeli
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources reported that two Israeli jet
fighters carried out at dawn today an air raid at the guerrilla
base of Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Beqaa Valley in eastern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Hezbollah sources in the Shiite Moslem stronghold of
Baalbek City denied casualties were caused in the air raid, adding
that the base attacked by the Israeli warplanes had been used by
the resistant guerrillas for storing anti-air weapons.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalate in south Lebanon following Hezbollah
guerrillas fired some 14 Katyusha rockets into the Galilee
panhandle in northern Israel on Tuesday morning, wounding 36 local
Jewish residents, in a revenge for the killing of a 16-year-old
Lebanese kid and the wounding of three other civilians by a mine
blast at Barashit village at Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Prices in US Up Sharply in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Wholesale prices jumped
by 0.5 percent in March, the biggest increase in three months, the
U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said that the Producer Price Index (PPI),
which measures cost pressures before they reach the consumer
level, matched a same percentage advance last December.
</P>
<P>
The sharp gain of the PPI was fueled by a huge jump in
winter-related energy prices. Energy costs jumped 2.4 percent, the
steepest advance since a 2.7 percent gain in January when a
blizzard and other severe weather struck much of the nation. But
the cold March again resulted in the big gain of energy costs.
</P>
<P>
Food prices, also affected by the weather, rose 0.6 percent,
the steepest increase since they rose 1.1 percent last November.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, wholesale
inflation in the U.S. climbed just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest advance means the U.S. wholesale inflation was
rising at a 2.8 percent annual rate during the first three months
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department will announce the prices at the
consumer level on April 12. Consumer prices have remained below 3
percent annually for the last four years. The lack of price
pressures has permitted the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut
short-term interest rates three times since last July to spur
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, signs of a strengthening economy led Fed policy-makers
to leave rates unchanged at its last meeting in March.

<HEADLINE> China Hails African Nuclear-Free Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China today hailed the signing of a
treaty declaring Africa free from nuclear weapons, saying that the
states which have nuclear weapons should respect the status of
nuclear-weapon-free zones and undertake corresponding obligations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, who represented
China to sign two protocols attached to the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty here today, said in a written
speech that the pact is a great contribution to the realization of
"mankind's common ideal -- a world free of nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 40 African countries signed the
treaty today pledging not to build or stockpile nuclear weapons on
their continent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always respected and supported the
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones by non-nuclear-weapon
states through consultations and agreements among themselves on a
voluntary basis, the Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
China, along with the United States, Britain and France signed
Protocol I and Protocol II to the African nuclear-free treaty,
pledging not to attack Africa with nuclear weapons or conduct
nuclear tests in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the other nuclear power in the world, apparently had
reservations over the two protocols and did not sign them
today. But it was expected to sign later.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing noted in his statement that China also supports the
effort to set up a zone in the Middle East which is free from
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Israel is believed to be the only Mideast country which
possesses nuclear weapons. The Jewish state has refused to join
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers and
representatives from 42 African countries signed here today a
historic treaty declaring their continent free from nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
By signing the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty, African
states pledged not to build or stockpile nuclear weapons. The
treaty also prohibits nuclear tests in Africa and bans the burial
of imported nuclear waste on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak opened the conference for the
signing ceremony of the treaty, highlighting in his speech the
importance of the pact in guaranteeing peace and security of
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also stressed the role of the treaty in supporting
international efforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak described the signing of the treaty as "the realization
of a dream," saying that the pact represents "a tangible
achievement on the road to regional and international nuclear
non-proliferation."
</P>
<P>
"Human civilization has managed to put behind it the phase when
countries rivaled one another, in order to achieve security and
power by acquiring the most destructive armaments," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a treaty freeing the Middle East from
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Israel is believed to be the only Mideast country which
possesses nuclear weapons. Egypt has urged the Jewish state to
join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
China, the United States, Britain and France, four of the
world's five nuclear powers, signed the two protocols attached to
the treaty, pledging not to use nuclear weapons against Africa or
undertake nuclear tests in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The fifth nuclear power, Russia, apparently had reservation
over Protocol I and Protocol II to the treaty and did not sign
them. But it was expected to sign later.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told a press conference
after the signing ceremony that Russia did not refuse to sign, but
only postponed its signing of the protocols.
</P>
<P>
A number of African countries including Liberia, Somalia and
Seychelles did not sign the treaty today. Some of them, however,
were expected to sign soon.
</P>
<P>
In a message read by his personal representative Vladimir
Petrovsky at the signing ceremony, U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali said that the establishment of an African
nuclear-weapon-free zone would advance global disarmament norms
and contribute to efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and strengthen the international non-proliferation regime.
</P>
<P>
The treaty "will accelerate the stride toward a world free from
nuclear weapons," the message said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, current Chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), also sent a message to the
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In the message read by Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin, Zenawi hailed the treaty, saying that it "is not only in
the interest of Africa, but also in the interest of all peoples
and countries."
</P>
<P>
The treaty signed today is the third such regional pact after
the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin
American and the Caribbean and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone
Treaty.

MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Destructive mudflows will continue
for the next 15 years in three southern Luzon provinces since some
200 million cubic meters (mcm) more of pyroclastic materials are
still deposited on the slopes of Mt. Pinatubo.
</P>
<P>
According to an assessment report of the Philippine Institute

Pinatubo erupted in 1991.
</P>

Scientists noted that some two billion cubic meters of
pyroclastic materials were spewed by Mt. Pinatubo since 1991 but
most of them will remain embedded on its slopes.

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has urged
Party and government leaders in all localities to give strategic
priority to the popularization of the nine-year compulsory
education and the elimination of illiteracy among youths and
adults.
</P>
<P>
Li, also member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, stressed the importance of basic education in enhancing
the quality of the whole Chinese people in an article to mark the
tenth anniversary of China's Compulsory Education Law.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that the Compulsory Education Law adopted
by the Fourth Session of the Sixth National People's Congress in
April 1986 is a basic law promoting and guaranteeing the sound and
healthy development of the country's basic education.
</P>
<P>
He said that great attention should be paid to three main
aspects: the popularization of nine-year compulsory education,
elimination of illiteracy among youths and adults and financial
input into basic education.
</P>
<P>
Li said that since most of the country's primary schools and
kindergartens are in the countryside, the governments at county
level have particularly important roles to play in this respect.
</P>
<P>
In his article the vice-premier wrote that priority in basic
education should still be given to educational reforms,
enhancement of educational quality and improvement of the
qualifications of teaching staff.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to develop normal education and
check promiscuous collection of fees for compulsory education, the
vice-premier added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri affirmed that China and Lebanon are linked together by
friendly ties, and that he highly appreciates China's support for
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This came in an interview that Hariri had at noon today in
Beirut with a visiting Chinese Women delegation headed by Huang
Qizao, Vice Chairwoman of All-China Women's federation.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be visiting China in a couple of months .. something that
 I have long been wishing to do. During my coming visit to China
I'll have talks with Chinese officials on ways of developing
bilateral cooperation between the two countries," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is a small country, but it is a gateway to the East
and can play some role in the Middle East. Lebanon is currently
reconstructing itself in order to be a financial, trade, cultural
and tourist center in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hariri affirmed that Lebanese women play a major
role in several fields, calling on Lebanese women to participate
more actively in political life.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qizao briefed Prime Minister Hariri on the ties linking
Chinese women with their Lebanese counterparts, referring to the
positive participation of Mme. Elias Hrawi in the Fourth
International Day of Women held in the Chinese capital Beijing
last September.
</P>
<P>
"Through their current visit to Lebanon, the Chinese Women
delegation managed to acquaint themselves with the history and
culture of Lebanon. The reconstruction achievements secured by the
Lebanese people have had a remarkable impression on members of the
delegation," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the visiting Chinese Women delegation have felt
the role played by Lebanese women in all fields, which indicates
that the Lebanese government is interested in the cause of women.
</P>
<P>
Concluding, Huang affirmed that China respects the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon,
and that China is interested in the role played by Lebanon in the
Middle East peace process, and that China calls for implementing
the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls on Israel to
withdraw its troops from a border enclave in southern Lebanon.
</P>

The Chinese Women delegation arrived in Beirut on April 8 for
a six-day visit to Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
said today that China and France should establish a long-term
strategic partnership and view the development of bilateral
relations from worldwide and Sino-European perspectives.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with French Foreign Minister Herve De
Charette in Paris this morning, Li said that Asia and Europe have
the potential for promising and mutually-beneficial economic
cooperation since Asia, including China, is rich in natural
resources and has a huge potential market, while Europe is a
technologically advanced and strong economic power.
</P>
<P>
He said it is entirely natural for China and France to have
different opinions on certain issues due to their different
national conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, "so long as the two countries increase their dialogue
based on equality and mutual respect, any problems in the way of
bilateral relations will be solved," the Chinese premier stated.
</P>
<P>
Li added that bilateral consultations at various levels will be
beneficial to promoting mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
The premier said his visit to France has gone smoothly and many
cooperation documents have been signed. He hopes the visit will
further bilateral cooperation in a number of fields.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said the French government attaches great
importance to strengthening its ties with China and priority has
been given to the development of Franco-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that new achievements have been made in trade and

<HEADLINE> Big Drop in College Candidates in Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The slump in the Hungarian
economy has stifled the development of education and led to a
decline in college candidates this year, Hungary's education
authorities have claimed.
</P>
<P>
As the Hungarian government decided to "downsize" educational
institutions, 5,500 teachers lost their jobs and another 30,000
are at risk. The number of college candidates wanting to major in
education and teaching also declined this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of people applying for college fell by nine percent
to 79,000 as compared with the figure last year.
</P>
<P>
But majors associated with well-paid jobs like law, economics,
business management and medicine remain popular in the context of
a continuous fall in residents' average income for years.

coverage to more workers in a more economical way.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping to Attend Various Functions of PC Panels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, vice-chairman of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), arrived here late this afternoon to attend
advice-seeking functions organized by the Selection Committee
Panel and Economy Panel.
</P>
<P>
In his written speech delivered at the airport, Lu, also
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State
Council, said that the Selection Committee Panel's efforts in
seeking advice from various sectors in Hong Kong are meant to
implement the Preparatory Committee's principle of "catering to
Hong Kong people and relying on Hong Kong people."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that the Hong Kong people will take
part in the various preparatory work for the establishment of the
Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Selecting Committee is to be responsible for selecting the
first chief executive and the members of the Provisional
Legislative Council, according to the Decision on the Method for
the Formation of the First Government and the First Legislative
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region adopted by
the Third Session of the Seventh National People's Congress and
the Preparatory Committee's Decision on the Establishment of the
Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the Preparatory Committee holds
seeking-advice meetings in Hong Kong after it was established in
Beijing in January.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee Panel will hold 16 meetings on April
13 and 14 and more than 1,000 people from 300 Hong Kong-based
associations and societies have received invitation to attend the
meetings.

<P>
In referring to the Selection Committee's tasks, he said that
it is to shoulder the dual responsibility of recommending a
candidate for first chief executive of the SAR and choosing the
provisional legislative council through elections.
</P>
<P>
Because the specific method of choosing the Selection Committee
is a matter of common concern to the various circles of Hong Kong
residents, he said, adding that many people have suggested that
the Preparatory Committee hold consultations on it in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Preparatory Committee's chairman and
vice-chairmen it was decided that consultations to be conducted in
Hong Kong will help in gathering opinions of various people in
Hong Kong and make the specific method of choosing the Selection
Committee fit the actual situation of Hong Kong better, he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the major consultants, Chen said the
Selection Committee panel has invited representatives of nearly
400 organizations to participate in the consultations, most of
them from influential organizations with broad public recognition.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the National People's Congress and members
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference from Hong Kong, advisors on Hong Kong
affairs, and former holders of political office have also been
invited, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
He said that some organizations cannot participate in the
consultations for the time being, but he hoped they can put forth
opinions by other means, including in written form.
</P>
<P>
"The Preparatory Committee's channels for discussion are always
open to the Hong Kong people," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the consultations and the panel meetings
will bring the Preparatory Committee closer to the people of Hong
Kong and will gain their support.

<HEADLINE> Israel Escalates War To Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli air force today
launched strikes at Hezbollah (Party of God) targets in southern
Beirut, first ever since the 1982 Lebanon War, reported Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the attack in a
statement, saying that the air force helicopters armed with
missiles, rocketed the main operation center of the Shiite Moslem
guerrilla group Hezbollah in southern Beirut. The building was
used by the organization to plan and coordinate attacks against
northern Israeli population centers as well as IDF and allied
South Lebanon Army forces in the Israel-occupied "security zone."
The pilots reported accurate hits.
</P>
<P>
The residents in the northern regions bordering Lebanon
evacuated their children this morning for fear of Katyusha rocket
attacks by Hezbollah in retaliation. In Kiryat Shmona, children
began to be evacuated to the center of the country. The military
authorities instructed the local people to go into their bomb
shelters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, according to an announcement from the IDF spokesman's
office, Israeli air force planes attacked Hezbollah logistics base
in Baalbeck, Bekaa Valley, early this morning. Later, shortly
before 7 a.m., planes struck buildings used for Hezbollah
operations in Mizrat Ein Abu Sawar, north of Nabatiya.
</P>
<P>
Two Lebanese government soldiers were wounded in the Israeli
air attacks this morning, according to a report from Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, Chief of General Staff, warned
that the Lebanese government must decide how it should act. He
told the Israel Radio that Israel has no interest in hurting
Lebanese armymen. But he argued that Israeli troops were forced
to respond when Lebanese army fired anti-aircraft missiles at
Israeli helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ehud Barak summoned the U.S. Ambassador to
Israel, Martin Indik, to brief him on the situation in
Lebanon. Barak said that the Lebanese government is the political
address for everything that is happening in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak threatened that no place in Lebanon is immune as long as
Hezbollah activities continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chen Ziying, deputy
secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), said here today that the
Preparatory Committee is concerned with the basic interests of the
six million Hong Kong people, and expects participation and
support from them.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is the first time for the committee to go to
Hong Kong to conduct consultations and hold panel meetings there
since it was established in January. This demonstrates the
committee's strong belief in democracy, in relying on the Hong
Kong people, and in adhering to "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong", he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Hong Kong this afternoon to take part in
consultations on the specific method of forming the Selection
Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, he
told Xinhua that the Hong Kong SAR has a high-degree of autonomy
under the principle of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
At the Preparatory Committee's first plenary session, which was
held last January, Chinese Vice-Premier and Chairman of the
Preparatory Committee Qian Qichen pointed out that the committee
must adhere to the principle of "taking ourselves as the mainstay"
and "catering to the Hong Kong people and relying on them."
</P>
<P>
This requires that each decision of the Preparatory Committee
must be based on a wide-ranging consultation of the Hong Kong
people, Chen noted.

MAPUTO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A ship carring toxic chemicals is
heading for South Africa after several days of voyage in the
Mozambican Strait, according to a local press report here today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Mozambican official as saying that the
ship, which came from Kenya's port of Mombasa, neither cruised

Officials of Port Beira, Mozambique, said the ship, carrying
16 containers of pesticide and deteriorated medicines, had stayed

name and flag unknown, had been harboring at Beira port since
April 4.

Rechem International Services, a British shipping company
which is in charge of transporting these goods, promised that
there is no danger of toxic leaking in the ship.

<HEADLINE> EU Agricultural Income Up 4.2 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural income in the
European Union rose in real terms by 4.2 per cent last year to its
highest level for 20 years due to reform of the Common
Agricultural policy and higher prices.
</P>
<P>
But the rate of increase was much lower than 1994's 9.1 per
cent, figures from EUROSTAT, the European statistical office in
Luxembourg show.
</P>
<P>
Last year's rise masked wide differences between the 15 EU
member states. Agricultural income in Sweden showed the biggest
rise of 21.3 percent after a 9.5 percent fall in 1994, while at
the other end of the scale, income in Belgium fell 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom and Denmark followed Sweden with growth
rates of 15.2 percent and 12.2 percent respectively. Finland, the
Netherlands and Spain also saw their agricultural income fall.
</P>
<P>
EUROSTAT attributed the overall rise to continuing reform of
the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, particularly the upgrading of
compensation for falling cereal and cattle prices, and the
improvement in some agricultural markets due to falling output and
reductions in intervention stocks.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Mayor Vows to Improve Public Security Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- This Chinese capital will take
effective measures to "remarkably" improve its public security
situation, Mayor Li Qiyan said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Li said that earnest efforts by
governments at all levels and departments concerned have ensured
political and social stability in the capital during the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period, which ended last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Beijing's public security situation is not perfect, Li
said, noting that "the sense of security of the general public has
been weakened by a poor public security situation in some areas
and by a rise in serious crimes."
</P>
<P>
An official release shows that the public security bureau of
the Chinese capital cracked more than 10,000 criminal cases in
1995, of which over 6,000 were serious ones. It also shows that
the number of criminal offenders punished was up 5.7 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
In January and February this year, the number of criminal cases
placed on file for investigation and prosecution exceeded 1,000,
an increase of 12.2 percent over the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
A tough line has been adopted because of the seriousness of
robbery, random criminal activities, gangster activities, and a
surge in economic crimes such as fraud, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
Li said that efforts will be bolstered to crack down on crimes
involving violence, firearms, manufacturing and smuggling drugs
and those with gangster features.
</P>
<P>
"Severe punishment will be meted out to criminals that
seriously endanger public security so as to halt the surge in
cases of grave crimes," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He added that greater efforts will also be made to deal with
random criminal activities, such as robbery and theft of bicycles.
</P>
<P>
Also this year, supervision over the areas between the city
proper and the countryside, migrant ghettoes, newly-built
residential quarters and public areas will be enhanced, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the alertness against crimes against government
institutions, airports, railways, financial departments and
important storage facilities will also be increased, adding that
measures will be taken to confiscate illegal guns and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The mayor highlighted the role of neighborhood communities,
village committees and public security departments at the
grass-roots, and said that public-spirited model citizens fighting
against criminals should be publicized and rewarded handsomely.
</P>
<P>
The police should be strictly managed and their political and
professional qualities should be improved, Li said. He urged
governments at all levels and departments concerned to take more
responsibility for the public security situation in their
respective areas.
</P>
<P>
"Leading officials and those found directly accountable for
major security problems and serious fires will be prosecuted," Li
said.

<HEADLINE> US Evacuation Operation Continues In Monrovia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States marines today
continued the airlifting of Americans and foreign nationals from
Monrovia, capital of war-torn Liberia, with about 250 evacuees
brought to neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Many evacuees, looking shattered, complained that they had
"very little time to pack their belongings" before being whisked
off by helicopters to Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
They confirmed that sporadic fighting was still going on by
lunch time, saying the possibility of returning to calm is
"remote".
</P>
<P>
An official from an international relief agency said buildings
of many aid organizations including the World Food Program and
the Red Cross have been looted by soldiers of the warring
factions.
</P>
<P>
"When we do go back, we shall have to start from scratch," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Another evacuee said there is a danger of food shortage and an
outbreak of cholera as people have been drinking contaminated
water to survive.
</P>
<P>
Monrovia remains a "ghost city" with only gunmen belonging to
the warring factions parading the streets and letting off a
volley of random shots, they said.
</P>
<P>
General John Inienger, Commander-In-Chief of the West African
peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, said his forces are "still trying to
enforce" the ceasefire announced on Wednesday morning, but there
are doubts whether he will be successful.
</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of one of the faction leaders, Roosevelt
Johnson, is still unknown although press reports indicate he is
still holed up at the Barclay Training Center in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 people are said to have taken refuge in the
center where it is also believed a number of hostages are being
held.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's interim government last week announced the arrest of
Johnson on an alleged murder charge, which sparked off the
fighting, rioting and looting included, since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Freetown said the
evacuation is "progressing satisfactorily and that there has been
no hitch."
</P>
<P>
But he still cannot say how long the evacuation will last.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 450 U.S. residents, among nationals of
other foreign countries, in Freetown.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Six key military personnel in
the former military junta of Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio
will go abroad on study leave "without pay" and their leaves have
been endorsed by President Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
State house officials today confirmed this and said the six are
Brigadier General Bio, Lt Colonel Idriss Kamara, Lt Colonel
Karefa Kargbo, Lt Colonel Charles Mbayo, Lt Colonel John Gbondo
and Lt Colonel Reginald Glover.
</P>
<P>
Two leading members of the former junta, Lt Colonel Tom Nyuma

relatives said.
</P>
<P>
Bio has already left Freetown for "a short holiday" in Ghana
from where sources said he would proceed to France to study
French.
</P>
<P>
The other five have already travelled to the United States for
further studies, according to military aides.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here said funds for their travelling and
subsequent university tuition fees came from a special "good
governance fund" operated by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 19 out of the 68 ordinary members of parliament who
have been nominated for cabinet posts by President Kabbah are to
resign from the legislature today, parliamentary sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sierra Leone constitution, any
parliamentarian nominated for a cabinet post should resign his
seat in parliament before his nomination will be considered by a
special parliamentary appointment committee with the speaker as
chairman.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Leads in Raising Chinese Yew Seedlings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
has made bigger progress in cultivating yew seedlings and yew
planting, as a result of four years' unremitting efforts by local
authorities and scientists.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of March this year Yunnan had
raised 3.2 million Chinese yew seedlings, which are all expected
to be planted across the province within the year.
</P>
<P>
Yew is a kind of rare plant worldwide. Taxol extracted from the
tree's bark is an ingredient in an anti-cancer synthetic drug made
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
There are 11 kinds of yew trees in the world, and China has
five of them. Four kinds grow in Yunnan, and have the highest
content of taxol, reaching 10 per ten thousand units.
</P>
<P>
To better protect and enrich yew resources in the province a
group of scientists have been sent to investigate the distribution
of yew trees in seven ecological zones of the province's 27
counties. Research on artificially raising yew seedlings has
proved successful.
</P>
<P>
The province has so far set up yew seedling raising bases in
six prefectures and counties. In 1995, a total of 74.4 hectares of
yew trees were planted in Lijiang County.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan plans to plant 7,380 hectares of yew trees in the next
15 years.

<HEADLINE> Australian Employment Rate Drops in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia's employment fell in
March after three consecutive months of growth.
</P>
<P>
The volatility of the labor market surprised local economists,
who expected employment to increase in March.
</P>
<P>
The total number of employment dropped by 55,300 in the month,
while the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percent to 8.5 percent
seasonally adjusted from 8.4 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The participation rate, or the proportion of working-age
persons who have or seek a job, also dropped to 63.4 percent from
63.8 percent in the previous month, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) said today.
</P>
<P>
Federal Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth
Affairs Amanda Vanstone blamed the rise of unemployment on the
previous Labor government's maladministration of the labor market.
</P>
<P>
She said that a new set of policies are needed to revigorate
the labor market.
</P>
<P>
But local economists said that the unemployment figures were
consistent with the softening of the economy. In trend terms, both
 employment and unemployment remained basically unchanged in March
over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
They expected employment to bounce back in the latter half of
the year as the economy continued to grow at 3-4 percent annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Exhibition of 45 pieces
of paintings of a well-known Chinese artist, Guan Shanyue, is to
begin here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The four-day exhibition will display part of the works Guan
painted between 1939 and 1996. Most of the works are mountains and
waters and figures of traditional Chinese paintings.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1912 in Guangdong Province, Guan fled to Macao during
the period of the Japanese aggression into China in the 1930s. He
painted many pieces to show his determination of fighting against
the Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
In 1939, his first personal exhibition of paintings of
anti-Japanese invasion was held in Macao. And the current is his
second personal exhibition in more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Guan has traveled to many parts of China and become a well-known
artist for his co-work for the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
The "Beautiful Scenery of China" co-painted with Fu Baoshi, another
well-known artist, has been rendered as a "World Famous Piece" by
the Japanese media.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference today, the 84-year-old artist said that he
plans to paint a series of Chinese mountains and waters in the
remaining years of his life.
</P>
<P>
"I want to go to more places in China and paint at least one
piece a year," he said. "I have a strong desire to depict more
beautiful sceneries of my motherland."

The statement said that an Israeli helicopter opened fire at a
Lebanese position near the southern Lebanese port city of
Sour. The Lebanese troops fired with anti-air weapons at Israeli
warplanes.
</P>

Lebanese security sources reported that two Israeli jet
fighters carried out at dawn today an air raid at the guerrilla
base of Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Beqaa Valley in eastern
Lebanon.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Tensions escalate in south Lebanon following Hezbollah
guerrillas fired some 14 Katyusha rockets into the Galilee
panhandle in northern Israel on Tuesday morning, wounding 36 local
Jewish residents, in a revenge for the killing of a 16-year-old
Lebanese kid and the wounding of three other civilians by a mine

SHENYANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Rural industries have become the
most dynamic part of Liaoning Province's economic development in
this old industrial base in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The province has approved 60,000 township and village
enterprises which absorbed 40 percent of the province's total
rural workforce.
</P>
<P>
The output value of rural industry now accounts for 40 percent
of the province's total. Over half of added value during the
country's Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95) was generated by rural
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Rural industries in Shenyang City, which has a large number of
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, yielded an output
value of 50 billion yuan, accounting for half of the city's total
industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Rural industries have benefitted from full government support,
said Wen Shizhen, governor of Liaoning. Since the beginning of
1990s, the local government backed the growth of rural industry
while restructuring the state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of reforms in operations and property rights, many
rural firms shifted from simple production to high-tech
development, and some have formed enterprise groups, paving the
way for integrated urban-rural cooperation.

HONG KONG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government officials
and senior Hong Kong civil servants held their ninth informal
get-together here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing after the meeting, Zheng Guoxiong,
vice-director of Xinhua News Agency HK Branch, said that keeping
Hong Kong's disciplinary forces stabilized is extremely
significant for Hong Kong's social stability and social order,
especially for the smooth transition in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and leaders have time and again
explained the policies toward civil servants working in the
disciplinary forces, the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) has put forward ideas and
suggestions on stabilizing the contingent and system of Hong Kong
civil servants, especially on matters of concern to the
disciplinary forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's policies toward the disciplinary forces
in Hong Kong, assuring civil servants in the disciplinary forces
that their job is to perform duties according to the law or
government directions and that they do not need to bear any
political responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He said civil servants at different levels in the disciplinary
forces can continue to stay after 1997, except for a few senior
officers who will be appointed in line with the related provisions
of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The existing interests, service conditions, disciplines and
management systems of the disciplinary forces will basically
remain unchanged, he said.
</P>
<P>
It should be legally ensured that the disciplinary forces are
able to effectively protect social order and crack down on all
kinds of criminal activities, as provided for in the Basic Law, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said there will be no interference from any mainland
departments to the undertakings of Hong Kong disciplinary forces,
and communications and cooperation will be carried out on the
basis of mutual respect for the two legal systems.
</P>
<P>
"We hope and believe that all civil servants at different
levels in the disciplinary forces can keep their mind on their
work and continue to serve the SAR government and Hong Kong people
after 1997," he said.

ANKARA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Four Iranian diplomats, who are
accused of having links with political assassinations in Turkey,
are preparing to leave the country, an Iranian Embassy official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has claimed that the four were involved in the killing
of a leading Turkish newspaper's editor-in-chief, a named
advocate of secularism, and the killing of some Iranian
dissidents living in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Tehran has rejected the charges and reciprocated Ankara
Tuesday by announcing four Turkish diplomats based in Iran were
involved in espionage and convert activities.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has decided to withdraw as soon as possible the four
diplomats "for their own security" and expressed deep resentment
for Iran's move which was proved to be a "cold shower" during a
senior Turkish diplomat's crucial visit to Tehran for "political
consultations."
</P>
<P>
The local Anatolia news agency quoted the Iranian Embassy as
saying that Turkey had put no deadline for their withdrawal but
hinted that they would leave at the same time when the four
accused Turkish diplomats leave Iran.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Deputy Foreign Undersecretary Ali Tuygan flied back
from Tehran this morning. He will report the outcome of his visit
and discuss in the Foreign Ministry the "unexpected tension"

<HEADLINE> Seminar on China's Economic Situation Held in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 Hong Kong
businessmen today attended a seminar titled "the Outlook of
Chinese Economy 1996," a common concern among the people in Hong
Kong and the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech this morning, Tsang Hin-chi, chairman of
the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said that Hong Kong's
economic situation is now becoming closely related to the economic
development in the Chinese mainland and the development trend of
the Chinese mainland will produce a huge impact on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1996, China will take new measures in curbing
inflation, absorbing overseas investment and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, Zhang Sai, director-general of the State
Statistical Bureau, delivered a key-note speech on a review of
1995 and an outlook for 1996.
</P>
<P>
On the favorable conditions for 1996, he said that firstly the
bumper harvest of agriculture in 1995 lays a richer material
foundation for China's economic development, particularly for
curbing its inflation.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said, in 1995 China's macro-economic relations
were well coordinated. On this basis, the national economy is
capable of having a healthy development.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, an overall recovery of the international economy,
particularly the high economic growth rate in the region of East
Asia, provides China with a broader international space for its
economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the existing unfavorable factors including
the high inflation rate which will constrain the high economic
development in China, some enterprises in difficult operation
which will weaken the vitality of micro-economy, and the weakness
of agriculture which is not expected to withstand the attacks of
the large scale natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ingenious point for China to implement the
policy of macro-economic regulation and control in 1996 will be,
to the largest extent, to have a full play of the favorable
factors and to curb the impacts by the unfavorable factors so as
to promote China's economic development in a continuos, well
coordinated and sound way.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate in 1996 should be maintained at eight
percent and the Retail Price Index (RPI) be controlled around 10
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, Qin Chijiang, head of the Research Institute of
Finance of the People's Bank of China, Liu Xiangdong, assistant to
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Mary Wong,
assistant director of Hong Kong Trade Development Council, also
delivered speeches on the topics about the convertibility of
Renminbi, reform and adjustment of import and export taxation
policies, and the relations between China and Hong Kong economy.

</P>
<P>
There are 14 air routes between the two countries, 33 regular
flights and even more charter flights each week, compared with two
to three routes before the founding the Commonwealth of
Independent States in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Three Russian carriers -- Aeroflot, Volga-Dnepr Airlines and
Samara Airlines -- and three Chinese ones -- Air China, China
Northern Airlines and Xinjiang Airlines -- are operating on the
Sino-Russian routes, compared with only two before 1991.
</P>
<P>
Destinations on the routes include the seven Russian cities of
Moscow, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, Khabarovsk, Chita, Samara and
Ulyanovsk, and the six Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin and Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
The northern China city of Hailar and the southern one of
Shenzhen are soon to become new points on the routes.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 charter flights from Russia to China have soared,
with more and more Russians coming to China for sight-seeing and
trading, Wu said, adding that the number of charter flights can
reach over 200 a month.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics from CAAC show that about 120,000
passengers traveled on the Sino-Russian routes last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a Sino-Russian air service pact and two following
memoranda, carriers of the two countries can operate a total of 34
passenger routes and 19 cargo ones, and each party can operate up
to 80 flights each week.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Junlin, a CAAC official in charge of international
relations, said the two governments encourage more bilateral air
traffic, and the current agreement will provide sufficient space
for the development of the Sino-Russian air transport market in
the next five to ten years.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Peasants Not Worry About Medical Expense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- When Zhao Honglan, a peasant in
Kaifeng County, central China's Henan Province, was sent to
hospital with heart disease she did not have to worry about
footing the bill.
</P>
<P>
It was all thanks to the medical co-operation system adopted in
the province.
</P>
<P>
"It was the medical co-operation system that offered me a
helping hand by providing more than 3,000 yuan for my treatment."
said Zhao, a beneficiary of the system, who pays only 12 yuan
annually, but can enjoy reduced payments for 200 medical items
when seeing a doctor.
</P>
<P>
Zhao is one of an increasing number of peasants in Henan
benefiting from the system.
</P>
<P>
As one of the counties which led the country in medical
co-operation system, Kaifeng boasts 640,000 participants in the
system, which is more scientific and effective compared with
before.
</P>
<P>
Medical expense funds are jointly invested by the state,
collectives and individuals, with individuals covering the bulk of
the total.
</P>
<P>
Annually, every individual pays between five to 22 yuan, based
on the economic level of individual villages, and the will of the
people.
</P>
<P>
They are then able to enjoy various medical compensations, from
total exemption, partial exemption to risk compensation.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the participants of the system may enjoy
reduced payments in 80 to 100 items when seeing a doctor.
</P>
<P>
On the wall beside cash counter in every hospital within the
coverage of the medical co-operation system, detailed forms
explain payment reductions.
</P>
<P>
Participants, therefore, at a glance, can understand how much
reduction they can enjoy, a privilege which Chinese peasants have
never enjoyed before.
</P>
<P>
Shi Yongbing, a peasant who has just undergone a stomach
operation, said, " Had I not been a participant in the
co-operation system, I would have to pay 300 yuan for the
operation."
</P>
<P>
"But I enjoyed a payment reduction of some 200 yuan for this
operation, which is much more than the annual fee of 55 yuan that
my whole family of five has paid." he said.
</P>
<P>
Like peasants in most Chinese villages, peasants in Kaifeng
County used to worry about seeing a doctor in the past, just
because their low incomes could not meet great medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the rural medical co-operation system,
according to a relevent department of the county, not only
benefits peasants, but also benefits local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The hospitals can now afford to update facilities, and bring in
more technical personnels simply because, with the assistance from
the medical co-operation committees, most peasants could pay the
much lower expenses which they used to owe to the hospitals.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Over one and a half million poor
people in east China's Shandong Province are living better lives
thanks to an anti-poverty drive of the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
Although considered an economic powerhouse, Shandong still had
3.2 million people living below the poverty line in 1994, with an
annual income of less than 850 yuan. Most of these people live in
mountainous or remote areas that have been hit by various kinds of
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, people in these areas got access to electricity and
communications for the first time, linking them with other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Local government assisted farmers in harnessing rivers and
developing forestry with funds and technology.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province allocated 78.7 million yuan in 138
aid-the-poor projects in agriculture, cultivation, and side-line
products, said Meng Qingzhong, deputy director of the provincial
anti-poverty office.
</P>
<P>
As a result, per capita annual income of farmers in the 19
poorest counties in Shandong rose to 1,305 yuan last year, 356
yuan more than the previous year's figure, Meng said, adding the
growth rate was the highest in the past decade.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Higher interest rates and a
stronger peso are expected in the Philippines as the government
revised its macroeconomic assumptions for this year.
</P>
<P>
The inter-agency Development Budget Coordination Council (DBCC)
used a higher interest rate assumption of 13 percent for 1996 from
its earlier assumption of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Weighted treasury bill rates stood at 12.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that the adjustment in the interest
rate assumption was made in view of the increasing cost of money
during the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DBCC also used a new foreign exchange assumption
of 26.75 peso to a US dollar.
</P>
<P>
The council, however, confirmed its internal target for the
growth of gross national product (GNP) at 6.5 percent to 7.5
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It also maintained its programmed inflation rate of 7.5 percent
to 8.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The GNP and inflation targets confirmed by the DBCC were also
the targets presented to the International Monetary Fund during

TIANJIN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese companies are welcome to
be listed on Japan's stock market, said a senior Japanese
securities official.
</P>

Sadakane Doi, head of the Japan Securities Dealers Association,
during a recent visit to Tianjin.

get acquainted with Japanese financiers because it has plans to

<P>
Japan ranks fourth in foreign investment in Tianjin. Zhang said
he hopes that Doi will contribute to raising overseas funds for
Tianjin's enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Abducted West African Peacekeepers Freed In Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Soldiers of the West African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG in Liberia, held hostage by
gunmen in the wake of last weekend's renewed fighting were freed
on Wednesday by their captors, according reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The hostages and some 600 civilians were held due to fighting
between the ethnic Krahn fighters and other warring factions that
broke out on last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting occurred in the southeastern Sinkor district on
Saturday when Krahn fighters clashed with the Liberian police
trying to arrest Roosevelt Johnson, ousted leader of the Krahn
wing of the United Liberation Movement, who is wanted for murder.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ECOMOG field commander General Inienger made a
passionate plea to Johnson to hand himself over to ECOMOG, adding
that ECOMOG would ensure that justice was carried out.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations yesterday also expressed concern at the
latest developments in the war-torn Liberia.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the United States started the
airlift of American and other foreign nationals from Liberia by
midnight on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the warring parties respected a ceasefire
in their battered capital yesterday after four days of clashes,
brokered by ECOMOG and United Nations military observers late on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Stresses Cooperation With Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand sees more opportunities
for closer cooperation with Vietnam on investment as Thai Foreign
Minister Kasem S. Kasemsri will focus on the issue during his
official visit to Hanoi next week.
</P>
<P>
Kasem said on Wednesday that he would emphasize Thai
cooperation with Vietnam in the field of investment rather than
fisheries when he meets his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam
and other Vietnamese officials.
</P>
<P>
Kasem, who will head a delegation of senior officials and
businessmen to Vietnam on April 15-18, reiterated that he
supported investment cooperation, including establishment of joint
ventures, between the two countries as both countries will benefit
from it.
</P>
<P>
Yet local newspapers today said that Kasem also is expected to
touch on the thorny fisheries issue as well as to settle
overlapping maritime borders during his tour.
</P>
<P>
Kasem also said that Thailand had to change its role in
fisheries to benefit other countries that are its partners, but he
declined to elaborate, saying the matter is supervised by the
Fisheries Department.
</P>
<P>
The fisheries issue between the two countries stemmed from
fish-catching by Thai fishermen in Vietnamese waters. The two
sides are expected to meet later this month to seek ways,
including a joint patrol on the sea, to solve these problems.

<HEADLINE> Gold and Silverware Unearthed in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have unearthed a great deal of
gold and silverware from ancient tombs.
</P>
<P>
In Chifeng City in the eastern part of the region, workers
unearthed the earliest gold earring ever found in the country,
from a tomb dating back 4,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Gold cap and horse ornaments from some 2,000 years ago have
been found in many tombs scattered in the region. Experts say that
they belong to ancient nomadic tribes that roamed the grasslands.
</P>
<P>
Tang Dynasty (618-907) gold and silverware found in the region
include a valuable gilded silver cockscomb pot with a northern
tribe form and central Chinese decoration and a gilded silver
kettle combining Chinese form with Persian decoration.
</P>
<P>
"These suggest good cultural exchanges between the tribes and
their neighbors," experts say.
</P>
<P>
The best gold and silverware are, perhaps, those found in
imperial tombs of the Liao Dynasty (916-1125) which was
established by a northern nomadic tribe.
</P>
<P>
In the tomb for a princess and her husband, the experts found
silver burial suits worn by the imperial couple, a silver pillow
with golden flower design, gold masks, and other fine gold and
silver decorations.
</P>
<P>
In another tomb for the husband of a Liao princess, 1,000
different gold ornaments for one horse have been found, showing
the love of horses of the nomadic people, the experts say.

<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China would like to see a joint
effort with the US side in overcoming difficulties that exist in
Sino-US relations and to get them back on a steady, developmental
track.
</P>
<P>
The remarks come from the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman,
Chen Jian, speaking at a press conference here today, who was
asked to comment on the report that Sino-US ties have been
strained recently because of differences over the issues
concerning Taiwan, human rights, and nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
The recent difficulties in bilateral ties were neither created
by the Chinese side, nor did the Chinese side wish to see them,
Chen said. He noted that the key to overcoming the difficulties is
to adhere to the principles enshrined in the three Sino-US
communiques, especially those on mutual respect of sovereignty,
territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, so as to cope properly with the problems
existing in the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that maintaining healthy and stable ties between the
two countries is not only in the fundamental interests of the
peoples of China and the US, but also conducive to peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China has always attached great importance to the Sino-US ties
and has made unremitting efforts for the improvement and
development of bilateral relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
will meet and confer with US Scretary of State Warren Christopher
in Hague shortly, the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The first quarter of 1995,
Shanghai approved the first branch of a provincial bank, helped a
local bank open a branch in Beijing, became the headquarters of a
Thai bank, and approved branches of foreign financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
These measures are expanding the city's influence, and the
mayor, Xu Kuangdi, says that it will dramatically increase
inter-bank lending, foreign exchange, and securities trading in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The city's Foreign Exchange Trade System, linked with 23 major
cities by computer, has developed the system into a major index of
foreign exchange rates in China.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 companies from around the country are listed on
the Shanghai Stock Exchange, where over 500 securities firms and
more than seven million investors do business.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has increased the capital flow in other parts of
China, with daily transactions on the inter-bank lending market of
almost one billion yuan, bringing high returns from the Yangtze
River Delta.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Communications and the Pudong Development Bank,
both headquartered in Shanghai, have unveiled plans to move into
the Yangtze River Delta and major coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong Development Bank has affiliates in neighbouring
Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and will set up branches in
central, southwest and northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The close economic connection between Shanghai and cities of
the Yangtze River Valley has helped give Shanghai financial
muscle, analysts point out, and that the Shanghai Branch of the
People's Bank of China has helped turn Shanghai into a national
financial center.
</P>
<P>
The branch has a capital management system, a financial
supervisory system, and a framework to oversee foreign capital and
foreign-funded financial institutions, and has drawn up more than
10 regulations on checks.

<HEADLINE> Alliance To Merge With Tanzanian And Ugandan  Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Alliance, a joint airline
company of South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda, has publicly
floated a proposal to merge with Air Tanzania Corporation (ATC)
and Uganda Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Alliance Board of Directors, Adrian Sibo,
a Ugandan MP, said here during a dinner hosted by Tanzanian
Minister for Communications and Transport, William Kusila this
week, that his company wanted an interest in the successors.
</P>
<P>
"A merge in this respect would be the best option", Sibo said,
adding that both ATC and Uganda Airlines were earmarked for
privatization.
</P>
<P>
He was worrying that any privatization of the two airlines
leaving Alliance out would make the joint company vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Sibo further said Kenya should also be invited to
join the Alliance in reviving the East African aviation unit.
</P>
<P>
Sibo stressed aviation was an extremely competitive business
and that the Alliance needed political and economic support of
the member governments to survive.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was important for the Alliance to exploit the
lee way for other African countries to participate which was
provided in the Alliance-government accord, to acquire shares in
other African airlines and hence capture the entire African
market.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed the Zambian and Rwandan governments had indicated
interests to join the Alliance. He also said the newly born East
African Community had room and major role to play in
strengthening the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function Tanzanian Minister Kusila said
it was necessary for African airlines to unite and form a major
and powerful airline to compete with developed world airlines.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized, "There is no hope or future for small national
airlines. their days are numbered."
</P>
<P>
He also called on economically powerful African countries such
as South Africa to pull their "sisters" who were lagging behind by
cooperating with them in economic ventures and influence
provision of technological resource allocation to them.

<HEADLINE> A Few Steps Earn Dalian Women 1,000 Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Two women workers were given 1,000
yuan (about 120 US dollars) each for walking a few steps and not
stepping on a lawn in the coastal city of Dalian in northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
This is an unusual case of a company's honoring employees'
environmental protection awareness.
</P>
<P>
It happened just after 7:00 am on April 2, when some employees
of the Dalian Ocean Fishing Group Company were escorting children
to kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yi, general manager of the company, was standing in front
of the office building and counted 38 of the employees cutting
across to the kindergarten by walking on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
But, he also observed two women, Jiang Yuan and Yuan Mingying,
not walking across the lawn, but going a little bit "out of the
way" to take their children to kindergarten. When one child tried
to walk on the lawn, one of the women pulled him back off it.
</P>
<P>
Zhang decided that the women deserved a reward, and gave them
1,000 yuan each.
</P>
<P>
"The award is given in honor of their sense of environmental
protection," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the company invested three million yuan (about
360,000 dollars) last year in greening up the fishing port,
including planting more than 6,000 trees and 5,000 sq m of lawn.
</P>
<P>
It has decided to invest another 200,000 yuan this year in rare
trees and plants.

<HEADLINE> mee041105hke-- Israel Raids Hezbollah Bases inside Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli airplanes this morning
attacked several guerrilla bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, beside the town of Baalbek in the Beqaa Valley in
east Lebanon, an Israeli army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the strike took place just before 5:00
a.m. local time (2:00 GMT), and all Israeli airplanes returned
safely from the raid, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah reportedly has a number of training and operating
bases in the Beqaa Valley, a region where is under the control of
the Syrian army stationed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Lebanon quoted a Hezbollah official in Baalbek as
saying that two Israeli jets fired two rockets at a base used to
store anti-aircraft weapons near Baalbek, and there had been no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel radio report, Israeli airplanes and
artillery later also blasted Hezbollah positions near the port
town of Tyre and several other Lebanese cities and villages.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Israeli side of the border remained
quiet this morning, although residents were told to move into bomb
shelters and security rooms.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ori Orr stressed Wednesday
that a military operation in south Lebanon would not necessarily
bring quiet to the northern border of Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel would take actions to make the Lebanese
government realize that it is responsible for the escalation of
tension in south Lebanon and residents of villages there can no
longer be used as a human shield by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to elaborate on what Israel was planning
to do.
</P>
<P>
As Israeli leaders vowed to punish Hezbollah, Israeli army
Wednesday flew reconnaissance missions over south Lebanon amid
intensive military activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. sources in Lebanon said that Lebanese residents
of villages north of the "security zone" were reportedly fleeing
northward in anticipation of an Israeli military action.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Refuse to Meet Donors in Joint Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister
Rajko Kasagic has rejected a proposal that Serbs attend the donors
conference on April 12-13 in Brussels in the name of the Bosnian
delegation.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to High Representative for Bosnian Civilian Affairs
Carl Bildt, Kasajic said late Wednesday the "proposed formula is
unacceptable, because, according to the Dayton accord, there is no
joint body of Bosnia until the elections are held" in September.
</P>
<P>
"There are two entities -- Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat Federation, and the only link between them is the
Joint Commission. Therefore, if Bosnian Serb representatives
travel to Brussels, we seek separate representation and equal
treatment with the federation, as granted us under the Dayton
accord," Serb news agency SRNA quoted the letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
In response to Kasajic's letter, Bildt deplored the Serb
rejection and said that Republika Srpska no longer stood by the
agreement reached at the meeting of the interim Joint Commission
in the Serb town of Banja Luka on March 30 on how Bosnia's
different parties should be represented at the conference.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is no longer the international community excluding
Republika Srpska; it is Republika Srpska excluding itself," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The donors conference in Brussels on Friday is organized to
drum up international financial aid to help rebuild Bosnia after
more than three and a half years of war.

<HEADLINE> Cross Worshiped in China 1,000 Years Before Jesus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Cross was a symbol of worship
among grasslands Chinese people 1,000 years before Jesus was
crucified, archaeologists have revealed.
</P>
<P>
The clue to the discovery is a bronze cooking vessel, with
cross design from the Shang Dynasty (16-11th Century BC), which
was found a decade ago in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Painting-like inscriptions on the vessel, which were written
within a form of a cross, were deciphered until recently.
</P>
<P>
Lu Sixian, a leading archaeologist in the region, says that the
inscriptions were those used in ancient sacrificial rites for
people worshiping the universe.
</P>
<P>
"Cross represents four directions with an extended meaning of
the universe, " Lu says, adding that cross is also the outline of
the sacrificial sites.
</P>
<P>
Remains of such sacrificial rites can still be found in the
eastern part of the region.
</P>
<P>
"The culture of worshiping the cross has spread to other parts
of the world," he says, citing the offsprings of the Shang people
who went to the Americas about 3,000 years ago and built a
cross-shaped altar and universe chart.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment In HK Remains Robust: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Hong Kong
will remain fairly robust over the next two years thanks to
increasingly close ties to China, according to the latest Asian
Development Outlook released here today.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank, headquartered in Manila,
Philippines, launched today in Hong Kong its Outlook for 1996 and
1997, one of the bank's major publications that outlines economic
prospects for its member countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The bank's chief economist Dr. Vishvanath Desai said: "The
prospects for foreign investment in Hong Kong are fairly
positive."
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have been attracted by Hong Kong's
geographic proximity and links to China, as well as by its low tax
rates and open trading environment, according to the Outlook.
Recent declines in rents and property prices have also been
positive for foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Outlook warns that the strengthening of the US
dollar could dampen foreign investment by reducing Hong Kong's
competitiveness. Besides, Singapore is a keen competitor which
tends to divert foreign investment from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Outlook predicts Hong Kong's economic growth will weaken
slightly to 4.5 percent annually in 1996 and 1997, nearly one
percentage point less than in the previous year. The economic
development in China and links with the US dollar and US financial
markets will continue to be the principal influences on the
performance of the Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, as an entrepot center for China, will continue its
role in 1996 and 1997. According to the Asian Development Bank,
prospects for Hong Kong's external trade will be influenced
primarily by China's economic performance.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Likes to Confer With HK Chief Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, vice-chairman of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, likes to meet with chief secretary of the Hong Kong
government, Anson Chan Fang On-Sang, to confer on making the
transition smooth for HK civil servants.
</P>
<P>
This message came from Chen Ziying, deputy secretary-general of
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, in an interview
with Xinhua here earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Chen cited Hong Kong's civil servants as an important force in
society, and said that keeping their situation stable will play an
important part in maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The Central government has always attached great importance to
this, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Basic Law stipulates, in Article 100, that public
servants in all Hong Kong government departments, including the
police, serving before the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
was established, may remain on the job and retain their seniority
with pay, allowances, benefits and conditions of service unchanged.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the central government's policy toward the
public servants is quite clear, he said. "We welcome the public
servants to keep their minds on their work and remain in Hong Kong
after 1997 so as to contribute more to Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability."
</P>
<P>
There are more than 180,000 public servants in Hong Kong. The
political affairs panel of the Preliminary Committee of the
Preparatory Committee has held four meetings, two of them in Hong
Kong, discussing the issue of public servants.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, who is also secretary-general of the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, and Chen Ziying left here for Hong
Kong this afternoon to take part in the consultations on the
specific methods for forming the Selection Committee of the Hong
Kong SAR.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Air Raid at Hezbollah Base in Beqaa Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli jet fighters carried
out at dawn today an air raid at a guerrilla base of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, at Kayal area in Beqaa
Valley in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Israeli army confirmed the dawn air raid,
saying that the Israeli warplanes launched the attack at a "big
Hezbollah base" near the Shiite Moslem stronghold of Baalbek city
in Beqaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
However, Hezbollah sources in Baalbek denied that any casualty
was caused by the air raid.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Israeli jet fighters attacked a base
used by the resistant guerrillas for storing anti-air weapons.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also mounted near 7:00 a.m. local time (04:00
GMT) three air raids at the hill of Mlita and Ein Bouswar at Iglim
Al-Toffah, a ridge often used by Lebanese Moslem guerrillas as a
springboard to launch attacks at the Israeli occupation forces in
the so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Following the air raids, Israeli helicopters flew at low
altitute over the attacked areas, searching suspected guerrilla
targets, security sources in south Lebanon reported.
</P>
<P>
The security sources also said that two Israeli military
helicopters opened fire at a Lebanese army check point at a south
entrance of the southern Lebanese port city of Sour.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces, from their positions in the
buffer zone carved by Israel in 1985, bombarded this morning
vicinities of a number of southern Lebanese villages in the
Nabatiyeh area.
</P>
<P>
A latest report coming from south Lebanon said that a military
vehicle of the Lebanese army in the area was hit and inflamed by a
shell in the morning bombardments, three Lebanese soldiers were
wounded, one of them was seriously injured and has been moved to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted an Israeli army statement as announcing
that the Israeli troops would attack any southern Lebanese village
where Hezbollah guerrillas launch Katyusha rockets, and any place
where activities of Hezbollah guerrillas are plotted.
</P>
<P>
The statement also warned southern Lebanese villagers not to
offer helps to militants of the Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for retaliatory attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas,
the Israeli army has ordered the Jewish settlers in northern
Israel to resort to underground shields, according to an Israel
Radio report.
</P>
<P>
The situation in south Lebanon became tense following Hezbollah
guerrillas fired Tuesday morning some 14 Katyusha rockets into the
Galilee panhandle in northern Israel, wounding 36 local Jewish
settlers, in a revenge for the killing of a 16-year-old Lebanese
girl and the wounding of other three civilians by a mine blast at
Barashit village in south Lebanon Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas Wednesday also carried out a series of attacks
at the Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon, killing one
Israeli soldier and wounded three others.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces, on the other hand, shelled continuously
and intensively a number of guerrilla targets in south Lebanon in
the past two days. And Israeli jet fighters also fired
air-to-surface missiles at suspected guerrilla bases.

<HEADLINE> Hot Weather Boosts Swimming Wear Sales in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand sees booming sales of
swimming suits in the country as more and more Thais turn to
beaches and swimming pools to escape the heat wave in the
summertime.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Farmers Bank's Research Center, the
swimming suit market in Thailand has been growing by 20 to 30
percent each year and the sales are expected to hit a new record
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Department has predicted that the
temperature might climb up to a 40-year record high of over 40
degrees centigrade later this month, said the research arm of the
Thai Farmers Bank.
</P>
<P>
The market value of swimming suits in Thailand is now estimated
at 1 billion baht (40 million US dollars), the center said.
</P>
<P>
Another factor that will help boost sales of swimming suits is
the popularity of swimming as a sport among teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Parents are encouraging their children to go swimming as they
believe swimming is one of the best exercises to keep their
children healthy, according to the center.

<HEADLINE> Nearly One-third of Chinese Live in Urban Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Continued quick economic growth
has accelerated urbanization of China's population, according to
the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that 28.85 percent of the national
population live in urban areas, 0.23 percentage points higher than
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had a total of 1.21 billion
people, 860 million of them living in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The bureau obtained the results from its one-percent national
population survey last year.
</P>
<P>
Data from the bureau showed that in 1949 when New China was
founded, only 10.64 percent of Chinese people lived in cities and
towns. The level of urban population among the total population
only started to rise dramatically from the late 1970's, when the
country adopted the policy of reform and opening to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here point out that China's urbanization of its
population is still a long way behind the developed countries,
where the rate is between 60-70 percent.
</P>
<P>
After all, they said, China is still an agricultural country.
</P>
<P>
An official from the bureau's population and employment
statistics department explained that it adopts a different method
of counting the numbers of urban people than from the public
securities authorities last year.
</P>
<P>
"People who don't have urban resident permits, but have lived
in the urban areas for more than half a year, are included in the
urban population," he noted, "while the public security
departments strictly counts the number of urban people in
accordance with their registered residence permits."

</P>
<P>
In his statement to the press yesterday, Mbabazi said, the
affected area is a stretch, lying between Keri and Oraba.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the SAF's flagrant attack on our territory",
Mbabazi said, "the Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) has
maintained their defence posture and are ready to defend our
territory should the SAF advance into Uganda."
</P>
<P>
He added, "the government of Uganda, in the strongest term,
condemns the actions of the Sudanese regime for their unprovoked,
naked acts of aggression." enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Dining in self-service
restaurants has become a fad among citizens in Yinchuan, capital
of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Since Hui people are Muslims, the dozen self-serve snack and
shaun-style restaurants opened in recent years here are all
Islamic, only offering food acceptable by the believers.
</P>
<P>
The clients, among them government employees, teachers, company
executives, workers and farmers, prefer quick-meals for their
convenience, hygiene, freedom of choice, economy and the elegant
environment of the restaurants, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
The first such restaurant in the inland city was opened by a
Malaysian two years ago. Business of the upbeat restaurant,
"Ludao" (blue island), is booming.
</P>
<P>
"It is well worth eating a ready-meal at 50 yuan (6.02 US
dollars) per person. I enjoy the meal, as well as the
environment", said Wu Xiang, a teacher, in Ludao.
</P>
<P>
The Ludao Restaurant usually receives 100 to 200 clients a day,

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: IOC's Concept Not Relevant In Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian prime minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today that the International Olympic
Committee's (IOC) concept that sports bodies should be free from
interference from any party, including political influence or
pressure, was no longer relevant in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's national news Agency Bernama reported from Langkawi,
an island in northern Malaysia, today that Mahathir made the
statement after he opened the national sports convention there.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the Malaysian national sports associations should
not be bound by this concept of IOC, and should accept the fact
that the government has a similar role in the nation's sports
development.
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes cannot understand the attitude of those leading
the sports associations. On the one hand they want to be
independent but on the other, they ask full aid from the
government," Mahathir said, adding most of the sports associations
would be crippled if the government did not extend its financial
aid or help to find sponsors for them.
</P>
<P>
Stressing Malaysians should view sports in their own
perspective and not blindly follow what others did, Mahathir
said:" I don't believe that the IOC would come to the aid of
sports associations in this country in their respective
development efforts."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said sports was a platform to unite the people and his
government would continue playing its role to achieve this
objective.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the government would continue its efforts,
especially in building the infrastructure and implementing sports
development programs, Bernama said.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia welcomes Malaysian
businessmen to tap its vast investment opportunities, visiting
Bosnian Minister of Foreign Trade and International Communications
Neven Tomic said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Petaling Jaya near here, Tomic said
that it was now good time to invest in Bosnia-Herzegovina to help
rebuild its economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the peace process and the inexpensive labor in Bosnia
would assure investors of good returns for their investments.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are in a transition period and we hope friends like
Malaysia will come to help us rebuild our economy," Tomic said.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that Malaysian businessmen could play a role
in reviving Bosnia's five industrial and commercial zones that
were destroyed during the war.
</P>
<P>
Tomic, in Malaysia on a six-day visit, said his country wanted
to build a new partnership with Malaysia, especially in business.
"That is why I'm here," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said next week's visit to Bosnia by Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad would pave the way for creating greater business
opportunities through joint ventures or direct investments.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,400 business projects damaged in the war need to be
reconstructed in Bosnia, said Tomic.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the World Bank, Bosnia-Herzegovina
needs 5.1 billion US dollars in the first three years of its
reconstruction programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Manchurian Tiger Park has
become a roaring success after attracting increasing numbers
of 'safari' visitors.
</P>
<P>
The park, which opened this year in Harbin, capital of
northeastern Heilongjiang Province, is located one km north of Sun
Island, a scenic spot in Harbin.
</P>
<P>
It covers a million square meters and is the first and largest
of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The park is aimed at training Manchurian tigers to adapt to the
natural environment in the wilderness before being returned to the
forest eventually. It is also aimed at developing people's love
for wildlife.
</P>
<P>
So far 30 Manchurian tigers and 10 cubs inhabit the park, all
supplied by the China Hengdaozi Breeding Center for the Cat Family.
</P>
<P>
At present, tourists can tour the park in six mini-buses and
two travel vans, accompanied by a jeep full of live sheep, cows,
chickens and ducks, which are used as the bait of the tigers.
</P>
<P>
Manchurian tigers, which live in northeast China and Russia's
Siberia, have been listed as one of the ten animal species on the
verge of extinction by the World Wildlife Fund.

equipment to receive TV station transmissions.
</P>
<P>
China Resources Hotel has also been caught during a clampdown
by telecommunications officials in China's capital city.

<HEADLINE> Four Die of Gas Poisoning in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 80 people were gas
poisoned and four - a child and three adults - died between April
6 and 8 in the Chinese capital when they had baths at home, using
gas-fired water geysers.
</P>
<P>
The local public health bureau and gas company have started an
emergency investigation into this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The problem emerged last weekend when 37 local adults and 12
children went to the hospital suffering from nausea, vomiting and
nervous shock after taking baths in their homes.
</P>
<P>
A day later, on April 7, another 23 adults and eight children
went to the hospital for the same reason, but two of the children
died later.
</P>
<P>
On April 8, four members of one family were also rushed to the
hospital for help. Later one old man lost consciousness, and two
adults died.
</P>
<P>
The medical check found all the people suffered from carbon
monoxide poisoning after they took bath at home with gas geysers.
</P>
<P>
However, relatives of the victims argued that when they bathed,
they had already watched out for gas poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Some experts expressed doubts about the quality of the gas
geysers, while others blamed unventilated rooms.
</P>
<P>
They urged the gas geyser users to immediately fix and
frequently clean ventilating vans fixed to the geysers.

<HEADLINE> Rice Fields Become a Golden Touch for Tangshan Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Golden beaches have provided
a bowl full of cash for rice-growing farmers in north China's
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Since they created rice fields out of salty beaches their
income has gone up more than fourfold in just a few years.
</P>
<P>
Now farmers in neighboring areas are turning to beaches to
boost their wealth.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, farmers from Caozhuangzi Township,
Tangshan City, Hebei Province, pooled eight million yuan to
transform about 2,700 hectares of salty beaches into productive
rice fields.
</P>
<P>
Caozhuangzi's practice has quickly spread to other parts of
Tangshan City.
</P>
<P>
Local governments, building irrigation channels, encouraged
farmers to pool money to dig ditches so that waste and low-yield
land could be turned into rice fields.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan farmers have raised 160 million yuan to build small
water conservancy projects, which accounts for over 80 percent of
all funds spent on the sector.
</P>
<P>
The projects so far have increased Tangshan's acreage of rice
fields by 67,000 ha. The city now has 40 plots of rice paddies of
over 670 ha, as well as 200 plots of over 67 ha.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Tangshan reaped 3.2 billion kg of grain in 1995,
500 million kg more than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The rice fields in Caozhuangzi, scoring an average per-hectare
output of 9,000 kg, help to raise the township's annual income per
head from 500 yuan in 1991 to 2,800 yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> Skyscrapers, Modern Urban Landscape Pudong's Attractions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- People visiting Shanghai's
Pudong these days may find it hard to believe that skyscrapers and
and modern urban landscape has risen on an area that was farmland
only six years ago.
</P>
<P>
There are two highway bridges and three tunnels linking Pudong
with the downtown area as part of a 200-kilometer highway network.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, one-third of foreign-funded projects
in the Jinqiao Export-oriented Processing Zone had gone into
production and had an annual output value of 1.5 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone is home to more than 400
foreign-funded enterprises engaged in international and transit
trade, and progress has been made in the Zhangjiang High-tech
Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
Improved investment conditions, the booming economy, and social
stability have attracted some 7,900 enterprises from other parts
of the country and 3,700 enterprises from 53 countries and regions
with a total investment of 15 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw Pudong exporting more than 2.47 billion US
dollars worth of goods, accounting for 21 percent of Shanghai's
total, and a GDP reaching 41.2 billion yuan, accounting for 17
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Per capita GDP last year there was 27,000 yuan, 9,000 yuan more
than Shanghai's average.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that the number of foreign-funded projects
and the amount of their investment in the first three months of
this year rose by 5.56 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively,
over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded banking organizations began moving from Puxi, in
the downtown area of Shanghai, to Pudong after an announcement was
made in late March allowing foreign-funded banks in Shanghai to
open branches in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
To date, Pudong has 29 foreign trade organizations from other
municipalities, provinces and central government departments, and
it plans to run three to four joint sino-foreign trade enterprises
on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
It will also focus on developing high-tech industries to
increase its GDP to 53 billion yuan this year, an increase of 20
percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 billion US dollars has been invested in
infrastructure, including an airport, information service, and
Subway Line Two. A 500,000-line telephone switching capacity and
satellite communication projects have been completed, and 14
regulations and rules on competition and protecting the interests
of investors have been worked out.

<HEADLINE> 65 Children Poisoned by Bread in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-five Chinese children have
been poisoned in Haikou, capital of the island province of Hainan,
after eating virus-infected bread.
</P>
<P>
 But officials say that none of them are in danger, and 52 of
them have now left hospital after treatment.
</P>
<P>
 The event started around 5pm on April 8 when the Hainan
People's Hospital received one poisoned child after another from
the local Guomao Kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
Within a short time 65 children from the kindergarten had been
rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
Many of the children had signs of poisoning, with high fever,
deep sleep or coma, sluggishness, stomach pains, diarrhoea and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
Medical checks found the bread that the children had eaten was
contaminated with a virus.
</P>
<P>
According to the director of the kindergarten, the 140 slices
of bread were bought from a privately-owned bakery a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
At 2:30 pm on April 8, the bread was eaten by 130 children in
the kindergarten, and just over two hours later the first were
showing signs of poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the local epidemic prevention center went to the
bakery and found it had no legal licence, and was operating in an
insanitary condition. It was immediately closed by the authority.
</P>
<P>
Officials say the case has aroused great concern in the city,
and in the province as a whole, with vows from authorities to
tighten the management on bakeries and kindergartens.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Brain Cancer Patients Alive Three Years After Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors have succeeded in
markedly extending the life of patients suffering from malignant
brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
Some patients receiving comprehensive treatment in a north
China hospital are still alive three years later.
</P>
<P>
Traditional treatments for the malignancies involve craniotomy,
or brain operation to cut tumors from opened skulls, together with
radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative medical statistics in the United States show that
patients afflicted with malignant brain glioma lived 17 weeks on
the average with mere craniotomy operation, and they survived 37.5
weeks with the operation and radiotherapy combined, or 51 weeks
together with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Senior brain doctor Wang Zhaoming and tumor doctor Liu Lingyi
from the No.2 Central Hospital in northern China's Tianjin City
have now treated malignant brain tumors more successfully.
</P>
<P>
First they operated to cut malignant tumors from the brain, and
during the process microwave heat therapy was introduced, and
then a small stretch of tube containing iridium-192 was put near
the tumor bed to administer radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Mini-cruises along China's Haihe
River have become a trump card to attract overseas tourists to
Tianjin, the country's third largest city.
</P>
<P>
The day-long land and river tour, covering 83 kilometers, gives
tourists a glimpse of the port city and the rural scenery
surrounding Tianjin. Then they head to Xingang Port at the mouth
of the river, with its beautiful beaches and the beacon of the

<HEADLINE> 2,000-year-old Mint Found in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have found
remains of a coin-making workshop dating back 2,000 years in an
historical city in central China.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the State Bureau of Cultural Relics say that such
an early government-run mint site is rarely found in the country.
</P>
<P>
The site is located at a construction area in downtown Nanyang
city in Henan Province, which used to be part of the
economically-developed Wancheng city of the Han Dynasty (206
BC-220 AD).
</P>
<P>
The workshop remains was a large area of red-baked earth, above
man-processed hard black clay, near which five bronze coin-making
molds and tools made of antler have been found.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the hexagonal mold, for making Wuzhu coins in
the middle and the late Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD), is
rarely seen in the country.
</P>
<P>
Clay coin-making molds have been found in the city previously.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that all the finds proved that the southwestern
part of the site of Wancheng city of Han was a center for
coin-making.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asia Intensifies Intra-Regional Investment (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Intra-Asian foreign direct
investment (FDI) has been intensified in the past decade thanks to
more open economic policies and enhanced economic integration in
Asia, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in an annual report
released today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Asian Development Outlook for 1996-1997, FDI
inflows in East Asia went up to an estimated 26 billion US dollars
in 1993, a dramatic increase from the annual average of less than
4 billion US dollars between 1982 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
East Asia accounted for more than 26 percent of the world's FDI
inflows by 1993, almost triple its average share of nine percent
between 1982 and 1986, said the Outlook.
</P>
<P>
It noted that more than 50 percent of the total value of the
stock of foreign direct capital in East and Southeast Asia
originated from within Asia.
</P>
<P>
The major sources are the newly industrializing economies
(NIEs), including Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as
well as Japan, said the Outlook.
</P>
<P>
It added that the main destinations of the NIE and Japanese FDI
into Asia have been the member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), mainly Indonesia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Outlook cited several reasons for the growth of the
intra-Asian FDI.
</P>
<P>
One important factor is that the growth of the real output of
Asian economies has made them more attractive locations for
investors, including those from other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the rapid relaxation of controls on inward FDI has
also contributed to the growing intra-Asian FDI.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that there has been a movement toward the
liberalization of capital flows in virtually every economy in the
world.
</P>
<P>
They indicated that the developing members of the ADB have
generally been ahead of the developing countries in other regions
in recognizing the possibilities of new production and exports
associated with the FDI.
</P>
<P>
Most Asian economies have attracted foreign investments through
financial incentives and/or export processing zones.
</P>
<P>
According to the Outlook, multi-national corporations have been
a major force in East and Southeast Asia in the development of
exports, especially of manufactures.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the share of foreign
affiliates in exports was as high as 24 percent in Hong Kong and
17 percent in Taiwan in the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, most of the FDI has been directed toward activities
that are export-oriented and whose outputs are sent mainly to
third-country markets, said the Outlook.

<HEADLINE> HK Launches Campaign Against Child Sexual Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong government and
non-governmental organizations jointly launched the first stage of
an Against Child Sexual Abuse Awareness Campaign today.
</P>
<P>
The publicity campaign will focus on educating young children
in the need of self-protection against sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the campaign strategy,
Assistant Director of Information Services Harold Yau said: "We
intend to conduct this campaign in three stages. The first is
aimed directly at children under the age of 12 -- the prime risk
group -- as well as their parents and minders. The aim is to help
children protect themselves."
</P>
<P>
Yau added that the second and third stages of the campaign
would be targeted more on parents and minders, advising them how
to identify and handle child sexual abuse cases.
</P>
<P>
The number of active child sexual abuse cases in Hong Kong rose
from 61 in 1993 to 77 in 1994 and 116 in 1995. The percentage of
child sexual abuse cases as compared to the total number of child
abuse cases also rose from 14.7 percent in 1993 to 17.1 percent in
1994 and 20.1 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Director of Social Welfare Patricia Chu said it is
encouraging that child victims and family members have become more
ready to bring the problem to light and to seek help when child
sexual abuse occurs.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asia to Continue Strong Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite the moderate growth of
global economy, the Asian and Pacific region will continue its
strong economic growth in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Asia remained the fastest-growing region in the world.
Developing Asia achieved an overall real gross domestic product
(GDP) growth of 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to "the Asian Development Outlook" released by the
Asian Development Bank today, the developing economies of the
Asian and Pacific region will grow at 7.1 percent in 1996 and 7.3
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The outlook indicated that China remains the fastest-growing
economy in the world with output growing at 10.2 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, growth in 1995 was significantly lower than the rates
of growth registered during the previous two years, mainly as a
result of deliberate contractionary macroeconomic policies aimed
at moderating the growth rate to sustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for China remains optimistic, as the economy is
projected to grow annually at about 9 percent over the next two
years, while inflation should decline further to 12 percent on
average.
</P>
<P>
The outlook notes that all the newly industrializing economies
(nies) except Hong Kong are expected to grow at between 6 percent
and 8 percent in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth of Hong Kong will remain at 5.1 percent and
4.6 percent respectively in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The outlook said that the economic prospects for the
fast-growing market economies of Southeast Asia remains bright.
</P>
<P>
Growth is likely to be maintained at over 7 percent per annum,
led by exports and high rates of investment. Inflation should
remain at single-digit levels.
</P>
<P>
The economy of the Philippines is in a different situation
compared to those of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. However,
the momentum of growth is already beginning to build up.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country's GDP grew by 4.8 percent, and is
projected to grow further at around 6 percent during the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Viet Nam constitute a distinct
subgroup within Southeast Asia in the sense that all these
economies are in the process of transition from centrally planned
systems to market economies.
</P>
<P>
They are already achieving high rates of economic growth. In
1995, all these countries grew by more than 7 percent and Viet
Nam, by as much as 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for South Asia is clearly less buoyant than it is
for Southeast Asia and its GDP growth was in the range of 4-6
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the effect of several years of structural adjustment
is beginning to have some positive effects.
</P>
<P>
After the initial stabilization, growth has resumed in these
economies and they are likely to grow at around 5-6 percent over
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
With further liberalized economies and enhanced economic
cooperation in the region, experts indicated that Asia will
continue to maintain its rapid economic growth for the next two or
three decades.

MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China is the developing world's
largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the
second largest in the world after the United States, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) said in an annual report released today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Asian Development Outlook for 1996-1997, China
registered a phenomenal increase in annual FDI inflows from 3.8
billion US dollars in 1982-85 to 27.9 billion US dollars between
1990 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, China has become the largest FDI recipient in Asia
or in the developing countries, accounting for nearly one half of
the total inflows into Asia in 1992 and 1993, said the ADB
Outlook.
</P>

According to the latest available statistics for 1993,
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand were the other major

<HEADLINE> Regional Cooperation Booming in Asia, Says ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Regional economic cooperation in
Asia has resulted in increased intra-Asian trade, enhanced foreign
direct investment and greater movement of labor within Asia, the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in a report released today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Asian Development Outlook for 1996-1997,
economic cooperation in Asia is centered firmly in the context of
a broader policy of openness to the rest of world.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation in Asia is multi-dimensional and has
extended beyond trade relations to cover common infrastructure
interests, joint development of resources and environmental
issues, said the Outlook.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the increase of the intra-Asian trade is
contributed by the higher growth among the trading countries
themselves and the unilateral reduction in trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
Trade liberalization has also worked in combination with
cooperation on trade and investment facilitation and reductions in
transport costs to increase the proportion of total trade carried
out within the region.
</P>
<P>
The ADB Outlook said there has been a rapid increase in foreign
direct investment (FDI) flows in Asia and the pattern of the FDI
has been changing.
</P>
<P>
Asia's newly industrializing economies have emerged as new
investors in other Asian countries due to the liberalization of
the FDI, trade in goods and services in Asia and the investment
opportunities created by high growth rates of Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
The Outlook pointed out that Asian labor migration is now
chiefly intra-Asian, although Asia as a whole is still a net
emigration area.
</P>
<P>
These changes reflect changes in relative per capita incomes,
unemployment rates and other features of labor markets in the
region, said the Outlook.

NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- India's Election Commission has
rejected the demand of the central and state governments to allow
export of cotton on the eve of the 11th Lok Sabha (lower house) as
well as six state assembly elections to be started simultaneously

Election Commissioner M.S. Gill said that the move would

</P>
<P>
Various state governments including Gujarat and Maharashstra
had requested the central government to allow export of cotton to
enable an increase in prices in domestic market to benefit the
cotton growers, who were getting low returns this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Urges Closer Cooperation in ASEAN Textile Industry (by Xiong Ping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is sending
out signals to other Southeast Asian countries, urging the textile
and garment industries in the region to cooperate more closely to
strengthen their competitiveness in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has stressed that the industries in the region should
stop viewing each other as rivals and strengthen their
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is proposing to establish joint ventures under the
industrial cooperation framework with the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) as measures to band the textile and garment
industries tighter in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Thai textile and garment industries could offer management
technology and benefit from lower labor costs and raw materials in
other ASEAN member countries, said Krirk-krai Jirapaet,
director-general of the Business Economics Department under the
Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thai spinners and bleach factories could link up with
Indonesians who could supply cheap petrochemicals, or with
Malaysians who could acquire cheaper raw materials owing to the
country's lower import tariffs, Krirk-krai said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, tariffs on imports of synthetic fiber, cotton yarn,
synthetic yarn and other textiles in Malaysia, Indonesia and the
Philippines are at 3.75-20 percent, lower than 10-40 percent in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Labor costs in other ASEAN members are also lower than in
Thailand. The hourly pay is 39 US cents in Vietnam, 48 cents in
Indonesia, 1.18 dollars in Malaysia and 1.41 dollars in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN economic ministers are scheduled to meet in March next
year to sign a new ASEAN industrial cooperation scheme, which will
allow joint ventures to benefit from tariffs of 0-5 percent for
their products traded within the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
However, some businessmen from the Thai textile industry said
that the Thai textile and garment industries have not been fully
prepared for the process, noting cooperation with other countries
is the second step.
</P>
<P>
The first step should be trying to strengthen the local
industries themselves, they stressed.
</P>
<P>
They also worried that they may face difficulties in the
process owing to different management styles in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Krirk indicated that trade would be liberalized further by 2005
under World Trade Organization agreements, giving Thais some time
to adjust, but Thais should not wait until the final year,
Krirk-krai stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called for the country's textile and garment industries to
relocate their businesses in other countries with cheaper labor,
while urging the government and the private sector to jointly
prepare an action plan to ensure the industries' survival.

<HEADLINE> Australia Unwavering On Commitment To Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said today that the new government would keep
closer engagement with Asia as the country's "highest foreign
policy priority."
</P>
<P>
But he also voiced concern that increasing prosperity of major
regional economies would pose potential threat to regional
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to foreign correspondents in Sydney that outlined
the coalition government's foreign policy priorities, Downer said
that Australia's full commitment to Asia and the Asia-Pacific
region remained unchanged despite the change of government.
</P>
<P>
"This government will be building on, not tearing down, the
previous government's work," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new government would continue to contribute
actively to the development of regional economic structures, such
as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the
(ARF).
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government is committed to ensuring that APEC
develops as a non-discriminatory trading organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining Australia's role in multi-national groups
such as APEC and ARF, the coalition government would attach more
importance to strengthening bilateral relations with regional
powers, including Indonesia, other Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) members, Japan, China, the Republic of Korea and
India.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's relationship with China will remain a central
feature of Australian foreign policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As China's economy modernizes and expands, its influence as a
regional and global power will become increasingly apparent," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for all regional countries that as China
assumes its place as a major power, it is able to reassure other
members of the region that it is committed to working with them in
the region's broad interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government also attached great importance to
development of security cooperation both at multi-lateral and
bilateral levels with other nations in the region, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia's security would be largely dictated by
the interaction of relations between the United States, China,
Japan, Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
He said that though the Australian government did not see any
direct security threat to the country, there was some risk of a
"spillover" of conflicts originating in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Importantly, the armed forces of the region are becoming
increasingly capable as the growing wealth of regional economies
allows the purchase of more powerful weaponry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia would use APEC and ARF as regional security
structures.
</P>
<P>
"A custom of cooperative engagement lies at the heart of the
development of ARF, which is presently providing the principal
avenue for security dialogue in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
As part of its move to expand bilateral relations with Asian
countries, Australia will form security links with Japan and the
Republic of Korea and stick to the newly signed security treaty
with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that the coalition government's policy of "Asia
First" does not mean "Asia Only" or all "Asia" no "Pacific."
Australia was not to give priority to the region at the expense of
interests elsewhere, such as North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that Asian countries such as Thailand wanted to
cooperate with Australia in maintaining world peace, because
Australia was a regional nation with close relations with Europe
and the US.
</P>
<P>
"Today, on the verge of my first formal trip as Foreign
Minister to three countries of the region, namely, Indonesia,
Singapore and Thailand, I want to give an unequivocal message to
the region: closer engagement with Asia is the Australian
government's highest foreign policy priority," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer's Southeast Asian trip next week follows the visit of
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir to Australia last month. So far
the coalition government under Prime Minster John Howard has
received positive response from its Asian neighbors, especially
the ASEAN members. Howard has been invited to visit Indonesia and
Malaysia. He is expected to visit one of the Southeast Asian
nations on his first overseas trip since taking office.

<HEADLINE> Indian EC Rejects Demand for Cotton Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- India's Election Commission has
rejected the demand of the central and state governments to allow
export of cotton on the eve of the 11th Lok Sabha (lower house) as
well as six state assembly elections to start simultaneously from
April 27.
</P>
<P>
Election Commissioner M.S. Gill said that the move would
influence voters in favor of the ruling party. The Election
Commission felt that there was no need to concede to the demand
which was being made in view of the near glut situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Various state governments including Gujarat and Maharashstra
had requested the central government to allow export of cotton to
enable an increase in prices on the domestic market to benefit the
cotton growers, who were getting low returns this year.
</P>
<P>
Gill, who was earlier agriculture secretary, said that the
Election Commission had advised the government to intervene in the
market by activating their procurement agencies.

<HEADLINE> Australia Unwavering On Commitment To Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said today that the new government would keep
closer engagement with Asia as the country's "highest foreign
policy priority."
</P>
<P>
But he also voiced concern that increasing prosperity of major
regional economies would pose potential threat to regional
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to foreign correspondents in Sydney that outlined
the coalition government's foreign policy priorities, Downer said
that Australia's full commitment to Asia and the Asia-Pacific
region remained unchanged despite the change of government.
</P>
<P>
"This government will be building on, not tearing down, the
previous government's work," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new government would continue to contribute
actively to the development of regional economic structures, such
as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the
(ARF).
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government is committed to ensuring that APEC
develops as a non-discriminatory trading organization," he said.

<HEADLINE> Students Fights Pollution with Pen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A team of middle school students
in Xuzhou city, east China's Jiangsu Province, succeeded in urging
local governments to protect environment, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
These young students started to report pollution cases to local
government 10 years ago. They recruited more than 40 fellow
students from the middle schools attached to the Xuzhou Coal
Mining Bureau to be better informed of conditions of pollution.
</P>
<P>
In January 1986 dozens of students spent one week observing the
Kuihe River, which flows across Xuzhou city. Then local
environmental bureau received a painted picture describing how
badly the river had been polluted.
</P>
<P>
So far local governments have invested over 10 million yuan
(about 1.2 million U.S. dollars) in a project to separate
industrial waste water from the water discharged into the Kuihe
River.
</P>
<P>
Some 124 enterprises discharging waster water into the river
have installed waste water treatment facilities. And the
construction of a sewage treatment plant started at the end of
1994.
</P>
<P>
Last July 30 students from the group investigated the water
pollution situation in central China's Henan province, east
China's Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, which are all crossed by the
seriously polluted Huaihe River.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after they interviewed residents and concerned
government departments in these areas, they represented a report
to the State Council and the local governments.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Song Jian and other senior officials met with
these young students and praised them as protectors of the
environment and encouraged them to pursue their cause. enditem

KATHMANDU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main ruling party

<P>
Last Sunday, NC President Krishna Prasad Bhattarai announced

According to sources close to the party leadership, the

Local conventions electing representatives for the national
convention came to a halt last month following a no-confidence

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
will conduct a comprehensive survey of all its 40 nature reserves
that is under government protection now, within the next five
years, today's "China Daily" reported here.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Province is known as China's "kingdom of plants and
animals", with 15,000 species of plant, or half of the country's
total, 250 kinds of animals and 760 species of birds.
</P>
<P>
In preliminary surveys of five natural protection zones of the
province last year, scientists found forests of some rare species,
such as the dipterocarpaceae family of plants, and more than 40
new species of plants.
</P>
<P>
At the Nangunhe State Natural Reserve, researchers have even
discovered traces of the existence of xiongli, or Arctictis
binturong in Latin, which is an endangered animal under priority
state protection.
</P>
<P>
According to the head of the provincial forestry department,
Wang Weimin, the results of last year's surveys indicated that
there are still many things to do to get an overall view of
Yunnan's plant and animal resources.
</P>
<P>
The country has 354 species of plants on its key protection
list, and 151 of them are found in Yunan. Of its animals and
birds, 160 species represent wildlife under priority state
protection.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has 100 nature reserves of various kinds
at the State, provincial, prefectural and county levels, which
cover an area of 1.95 million ha, or 5.8 percent of the province's
total territory.
</P>
<P>
Leading managers of the nature reserves in the province will
gather at the end of this year to discuss better ways to deal with
the province's increasing contradictions and conflicts between
natural protection and economic development, especially of the
tourism sector, Wand said.

<HEADLINE> Joint Car-Making Venture Gets French Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Dongfeng Citroen Automobile
Co, a Sino-French joint venture expected to grow into a major
sedan manufacturer in China, will be able to produce 150,000 ZX
Fukang cars annually as investment from both countries comes on
line this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by today's China Daily, the final batch
of investment from France in the form of an export credit was
signed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The venture was established in 1992, but funding began late for
various reasons. Nevertheless, officials with the Ministry of
Machine-Building Industry said it will achieve its operating
capacity on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Of the funds agreed to by China and its French partners,
Societe Generale bank and the Banque Nationale de Paris, 1.3
billion French francs (257 million US dollars) will be used for
construction of the joint venture while one billion (198 million
US dollars) will go toward corporate operations.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that 80 percent of the loans will come to
the Bank of China (BOC) and the other 20 percent from Banque
Nationale de Paris. BOC is to grant the credit to Dongfeng Citreon.
</P>
<P>
In this joint venture, China's Dongfeng Motor has 70 percent
interest, PSA Peugeot Citreon has 25 percent, Societe Generale 4
percent and Banque Nationale de Paris one percent.
</P>
<P>
By last year, 5.1 billion yuan (about 612 million US dollars)
had been put in the venture. An additional 3.9 billion yuan will
go into the venture this year, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Output at the joint venture will be raised to 300,000 vehicles
per year, with the introduction of a second Citroen model
alongside the ZX Fukang.
</P>
<P>
Last year about 4,000 ZX Fukang cars were assembled. The
hatch-back 1.36-liter ZX Fukang, based on the Citroen ZX, were
mainly bought by individuals, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Sell Houses by Determining Incomes of Occupants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
sell millions of houses by determining the incomes of occupants,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
In a drive to reform the country's housing system, the
government will sell apartments at market prices, to middle- and
low-income families at cost, and to poorer households at
preferential prices, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Apartments built under the "Comfortable Housing" project, and
other houses built by the localities to ease the housing shortage
of middle- or low-income families, should be sold to urban
residents at cost value, the newspaper quoted a housing official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xuebin, office director of the Housing System Reform
Leading Group under the State Council, said that the government
wants this new way of dealing with housing to be introduced across
the country by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But the problem is how to determine the different income
levels, Chen said, noting that it is impossible to set up a
national standard, since the economic-development paces, income of
urban residents and cost of housing differ in different parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Also, ways to determine income levels should change annually
according to the changing housing prices and actual income, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
No city has drawn up a plan for the determination of family
income so far this year, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
But Chen said a great majority of China's urban residents would
be listed as middle- or low-income families.

<HEADLINE> China Aims at Exporting 30 Million Tons of Coal This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's coal exports promise
bright prospect this year though some unfavorable elements at home
and abroad exist, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The country aims at exporting 30 million tons of coal this
year, Wang Xianzheng, vice-minister of coal industry, told a
national conference on coal exports yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The China National Coal Industry Import and Export Corp
(CNCIEC), the country's dominant coal trader, aims to export 27
million tons of coal this year and earn 945 million US dollars in
foreign exchange, representing a 20 percent and 40 percent
increase respectively compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
He said CNCIEC should further expand its Asian markets for coal
exports while consolidating markets in Europe by improving coal
quality and services and by developing new varieties needed by
consumers, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, CNCIEC coal exports
increased by more than 300,000 tons compared to the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Guo Kemu, vice-president of CNCIEC, told the conference that
some international organizations believe the global economy will
maintain growth in 1996 and, at the same time, the the world's
trade is expected to increase by 7 percent, which will promote the
international coal trade.
</P>
<P>
The world's needs in coal this year will continue to increase,
especially in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Guo said China's rapid development of the coal
industry has created a favorable environment for the company's
coal exports.
</P>
<P>
The country's coal output is expected to reach 1.29 billion
tons in 1996 from 1.28 billion tons last year.
</P>
<P>
However, such unfavorable factors as dropping prices in the
international market, domestic transport bottlenecks and increased
production costs amid decreased export-tax refund rates will
somewhat dampen CNCIEC's exports of coal this year, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company exported a record 24.75 million tons of
coal mainly to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong
Kong. Meanwhile, it imported 720,000 tons of coal, the newspaper
said.

BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is hoping for the

double taxation before the US presidential elections in November,
a senior Thai official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and the US have been negotiating such an agreement on

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Canada to Jointly Mine Copper in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Canada will jointly
develop, mine and process copper resources in Myanmar, the
official New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under a joint venture agreement signed here Wednesday, the
state-run Myanmar Mining Enterprise and Ivanhoe Myanmar Holdings
LTD of Canada will carry out the work within the Monywa copper
complex in northern Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister for Mines Lt. Gen. Kyaw Min said operations of
the joint venture company would include mining and processing
copper ore, producing cathode copper and marketing the product in
Myanmar and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the Myanmar Mining Enterprise launched a copper
project at Sabetaung and Kyisintaung with credit assistance from
the Invest Import Company of Yugoslavia, which resulted in a
flotation complex with a capacity to produce 60,000 tons of copper
concentrate per year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been extending invitations to foreign companies to
conduct mineral prospecting and exploration in the country and
competitive bidding entered the second round last October.
</P>
<P>
The first round involved 11 blocks with an area of 1,400 square
kilometers each.
</P>
<P>
Companies from Canada, Singapore, Australia and the US are
among those involved in gold and copper exploration in Myanmar
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
A Thai company -- Nouveau Marketing Co. LTD -- entered into a
joint venture agreement with Myanmar for extraction of gemstone in
February this year.

Buenos Aires, April 10 (Xinhua)-- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso told Argentine legislators Tuesday that Brazil
supports Argentina in its claims on the British-ruled Malvinas
Islands (Falkland Islands), South Georgia and South Sandwich
Islands, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
"Argentina will always have our support in its fight to have
its rights over the Falklands (Malvinas), South Georgia and South
Sandwich Islands," Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
Argentina would have to "find the means (of defending) what is
rightfully hers," said Cardoso, who arrived here Sunday for a
three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
The Malvinas Islands, or the Falkland Islands, lie in the
southern Atlantic, about 480 kilometers away from the mainland
part of South America.
</P>
<P>
Argentina has maintained its claims on sovereignty of the
islands for 163 years. Argentina and Britain fought a war in 1982
over the sovereignty of the islands.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain resumed diplomatic relations in 1990.
The two nations have reached an agreement on oil exploration in
the disputed region.

Fishing rights and Argentina's continuing sovereignty claim are

foreign debt within the next week, Planning Minister Teodoro

inflation, which hit 56 percent in 1995 and 24 percent in the
first quarter of 1996, increasing government revenues and
providing a social cushion for the poorest Venezuelans.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Baht Depreciates Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The surging US dollar has
weakened the Thai currency by 1.3 percent since the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the Thai baht to the US dollar reached
25.30 Wednesday, which means that the Thai currency had
depreciated by 0.11 baht from the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The US dollar had been surging since January and reached a
two-year high of 108.51 against the Japanese yen Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the appreciation of the dollar against the
baht is supposed to benefit Thai exports.
</P>
<P>
However, the weaker baht is not expected to discourage capital
inflows into Thailand because the baht/dollar interest rate
difference is still four percentage points, a figure high enough
to cover the 1.3-percent decline in the baht's value against the
dollar.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Belarus may re-deploy its troops
to its areas bordering Poland if that country joins the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Defense Minister Anatoly
Makytsev said today.
</P>
<P>
Belarus just signed an agreement on April 2 with Russia
establishing an alliance called the Community of Sovereign
Republics to enhance their military and security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Interfax News Agency, Makytsev said
that the re-deployment will be the last and extreme resort, which
will be used only when all political means are exhausted in
stalling the attempts to break the existing military and political
balance in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Belarus Foreign Ministry announced that Belarus
might ask Russia to stop withdrawing its strategic nuclear
missiles from its territory if the Czech Republic and Hungary join
NATO and allow the organization to deploy tactical nuclear
missiles on their soils.

UNITED NATIONS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has written to leaders of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea(DPRK), offering his good offices to
ease tensions on the Korean peninsula, a U.N. spokeswoman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
At a noon news briefing, Sylvana Foa said that the U.N. chief
had sent two letters, one to DPRK leader Kim Jong Il and the other
to Foreign Minister Kim Yong Nam.
</P>
<P>
"In these letters, he once again expresses his preoccupation at
the deterioration of the situation on the Korean peninsula and
once again offers his good offices to help mediate the situation,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Juan Somavia of Chile, president of the
U.N. Security Council for April, said that the council expected to
discuss the issue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK issued a statement on April 4, accusing South Korea of
violating the 1953 armistice agreement by deploying heavy weapons
and military personnel in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) dividing
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK would therefore no longer observe the armistice
agreement concerning the DMZ, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported
that South Korean troops would be given orders to shoot any DPRK
troops setting foot in the southern half of the DMZ.

SHENZHEN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- This south China city adjacent

An official with the Shenzhen Trade Development Board revealed

<HEADLINE> Cape Town Olympic Games Bid Deputy Chairman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Cape Town city councillor
Clive Keegan said on Wednesday that he was resigning as the deputy
chairman of the city's 2004 Olympics Bid Company because he had no
confidence in chief executive Chris Ball.
</P>
<P>
But Keegan, whose letter of resignation was faxed anonymously
to selected newspapers, said he would remain on the board as a
director.
</P>
<P>
He complained of Ball's "insulting behaviour" and accused the
bid team of being arrogant, amateurish and inept.
</P>
<P>
But Ball wrily told a news conference: "I learn from people
around the world that this is all part of the bidding process."
</P>
<P>
Cape Town is thought to be a front-runner, with Athens and
Rome, in the race to host the 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
As a show of confidence in Ball, other members of the bid
company's board sat with him at the news conference to answer
allegations Keegan made in his resignation letter.
</P>
<P>
Keegan, fighting local government elections in May as an
independent, complained Ball spent too much time trying to gain
international support for the bid rather than in wooing local
people.
</P>
<P>
He also said he (Keegan) had been snubbed and that the bid
company had no policies on sports development or the environment.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town's other rivals in the bid are Buenos Aires, Istanbul,
Lille, Rio de Janeiro, San Juan in Puerto Rico, Seville, Stockholm
and St Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
Detailed plans must be handed to the IOC by August. Four or
five cities will get on to a shortlist before the final choice is
announced in Switzerland on September 5 next year.

<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- World 110 meters hurdles
record-holder Colin Jackson will meet officials of the British
Athletic Federation this weekend to discuss his boycott of
meetings organised by the BAF this summer.
</P>
<P>
But Jackson is still refusing to see BAF executive chairman
Peter Radford, who sparked his boycott by reprimanding him for
pulling out of the AAA Championships last season, then running in
Italy the following day.
</P>
<P>
Jackson said at the time: "I will never compete in another BAF
meeting while Radford is in his present job."
</P>
<P>
Jackson conceded on Wednesday he was under pressure from his
family to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
"My mum and my nan are screaming at me to run," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The BAF and the public would like to see me competing, so
there is a lot to think about. Money is not the issue. It is
about whether I feel good in myself," he added.
</P>
<P>
"My training has been going well and I want to run all over
the place. I have calmed down in myself but what happened last
year still sticks in the mind."
</P>
<P>
He said he would meet the BAF promotions people "who know how
strongly I feel on the issue. If they can understand the problems
I had, that is the key thing. But I can't see myself talking to
Peter Radford - no way.
</P>
<P>
"When you are ill and injured and someone comes into the
Federation and tries to walk all over you, all the frustrations
come to a head."
</P>
<P>
At present, Jackson's only domestic meetings will be the Welsh
Games in Cardiff and the AAA Championships, which double as the
Olympic trials, in Birmingham in June.

<HEADLINE> Different Accounts in Tyson Sex Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- An accusation that Mike Tyson
sexually assaulted a woman at a Chicago nightclub was declared
unlikely by a manager at the club and denounced as not credible by
his adviser, but Chicago police did not make any comments on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Accounts vary as to what happened early Monday morning at the
Clique, a chic dancing club popular among athletes, but police
said they were investigating a 25-year-old woman's allegation that
Tyson, the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, had
assaulted her.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who was released on four years parole just over a year
ago after serving a three-year prison term for a 1992 rape
conviction, was not commenting on the case from his Southington,
Ohio, mansion near Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
But a lawyer for the woman, who is co-owner of a beauty salon
and from Gary, Indiana, said Tyson instigated the encounter at the
club after spotting her on the dance floor and attacked and
injured the woman in a private room.
</P>
<P>
"She was taken into his company by club employees instructed by
the boxer", the Chicago Sun-Times quoted attorney Jerry Peteet as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The woman was treated at a local hospital and called police,
then came to see him, Peteet said.
</P>
<P>
"She was visibly shaken, fearful and in some degree of
discomfort from the injuries she sustained," Peteet told the
newspaper, without being specific about her injuries. "She was
angry, emotional, disturbed and shocked."
</P>
<P>
But the nightclub's assistant manager, Moody Andrews, said the
club kept its own security guards around Tyson at all times and
that he never went to a private area. Moody told CBS-Radio that
the woman asked to meet Tyson, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who converted to the Moslem faith during his stay in an
Indiana prison, drank nothing but water, Moody told the
Sun-Times.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's advisor while in prison, Indianapolis schoolteacher
Muhammad Siddeeq, said he attended a prayer service in Chicago
with Tyson on Sunday, and dismissed the woman's claims.
</P>
<P>
"I give no credence to this report," Siddeeq told the
Sun-Times. "Every time Mike turns or moves there's people out
there who want to do their thing."
</P>
<P>
WGN television in Chicago reported that Tyson was in the
company of former champion Oliver McCall Sunday evening. In an
unrelated incident, McCall was arrested Tuesday night in
Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and charged with possession of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, 29, has fought three times since his release from
prison in March, 1995, and won the World Boxing Council
heavyweight title on March 16 when he stopped Briton Frank Bruno
in the third round.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was convicted in 1992 of raping Desiree Washington, a
contestant in the Miss Black America beauty pageant the previous
year in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was the undisputed world heavyweight champion from
August 1, 1987 to February 11, 1990, when he was knocked out by
James "Buster" Douglas in one of the biggest upsets in boxing
history.

<HEADLINE> Italian League Officials Meet to Avoid New Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian soccer league officials
held talks on Wednesday in hopes to find way to avoid a second
strike by serie A players scheduled for April 20 and it has
reportedly made some progress.
</P>
<P>
All sides involved, including players, trainers, officials
from the soccer league, federation and the Italian Olympic
Committee (CONI), were due to meet again on Friday to discuss the
strike.
</P>
<P>
Italian players held an unprecedented strike on March 16 and 17
over a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
They included admitting the leaders of the players' and
coaches' unions to the sport's ruling body as well as demanding a
guarantee fund that ensures players receive their salaries even if
their club goes bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
The unions also want to maintain limits on players from
outside the European Union following the European Court's recent
Bosman ruling and are seeking the immediate abolition of transfer
fees at the end of the current season.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A seven-year-old girl took off
today in a single-engine plane from Half Moon Bay, California, for
a coast to coast flight across the United States.
</P>
<P>
Jessica Dubroff, with her flying instructor at her side and her
farther in the back seat, took off at 7 a.m. in a Cessna, hoping
to make history as the youngest pilot to fly a round-trip across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
"I fly for joy," said Dubroff, the 4-foot-2 pilot whose plane
has special aluminum extensions attached to the rudder pedals so
she can reach the controls. "I just enjoy being up in the air,
floating."
</P>
<P>
During her 7,000-mile journey, Dubroff will stop every four
hours to refuel and each night to rest. She has invited President
Clinton for a ride once she gets to Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
"To visit you at the White House would be wonderful and clearly
to pilot an airplane that you would be in would bring me an even
greater joy," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
Dubroff, taught by her mother, started taking flying lessons
five months ago from Half Moon Bay instructor Joe Reid, whose
Cessna four-seater is being used for the transcontinental flight.
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to see the Statue of Liberty," Dubroff said.
After stopping on the East Coast, she will detour to Florida to
visit her paternal grandfather.
</P>
<P>
An 8-year-old currently holds the record for being the youngest
pilot to complete a round-trip, coast-to-coast flight across the
United States.

PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen and his French counterpart Herve De Charette agreed here
today that France and China should cooperate more closely in major

During their talks here this evening, the fourth meeting since

economic field, but also conduct discussions on the issues of
major international and regional issues as well as bilateral
relations, and have closer cooperations in international affairs.

De Charette said that Chinese premier's current visit to France
is a milestone in French-Chinese relations, which involves

<P>
NEW YORK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A last hour sell-off sent the
Dow Jones industrial average tumbling Wednesday, extending losses
to more than 200 points, or almost 3.6 percent, over four straight
sessions.
</P>
<P>
The major indicator of blue chips on the New York Stock
Exchange fell 74.43 points to close at 5,485.98, with most of the
losses in the final hour.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues led advancers by nearly 2 to 1. Volume was
moderately heavy at 473.79 million shares, above Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes also finished lower, but the Nasdaq
composite put up a good fight until just before the close.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 4.20 to 340.93. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.69 to 633.50.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.87 to 1,105,28. The American
Stock Exchange's market value index fell 2.75 to 569.96.
</P>
<P>
The final sell-off was heightened by computer-driven sell
programs, but inflation fears were the fundamental reason behind
the market rout.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond declined with the bond's yielding,
which moves in the opposite direction of price, rose to 6.94
percent from 6.83 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts attributed the market's losses to the fear of
investors for higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, stocks followed bonds, especially in sectors like
banking, financial and utilities stocks, which usually respond
first to changes in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks weathered a semiconductor industry report
issued after the close of trading Tuesday that signaled weaker
demand for computer chips.

WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown, who died in plane crash in Croatia last week, was laid to
rest here today at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, at the funeral service at the
Washington National Cathedral, called Brown "the incredible life
force" without whom he wouldn't be elected the president in the
1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
Brown, 54, was on a trade mission to the former Yugoslavia when
his military passenger jet crashed into a mountain ridge in poor
weather in Croatia. The crash also killed 32 other Americans and
two other people aboard.
</P>
<P>
Brown, widely regarded as one of America's most adroit black
political strategists, was chairman of the Democratic National
Committee and a key adviser to Clinton's presidential campaign in
1992.
</P>
<P>
After the service, Brown was buried at Arlington National
Cemetery with full military honors. The funeral drew thousands of
mourners.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Mixed As Rally Slowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The rise of the U.S. dollar
against major currencies was slowed by profit taking Wednesday, a
day after the U.S. currency hit a 14-month high against the mark
and a 26-month high against the yen.
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended to be worth 108.40 yen, up from 108.30 late
Tuesday. The dollar also was trading at 1.4973 marks, down from
1.4982 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was also influenced by late day selloffs in the U.S.
stock and bond markets, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders continued to regard last Friday's strong
employment report as a signal that interest rates might remain the
same or rise, making the dollar attractive to global investors.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Europe's lagging economy, confirmed Wednesday
by a small dip in German unemployment rates, made traders certain
that some European rates will keep heading south.
</P>
<P>
That kept the dollar from ending significantly higher against
the mark and yen, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. employment report first jolted the markets on March 8
when the Labor Department reported a surprisingly large jump in
jobs in February. Last Friday, the department confirmed the upward
trend, announcing that more jobs were created in March.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The British Treasury's panel of
independent economic advisers Tuesday warned that the next move in
UK interest rates might have to be up and that there was little
scope for big tax cuts in this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
According to reports here today, five of the "six wise men"
argued in their latest report on the state of the economy that the
current slowdown in the economy would be short-lived and activity
would rebound in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Although they welcomed the three cuts in interest rates, the
Wise Men warned, "Most of us do not think that the next move in
interest rates should necessarily be downwards."
</P>
<P>
They added, "some of us feel that there is already or could
soon be a good case for raising interest rates if the government
is serious about achieving its inflation objective."
</P>
<P>
Most of the six argued that the Chancellor was unlikely to have
scope for a big giveaway in this year's pre-election Budget.

attacks, which killed 58 people in Israeli cities. He asked the
U.N. chief to demand Israel reopen the border and bring the issue
to the Security Council and the General Assembly.
</P>

The closure has prevented 60,000 Palestinians from working in

<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The world-wide ban on British beef
and beef products remains in force after the European Union (EU)
veterinary committee's special meeting in Brussels, a British
government spokesman confirmed.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the EU veterinary experts remained
undecided on whether it was safe to take gelatine, a glutinous
material obtained from animal tissues, off the list of Banned
substances, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It is still felt that the ban has not been in force long
enough to reassure consumers," he said. "But the talks were
certainly helpful and there is definitely a move towards
scientific evidence."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British Meat and Livestock Commission has
accused the EU of harboring political motives for insisting on a
world-wide ban on the sale of British beef.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Commission Collin Maclean was reported
as saying, "the EU owes much to politics and very little to
science and it is high time that the EU stopped its scaremongering
and listened to the advice of the scientists."
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission imposed the total ban early last month after
wide-spread public fears that mad cow disease was linked to the
human disease CJD.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian group is working on
plans to stage the World Film Festival/Expo in Lagos between
November 15 and December 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
The President-General of Nigerian Film Industrialists
Association, Benjamin Idowu, told the News Agency of Nigeria here
today that the National Implementation Committee for the festival
would be launched later this month.
</P>
<P>
The plan to stage a film festival of the kind in Lagos has
been on for about ten years.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the committee would be to fashion out a
marketing strategy for African films during the festival.
</P>
<P>
Idowu, who is the coordinator of the festival, noted that
over the years, African film makers had been finding it difficult
to market their films internationally.
</P>
<P>
He said that the festival would be used as an avenue for not
only marketing African films but also exposing the rich African
culture, just like the Indians, Chinese and Europeans had done.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government signed
today a peace agreement with two southern rebel groups, paving the
way to an end the long-time fighting in the war-torn south.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed on behalf of the Sudanese Government
by Sudan's First Vice President General Zubair Mohamed Saleh, and
Riek Machar, leader of the South Sudan Independence Movement, and
Col. Karbino Kuangyin, leader of the Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir and other senior officials
were present at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for a peaceful and political settlement to
Sudan's problems, maintenance of the country's unity and
territorial integrity, and safeguarding Sudan's entity against
internal and external dangers and threats.
</P>
<P>
It underlines the necessity that the signatories spare no
effort to establish peace and justice in the country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for the commitment of all parties to
the freedom of religion and creed.
</P>
<P>
It affirms that social development shall be given top priority
in the country, and that the government should work out plans to
build confidence among citizens, and to eradicate poverty,
ignorance and illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
It spells out the necessity of a just distribution of authority
and resources in the best interest of all citizens, and that the
two parties shall work out the related details.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in the Sudan has been going on for 13 years, but
the Sudanese government has so far failed to reach peace agreement
with John Garang, leader of Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA),
the mainstream rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
The government announced a cease-fire with Machar's group in
March, paving the way to the agreement. Talks with the two factions
were mediated by Kenya and other neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Machar separated with the mainstream SPLA in 1991. Kuangyin
split with Garang in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The two groups have since involved in bitter fighting s with
Garang.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 1.3 million people have been killed
in the civil war and related famines.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Allows Serbs To Attend Donors Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb entity will be
allowed to attend the Donors Conference due to take place in
Brussels on April 12, Carl Bildt, the international community's
High Representative, announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the Serbs released three war
prisoners and submitted to the Hague-based criminal tribunal files
on 17 remaining persons in their custody suspected of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
"The Republika Srpska side has since yesterday afternoon also
been in full compliance with the terms set by my office concerning
the release of remaining prisoners under the Peace Agreement,"
Bildt said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached on March 30 in Banja Luka,
Bildt said, Bosnia will be represented at Brussels conference by a
delegation consisting of three prime ministers from the Bosnian
government, the federation and the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian peace agreement calls for release of all prisoners
of war within the first 45 days after it took effect, but the
deadline has to be postponed several times due to non-compliance
from the three warring factions. About 30 prisoners of war have
still been detained by the factions on charges of war crimes.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign gemstone dealers

minerals, sources from the Tanzanian Ministry of Energy and
Minerals said today.
</P>
<P>

firms, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new procedures announced by the ministry, no raw
gemstones would be exported, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
According to the new procedures, there will be three types
of licences to be issued to the gemstone dealers operating in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
They are master gemstone dealers licence, lapidary (cutting
and polishing) licence and gemstone dealers licence.
</P>

The sources said foreign firms and individual gemstone dealers
from outside Tanzania would only qulify for the lapidary licence
while the Tanzanian citizens could apply for any of the three

<HEADLINE> Peres: No Hezbollah Positions Are Immune to Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said tonight that his country is very serious in its efforts
to make peace with its neighbors, but not at the expense of
security for its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Talking about today's military operations in Lebanon at a news
conference in Tel Aviv, Peres angrily accused Hezbollah (Party of
God) of provocations, which led to Israel's punitive attacks on
Hezbollah targets including its headquarters in southern Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Peres warned that no Hezbollah positions would be safe from
Israeli strikes.
</P>
<P>
During Israeli air attacks, according to a report from Beirut,
five Lebanese were killed and some 15 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Recalling recent Hezbollah attacks against Israel, Peres said
that Hezbollah gained a simple impression that they had the
superiority and initiative in their hands, but that is not the
case. "If they have Katyushas, we have better missiles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peres said bitterly that while Israel has deep interests in
the continuation of the peace process and while Israel has to
take the risks and pay the prices for peace, it cannot sacrifice
the security of the land, of every part of the land and of the
citizens of this country.
</P>
<P>
"We prefer dialogue to confrontation. But if someone prefers
confrontation to dialogue, they we have the means to confront
him as well," Peres said.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Body to Be Neutral in Election Run-UP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI), Britain's biggest business organization, said
today that it will remain politically neutral in the run-up to the
next general election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the CBI's monthly council meeting,
Director-General Adair Turner said a manifesto will be published
in mid-July to set out the policies demanded by the business world
of this country in the election run-up.
</P>
<P>
Turner indicated that his confederation will not turn the
manifesto into a party endorsement, but individual members might
be more overtly political.
</P>
<P>
The next general election will be held in May 1997, but
propaganda seems to have informally started.
</P>
<P>
A dozen leading businessment have financed a 100,000 pound
(150,000 U.S. dollar) campaign effectively endorsing the Tory
government's economic policy and this has been considered that the
battle between the Conservative party and the Opposition Labor
over their relations with British business is reaching a new and
more aggressive phase.
</P>
<P>
These businessmen have distributed 50,000 copies of a booklet
among corporate peers and journalists, which quotes foreign
newspaper and overseas companies praising the UK economy.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Conservative party is not mentioned in the text
although the cover livery is in Tory blue and different shades of
the same color dominate the booklet's design.
</P>
<P>
The booklet is also accompanied by a letter from Prime Minister
John Major, who writes: "These snapshots of Britain from around
the globe build up a consistent picture of a strong, successful
modern economy which is forging ahead."
</P>
<P>
The initiative was organized by two senior advisers to the
Conservative party, Peter Gummer and Tim Bell, both of whom are in
the inner circle of Tory strategists planning the party's general
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
It is held that this initiative is bound to prompt a furious
response from Labor, which is likely to claim that this is an
indirect form of party political campaigning.
